      TO MY ABSENT HUSBAND</head>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Thou'rt gone!  Thou'rt gone! no more may I hear</l>
	<l>Love's lingering tones lowly breathed in my ear.</l>
	<l>My bower is desolate where lately there shone</l>
	<l>A bright beaming star - but now I'm alone.</l>
	<l>'Tis beautiful there, more brilliant the flowers</l>
	<l>Of autumn than those of the past summer hours,</l>
	<l>Sweet birds too are singing, but I hear not their lay</l>
	<l>My spirit is lonely for thou art away.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Each favorite haunt tells me, dearest of thee,</l>
	<l>On my heart is thine image where'er I may be;</l>
	<l>When I call to the echo no sound is so sweet</l>
	<l>As the name of all others I'd rather repeat;</l>
	<l>But thy country has called thee, in her hour of need,</l>
	<l>While the groans of her dying for victory plead,</l>
	<l>And I know that thy valor  in her service will shine</l>
	<l>Though thy strength may be feeble, her glory is thine!</l>
	<l>God shield thee in suffering, and keep thee from harm</l>
	<l>In peace or in battle, in sunlight or storm,</l>
	<l>And memory, sweet memory illumine thy heart</l>
	<l>With dreams of our past that ne'er may depart.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Thou'rt away!  Thou'rt away, where the cannon's loud roar</l>
	<l>Sends terror to thousands who'll hear it no more;</l>
	<l>There war wildly rages and dangers beset,</l>
	<l>Yet thy home and thy loved one thou'lt never forget.</l>
	<l>I gazed on thy form as it passed from my sight,</l>
	<l>Thine cager war charger exulting in might,</l>
	<l>And called in my anguish on the God of the free,</l>
	<l>Believing He'd watch o'er my brothers and thee.</l>
	<l>Each morning and evening our prayers will unite,</l>
	<l>That he may defend us in justice and right,</l>
	<l>Give us liberty and triumph with gladness again,</l>
	<l>And no more let battle cries sound o'er the plain.</l>
