      <head><add>This is the poem that was written after visiting the Mountain in 1858</add><lb/>
      The Stone Mountain Of Georgia in the Long Ago.</head>
      <p>One of the Wonders of the World.  Not a mass of loose rocks, but
      one mighty solid stone that lifts its regal crest far above all the
      surrounding country.</p>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>One pleasant day when Autumn's Queen</l>
	<l>Had donned her vestal garments bright,</l>
	<l>And Nature wore a smile serene</l>
	<l>Of tranquil pride in her delight,</l>
	<l>A sylvan Spirit whispered low</l>
	<l>Of beautiful flowers and woodland dells,</l>
	<l>Where never ceasing waters flow,</l>
	<l>And Oreander wander from their cells.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Her voice still lingered on the air</l>
	<l>A light illumed a towering Mount,</l>
	<l>And on we followed free from care</l>
	<l>Till the echo led us to a fount</l>
	<l>Of crystal water pure and clear,</l>
	<l>Where Oak and Ash in beauty great</l>
	<l>Near mossy rocks where every tree</l>
	<l>Was spangled with the glittering dew.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Ah, here then was the Sylvan (??) Queen</l>
	<l>Who called us thither!  My young heart</l>
	<l>Thrilled Wildly o'er the inspiring scene </l>
	<l>Thus woven round me to impart</l>
	<l>Enchantment never edreamed before,</l>
	<l>For high above us in the air</l>
	<l>Through rift of chord that floated o'er</l>
	<l>Was God's own mighty Presence there!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>And Oh, the grandeur of scenes below</l>
	<l>As spreading fields and hill and vale</l>
	<l>Grew brighter when the sunset glow</l>
	<l>Crept o'er each mead and flowery dale!</l>
	<l>Old Kennesaw in azure hue</l>
	<l>Saluted Yonah from afar,</l>
	<l>And Chattahoochee pledged anew</l>
	<l>Allegiance to the Evening Star.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>O here was neauty in a dress</l>
	<l>Of brilliancy and grandeur rare,</l>
	<l>Which gave my soul the power to bless</l>
	<l>The power of Him who placed it there!</l>
	<l>And Memory saved without alloy,</l>
	<l>Through weal or woe the future bring,</l>
	<l>Shall still recall my girlhood joy</l>
	<l>When first I saw this Mountain King</l>
