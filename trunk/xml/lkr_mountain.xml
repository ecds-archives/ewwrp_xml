This is the poem that was written after visiting the Mountain in 1858

The Stone Mountain Of Georgia in the Long Ago.

One of the Wonders of the World.  Not a mass of loose rocks, but one mighty solid stone that lifts its regal crest far above all the surrounding country.

One pleasant day when Autumn’s Queen
Had donned her vestal garments bright,
And Nature wore a smile serene
Of tranquil pride in her delight,
A ???? ???? whispered low
Of beautiful flowers and woodland dells,
Where never ceasing waters flow,
And Oreander wander from their cells.

Her voice still lingered on the air
A light illumed a towering Mount,
And on we followed free from care
Till the echo led us to a fount
Of crystal water pure and clear,
Where Oak and Ash in beauty great
Near mossy rocks where every tree
Was spangled with the glittering dew.

Ah, here then was the Sybian (??) Queen
Who called us thither!  My young heart
Thrilled Wildly o’er the inspiring scene 
Thus woven round me to impart

Enchantment never edreamed before,
For high above us in the air
Through rift of chord that floated o’er
Was God’s own mighty Presence there!

And Oh, the grandeur of scenes below
As spreading fields and hill and vale
Grew brighter when the sunset glow
Crept o’er each mead and flowery dale!
Old Kennesaw in azure hue
Saluted Yonah from afar,
And Chattahoochee pledged anew
Allegiance to the Evening Star.

O here was neauty in a dress
Of brilliancy and grandeur rare,
Which gave my soul the power to bless
The power of Him who placed it there!
And Memory saved without alloy,
Through weal or woe the future bring,
Shall still recall my girlhood joy
When first I saw this Mountain King
