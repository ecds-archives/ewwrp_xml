What I Want My Husband To Be.
1 I want my husband to be a man
Complete in all that Gad may plan.

2 He must be gallant he must be true
And coincide with all I do.

3 He must not frown, he must not scold
And say my coffee is too cold
The steak is burnt, my rice not done
And think light bread must weigh a ton!

4 Whatever I say whatever I do
My husband has got to say so too.

5 Never a fault to find, not he
With either his mother-in-law or me.

6 Tall and comely, black eyes and hair
And the spirit to do and to dare.

7 He must not talk about other pretty girls
Of rosy cheeks and golden curls,
For if he does my time I値l wait
And very soon retaliate

8 My husband must be submissive to me
And no other will but mine to be.

9 If I wear a hat as big as the house
He must be as meek as a mouse.
And say I知 stunnin, tho he痴 frownin
And that he thinks I知 sweeter that pinks.

10 I want my mate to be something great
An Earl a Count or a Potentate.

11 My husband must be a President
Of something, though not worth a cent.

12 He must have riches and plenty of gold 
An automobile and a chauffeur bold.

13 I知 satisfied with any old thing 
That can give me a living and a diamond ring!
