Little julia’s Mission.
Affectionatly inscribed to the memory of little Julia Wright, infant daughter of my brother, Dr. T.R. Kendall, pastor of Trinity church, Atlanta.  The little motherless darling was called by the church “Our Baby.”
She came with cold December’s snow
On angle pinions shining bright,
A gleam of Heaven’s morning ray
illuminating our hearts with light.
Earth fairer, brighter, warmer grew – 
And snow white lilies reared their crest,
The robin sang a sweeter lay,
When Baby came awhile to rest

She whispered low a message sweet
From Him who sent the gift of love,
Another precious link between 
This fleeting life and that above,
A few brief hours passed in joy –
Then swiftly o’er the starry skies
The messenger returned , and bore
The mother home to Paradise.

Ah, sudden darkness shrouded earth
As crushed – we passed beneath the rod,
Our bleeding hearts could only hear
“Be still – and know that I am God.”
“Thy will be done!” The answer low
From broken-hearted mourner came.
Through chill the hearth, its sunlihgt fled,
Still blessed by Thy holy name.

For Thou hast left a precious charge,
A soul immortal to our care,
A pure, sweet gem from Eden’s bowers
To tell us of the glory there.
Ah, how we loved her!  Day by day
As some new charm shone in her eye,
We held her in a close embrace
Ne’er dreaming that she too must die.

But e’n for her a message came,
‘Twas wafted on the summer breath,
And we again with heavy heart
A treasure give to thee, O, Death!
A few short months our baby staid –
Just long enough to win our love,
And then her little mission done
She sought her mother up above.
