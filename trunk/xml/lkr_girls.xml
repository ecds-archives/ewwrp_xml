      <l>A little girl I am indeed</l>
      <l>And little do I know.</l>
      <l>Much help and care I yet shall need</l>
      <l>That I may ??? great</l>
      <l>If I would ever hope to do</l>
      <l>Things great and good and useful too.</l>

      <l>Yes even now I ought to try</l>
      <l>To do what good I may</l>
      <l>God never meant that such as I</l>
      <l>Should only live to play</l>
      <l>And talk and laugh, and eat and drink</l>
      <l>And sleep and never think</l>

      <l>I may if I have but a mind</l>
      <l>Do good in many ways</l>
      <l>Plenty to do the young may find</l>
      <l>In these our busy days.</l>
      <l>Sad would it be though very small</l>
      <l>If I was of no use at all.</l>

      <l>One gentle word that I may speak</l>
      <l>Or one kind loving deeed</l>
      <l>May through a trifle poor and weak</l>
      <l>Prove lifes a tiny seed;</l>
      <l>And who can tell what good may spring</l>
      <l>From such a very little thing?</l>
