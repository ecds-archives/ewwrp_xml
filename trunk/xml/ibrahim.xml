<p>THE PREFACE.
</p>
<p>Donot know r^hat kind of praifc the Antients thmght they
gave to that Fainter, nfio not able to end his rrork, fmfhed
tt accidently by throwing hn pencill agamjt his ri^ure--&gt;bHt
I know very well, that itfkouldnot have obliged me, and
that Iftmld have taken it rather for a Satyre, than an Eto-
gium.lhe operations ofthefpirit are too imfortant to be left
to the conduU of chance, and I had rather bee accufed
forfayling out of knowledge, than for doing well without minding it. There is
nothing which temeritie doth not undertake, and which fortune doth not bring
to paffe 5 but when a man relyes on thofe two guides, if he doth not erre, hee
tnaverrej and of this fort, even when the events are fucctfsfull no glory is
merited thereby. Every art hath its certain rules, which by infallible meanes
lead to the ends propofedj and provided that an Archited takes his mea~
fures right, he is afjured of the beauty of his building. Bcleeve not for all t-his.
Reader,that I will conclude from thence my work, is compleate^ becaufe I have
followed the rules rehich may render it fo ; / know that it is of this labour, as
of the Mathematicall Sciences, where the opperation may fail, but the art doth
never fail , nor doe I make this d/fconrfe but to pew you, that if I have left
fome faults in my Boo k,i they are the effe&amp;sofmyweakenefs, and not of my
negligence. Suffer mee then to difcover unto you all the reforts of this
frame, and let you fee, if not all that I have dene, at leaUwife all that 1 have
indevored to doe.
</p>
<p>whereas we cannot be knowing but of that which others d&amp; teach nt^^ that it
is for him that comes after,to follow them who precedhim^T have beleeved,that

<p>one,and thefeverallHifiories in the other,are not rather beauties, than clefSs-^
but it is alwaies neceffdry, that the adrefs of him which imployes themftjould
hddthem in fome fort to this principall a&amp;ion., to the end, that by this inge¬
nious concatenation, all the parts of themfould makg but one body, and that
nothing may be feen in them which is loofe and unprofitable. Thus the mi-
riage of my JuiWnhno and his Ifabeila, being the obJe3 which ihavepropo-
fed unto my f elf, I have imployed all my care fo to doc, that all the parts of my
W9rk.may tend to that conclufion:^that there may be afirong connexion between
them 5 and that,except t1oe objlacle which fortune oppofeth to the defires of my
HeroSjd// things may advance,or at leftwife indeavor to advance his mortage
which is the end of my labor.Now thofe great Geniuff'es of antiquity, from who
I borrow my light,knowing that well-ordering is one of the principall parts of
apiece,have given fo excellent a one to their fpeakjng pi^ures,thjt it would bg
as much fiupididitie,as pride,not to imitate them.1 hey have not done like thofe
Vainters,who prefent in one and the fame cloth a Prince in the Cradle,upon the
Throne,&lt;d^ in the Tombe,perplexing, by this fo little judicious a confufionjnm,
that confiders their worksfbut with an incomparable adref they begin their Hi~
Jiory in the middle,f0 to give fome fufpence to the Reader,even from thefirftd'
pening of the book.^ and to confine themfelves mthin reafonable bounds they
have made the Hijiory (^as I likewife have done after them J not to laji above a.
year, the reji being delivered bj narration. Thus all things being ingenioufly
placed^ and of a juji greatnefs, no doubt but pleafure will redoundfrom thence
to him that beholds them, and glory to him that hath done them. But amongfi
all the rules which are to be obferved in the compofition ofthefe workes, that of
true refemblance is without queliion the mofi neceffary 5 it is, as it were, the
fundament all jione of this building, and bttt upon which it cannot fubfijl;
without it nothing can move, without it nothing can pleafe : andifthischar-
mingdeceiver doth not beguile the mind in Romanzes, this l(ind of reading
difunfts, injiead of intertainingit : I have labored then never to eloigue my
felffrom it, and to that purpofe I have obferved the manners, cujiomes , Rdi-
gions and inclinations of people : And to give a more true refemblance to
things, I have made the foundations of my work.Hijloricall, my principall per-
fonages fuch as are marked out in the true Hiftory for illufirzous perfons, and
the warres effe&amp;ive. This is the way doubtlefs, whereby one may arrive at his
end'-, for when as falfhood and truth are confounded by adextrus hand, wit
hath much adoe to difintangle them, and is not eafily carried to dejiroy that
which pleafeth it 5 cont rarity, when as invention doth not make ufe of this ar¬
tifice ^and thatfalfhood is produced openly,this grofs untruth makes no impref-
(ionin the foul, nor gives any delight: As indeed how ffjould I bee touched
with the misfortunes of the ^een of Gundaya, and of the King of Aftroba-
cia when as I know their very Kingdomes are not in the Vniverfall Mapp, or,
to fay better, in the being of things ? But this is not the only defeB which
may carry us from true refemblance, for we have at other times feen Roman-
zes whichfet before ut mongers, in thinking to let us fee Miracles j their Au¬
thors by adhering too much to wonders have made Grotefques, which have not
a little of the vifions of a burning Feaver 5 and one might demand ofthefe

doth afjure us, that God keepes them in his Treafures ^ and that vhilofophy, as
clear (Idieted as it is,could never difcover their retreat. Howbeit I pretend not
hereby to banifi) shipwrackj from Romanzes, I approve of them in the worker
of others, and make ufe of them in mine'^ I know likewife, that the Sea is the
Scene mofi proper to make greit changes in, and that fome have named it the
Theater ofinconftancie 5 but as all excefs is vicious,! have made ufe of it but
f}ioderately,fortoconfervetruerefembling'.fiowthe fame deftgn is thecaufe
alfo, that my Heros is not ofpreffed with juch a prodigious quantity of acci"
dents   as arrive ttnto fome others, for that according tomyfenfe, the fame is
far from true refemblance,the life of no man having ever beenfo croft. It would
be better in my oppinion to feparate the adventures , to form divers Hiftories
of them, and to make perfons aBing, thereby to appear both fertile, and judi¬
cious together, and to be fi:ill within this fo neceffary true refemblance. And
indeed they who have made one man alone defeat whole Armies,have forgotten
the Proverb iv/j/V/j/^///.), not one againft two ^ and know not that antiqnitie
doth affure us, how Hercules would m that cafi be too weak..  It is without all
doubt, that to repreftnt a true heroicall courage, onefhould make it execute fome
thing extraordinary, as it were by a tranfpert of the Heros 5 but he muft not
continue in that fort, for fo thofe incredible anions would degenerate into ri¬
diculous fables,and never move the mind. This fault is the caufe alfo of com-
milting another -^ for they which doe nothing but heap adventure upon adven¬
ture, without ornament,and withcut ftirringup pajfions by the artifices ofRhe-
toriquc, are irkefome, in thinking to be the more mtertayning. This dry nar¬
ration, and without art, hath more of an old Chronicle, than of a Romanze
which may very well be imbeliftjed with thofe ornaments, ftnce Hifiory, as fc-
vere andfcrupulous as it is, doth not forbe ir imploying them.   Certain Au^

<p>The Preface.
</p>
<p>For how can I tell, whether in theft events fortune hath not done as much as
he } whether his valor be not a brutifh valor ? and whether he bath born the
misfortunes that arrived unto him, as a worthy manfijould doe ? it is not by
things without him^ it is net by the caprichioes of dcftinie, that I will jndge of
him 5 7t ii by the motions of his foul, and by that which hefpeaketh. I honor
all them that write at this day 5 / know their perfous, their workes, their me¬
rit s'-, but as canoniZfing is for none but the dead, they will not take it ill if I doe
not deifie them, fince they are living. And in this occafion Ipropofe no other
ex ample,than the great and incomparable Urfe, certainly it mufi be acknow¬
ledged that he hath merited his reputation 3 that the love which all the earth
beares him isjuft 5 and that fo many different Nations, which have tranflatcd
his Bookinto their tongues, had reafon to doe it ' as for me,lconfefs openly,
that I am his adorer 5 thefe twentyyeares I have loved him 3 he is indeed ad¬
mirable over all'-) he it fertile in his inventions, and in inventious reafonable ;
every thing in him is mervailous, every thing in him is excellent 3 and that
which is more important, every thing in him is naturall,and truly refembling :
"But amongft many rare matters, that which I moft efteem of is, that he knowes
how to touch the paffionsfo delicately, that he may be called the Painter of the
foul'-) hee goes fearching out in the bottom of hearts the moft fecret thoughes^
and in the diverfity of natures, which he reprefents , every one findes his own
pourtrait,fo that

That merits Altars, "lyr/i?"/ he
Who can alone pretend thereto.
Certainly there is nothingmore important in this kjnde of compofition,
thanftrongly to imprint the idea, or (to fay better) the image of the Heroes
in the minde of the Reader, but in fuch fort, as if they were known to them'-^for
that it is which intereffeth him in their adventures,d^ from thence his delight
commeth , now to make them be knorvn perfectly, it is notjufficient to fay how
many times   they have fuffered fijipwracki and how times they have in-
countred robbers, but their inclinations muft be made to appear by their
difcourfe :   otherwife one may rightly apply to thefe  dumb Heroes that
excellent mot to of Antiquity, Speakethat I may fee thee.   And tf fmm
true refemblance, and inclinations, expreff'edbywords , wee will pafs unto
manners , goejrom the pleafant to] the profitable, and from delight to ex¬
ample,! am to tell you. Reader, that here vertue is feen to bee alwaies recom-
penced, and vice alwaies punifiied, if he that hath followed his owne unrulinefs
hath not by ajuft andfenfible repentance obtained grace from Heaven'-, to which
purpofe I have alfo obferved equality of manners in all the perfons that do a£f,
unlefs it be whereas they are difordered by paffious, and touched with remorfe.
J have bad a care likewife to deal in fuch fort, as the faults, which great ones
have committed in my Hiftory , ftjould be caufed either by love, or by ambition,
which are the nobleft of pajfions, and that they be imputed to the evill counfell
of flatterers'^ thatfo the refpe^i, which is alwaies due unto Kings,may be prefer-

<p>Book which the Ladies may Hot read without bluf/.'iirg. And if you fee ml my

and that he could not be loved, but becaufe it would clft) w.th civility ni

(hew themfelves cruell unto them, nor in doing it c^mldhave any '.oodgrace:
Finally whether things ought to bej\or whether I hwe ja.lged of my Hero
by mine own weaknef,I would not expofe his fidelity tu that dan^rous try all,
hut have been contented to make no Hilas, nor yet an Hipolitus of
him* But whilft Ifpeak of civilitie, it is fit ifijould tell you (^ for fear I be
accufed of fading therein ) that if you fee throughout all my IVork.^ ivhcn as
Soliman/V fpoken unto, thy Wghnefs,thy Mtjefiy, and that in conclufion
he is treated with thee, and not with you, it is not for want of R ffiM ,but
contrarilyit is to have the more, andto obferve the cuftom of thofe peope,
who (beak, after that fort to their Soveraigns. And if the authority of the
living may be of as much force, as that of the dead, youfi)all find examples
of it in the moft famous Othomans, and you fijall fee that their Authors
have not been afraid to imploy in their own Tongue a manner of fpeaking,
whijch they have drawn from the Greek^nd Latin'.) and then too I have made
it appear clearly, that I have not done it without deftgn , for unleft it be
when as the Turk^ fpe^k to the Sultan, or he to his inferiors, I have never
made uft of it, and either of them doth ufe it to each other. Now for fear it
may be obje&amp;ed unto me, that I have approached fome incidents nearer than
the Hiftory hathftoewed them to be, great Vifgil ftoallbe my warrant, who in
his divine JEnesids hath made Dido appear four Ages after her own'-, where¬
fore I have beleeved I might do of fome moneths, what he hath done of fo
many years , and that I was not to be afrgidof erring, as long as I followed
fo good a guide. I know not likewife whether fome may not take it ill, that my
Heio and Hewnh are not Kings'^ but befides that the generous do put no
difference betweenwearingof Crowns, and meritipjgthem, and that my ]ii-
ftmiano is of a race which hath held the Empire oft he Orient, the example of
Athenagoras, me -thinks ^ought to ft op their mouthes, feeing Theogines and
Charida are butfimple Citizens. Finally, Reader, fuch Cenfors may fet their
hearts at reft for this particular, and leave me there, for 1 affure them that

of my Heroe rvithont entring into it, that is to fay, not to read the dtjcnp-

ras , who playes the Mafon in the Temple of Jupiter Hammon 3 nor life
Poliphile in his dreams, who hath fet down mofi ftrange terms, and all

thereof'■) it is not hecaiffe they are not beauties futable to the Pvomanze ,  as

rvhich azures us that it was the moji fuperb the Turks ever made , as fhll ap¬

Reader   ingenuity being a matter neceffary for a man of Honour,  and the
theft of glory being the bafejl that may be committed , / mufi confejs here for
fear of being accnfed oj it, that'the Hftory of the Connt of Lavagna,
which you fijall fee in my Booky is partly a Paraphrafe of Mafcardics 3 this
Adventure falling out in the time whilft I was writing, I judged it too excel¬
lent not to fet it down, and too well indited for to undertake to do it better 3

man   whofe Interpreter onely I am.     Andif you finde fomeihiug not very
ferious in the Hiftories of a certain French Marquis, which I have interlaced
in my Book , remember if youpleafe, that a Romanze ought to have the ima¬

<p>Tauris: If the aflault were vigorouj, the defence was no lefs; the Perfians were feen
to give ground; the Turkes were alfo feen to be repulfed ; and this falfe Image of
of war had all the apparcnces of a true fight: Butat length, after a great refiftance,
the well-made Slave forced the gates, mounted firft onthewalles, andpluckifig
down the Sophyes Colours for to fet up thofe of the Sultan,   his valor and addrefs
were the caufe, that the Moon made theSuntobe cclipfed;   his viftory wasfe-
conded with agreatfhoutof the Janizaries, and of all the people, and nothing Was
heard over all the Hipodrome, but long live Sultan Soliman.     In the mean time
Ibrahimh^iTd,  who knew his friend no lefs by his addrefs* thanby his face, waS
ravifhed to fee ,   that all the glory of this aftion could not be difputed with him.
When the noifeof fo many voices was difperfed, there appeared a Troop like to
Chriftian?, and obferved for fuch by the Croffes,  which were feen in their Co*
lours; they reprefented certain Cl^riftians,   who living under the Empire of the
Sophy thought they were obliged to defe.nd that Prince, though he were not of
theirRcligion, and indeed had fought fogeneroufly for him, as they bad been
the firft in the war, and yet the laft that were vanquiflied.     This feigned Troop
had order from the Baffa of the Sea to refift for fome time that of the Turkes,
which came at that very inftant outof theCitty, and then to fuffer themfelves to
be vanquifhed; and they that were attired like Turkes were commanded to chain
them, andto trail their Colours on the ground     But when the fight began, that
generous Slave,   vvho had drawn the eyes of all the Affembly upon him at the
taking of the feigned Citty ofT'(««m,fell fuddenly from jcfting into a more ferious
thought, and being carried away by the zeal of his Pveligion,   he paffed from the
Turkifh Troop into that ofthe ChriftianS,   and by changing of party made the
face of things to change: The Turkes, whom he had left, laboured to vanquifti him
with the reft, but he beat them back to the very gates ofthe City; and albeit they
made three fallies more upon him, he repulfed them allthe three  times,   even
to the fame, gates.  Allthe world was furprifed with this adventure, and i^e/Zw/rw,
not being able to comprehend the matter, demanded ofthe Baffa ofthe Sea, what it
meant ^ But the Baffa, cafting himfelf at the feet of his Highnefs, affured him that
this criminall aftion came not from his order,but that it proceeded from the infc-
lencie of his Slave ;   whereupon a motion of-choler feizing on the mind ofthe
Grand Signior,   he commanded that this   Slave fhould be inftantly impaled.
But the grand Vifier, rifing from the place where he fate, and falling on his knees,
befought the Sultan that he would not mark the day of his Triumph with blood ;
but remember that clemency is properly the vertue ofthe Viftorious; that in
faving the life of this inconfiderate he fhould be affured, that he would lofeitfor
his fervice ; and that he was of a birth and humor never to be ingratefull; that
knowing him as well as himfelf,  he would be refponfable for hhntohis High¬
nefs ; and that being fo far obliged unto him as to dye for to fave him, he befought
the Sultan to take his life inftead of his, if his fault could not obtain pardon.
Soliman reached out his hand to the illuftrious Baffa, and in raifing him up, faid
tinto him, that were the Lightning in his hand,  his   prayers fhould arreft it;
and that  being unable to refufe him anything, he granted him both the life and
the pardon of that r^fti man.  Ibral^im caft himfelf again at the feet of the Sultan
for to render him tiianks, and after he had obtained of the Baffa of the feathat
this flavefliould come and pafs the night with him, he fent him a commandment
to attend him.   All the magnificences of this Triumph being finished, Soliman
was going to rife, andto prepare himfelf for his return unto his Seraglio, when
as he perceived 0/»;^«, the Baffa of the l&gt;as onely fonne, who breaking through
the prefs, and leading a woman in his hand, came and threw himfelf together
•with her at his feet. 1 know well, my Lord, faid heuntohim, that luyprefumpti^

<p>one of thy Jufticc. The Baffx of the fea knowing that he wets the moft 5"terefl^d
in the matter in hand, approached near to the Grand S.gnior for to befeech h m
with a great deal of earnettnefs not to give ear to the complaintsof a man, who
had beenfo bold as to come and interrupt his Triumph ; that for his part, al¬
though he were his fbunc, he would crave no favour of him forhis fault, but con-
trarily he ftioufd be obliged to his Highnefs if he would give him a chaftifement,
that might punifh him, not only for his crime, but for all others whereof he w^as
alfo culpable. A difcourfe fo violent, and fo far dift.mt from the apprenfions of
a father, made Solman willing to becleaitd therein, being loth in a day of his
gloryhis people might fay, thathehadrefufedtohear the complaints ofthe op-
prelfed. Howbeit he would firft demand the advice of the grand Vifier/^r&gt;iA«/»,
who having no other aim but the glory of his Mailer, faid unto him, that in a
time wherein Heaven had done him jufttcein giving himthcviftory over hil E-
neniief, he fhould in fome fort beunjuftco deny it to them that craved it (if him.
The firft fence of SoUman having been confirmed by the counfell of a man, who
might do all things with him, he commanded the Baffa of thefea to hold his
peace, and the woman whom Ofman had brought to his feet, to tell him what in*
tereft ihe had in the fortune of that man; to the end that underftanding the mat¬
ter from aperfon that fecmed leaft capable of difguifing it, he might alfo give a
more equall judgement therein. That woman then having heard this command¬
ment, could not for all thatrefolve to obey it, before ftie had looked on OfnMn,
as it were to demand permilfion of him to anfwer unto it; but he having made a
fign unto her that he defired it, ftietuinedher {^eMtoviztds Soliman, with both a
modeft, and a confident countenance, which began already to obtain for her the
good-will and attention of all that could hear her. Alibech, fo wasthiswoman
called, was young and fair, and one might have faid that her beauty had been
without compare, if her complexion had not been a little tanned with the Sunj
fhe had a ftately look, but Without pride, and fuch ingenuity in her face, as
could not permit onetodoubt of her words. After that by Ofmans countenance

Tachmas would have infringed it for his fake; and if he would not, that want of
affeftion would be a reafon flrong enough to oblige him to make the Province re¬
volt, where hecommanded,and whereof he believed he wasabfo'utelythcMafter-
howbeit the matter fucccedcd not fo, for the enemies whidi my Father had made
him by his violences, meeting with fo fair an occafion to hurt him, they reprefen¬
ted unto the Sophy, that if he pardoned him this fault, it would make hii.i the
more infoknt for the future, yeaand that it would even overthrow all that Em-
pi re , the glory and force whereof confifted in the valour of noble perfons, where-
with it is rcplcniftied ; at length they wrote in fuch manner, that my Father was
declaredguilty,as contravening the fundamental! Laws of the State, and con-
tiraincd to undergo the chaftifement, which I fhall come to fpeak of^ by reafon that
the Province, where he commanded fo abfolutely when he was in grace, revolted
againft him, and left him not fcarcely the liberty to feek a refiige otherwhere • for
J forgot to tell thy Highnefs, that the fame Law which commaffded the utter r'uine
of my Father, commanded alfo that he fhould pafs his life in a pcrpetuall pri-
fon, and the perfon whom he had maried in another, for fear that living together,
and having children, it might one day caufe diforders in the State.    My Father
feeing himfelf in fo pitifull a fortune, went not about to move the heart of Tiif/;-
IW.W with payers and fubmiflion, but contrarily fent him word, that defcrving not
to be ferved by a man of his courage and valor, he would go out of his Eftates,
with an intention never to re-enter into them again , but to oring war along with
him.    Being then in ^izt^^/m, he bought a Man of War, wherein he imbarqucd
himfelfon.A/.«rtf»*4Vr, withhis wife, who as fhe was  the caufe of his misfor¬
tune, fo would fhe not abandon him in his exile.    They  continued fome time in
this fort, not knowing what refolution to take, nor having any other dcfign in the
courfe that they held, than to eloign themfelves from Perfta \ my Fathers great
heart not permitting him to go and feck unto the enemies ofT^icZ-wrff for a place
of retreat; for though hebefomewhat cruelJ,yct ishenotwithftanding generous;
neither would he likewife addrefs himfelf to the Princes that were allied to our
Empire, for fear he fhould not be favourably received by them.   In the mean time
thefe irrcfolutions having no end, the provifions of the fhip diminifticd daily:
The Pilot was well hoped up to ask him where he would land,vvhen as he found no
place in the whole univerfall Map whither ro go. Six moneths paft away in this
fort in running over all the Seas of the Levant; and whereas my mother was with
child of me, at fuch time as Ihe irabarqued her felf, ftie was not far from the term
wherein I was to fee the light, when as &gt;4r/«/o».f viftualls utterly failed him; and
having imployed all his money in the buying of the Vcffell, and fuch provifions
of War, and for the mouth, as he had laid into her, he knew not what part to re¬
pair unto for the fupplying of himfelf in fo adverfe an adventure. The fouldi-
ers and Mariners confulted together, and having gained the Pilot, they wrought
fo with him^that maugre the command n\y Father had given him to the contrary,
he fleered direftly to an Hand which they had difcovcred ; whereupon Arfalen
being in a rage to fee his authority contemned, went and puftied away the Pilot ^
rudely for to make him abandon the helm, as the poor wretch fell into the Sea;
and my Father becoming his own Pilot, he took his fcimitar in his right band,

with fright flie was brought to bed of me by th? ailiftance of her Nurfe, who had
never abandoned her, they fet upon the Vcffelljand after two hours fight rendred
themfelves abfolute Matters of her, wherein they found extreme riches, and abun¬

which my Father had fhewed in this occafion, grew fo devoted unto him, as they
craved pardon of him for refitting his will, and fwore never to forfake him ; he
to win them the morc,divided the booty amongft them,referving nothing for him¬
felf but the glory of having vanquifhed.   After this, my Lord, he took a refoluti¬
on to have no other Countrey but his fhip, and to pafs all the reft of his life upon
all the Seas of the worI&lt;^ to feek out alloccafions  c^ fighting, and to take all
the Veffells that fliould carry the Colours of PerJtA, or all that belonged to the
Enemies of our Religion, which are the Chriftians: He propounds this defign
to his foudiers, who approve it, and albeit my Mother withfbod it, he fetled this
refolution at laft. Behold, my Lord, in what fort my Father.hath lived for the fpacc
of eighteen years that I have been in the world,  and that which hath gotten
him fo much fame under the name of ArfaUntht Pirate throughout all the Sea«
that are known to us.    I have not for all that been always brought up in fo wild

which he had taken, he left me from the age of fix years untill fourteen, at which

<p>This Slave having confirmed this promifc unto him, my F.ith:r permitted him to
write unto the place whence he faid he was of, and fo going to the Hie of Cyprut
he gave this Letter to Merchants, with whom he held correfpondence, that under¬
took to caufe it to be delivered; my Father promifing this Slave, that within three
moneths he would return thither for an anfwer of it; but in the mean time that
he muftforhisfecuritygo along with him : This man not knowing what to do,
but to follow the Law of the Vanquiftier, refolved  to fubmit to that which he
could not avoid.  Not long after we encountred a great nun of War, in whofe
i-iag my Father obferved half Moons;  and whereas all his prizcj were fcldom
O'".'?^^&lt;^''made of any fave of Prr/^w/, or Chriftians, he purpofed not to meddle
withhei, but contrarily commanded his Pilot to quit his courfe, that fo he might
decline her ; but whereas Arfalon was taken for a Pirate, and this change of courfe
feemcd to be a flight unto him who commanded that Veffell, he made up with
tullfayls unto us, the better to difcern ours, and having well difcerncd her, he
canie prefently and grapled himfelf faft unto us.    I cannot fay, my Lord , what
this fight was, becaufe the fright I was in kept me from marking it,howbcit I know
that at the very firft, they of that Veffell leaped into ours; and whereat there were
many of my Fathers fouldiers fick, they might peradventure have rendred them¬
felves Matters of her without the valor of the/M/M«Sla&gt;e, who feeing that they
which attacqued us were not Chriftians, demanded leave of Arfalon to fight, who
having given him arms, gave him wherewithall to gain us the viftory ; for he per¬
formed fuch marvellous things in this fight, as after he had repulfed the enemy, he
leaped into their Veffell, followed by my Father, and fome of his, put very ncer
all that he met with there to the fword, rendred   himfelfe Matter of her, and
with his own hand, after a long refiftance, took Ofman ^ who commanded her, and
who by his Fathers order was going to Alexandria.   After this brave exploit,
this Slave was the favourite of Arfalon, of which grace notwithtt.mding he was not
much fenfible; for though my Father careffed him extremely, yet left he not to
be exceedingly afflifted, when as he knew that the reward of his viftorie; fliould be
a perpetuall flavery; for albeit my Father had promifed to give him his liberty,
"when as he fhould have received his ranfom, he had refolved neverthelefs to break
his Word with him, for that  hemight not, faidhe, part with a man which could
make him invincible by his wonderfull val jr.    In the mean time, my Lord, Ofman
finding himfelf wounded, and my inclination having always carried jne to the
comforting of others miferies,! vifitcd him whilft he was ill, and more for the
care that I had of his perfon, as long as he was fo, than for any beauty was in my
face, he bare an affeftion to me; and if I dare fay it, the knowledge which I had
thereof^ together with his merit, and the compaffion I had of his misfortune, very
much difpofed me to accept of it; the conftancy which he fticwed was partly the
caufe of my weaknefs,if at leaftwife one may call aaaffeftionfo, which hath no
other objeft but vertue.   As foon as 0/r»4» was taken, he told Arfalon vihzt he
was, who gave him the means to let the Baffa of the Sea undcrftand what ranfom
he was fet at, and how he might deliver him; in the mean time, his hurts being cu¬
red, he contrafted a great friendftiip with that generous Slave, fpeaking acertain
corrupted Italian unto him, which, they fay, is very much in ufe here in Conjlanti-
nople.    As forme, after I parted from the Ifle of.Cr/r/w,mychiefeftentertain-
mens was to talk with the Interpreter, whom my Fatlier carried always along with
him, and by the continuall conference which we had together, touching the diver-
fitics of Languages, I had almoft learned two or three, if not for to fpeak thera
well, at leaftwife to underftand them perfcftly ; and whereas the Turkifh and /m-
//Vrw were of that number, I did alfo many times converfe with thofe two infortu¬
nate ones, thinking I had paffe4 away the day exceeding well, when 1 could avoid
the company of thofe men of blood and flaughter that followed my Father. Thus
I fpent moft of my time, cither in the Captains Cabbin with my Mothers Nurfe,

a Ifianicffff 't in i.'s and the love which we bore one to another , and which we
had both ano concealed .is much as we could, began then to break forth. I could
not (perk tc hi o of n,y fithcrs dcfigns but with tears in mine eys,nor could he talk
tor.K of Tin e'cignnKnc^ which he believed to be inevitable, without declaring his
aficftionop lily unto ir.e; I believed , my Lord, that it was true, thinking it was
not a time httiiii: to diifrnible in ; he alfured methat his irons did not feem heavy
i.nto him, as long as he was with me, but the thought of being feparated from me
fi r ever, and-to be conftrained to carry chaines otherwhere, was infupportableto
to him; he fwaie to me further, that he had not defired his liberty but toobtain of
hisfathci, ajjainft whom he had never fo much as once murmured, the meanes to
deliver nic out of the hands of mine. A difcourfe fo obliging found not an ingrate¬
full foul, and I ivfolvtd to do what I could to keep my father from executing fo ig¬
noble a defign; I caft my lelf then at his feet,! begged this grace of him with tearesj

never to  fpeak to him more of it.    After  that   he alwaies treated  me   ill -

<p>1   had no longer the libcrtie to entertain Ofman   as   before ; and   wee Were

<p>der the difficulties of it, and find no other way to execute it, than to ftay till we
came to the Ifle oiChio, whither ray father was to goe,   and there to caft anchor •
for whereas he had caufed the Captains Cabbin to be divided in the midft, to
the end that I ftiould lie on the one fide, and he on the other, and that Ofman alfo
was every night locked up with a key, which ^rp/w himfelf alwaies kept by him,
I refolved to fteal icas fofdy as 1 could from him; but the difficulty was, that ever
fince he   purpofed  to retain the Italian Slave, he for to favour him, but indeed
to affure himfelf of him, made him to lie with him.    I refolved then to propound
unto him his efcaping out ofmy fathers hands; at firft he doubted it was but to
try him, that I fpake fo to him,  and withall his own generofity withftood it, but
having acquainted him with the truth ofthe matter, he believed rae, and faid, that
feeing my father had broken his word with him, he might fail in his fidelity to
him alio; and on condition that Q/5»/«» would promife him his freedom, he would
expofe himfelf to any thing for my fake. I affured him ofwhat he defired , andha-
ving fo good a fecond it was not hard  for me to finifh my enterprife.    But with-
OQt importuning thy Highnefs, my Lord, by a long relation, let it fuffife to fay,
we were no fooner at the road oiChio, where Ofman had fome acquaintance, but
night being come,   and my father afleep,  I went and ftoleaway the key ofthe
Cabbin,wherein Ofmanviz^ locked;and the generous Slave,having fhut up my father
in hisjwherehefoundlyflept, came along with me to unlofe his frienci, fnatched
away a fentinells armes that would have cryedout, and having killed him, as
well as the Pilot, we got into the skiff, and for the more furcty, the generous Slave
with a blow of his fcimitar cut afunder the cable that held the veffell at anchor,
which by the light of the Moon we faw fall away from us,  and float at the plea¬
fure of the winS, without a Pilot, or any man awake in her. In the mean time Of¬
man and that Slave rowed with fuch fpeed, as wee foon approched to land, where
we happily arrived; and meeting withafanftuary inthehoufeofone, who knew
Ofman at CktQ,   we in a little time found the meanes to come unto Conflantinople^
leaving Arfalon no doubt in an extreme rage at our flight,   which was made with
much the more fecurity,   for that my father feldomfuffered his great Veffell to
enter into any Port that was fufpefted unto him,  but fent   a Barque in for
the difpatch of^ fuch bufinefs as he had to do there, and upon that it was that I had
grounded my enterprife.  Now, my Lord,   after I had delivered Oyw&lt;*» with the
help ofthe generous Slave, and had brought him back to his paternall houfe, when
he would have made good his word  which he had given us, this incenfed father
hath intreatedme as an infamous perfon, and a vagabond, and hath put that Slave
into irons, to whom his fonne oweth his liberty,  fince that without him I could
iiot have executed that which I had promifed ;   it is that Slave, my Lord ,   whom
thou haft fo lately pardoned,  and of whom the Illuftrious Ibtahim hath underta¬
ken the proteftion.    Behold, my Lord, the difference that is between the Baffa of
the Sea, and his fonne, whole fenfe I will not deliver, for fear I ftiould be fufpefted
to interpret it too advantagioufly for my felf;   wherefore it is for thy Highnefs to
underftand itfromhis own mouth, and abfolutely to difpofe ofmy happinefs, or
ofmy unhappinefs, ofmy life, or ofmy death. ALbeeh having given over fpeak¬
ing   a confuted noife was heard , which fecmed to judge the matter for her ad¬
vantage; but Soltman , defiring to render equall Juftice, commanded the Baffa of
the Sea to fpeak his intentions. 1 have no other, my Lord, faidhe ,   thantochace
from my houfe a woman, that ought to be driven from all the earth,  and whofe

not for that which he was, and betray her father; a woman defcended from a Pi¬
rate    nourilhed amidft blood and cruelty, brought up amongft wicked villaines
whom the earth cannot bear, and the daughter ofa Perfian thy Highnefs enemy :
Behold what this woman is whom my fonne will mary,  and for allhereftate
brings nothing with her but infamy; he will tell mc ,  it may be, that he owes his
liberty to her, and I will anfwer him, that it is a good which ftie hath not done

<p>in a more deplorable eftate than ever man was feen : Love then did not enter into
her heart by voluptuoufhefs, but I can fay it was introduced thereinto by goodnefs
acknowledgement, and compaffion; for if fhe had not been pittifull, fhe had not if-
fifted me Whenl was ill, fhe had not loved me; if fhe had not been acknowledging,
fhe had defpifed the love ofa flave, that had not the liberty to do her any fervice-
and if her heart had not been tender, flie had not been moved with my misfortuner.
nor given an end to them. It is true, that fhe is the daughter ofthe Pirate Arfalon-
that fhe hath quitted her father to follow me; that ftie hath been brought up a-
tnongft cruell and bloody men ; and thatfiie is the daughter, not only of a Pirate
but of A Ptrfian. But, my Lord, all this, which feems to make againft me, makes
for me in this occafion : for what greater mark can one defire of a folid and im¬
moveable vertue, than to fee a woman of eighteen years of age, whofe inclinations
arc not corrupted amidft fomany vices, and whofe innocencie isprefcrved fo en¬
tire, as fhe could not fo much as cxcufe cruelty in her father ? It is true, that fhe
hath followed mc, but it was to fee no more murthers, nor fights, S(nd becaufe fhe
faw a juffer temper in my mind : She hath not betrayed her father to follow a flave,
but flie hath quitted the Pirate Arfalon to deliver a husband; for having promifed
tobefo unto her, nothing but death alone can keep me from it.    Moreover, my
Lord, fhe is not to be fufpefted of thy Highnefs, for though fhe be the daughter ofa
PerfiaUj it is of a Perfian the enemy of Tachmas, who hath for thefe eighteen years
waged War againft h ira. I will not ftand to fay, that this woman, albeit the daugh¬
ter of a Pirate, is for all that of a noble extraftion, becaufe the Alujfulmans mukc
Nobility perfonall, and belecve that it ought not to pafs unto children; but I will
only fay, that in the eftate wherein my fathers fortune now is,all that can be defired
In a woman is contrafted in riiis fame; ftie is fair, fhe loves me,and flic is vertuous.
It is tru&gt;t, that fheis without wealth, and without parents,  but ftichath lottthem
for the love of mc; and whereas by thy bounty my father hath no nced,either of fup-
porl, or of riches, what can 1 Wifti for more in a Wife &gt; If I take one that is rich, it
ftiay be fhe will abandon me ifl fliould happen to fall intomifery, but this that I
havechofen wil be the companion of all my misfortune$,withoutany fear that ever
flie will quit mc.   I know that I ow a great deal of refpeft to my father, but I
know that I ow my life and my liberty to this woman; I mutt then love both the
one and the other, or keep my word which I have given her ; for if my father will
not fuffer himfelf to be perfwaded, we will go voluntarily into banifhment;  we
are already accuttomed to misfortune, and the mifery that we ftiall endure toge¬
ther will no doubt be more fupportablc to us, than greatnefs and riches would
be if we were feparated.   As for the generous Slave, to whom I have promifed li¬
berty, 1 know not by what reafon my father can pretend any right to deprive  him
of it; he is neither his flave nor mine ; and bythefeverett law of War he can lay
Aocla'im at all unto him : He is a Chriftian I acknowledge, but allthe Chriftians
here in Cbr^amin*plt wear not fetters 5 he is a captive,  but that is to Arfalm^
and not to him; and a captive too, who after a breach of promife might with Ju¬
ftice break his chains ; nor hath he fought for liberty but to give it me, and that
</p>






<p>hold allthe crimes, my Lord, that I have committed; my father would have me
perfidious and ingratefull, and I had rather my father fliould hate me with inj«-
fticc than love mcunjuftly. The generous--^//^ff/'feeing that 0/Jw«w had made an
end of fpeaking, and having obferved by the Baffa of the fcas countenance, that
the difcourfe had rather incenfed, dian perfwaded hira, turned her felf to Ofmau,
with tears in her eyes, and conjured him to obey his father; I will not, fayd (he
unto him, have you faulty for the love of me; and fince our affcftion cannot be in¬
nocent, extinguifli it in your heart, and leave me the care ofconferving it in mine;

long  in pain; and though the Baffa of the fea would havcreplycd, he forbad him
to withlLindhis pleafure; but whereas he knew, that the true reafon wherefore
he oppofed the p.ill.'nn of his fonne, was avarice, fo ordinary amongft the Turks y
he told him, after he had confulted with Ibrahim^ that the vertue of Alibech hzd
charmed him in fuch fort, as he would adopt her for his daughter, and how irt
that quality he would give her three hundred thoufand Sultannics in mariage with
her, commanding him to receive her for the wife of hisfonne,andtointreat heras
if (he were his daughter, affuring him that he would hold the place of father unto
her, and that he would interefs himfelf in all that regarded her. That for the Slave
whom he had already pardoned, it was his pleafure, that he ftiould remit him in¬
to the hands of Ibrahim to difpofc of him as he Would. The Baffa of the fea, who
indeed had found no other defeft in the vertuous Alibech, than poverty, feeing her
to be rich by the bounty of the Sultan, changed his choler into giving of thank*
aid afl^^ucd Solm^n that he Ihould be obeyed.    Ofman and Alihchrendred him

which he carried in hisbreaff, could not amidft all his Vifto-

as vifiblc in his eyes, as it was fenfible to his heart. TheCon-

the whole extent of the Empire of the Mujfulmans with
gladnefs: but this gencrall rejoycing made not his particular ;

the only thing which made up all his defires, and all his ambition; heperfeftly
knew, that the more happy he was for another, d.«e more infortunate he was for
himfelf ; and a news which he had heard the day htfort from Arfalons flave, had
ftirred up fo great a trouble in his mind, and agitated it withfo much violence,
as forgetting all things to abandon himfelf to grief, he rcmcmbred not that he was
obliged to be prefent at the rifing of great 5o//&gt;»&lt;i«, of whom he was beloved with
fo much tcndernefs, as he alone had permiffion to enter into the Seraglio as often
as he pleafed, a favour fo extraordinary, that it had never been granted to any per¬
fon. He had alfo made choice of our Illuftrious Baffa to be not only his Grand
Vifier, buttorepofc himfelf upon him for all the affairs ofthe Empire. It was he
that commanded the Armies; it was he that made the Sangiacs, and gave them the
Government of Provinces; it was he that prefided in the Counfell of State, and
that alone formed the refolution thereof in the Sultans Cabinet: Ibrahim was fo
powerfull, that he wanted nothing but the fole name of Emperor, to be the chief
of all the Orient. In the mean time thefe favours of fortune could not keep him
from holding himfelf the wretchedeft of all men; it was in this irkfom thought
that the Ag*of the Janizaries found him, when as he came to tell him, that the
Grand Signior complaihed of his floth, and that it was his pleafure he fhould come
away unto him. IbrahiWy furprifed with this commandment, which made him fee
the fault he had committed, did what he could to conceal his grief from the Aga;
howbeit he perceived that there was fome unquietnefs in his mind; Ibrahim to\d.

El a had no fooner made an end of fpeakine, but the Sultan faid unto him very
cblipingly, Why then, IbrahimyHnce thy mefancholy proceeds not from any thing
thr.t regards me,  it muft needs be  fcmething   that  concerns   thee in   parti¬
cular, and  as   I   am no  lefs  fenfible   on   that fide, than  on the other, I

though thou  haft  laboured to put on  a joyfull countenance   in   anfwering

Ibrahim, feeing himfelf fo ncerly preft, could not forbear blufhing, and thinking
vu v.iiathe vvastolay, hecaft down his eyes, and fecmed to be ftrucken dumb,
which the Sukanhaving obferved, imbraced him, and faid. No, Ibrahim, do not

may be : Look not on me in this confidence, as on thy Soveraign, but as on 5#/i-
W.77, that is to fayy as on a man that will partake with thee in all thegood, and in
all the evill that can arrive unto thtc; thy courage hath made thee Ihed blood c-

<p>have fuGcceded in his dignitie, never to think themfelves fecurc : He had confirm¬
ed the Throne of Ba]az.et', he had been the only man that mounted him into it;
in the mean time for a recompence of all his fervices he was ftrangled by two
Slaves.    But, my Lord, not to go fofar to feek for examples, that of Chajfan
Baila, Vifier under the reign of an Emperor, who could not be but great, feeing
he hath given birth to thy Majefty, is not he able to ftrike fear into the firmett and
moft innocent fouH fince for giving good counfell, which had not been fuccefsful
if it had been followed, he loff that life which he had fo many times hazarded for
the fafi ty of this Empire : I fliould not have been fo bold, as to have fpoken of this
adventure In this occurrence, had I notremembred, that I have heard thy High¬
nefs bemoan the misfortune of that great man: Now therefore demand no longer
of me thccauleof my grief, feeing thy Ma)cfty knows it as well as my felf; but
if it be true that I am beloved of thee, as I cannot doubt of it without a crime,
pardon only my weaknefs, and believe not that the difcourfe which Ihave made
is aneffeft of my ambition. I know too well, my Lord, that I cannotgo h-igher,
and for that reafon it is that I fear the inconftancy of fortune, who being unable to
raife me more,ftiall be conftrained to deftroy me for to follow her naturall inclina¬
tion ;  it is an order which fhe hath kept in all ages, and I dare not hope that fhe
will break it in favor of me.    But, my Lord, were  I affured that flie would be
contented with bereaving me of all the honors, which I have received from thy
Greatnefs, and that (he would leave me heavy laden with chains, as I  was when
it pleafed thy Highnefs to free me of them, provided flf^y') that fiie would not
deprive me of thy Grace,  1 fliould be untroubled, and live more happily being
thy Slave, than now I do being full of glory  and   favors.    The  Sultan having
hearkened to this difcourfe with a great deal of patience, could not at  length
forbear interrupting  him ;    1 thought, Ibrahim, faid he, that  I had open¬
ed my heart fo well unto thee, and fo thorowly fhewed thee my Love, astliere
refted nothing more for thee, either to fear, or to defire; butiince I am deceived in
my con(eftures,I will pardon thy weaknefs,and if it be poffible I wil cure thee of it.J
couldjif I wouId,find fome cxcufe for the violences which my predeceffors haveufed
during their reignes, and tel thee,   that in an Empire which was not as then well
fetled, it was in fome fort convenient to lean rather towards rigor, than towards
clemencie; but I will not undertake to make their apologie ferve niy turn againft
thee; that which was juft in their times, would not be reafonable in thefe; where¬
fore I will imploy other remedies,   which, if I be not deceived, will make thee
know, that 5//&gt;w^» can tell how to chain up fortune \vhen he pleafeth, andthathe
is refolved, to meafure thine with his life.   The Baffa would have aiifweied to fo
obliging a fpeech,but the Sultan ftayinghim faid; I think, Ibrahim,thou haft not
forgotten, that it is by the meanes of the Sultana, my daughter Afteria, that I have
the commodity to fee thee in my fervice.   I ftiould be too ingratefull, replyed the
Baffa, if I ftiould not remember, that I ow my life unto her ,   and that which is
yet more precious unto me , I  ow her the honor of ferving the greateft Monarch
of the world. That being, faid  Soliman,   thou needeft not doubt, that the defign
which I have, fliould not pleafe her; feeing that in a time,  when .as flie knew thee
notbutby thygoodafpeft ,  flie judged thee worthy of her care; but to clear my
thoughts unto thee, and to diffipate the fear that mafters thee, know, th.it I am re-
fclve'd to place thee in our illuftrious alliance, by making thee mary Afi-eria; and
to leave thee yet a more precious gage,   receive the word which now I give thee,
r thou knowft, being what i am, that it is inviolable and facred ) remember then,
thatlfwear to thee by ALLA, that as long as 5'&lt;?//»M«fliall be living , thou
ftialt not die a violent death; judge now whether I can doe more,   and whether
thou haft not been too blame to doubt of the firmnefs of my affeftion.    It is true,

all the induftry of agriculture, joyned to the heat of the San, the ferenity of the

of one ofthe moft illuftrious races ofGenoua,   put our City into theeftate which
now it is , namely under the Government ofthe Nobility.    I have madeknown
unto thy Highnefs the divers mutations which have befalleijour Republique ,  to
the enci thou maift with the lefs difficulty comprehend that, which hath made all
this Conmionalty be divived a  long while fince into two principall faftions •
the Heades of thefe two parties are the Fregoz.es yZnd. the Adornes , ingaged , as
well as all the reft of Italy, in two oppofite faftions,  fo known and famous under
the name of the G«(r/fAf jf, and Gibelius, Jwithwhom the Fieftjues, the Donaes ,
the Spmolaesy the Grimald:esy the Juflinianoes ,   and all the other illuftrious Fa¬
milies ofGenoua have taken part.   But to come to that which regards me direftly,
I will not fear to tell thy Highnefs what my birth is, being confident of thy ge¬
nerofity : Thou maift be pleafed to underftand then, that I am of the illuftrious
race of that infortunate prince, from whom the valor and fortune of Mahomet the
fecond, thy great Grandfather , took his Empire, and hislife, and who interred
himfelf with all his glory, and with all that of the Palcobgues under the mines
of this famous City of 0«/rt«f;&gt;?o;&gt;/f: Thou art not ignorant, my Lord, that after
fo great a fubverfion of that State^ and in fo generall a deftruftion ^ all that remai¬
ned of the Princes of the Imperiall Houfe were difperfed over all the earth , and
not able to conceal their unhappinefs' in generall, fome of them concealed them¬
felves by changing a too famous name for their ^xeient fovtnne; Juflinmno Paleo^
logue, of whom I defcended , was of that number ;  for feeing he had faved out of
that fhipwrack wealth enough for a particular, but not enough for a Prince of fo
illuftrious a blood as his, he retired to Genoua, retaining but the mme of Jujlmiana,
which fince hath been the furname of our Houfe,  the very fame with that of a Po¬
pular Family,   which was before in the fame City: And that poor Prince defi¬
ring to accommodate his quality to his misfortune, fliut up that fecret within his
Family, and in this forr, though we be in effeft Princes,  yet have we paft ever
tincefor Gentlemen. That which obliged him to chiife(jtfw»4 for his retreat ,  ra¬
ther than any other place of/frf/7 ,   was, for diat he knew how the Genouefes had
alwaies been well affefted to that Empire;   how they had mightilv fuccoured
M'chaelo Paleologue ; and hovv in cafe it fliould happen that he ftiouldbe known
for that which he was,he fliould be in a place offafety : And truly he had fome rea¬
fon to fear it,   for he had  rendred himfelf fo remarkable by the gallant aftions
which he had performed,   and had fo fignalized himfelf on the day of the taking
of Conjlantinopte, as he was the laft that was feen to defend the breach ;  but at
length beholding the City taken, the Emperor Cmjlmtino Paleologue dead, and the
whole Empire ftibverted , he ftole away his perfon from the viftory of his Ene¬
mies; and being retii ed almoft alone he took the  refolution   which I have delive¬

landed at Carthagena.    But hardly was he arrived there, when as he faw himfelf
conftrained wholly to quit all his dcfigns of Africa for to think of defending himfelf
from the French. It would be unjuft to abufc thy patience with the recitall ofa War
which no way fcrvs to my difcourfc,it wil fuffice then that I fay,how I followed him
three whole years together, except when he was at Genoua, whither I would not
go for fear of being retained by my parents.   But at laft, after I had been a witnefs
of all the brave aftions which he performed in Navarre, in Germany, in Luxemburg
againft the Duke of Cleves, znd in Guelderlandy I received exprefs order from my
father to come home to him, which I prefently did, though the Emperor was
loth to let me go.   But, my Lord, what caufe of misfortune hath that return been
unto me? Ah! how much better had it been for me that I had dyed in the Wars,
than to have gone to a place where fo many grievous adventures were to befall me?
It was not, for that I was not received with joy, careffed by my kindred, imbra¬
ced by my friends with all kindnefs, and if I dare fay it, regarded by the enemies
of our houfe with more efteem, than that inveterate hatred, which had been long'
between us, would permit; but contrariwife it fecmed, that the Fates had refol¬
ved to let rae taft all the content of a quiet and deliciou s life, for to make mc feel
at once, both the privation of the good, and alfo the evill which was prepared
forme.   After I had then betto wed fome time in receiving the careffes of our fa¬
mily, and that I had anfwcred all the quettions which my father made me touching
the War , and my Voyages; after, Ifay, I had recounted unto him an hundred
times over all the occafions wherein I had been prefent, I defired  to make it ap¬
pear, that War and Gallantry were not incompatible, and that after having been
three years in flaughter and blood, I was not returned from thence, nor more wild,
or moreuncivillj I took care then to inform my felf from my friends, whether
there were not fome Affembly fhortly to be, where I might make comparifon be¬
tween the Beauties of our Ladies, and thofe which I hud feen in Spai»&gt; There¬
unto they anfwered rae, that I might in a little time content my curiofity, for that
in three or four dayes the Nuptials of two perfons of quality in our City would
be folemni2ed.    I further demanded of them whether a Nicpcc of Andrea Doriaes
held not ttill the Empire of beauty ? Or whether fince my departure fome other
had not bereaved her of that advantage, which had been given her with fo much
juftice &gt; They told me, that ftic was fair, as I had feen her, but as for the prime
place, flie had been conftrained to yecld it up to a fpringing beauty, which made all
that came near it to dy for love; and that they accounted me moft happy for not
being expofed to that danger. But when as I demanded of them by what falfe con*
fequence they conjefturcd that I was infcnfible of love &gt; they anfwered me then,that
Ifabella Grimaldi, the only daughter of Rhodolpho, was that fame admirable perfon,
who could not be fufficiently praifcd, and of whom they had fpoken unto me; and
that knowing the terms wherein we ttood, they beleeved that I was fo generous,
as I would not fuffer my felf to be vanquiflied by mine enemy. This difcourfe ftir¬
red up fuch an emotion within mc, as hath made mc to underftand fince, that there
is afupreme power which forceth us, whether we will or no, and without the aid

fhould have no need to ask her name ; but whether it were, that whilft I was in

could not meet with her any where, how carefull foever I was to do it.    I de¬

ly.    Scarcely was this difcourfe ended, but that devancing all the company len-
tfred  alone into the Cabinet, refolving to try the Eccho firft of all; howbeit   my
Lord, I had no fooner opened the window, but infteedof obliging the Eccho to
anfwer  mc, I my felf loft the ufe of my voice, by the rapture wherewithal! I
was feized, in beholding the faireft creature that ever Nature made; ftie was
leaning on aBaluftrade of Jafper and Porphirie, which formed a Qnadrant   in
the midft Whereof ftood a Fountain, wherein four Nymphs of white Marble feeni-
ed to play together in bathing themfelves; for by a marvellous artifice there part¬
ed from their hands in different aftions, an abundance of water, which wetted
them, and made one believe that they caft it upon one another, making withall a
very  pleafing noife.    If J had never feen this Fountain but in this incounter .  I
fhould not have heeded it fo much, as to be able to defcribe it ;   for f was fo fiir-
prifed With the charms of this unknown fair one, as 1 had no eyes but for her : I
changed colour twenty times in a moment, and hiding my felf forfearof beino-
perceived, I confidered her with all the attention that a man could have, who fron^
admiration was already paffed even to lovc;it being moft certain,that from the very
firft inftdnt I faw her,  I felt my felf forced withfo much violence to love her as I
then fully refolved to dye, or to poffefs her. As I was in this eftate all the compa¬
ny arrived, and ftiewed me that they were forry I had quitted them fo foon , be¬
caufe there had been a difpute about the nature ofthe Eccho, which would have
pleafed me very much i after I had heard this difcourfe, without anfwering unto
it, I asked whether there were any that could tell me the name of that fair one,
who fare niufing on the brim of the fountain, which I faw in the midft of the Gar¬
den ; in faying fo, I foftly opened the window, which I had half fliut, and prayins
them to make no noife,  1 fhewed them that prodigy of beauty :   I had no fooner
made an end of fpeaking, but by an hidden knowledge, which prevented their
anfwer, I felt fomething within me, that told me how it was the divine Ifabella-^
fcarcely had this thought excited fome trouble in my mind, when as one of ifiy
friends confirmed this truth unto me, and demanded of mc, if it was poffible that
I fhould not know mine enemy? Why, faid 1, interrupting him, is ftie that Ifce,
the daughter of Rhodolpho f 1 fpake this fo loud, that I made her turn her face to¬
wards the place where we were, fo that having perceived us fhe pulled down her
veil, and began to go away unto two womenthat were walkieg in an Alley a good
way off. Totell, my Lord, what became of me in this occafion, would be a diffi¬
cult matter; my reafon proved fo weak, and my paflion fo ftrong, as little wanted,
but that forgetting all kind of good manners, I had at the very inftant departed
from a place  that had been fo fatall unto me, as to let me fee in one onely perfon
theobjeftofmy hate,and ofmy love : Butat length, the fpight and the ftiameof
being feen with fo much weaknefs, made me refolvc to try to conreal it; I faid
then to him that had fpoken to me, that I was ravifhed with having fo fair an E-
ncmy, and that though fhe had arms which would eafily render her viftorious of
all them that ftic would fubjeft, yet was I generous enough , for to combat a per¬
fon by whom one might be vanquiflied without fliame.    After this they amufed
themfelves in feeking out the beauties of the Eccho ; thofe of the company who
had the worft and the hoarfeft voyces, forbore not forcing this Eccho to reproach
them with their defeft, in imitating thera :   As for me, who had it not unplea-
fing at that time, it was impoftible for me to fing, and howfoever I conftrained my
felf, I could not call to mind fo much as one air, albeit I knew many. This enter¬
tainment lafted fo long, that at length, the hour of our departure being arrived,
1 returned to GeneuaybuK. fo fad and nielancholick, that to conceal my unquietnefs
from my'Father, I refolved not to fee him .all that evening: I retired then to ray
chamber as foon as I was come home,and gave my people order to fay,that finding
my felf fomewhat ill I was gone to bed, having firft exprefly charged them to make

ihat 1 fpentthereft of the night in thinking on the means to execute it; but the
m&lt;.i e I confidered this enterprize, the more 1 judged it, impollible ; the   arrogant
hunuur of Rhodolpho, and the generofity of my father, fcemed two obftacles very
difiiailt to be forced ; but that which put me into further defpair, was the thought
that IjaL'clia her felf would be inflexible to my Love: For, faid 1, is.it polfiblep
that a maid, who hath been brought up with the hate ofthe Juflimanoesy who no
fooner op-ned her eyes, but ihe beheld my houfe as her cnemie, can refolve, I do
III It fay, to love, but only to indurc that I (hould adore her.    Thefe divers agitati¬
ons troubled me in fuch fort, as I could not form any defign;  but whereas love
cannot fubfift without hope, I think that in the end I had furmounted my paffion,
and broken my chain.":, if that fatality which will have me ruined, had npt expofed
mc once again to a new danger.    I was fcarcely out of my bed, when as my peo¬
ple told me, that I was invited to the Wedding of one of my Fathers friends, who
wastolu iiKuied to amaidallied to Ifabella y this news filled me with extreme
joy, and preparing to go thither, I took more care of my felf, than ever I had
iliji'c in all my life before: But being refolved to fee the arrivall of mine enemy, I
got mc ill good time to the place appointed for the Ball;   1 was no longer there
than to make the compleiuents, which are ufuall in fuch like occafions, whcnas I
faw IfibelLi enter with fuch a dazeling M.ajefty, as impofed filence to all the compa¬
ny, and it feemcd that (he had infpired every one with modefty and refpeft.    After
that this dumb admiration had continued a while, there was a confufed noife heard
of aicLunationsand piaifes, which were given to her beauty; and the truth is
that envy it felf could not find any thing in her to be amended. She hath a ftature
f o ad\ antagious, and a port fo majefticall, as never was there woman feen of a bct-
tcrprelence. Herhair is of colour brown, but fo beautifull, as all thofe threads
&lt;.)f bmnifhedgold, wherewith our Poets ufe to defcribe fuch, cannot reprefent
them; they fell that day carelefly upon her cheeks, and thence defcended in thick
curls down her neck and bofoni, but with a negligence fo repleniftied with addrefs
that It defaced the handtomert curiofity of all the women ofthe Affembly.    She
h.nth a complexion fo white and vive, as there is no whitenefs that feems not fal-
ou iinto It; but the (ame is mingled with fo dainty a Carnation, whirh is ftied a

<p>yet arc her looks fo modeft, and fo far from all artifice, as it is very eafie to know
that they are innocent of all the evills which they make one endure.   She hath a
mouth neither too great nor too litde, butfo compofed, and of fo Vermilion a
hew, as there is no corrall that comes neer it.   Her teeth arc fo evenly fet, and fo
white, as never were fmiles fo full of charms as hers; and her bofom fo delicate
and fo comely, as imagination cannot reprefent it to it fclf fuch as it is: There
is alfo a gracefulnefs mingled amongft all thefe marvclls, which cannot be expreft,
and which renders her more amiable than all that which I have delivered. To
conclude, be it for the whole form of the face, or for all the features of it in par¬
ticular, or for the air in  generall, it is the moftperfeft beauty that ever Nature
produced.    But, my Lord, had the fouldiers that took me, left me the  pifture
which I had of her, and the Letters which flie had written to me,  I could have
made thy Highnefs fee the truth of my words, and that the graces of her mind do
no whit give place to thofe of herbeauty: It was then, my Lord, that Ifabella
withall thofe allurements, appeared in that Affembly.    She was apparelled in a
Gown of Carnation Sattin, imbroidered with gold and pearls, whereof the fleeves
werebuttonedup with great Diamonds; the reft of her habit was of cloth of fil¬
ver, imbroidered with Pearls and Emeraulds intermixt. She appeared fo charming
unto me in this eftate, as I could not for all that evening take mine eyes from oti
her; and as I carefully obferved her, me thought fhe perceived that 1 did not be¬
hold her asancnemie, and to render my joy yet more accompliflied, I marked
how fhe blufhed every time that we met together in the fame Brawl, but in a fa(hi-
on which perfwaded mc, that it was neither for hate, nor for anger.    And where¬
as it is the cuftom of Genoua not to converfe with the women of an Affembly, but
in leading them to dance, I took out oneof mykinfwomen, whom I had feen all
the evening with Ifabella, and that I might oblige her to fpeak to me of her, I faid
unto her, that I found it very ftrange fhe fhould hold fuch intelligence with mine
enemy; but without giving mc leave to finifli my fpeech, flie anfwered me that the
talk they had together wasfo ad vantagious for me,   as I had no reafon to com¬
plain of it; and that as the praifes which arc given us by our enemies, are more
glorious for us, than others, becaufe they cannot be fufpefted of flattery, I was no
longer to doubt of my good meen and addrefs, fince Ifabella her felf had judged
of it in favour of me, upon fpeaking of the grace and dancing of every man of
the Company.    This difcourfe ravifhed me in fuch fort, as I could not forbear
looking on Ifabella, as if I would thank her for fo favourable a judgement; and as
fhe hath a quick and piercing wit, fbe knew both by my demeanor and joy, that
mykinfwomanhad given me an account of their talk, which poffeft her with fo
much confufion, as it was impoffiblc for me all the reft of the evening to incounter
her eyes. At length, my Lord, the company being feparated, I returned home, but
fo full of joy and hope, that my reafon found not it felf any longer ftrong enough
to oppofc my paffion.    But not to ftand on the recitall ofthefe firft proceedings
of my affeftion, wherewith I have already but too much importuned thy H'ghnefs,
it will fuffice to let thee underftand, that in the continuance of this happinefs I
{■i.v^ Ifabella in two or three Affemblies more, from whence 1 alwayes went ftill
better fat isfied; and after I had beenfo hardy, as to write divers times unto her,
and ready enough to finde the means to do it, I knew at length that my vows were
notrejefted, and that my temeritie ftiould not be punifhed.   I obtained then the
permiffion to ferve her, provided I were difcreet, and that neither by my .aftions,
nor by my difcourfe, I fliould give any caufe of fufpefting our intelligence : I ob¬
ferved this order foreligioufly, that albeit there paffed not a day wherein I faW
her not at her window, or an evening wherein I had not a Letter from her, or (he
from me, yet was no body ever aware of our commerce.    And to render my
good fortune more accompliflied, it hapned that the people being fallen into a mu-
tinie in the Ifle of Corfca for fome Contribution that fliould have been eft'bliftied

i.reffed me to tell him, whether his prefencc would not be neceffary for me there,

olence wherewith 1 fpake to him, that I was too far ingaged in this defign to be

<p>fo raviflied to hear her, that notvvithlfanding the defire 1 had to fpeak to her, yet
would I not interrupt her,  though I infinitely feared left fhe (hould be called away
before I had been feen of her; but in the end the fruition of a prefent pleafure
prevailed over the fear cf an uncertain evill. I heard her then with all the admi¬
ration  I was capable of:   For, my Lord, flie hath a voice fo ftrong, fo clear, fo
fweet, and fo chaniiing, as flie infpires the minds of thofe that hear her, with
the fame paffions which flie cxpreffeth by the airs flie fings; and vvhereas night and
filence are the friends of Mufick, there refted nothing more to make my content¬
ment perfeft, thantoaddeto the delight of hearing, that of feeing diftinftly: I
was not kng without enjoying that happinefs, for the Moon, which had been a
pretty while up before, made an end of diftipating of the fbadow that had reign¬
ed all over the Garden, and in rendring me that good office , flie made me alfo
to be perceived of her, fothat fhe prefently gave over finging, and approached to
the place where I was, but with fo much circumfpeftion, and fo much fear, as
made me greatly to pitty her.    She prayed  me with a trembling voice to give
her a Letta' if I had any, and that the next day, if I would let her down a Ifrine,
fbe v;ould faffen her anfwer to it.    After I had laboured to affure her as much as
poffibly I could, fhe made me to underftand, that we could not have any long con¬
verfation in that fame place without being difcovered, becaufe if we fpake foftly
it wculdbc unprofitable unto us, not being able to hear one another; and if we
raifed our voices,it were to be feared that we fhould be over-heard from a clofe ally
that was not far off.    I confented then to be contented with feeing her, and recei¬
ving her Letters by the way fhe had propounded unto me; but whereas I had my
defign concealed, I befought her to tell me in what part her lodging was, tothe
end i might atleaffwife have the pleafure to imagine to my felf the place where'
fhe would be writing.    But before fhe anl'wered me, fhe looked round about, to
obferve whether fhe might not be over-heard ; after which fhe demanded of me,
if I did not fee on my  left-hand a Turret athwart the trees, which was joyn-*
ing to the end of a Gallery, that made up one front of the Garden, and that an¬
fwered to another altogether like imto it &gt; and having told her that I faw it, flie
added that her chamber was of an even floor with that fame place; and that the
perron of it was juft againft the end of the clofe alley, from whence flie feared to
DC over-heard ; and that if I would advance forth my head a little, I might fee
the grateof her window.    As foon as flie had faid this, (he went away, having
firft affured me, that fuch evenings as flie could not come her felf to receive my
Letters, fhe would fend a mayd to me that lay in her chamber, in whom flic
abfolutely confided.    Afi:er ftie was retired, and clean out of figbc, I went pre¬
fently and found out my friend, to whom I gave an account of our conference.
But, my Lord, feeing I muft obey thy Greatnefs, in recounting afl my adventures
unto thee,  I muft fay, that after I had been three or four dayes obedient to/-
fabellaes   pleafure ,   one evening flie fent me that mayd which flie made ufe
of,  with   a Letier, defiring rae tp cxcufe her if flic came not her fclf ;  for
that being fomewhat ill in the morning ,  (he could not invent a pretext  to
obtain permiffion to come  into the Garden according to  her cuftom.    This
news grieved   nie exceedingly, and fo throughly confirmed me in my defigrt,
that to execute it, 1 enquired -whether Ifabella were retired to her chamber ? The
mayd told mc, that flie had left her at her window, ftaying till flie returned, which
ftie was inftantly to do, becaufe the doors would fuddenly be fliut, for the keys
were to be c.nried to her mother, who had commanded that to be cxaftly obferved.
I threw her down my Letter then, and having difmiffed her, I wentand defired
Dorta toaffift rae in the rcfolmjoni had taken to defcend into the Garden.    He
did all that he could to hinder me from if, but after I had told him, that lex-
pofcd my felf to no danger, feeing that Rodolpho was not there, that Julia was
fick, and that in conclufion, I fliould enter into an houfe where there were none
but fleeping Women,  the reft of the train being at Genoua, or gone with Rhodolpho-
1 entreated him that he would cnly attend forme at the window, to the end
that if by ill fortune I were feen, I might fave my felf before they had time to open

hat it " vas fliut, but yet I believed that IfabelU was not gone to bed, and that my

whereas 1 feared nothing in this enterprife btit Ifabelaes ^ifpleafure, I never
thought of mine own fafety, howbeit Dona made me take a brace of^ Pittols, and
wy f^word with rae, whereupon I defcended into the Garden, and calling to mind
that the clofe alley was correfponding to//^^.//^^Hodging, I went along through
it, forfearof being perceived, either frora the Gallery, or the mothers chamber ;
when 1 was arrived at the end of the alley, I obferved that there was no light '"
all that Turret, but in one window that had a grate, which I imagined to be Z/^-
hellaes Cabinet; 1 approached thereunto then as foftly as poftibly I could, and
vhcreasthc window was low, 1 might eafily fee all that was done in the room
throm-h the glafs, fo that I perceived Ifabella, but with fo much grace in the negli¬
gence wherein 1 faw her, as 1 knew well, that art added nothing to her beauty. She
was leaning on her left elbow upon a little table, where my letter lying open be¬
fore her, file had her eyes fixed on it, whilft Feliciana (fo was the mayd that ferved
l;er c.iUcd) undoing of aftring thattyed up her headgeer, covered her almoft all

(, lived -a. write unto me firft. Ic were better, faid I unto her, pufliing the cafement
that was not (but, that you would grant me the honor to entertain you awhile.
She vv.isio furprifed with feeing me in that place, a? flie could not forbear fcreek-
ingout, whereupon (he would have palled into her chamber, but not able to open
the door thereof (b quickly, 1 had leafure to tell her, that if fhe put me into de¬
fpair, 1 was apt enough to kill my felf before her window :   She fell down then
upon thecufliions notable to fpeak, which gave me time to crave pardon of her
for myboldncis; I befought her to remember the difcretion I had always ufed
lincc ihedaylhe had permitted me to ferve her ; that this was the onely difordei:
whereunto mypaffionhad carried rae; and that iffhe would take the pains to con-
fider ir, [be would not jndge this fault irrcmiffible.    Do you believe then, faid flie,
in approaching tothe window, that to put my glory and your life in hazard is a
crimcof fhiall importance &gt; But at length, after I had made her to comprehend, '
th.at there was lefs danger in fpeaking with her, when all the World was retired,
than at fiich time as flie of her goodnefs had granted me, I got her to confent, that
from thenceforward I fliould alwaies fee her in that fort.   Our conference was
fo long, as the awaking of the birds made me know, that it was time to let her go
to fleep; but before I left her flic gave me her pifture, which flie had drawn in imi-
taturc,  by beholding her felf in a glafs; for this divine perfon is skilfull in all ex¬
cellent Arts and Sciences: .'^he alfo permitted me to kifs her through the grate, a
favour which 1 may well fay, was the onely privacy that ever fl?e accorded me du¬
ring all the nights which I have paft in entenaining of her.   1 withdrew then

by fome way unknown to me, one evening, as I was alone with my fword under
Ifabellaes Window, he came thundring upon me, with eight men armed, in fuch
fury , aslhadjiardly the leafure to put my felf into defence ; now though it was
very dark,    yet chanced I to know him, and thereupon refolved, rather to be

therefore  but ward the blows which he laid at me; but tvvo of his advancing to¬

ceiving any more than two vvoands, which I got becaufe I would not ftrike Rho"

for a fuccour that arrived unto me. And confider, my Lord, the ftrangenefs ofmy

<p>chance into the ftreet where he was fet upon.   Rhodolpho was fo raviftied with this
difcourfe, as he could not forbear imbracing me,   and faying alowd,  that as the
confervation of his honor was more dear unto him, than that of his life,  the care
I took to deface the ftain  which he had made in it, obliged him more ftreightly,
than the blood I had fhed to fave his. As I would have anfwered, he ttayed me, and
went away to give order for all that he thought was neceffary,  both for his fafety,
and mine. And whereas D«'/. dwelt not far off,   he came not long after into the
chamber where 1 was, but fo furprifed, and fo amazed , to hear that 1 was woun¬
ded, to fee me in Rhedolphoes houfe, and to find Jftbella and Julta fiting by my beds
fide, that he was a long time in a doubt, whether   he was well awake, or no. Rho¬
dolpho, having been advertifed that he was arrived, came and entertained him with
fo much civility, and fpake fo advantagioufly of me, as I was conttrainedtopray
him to change his difcourfe ,   and to think rather of the neccffity of our affaires,
than of praifing me unjuftly. Doria was inftrufted then in the eftate of things,and of
our intentions; .RWo//)/jo defired him to tell my father,   that he would have gone
home to him , if 1 had not hindred him, to crave pardon for all that had paft be-
t wixt them, and to intreat him to think well of it, that his daughter might be the
reward of the combat, which I had fo happily undertaken for his defence; how
he was not ignorant, that Ifabellahid been more equall than  he, in eftecming of
me as foon as ftie knew me ; and that for him he was not fo ill informed of my dc¬
figns, but that he had been advertifed of thofe which I had for his daughter; in
the end fo to do, faid he to Deria, that the Families of the Jujlimanoes and the Gr/-
maldies may be united with an indiffoluble knot: More than this I have not to
fay, Lodovico knowes the Nobility of my Houfe, undcrftands the riches of it, and
cannot doubt but thatthe Principality of Monacoviill one day be Ifabellaes. Do¬
ria ovomifed to imploy all his addrefs to make the matter fuccecd according to
our defires. ^o^o/p^if inftantly requcftedhim, I earncftly conjured him, ind Ifabella
with her eys only intreated him thereunto. He went then to my Father,who was fo
furprifed with every thing that ror/4 imparted unto him,as he divers times asked
of him,whether he had not loft his underftanding:what,faid he,as I knew afterw.irds
by Por/.j in one very hour hath my fonne faved the life of his enemy? hazarded
his own by the wounds which he hath received &gt; killed the enemy of Rodolphot
made peace between the Juflinianoes and the Grimaldi es ? and for a conclufion, hath
Ifabella and the Principality of Monaco been offered him by Rhodolpho &gt; No , no ,
Doria, all that you tell me is far from alllikelyhood ; you talk tome of blood,
of murther, of flaughter, of reconciliation, and nuptials all at once; how doc
you think that I can accord all thefe things, and can joy and grief be compatible?
But in the end, my Lord, that firft tranfport being over, Doria affured the matter fo
ferioufly untohim, as he was conftrained to make no longer doubt of it.   I con¬
fefs that in this incounter I was more happy than I hoped ; for as foon as my fa¬
ther was periwaded to this truth,  Deria found his mind in the terms that I defi¬
red. 1 think, my Lord, Ihave already told thy Highnefs, hovi ledovico never ap¬
proved of that unjuft hatred, which paffeth with  the fucceffion ofKinfmen, and
that was the reafon why he was fo eafily carried to what I wiflied.  He came then
accompanied with Dor;.? and fome of his fervants; tothe houfe of Rhodolpho,-who
received him with a free and open countenance, and with fuch ftrong proteftations
of acknowledgement and amity, as it was eafie to obferve, that his eyes and his

hee  held   it  fuperfluous   to ask   my advice in a matter  that was   fo   glo¬

faidhe, taking/A^(f//&lt;«by the hand, it ison you that the conclufion of this im¬

by ihat fliamefaftneft, which madehertoblufii and be filent; the modefty of her
lex, and of her difpofition not permitting her to teftifieher joy, but in fuch a man¬
ner.    Rhodolpho and my father then promifed an inviolable friendfhip one to ano-
ther,and ordained us to do the like in their prefence;  and for a gage of this pro¬
mifc, Lodovico, who ordinarily wore a rich ring on his finger, took it to me for to
give to Ifabella, as a pledge of the faith which we had promii'cd to each other,    i
obferved this ceremony with Ad much pleaftire, as fpight of my miferies and hurt
I never felt the like before, nor fince ; but at length, after this happy  accord , they
retired into another chamber to think ofwhat they fliould do : My Father was
of the opinion^ as well as Rhodolpho, that he fliould (end to make his complaint as
foon as the Concell (liould be affembled ; bit that he held it not fit eidier for him
or me to ftay in his houfe; that die Family of the SpinUois were powerfull enough
to keep themfelves from having any manifei^ injuftice done them;   and that albeie
their kinfnian had been the agreffor in that fight, yet the Laws Wonld have the
dead always to be favoured ,  and that he which had killed any one fliould be al¬
ways puniflied; thatforthis reafon he was to retire to his Principality of Mona-
c&lt;7, where he .Slight attend fafely and coramodioufly the fticcefs of things; th^tc
place being in a fitu.ition foadvantagious, and fo well fortified, as it could keep
outaRoyallArmy; that as for me, I fliould finde an  inviolable faftuary in the
Army of the Emperor Charles, whom I had aheady ferved;  but whereas I Was
not in an eftate to travell, by reafon of my wounds, which peradventure would
keep rae a long time in my bed; and for that alfo he could not go out of the Ci¬
ty prefently, becaufe the gates were ftitit, he advifed that without further delay
and before the day appeared,,  I ftiould   be tranfported into   fome other houfb!
whereof the Mafter wasfo much rcfpefted, as no violence might be feared there
RhoMpho and Doria approved of thispropofition, and began to bethink them what

troubled about it, for that the Palace of Smibaldo, Count of Lavagna, chief of
thcFannly of the F../^«.., would be an affured retreat for them • that the high

<p>doubted that fome   urgent matter had brought him thither ;   wherefore he de¬
manded of him, whether he were fo happy as to be able to ferve him ?    Then my
father recounted unto him in few words all that had befallen mc , wherewith
he was fo ftrangely furprifed; but without giving him leave to make his rcqueft
he to told him ,   that he was too blame in not caufing him to be brought to his
houfe. And when my father anfwered him, that he durft not doc it before he had
intreated him thereunto,   Simbaldo fecmed to be offended with that circumfpefti¬
on, but fince the fault was done, he vvould pardon it upon condition,  that him¬
felf might go and help to convey me thither. And fo calling to his fervants he com¬
manded them to make him ready with all fpeed.   My father did all that he could
to ftay him from going, but could not prevail ,  for Simbaldo told him ,  that the
Spinolaes were violent, and that peradventure meeting them in the ftreet a fecond
misfortune might happen , that when he fliould be prefent with all his train, he
could not believe they would be fo daring, or fo ftroug, as to fet upon us.    My fa¬
ther then confented to what he pleafed, and he being quickly ready,   they parted
inftantly to go to Rhodolpho, who in the mean time had fetled his domeftick affaires.
When Smibaldo was arrived,   and had reprefented to Rhodolpho how glad he was
of our reconciliation, be prayed my father and him to arm all their people, and to
give order for whatfoever was neceffary for the tranfporting of me ,   during the
which he approched to the bed where I lay, exceedingly afflifted to fee them go¬
ing to feparate me from Ifabella, who was withdrawn to the other end ofthe cham¬
ber, when as Sinibaldo entred; but as  foon as he perceived it,  he told me that he
would not deprive mc of an happinefs, which I was fo fuddainly to forego,and that
he ftiould have leafure enough at  home to commend my valor ; that if he durft he
would have defired//.^tf//. to return thither again, but that he thought it fitter to
leave us at liberty together; herewith he went forth without  giving me time to
anfwer him ;   and he was no fooner out ofthe chamber, but putting  by the
curtain I  faw that Ifabella was alone  there  ;    for the confufion ,   wherein
the houfe then was, had fo bwfiedjuliay^ as flic never thought of that civilitie;
1 befought her then to comencarcr unto me, that I might bid her adew ;   at that
word the teares came into her eyes, and my fpeech faTTcd mc ;  fhe came then and
fatedown by my bed fide, with fo much fadnefs painted in her face ,  as much aug¬
mented mine; but after I had info reed my felf to fpeak, I faid unto her; At length,
n\y deareft Ifabella y   fortune hath joyned us,   and fortune doth feparate us,  but
what rigor foever fhe doth exercife towards me,   flie cannot longer keep me from
dying with glory,   now that I have the honor to be yours; (he may indeed feparate
our perfons, and it may be for a long time, but flie cannot difunite our hearts,  if
fo it be true, that your affeftion is anfwerable to mine. You may judge, faid ftie in¬
terrupting me, whether a maid, that hath not feared to offend her glory, in loving
her enemy againft the will of her Parents, be capable of change to a man that expo-
feth his life for her fake,  and to fave her fathers; believe then, and without ever
doubting, that all the powers ofthe earth, oppofed againft my defign, fliall not fo
much as niake mc waver; and that Jfabella will be abfolutely yours,  or never will
be any bodies. Her fighes fuffocated her in fuch fort, as it was impoffiblc for her to
fay more; and as I was about to give her thanks for fo obliging a fpeech , and niin*
gle my teares with hers, Sinibaldo, Rhodolpho, Julia, Doria,   and ray father came a-
gain into the chamber, fo that all I couW do, wasto fay unto her,    wringing her
hand, that fhe fliould alwaies remember her promifes,  and that then flie fhould bo
moft affured ,  that nothing but death fliould feparate us.    Immediately hereupon
they, which had order to carry me away, approched to my bed,   and by the com¬
mandment of Sinibaldo, feated me in a chair, that was prepared for me.   Rhodolpho,
\vho moft tenderly loved his wife, and daughter, began then to bid them farewell:

<p>bad her to come unto me, and give me her hand.    To tell thee, my Lorcl, what I
felt in the moment of our feparation would be impoftible for me,   [ince it is cer¬
tain that 1 had never fo much grief, as I had at that time, in eloigning my felf from
Jfabella, but in the end I was to refolvc for it ;   and after I had kiffed her hand
without   fpeaking to  her   but with my eyes,    I was carryed away,   fo loftj
as I do not remember the order that we held in the ftreetes ;   howbeit I was told
afterwards, that Simbaldo divided his men into two parts j and that I was placed
in the midft of them, where Rhodolpho and Doria had in charge not to abandon me,
whatfoever fliould arrive; Simbaldo put himfelf into the head ofthe Troop,   and
my lather marched in the rear, to the end that on what fide foever they were af-
faulted, a man of command and courage might ftill be there.   But whereas the
Spinolaes knew not that we were retired to Rhodolphoes houfe,  they never thought
of lying in wait for us, fo that we got to Sinibaldoes without any bad incounter ;
After I was laid in bed, he and my father advifed, that it would be eafier for Rho¬
dolpho to get away to Monaco as foon as it was day, than if he ftayed longer, be¬
caufe his enemies had not had leifure yet to think and confider of all, that might
hurt, or help them ; to that purpofe they judged it fit to difgnife him like a Mari¬
ner, and to put him into a Feluca, which might eafily carry him to that place of
fafety. KWo//'^o confented to whatfoever they thought good, and Simbaldo took
upon him the care of difpatching the bufinefs: He fent then to the Port as foon
as day began to appear, to hire a Feluca, upon condition it fliould part prefently j
and that the Mafter of it fhoifld lend one of his habits ; the moiiey which was offe¬
red to this man, was fo much, as raviftied with this incounter,  and without fur¬
ther inquiry, he faid that he was ready to part,   and that for one of his habis he
would lend it, fo as he might be permitted to goe home to his houfe,  becaufe he
had none there. He that made the bargain agreed he fhould do fo ,   but for fear he
fhould difcover any thing he would goe with him. The Mafter ofthe Feluca, who
thought of nothing but his gain, was contented with it; away they went together
to fetch that habit, and that done, he left that man in the guard of one of his fel-
lowcs, whom he had brought thither with him, and came and rendred an account
of his voyage. Immediately i?/jWo/;)/?o difguifed himfelf^,  and feeing it prettyfar
day he took his leave of Simbaldo and my father, who both of them promifed him
to doe in his name all that they had refolved on, and whatfoever elfe they judged
would be requifite to procure li is liberty.   Lodovico and   heflieWed fo much gene¬
rofity in this feparation,  and  fpake fo obligingly one to another,   a% Sinibaldo
could not forbear telling them, that Spinola could not have been loft more profi¬
tably for the Common-VVealth , feeing his death had ferved to make two fo great
and excellent men become friends. When they had anfwered to this civility, J^^o-
&lt;io//&gt;^o came to me, withfo much kindnefs , and fuch teftimony of acknowledge¬
ment and friendftiip, as I was fenfibly touched therewith: He affured me once agaim
with oathes, that his daughter ftiould be the reward ofthe blood which I had ftied
for h im, provided I did not change my refolution.  The weaknefs wherein I was,
did not keep me from rendring  him thanks, as I ought,   forfo obliging a dif¬
courfe; but at length he went away to find out the Mafter  that waited for him:
Simhaldo did notlct him go without a guard ; he caufed fix of his fervants to fol¬
low him aloof of, and he himfelf went to the Port for to fee him part. Rhodolpho
wasfoforttinate,   that   he croft throughtheCity withoutmeetink any one that
knew him; he irabarqued himfelf then with all poffible fpeed,   and in a little time
arrived lafcfy at Afo».f„, where he was received by his fubjefts with joy. ' As foon
asthcCouncellwasfet, they  vvould have complained inKhodolphoesname^bnt
they found themfelves prevented by the fpacc of a quarter of an hour onely . and
that the father of him whomlhad killed,   had accufed me for the death of his
lonne: for though our fight was in the night, yet was I known by my voice    and
the followers of him that was flain had marked ,  hovv he and I were ineased in

<p>inveterate hatred which was between the lujltniames and the Grimaldies, they could
not comprehend how I fliould be induced to fight for mine enemy.  As they wer9
in this pain, my Father prefented himfelf to demand juftice of them for the vio¬
lence had been done me, and to colour the matter he told them ,  that paffin^ by
chance along the ftreet, I had feen Sptnola fet upon Rhodolpho with fo much advan¬
tage, as my generofity not able to indure it, I prcfendy refolved to labour the hin-
dring of that mifchief, or if I could not, to fide with the weaker party, as I have
done; that in this occafion I had been dangeroufly hurt; that neverthelefs know¬
ing the power of the Spinolaes, and fearing left the Senate fliould be raifinformed
of the truth of the matter, I had abfented my felf till fuch time as jufticc was done
me.    My Father made this difcourfe with fuch earneftnefs, and fo advantagioufly
for Rhodolpho, as ifwas eafie to difcern that he was no longer his enemy.    But
whereas the affair was important, in regard it concerned three ofthe principall
Families of the City, they refolved nothing for the prefent, but referred the mat¬
ter to the next day, with order notwithftanding to the Spinolaes to caufe their wit-
neffes to be examined the day following.    This news was inftandy fpread over all
the City, with fo much admiration and aftonifhment, as no body could believe
it the firft time they heard it; contrarily all thofe of Genoua faid openly, how it
could not poffibly be, for that the hatred which  paffeth fucceffively into the minds
of men cannot be extinguifhed in a moraent,and that by confequence it was net cre-
diblc,that I could pafs from one extremity to another in an inftant,and that I fhould
render to the greateft of mine enemies all that the deareft ofmy friends could expeft
from me.But as nothing can be long conccalcd,it was quickly known,that love had
begot friendfliip,and that the paffion which I had for Ifabella,was the noble caufe of
this adventurcTn the mean time the whole Common-wealth w^as divided; and al¬
though the faftion of Simbaldo were the ftionger and moft confiderable, and that
it was abfolutely for us, yet could it not hinder the palling of an exprefs order for
the fearching out, and apprchenfion of us.    And whereas the dead party is al¬
wayes regarded, all the grace we could obtain was, that the  affair fhould not be
precipitated, and that it fliould be prolonged as much as the forms of Jufticc
would permit. Whilft things paft in this manner, I wrote every day to ifabella,
who anfwered me with fo much wit and fweetnefs, as I could not be but happy
in theconftraint wherein I lived.  Butat length my wounds being cured, I was a-
ihamed to remain fliut up in a houfe at  a time wherein I might make ufe of my
courage, and fhewmy Judges that I was not a man to be caft away; howbeit I
felt an extreme violence for the executing of this refolution ; for though I were
deprived of the fight of Ifabella, as well within Genoua, as if Ihadbecn faaher
ofl^ yet found I for all that fome content, in thinking that we were within the iu-
clofure of one and the fame City ; but fenfe was to give place unco reafon , and I
wasto follow the will of 7/".^*//., which ferved much to make mc depart the ra¬
ther, for knowing the violence of my paffion, flie imagined that being thoroughly
well, I would have much adoe to keep my fclf from ftcaling unto her fome even¬
ing, according to the propofition I had made her to that purjpofc; fo that to a-
void the mifchief that might arrive to me thereby , ftie preffed my departure: I
propounded it to my Father, who approved of it; the difficulty was to get forth of
&lt;;f»o«4 without danger; hut whereas Smibaldo never found any thing difficult to
ferve his friends, he told us, that he had an infallible means for to do it; that I
fliould but only get me in the night to his Galley, which being ready to fet fail,
to go and joyn'withthe Squadron of Corfica y fliould for my occafion take the
courfe of SeflroyViherel ftiould be received as in a place that depended on him,
and from thence I might eafily go to Ligome in aTartana.    This order was cx¬
aftly obferved, but before my departure 1 defired to confer with Doria in private;
I conjured him then totake a fpeciall care to fend me news of Ifabella, as often
as poffibly he could; and that he fliould not fail to write me punftually even the
leaft things that concerned her.    Dona promifed to fatisfie ray defire all that he

conclude, ray Lord , I can tell by long experience, that thy Greatnefs hath ex¬
traordinary lights for all that may be comprehended by a h-imane  fpirit ; and
it is out of this knowledge, that I have have not explaned my felf more at large
in many places of my narration, which certainly arc not intelligible in all the ex¬
tent of thy Empire, but which cannot be ignored by the moft knowing, the moff
mighty, and the moft viftorious Monarch of the World.    Soliman, not able
longer to endure thefe praifes, given him by I bi^ah tm, fayd unto him fmiling,
that hee had not permitted him to fpeak, but onely of his Adventures, and
that to obey him exaftly, he was to purfue his dilcourfe without flattering him.
The Baffa,  returning no other anfwer, butalowobeyfance, continued the courfe
of his Hiftory in this fort: Icame then my Lord, to the Emperor of theChriffians,
vvho received nie, 1 dare fay^ with jcy and kindnef5;he rcmcmbred ftill the fervices
I   had  him,   and in  confideration thereof vvould have given me imploymenc

was rather well affured, that if my bufinefs was difpatchcd at Genoua, I fhould
inftantly be gone, I excufed my felf the beft I could, and went and ferved amongft
the Voluntiers.   I lived then after this manner without any other unquietnefs,
than what abfencc brings along with it, which though it be fomewhat harfli to a
man that is paffionately inlove, yet tollerable tome through the pleafure that
I had done in receiving Letters from//.^&lt;?//.t : but I was not long in this conditi¬
on ; for three moneths aft:er my departure  I underffood the de?.th of Rhodolpho-^ I
knew that y«/;. and her daughter  were at Monaco; and to take all comfort fro n^
nie, my father wrote me, how that allthe grace that could be obtained of the Se¬
nate, was the banifliing of me for ever from all the Territories of the Repub-
ru^uc, and that upon pain of lofing my head if I were found in any part of them.
I ;cccivcd the news with fo muchangUifliof mind, as I thought I fliould have dy¬

that I would alwaies very exaftly follow her direft ions; that I befought her for
all that to confider, how I could not do better, feeing flic could not difpofe of her

we might live and reft in fafety; that theSpmolaes were not powerfull enough to
raife an Army for to fet upon us there, and that the Republique would not of a

change the order of things; that fometimes fentences had been revoked lefs uniuft
than that which baniftied me, and for men that were not of the family of the
Jufimiamesy and that peradventure were not more profitable for the publique
good : In the end I did all that I could to obtain permiffion to come unto her • I
wrote alfo unto Jultay with fo much refentment of thatlofs, which was more con¬
fiderable tome, than it was grievous unto her. Asfor my father, I fent him word
that I would buy out my liberty with my blood, being refolved to perform fuch
brave things in the Wars, as my Judges, and mine enemies themfelves ffiould wifh

<p>him, I prayed him to foUicite y«//Vi, whenhertcars wercdryedup, toaccomplifh
Rhodolphoes promifc. For Doriay I conjured him again to be carefull in curioufly
informing himfelf whether Ifabellaes mind were as firm in this incounter as ffi-
had made me hope it would be ; for I well forefaw, that J«/z., who, notwithftand¬
ing our reconciliation, had never loved mc, would bring fome obftacle to my de¬
fign. After 1 had difpatched away my pacquet, I remained in fo extraordinary
an unquietnefs, that I could not fettle my mind on any objeft, but fuch, as being
ingenious to perfecute me, offered every minute to my thoughts the image of a
new misfortune; but how intentive foever it was, I could not forefee that which
arrived unto me. As I was in this deplorable eftate, 1 underftood by a Letter from
Doria, that my father being infinitely affliftedfor my banifliment, was dead of a
Feaver, the veryfameday thathe wrote this to me; and that to fecure his eftate
unto me, he had paft it over to the Count of Lauagna, who queftionlefs would con-
ferve it faithfully for me. I muft confefs, my Lord, that the lofs fo fliaked my con¬
ftancy, as it was ready to fail, and I proved in this occafion, that theapprehen-
fionsof Nature are more powerfull than all others; and to leave no place for
me to doubt of it, I had almoft forgot/p^f/^^ in this my firft tranfport; but af¬
ter that reafon had combated with grief, and that I was able to look upon my di-
ftemper with a Calmer eye, I found it yet far greater than at firft I had believed it
to be : I faw all at once, both the lofs of my Father, and that too of my Miftris;
no way doubting but that it would be hard for me to carry Julia to that I defired,
there being no body now that had any intereft to make her keep her word. Cer-
t tin dales after this fad news I received onely a ticket from//.^f///», wherein con¬
trary to her cuftom I perceived fome confufion, with an abfolute command not
to hazard my felf as yet to come to Monaco, becaufe her mother had told her, that
having much wealth inGenoua, flie would give fome order to her affairs, for fear
of lolnig it, if flie fliould fofoon receive rae into her State and alliance; after this
fhe made me a proteftation of fidelity, but in fuchtearms, as made me judge that
fhe hadnotexpreffed all her thoughts: Yet was it not this ticket, that begot my
difpair and my fury ; a Letter from Dw., which I had received the fame way,
cleared this anigma moft cruelly for me ; by it I learned, that the Prince of Maf-
feran, whofe ftate is fituate between Piedmont, Montferrat, and the MUlanefe , being
imbarqucd at nlia-Frnnca to pafs unto Naples, where he had means, and bufine fs,
hid been caught by fo furious a tempcft three Leagues from the Port, thax all the

fdd 1 I will have the fatisfaftion to adore her innocent, or to hate her guilty.
But as'the body and the mind are fb ftraitly allyed together, thatthe one cannot
flitter without the other, I fell fick the very fame day I was to depart, andfovio-
lendy, as the Emperors Phyficians, who by his order vihted me every day, were out
©f hope of faving me ; and verily had I not had a fpark of hope remaining, that
IfabtllayNas not inconftant, Ihadrcfufed all the remedies which vvere given me,
and that were powerfull enough to recover me throughly.    But as if the health of
the body had not been beftowed on me, but for the better fupporting the evills of
the mtnd,l received my deaths wound by a Letter from Doria,vihich gave mS to un-
dcrftandjthat Ifabella had maried the Prince of Ma(feran,and that to put it out of all
doubt, he had learned it from Felicianaes own mputh, who not enduring her
Miftrtffes infidelity, without fliewing her refentment thereof, had been turned
away out of thePrinceffes fervice ; he wrote me alfo, that fince the laftPac-'
quct which he fent mCjhe never had received any news from that inconftant one;that
Julia had made a journy to Genoua a little before that unlucky wedding,without her
daughter in her company,where (he had publiihed that that mariage fliould fuddain¬
ly be folemnifedjthat having been advertifed of it,he had gone to her for to demand
of her,   whether fhe would diflionor her felf in rendring fo little refpeft to the
afhes of her dead hus'band, as to fail the promife which he had made me ? That her
daughter v/as no longer hers, feeing I had bought her with my blood, and the life
of Rhodolpho; that it wiasa payment, and not a grace, which he required of her; and
that at laft he was refolved to carry things to extremity rai^^er than indure to have
this injuftice done me ;  that to all this flie had anfwered peremptorily, how her
daughter fhould never mary a man that wasbaniflied from his Country ,  and that
ifl would have promifc kept with me , 1 fliould come and folicit the performance
of it at GemuA; and that after flie had faid fb, how ffie had left him , and would nor
hear him fpeak aword more. I leave it to thy Highnefs to imagine the deplorable
clhi; e, w hereinto this adventure put me,  it was fo ftrange, that all my paffions re¬
ducing themfelves into one, I had nothing but fury remaining;   and defpairfo
fully feized upon ray foul, as I thought no longer of revenging my felf of Julia ,
nor lelaiting the outrage which I had received from the Prince of Majferan, nor
of punifhing the infidelity of IfabelU, but my defign was wholly then to makea-
way (elf, and to exercife upon mine perfon all the cruelty which the crimes of o-
thershaddeferved. This deadly thought was fo deeply fetled in my heart, as if my
Religion had not with-held me,  I had killed my felf; but at length I refolved to
go and die like a man of courage, and in a place where I fliould never hear IfabelU

<p>named, and where Dona fliould not find mc : I concluded then to pafs into Swetli-
land, whofe King was at that time in War with the Done, with a purpofe to expofe
my felf to fo many perils, as I might dye nobly in fome one of thera; refolving yet
further, that if fortune fliould work a prodigie in preferving me, to go and confine
my felf into the horrid deferts of Finland. I ftole away then fecretly, and without
taking leave ofthe Emperor I  imbarqucd my felf upon the Baltique Sea, where
1 had not been three daies, but they ofthe Veffell,  wherein 1 was, difcovered the
Fleet of that valiant King of Algier, Chairadin Barbarofa,  whom a drcadfull tem-
peft had driven into that Sea.     This incounter gave me as much joy, asitcaufed
tear in them with whom I was; for I verily believed that I fliould foon fet a peri¬
od to my paines, by finding on the Sea that, which I went feeking for on the land :
And whereas I perfeftly fpake the German tongue, I reprefented unto them, that
fince there was nothing left to our choice, but death , or flaverie, being not able
to fly, for that the wind was contrary to us,it was better generoufly to refolve for
die firft ,   thanto fubmit our felves to the other; thatthe lofs of liberty being more
grievous and fhamefLll,than that of life, they were at the leaft to fell it dearly: In the
end, my Lord,! animated them in fuch fort, as againft all apparcnccthey refolved,
not onely to fight, but to goe and boord the firft veffell that fhould advance.  This
refolution was no fooner taken , but   Chairadin loofed two of his Fleet to come
up unto us; when they were within cannon fliot we difcharged one againft another
yvithout much effeft, but fuddainly they feparated themfelves to inclofe us, which
obferved by us we vvould have retired, but the fwifteft ofthe tvvo having fetched
us up, I prefently boorded her; it was there, my Lord,   that I fought againft ray
own good fortune, and that I laboured to lofe a life,   which thou hsft rendred
precious unto rae, in preferving it fince by a goodnefs    that never h.ad example,
and which thy power hath made happy in defpight of the malice ofmy deftinie:
I did then, my Lord, all that I could in this occafion to deprive rae of the honor
of being thy Highnes creature; but fortune, being refolved to fave me, was adverfe
to us, for to be favourable to me; for Chatradm, whon was unwilling to have this
viftory coft him dear,   and that faw well how we fought like defperate men ,
advanced with all his Fleet:  As foon as thofe of our Veffell perceived it,   their
weapons fell out of their hand,   and   I  was he alone that did not render my fclf,
though it be true, that I left not for all that to have the fame fate, for having been
wounded in four places, the lofs of blood weakned mc in fuch fort, as I fell down
1 ike one dead on the hatches; my fwooning lafted fo long ,   that I came not to my
felf again till I had been carried to another Veffell,  where allthe hurt men were
laid;^herel was dreft amongft the reft, and intreated after the fame manner , untill
we came to Algier, where foon  after I was fold to the Baffa Sinan, together with
three hundred others, which were deftined to thy Highnefs; andfo within a few
dayes we were imbarqucd for Conflantinople, where I had the honor to be made thy
flave, and to wear chaines, which have been more glorious to me, than the poffcffi-
cn of an Empire, and which I would alwaies prefer before liberty.  After this, my
Lord, I have nothing elfe to fay unto thy Highnefs  concerning that    which re¬
gards the reft ofmy fortune, feeing it is the work of thy hands,  and that I could
nut bring it again to thy remcHibrancc without offending thy modefty,  knowing
well enough by experience,  that the image of thine own vertties makes thee caft
down thy lookes, and change colour:  I will not tell thee then by what meanes
thdii haft drawn me out of irons   for to raife me up to the greateft commands of
thy Empire, but I will onely fay, that in the midft of this pomp, and of this glory,
I   am  in one day become the mott wretched of men; and not to keep thy Majefty
any loneer in fufpence,   may it pleafe thee to know,  that the generous flave, to

him to ufe him kindly till fuch time as he heard further from him, not kiaowmg
whether his Highnefs did intend to grant him his full liberty. The Sultan then
coramanded him to break his chains ^forthwith, and to prpfecute his difcourfe.
Ibrahim would have fallen on his knees to have tVanked SoUman for thxt grace,
but he not fuffering him injoyned him once again to fatishc his defire;
and therefore cxaftly to obey him, the Baffa continued in this fort. The
triumph being finiffied, I w.as no fooner in my Palace, but I fliut up my felf in my
Cabinet with that dear Slave; I will not tell thee, my Lord, the taking that Dorm
and I were in, fince it is a thing that tuay be more eafily imagined thaafpoken :
Doriaes amazement was fo great to fee me alive, to find me in the habit which i
wear, and to oblerve me in the rank which I hold, as his reafon above an hundred
times gave his eyes the lie : As for me, I was no lefs furprifed to fee him at Con-
fiantinonle, and to imbrace him in the habit ofa Slave, than he was to behold im
with a Turbant. Our firft motions of joy being over, I confefs, my Lord, that my
firft thought was for Ifabella; well now, faid I unto him, my dear Doria, hath the
Prince of Mafferan triumphed over all my hopes , and hath he rendred himfelt
poffeffor of an happinefs which he did not deferve, and which I thought I had
been Mafter of? 1 had not fo foon made an end of fpeaking, when as Doria fell to
demand pardon of me, to accufe himfelf o^ too much precipitation, to Commend
the conftancy of Ifabella,and to blame my defpair ; but becaufe this-difcourfe was
ot^fcure, I requefted him to clear it unto me : Whereupon he told ma, that Juli4
Vi/as no longer amongft the number of the living that the Prince of Majferajt waa
dead, at\d that IfabelU was never his wife ; but to particularize this unexpefted
event, thou mayeft be pleafed to underftand, that as ibon as Julia perceived the
PriHcc of Maferans love to IfahlU, ihe refolved, leeing the authority:'wholly ia
her felf by the dcith of her husband, to make that fecret hatred (hz had alwayes
born me to flafli out; whereunto alfo may be added, that this woman being ambi¬
tious, it may be the Title of a Soveraign blinded her, and carried her to that cru¬
ell defign of dcftroying all our pleafures; to attain the more eafily thereunto, ftie
thought It would be fit utterly to break off our commerce, which was not very
hard for her to do, for Monaco is feated onthe height of a great Mountain, almoft
macceffible on the three fides; the other which looks to the Sea is fo fteep, as one
cannot behold It without horror; there refts then bat one winding way which
ieadethto the Port, fo that whereas this Town hath but one onely avenue, and
hath alwayes a Garrifon in it, it was eafie fpr her to keep the Princefs-from recei¬

<p>juliavjasto perfwade every one that this mariage was acconipliffied, tothe end
that if 1 were advertifed thereof, I might be capable of fome extreme refolution,
either upon mine own perfon, or on that ofthe Princes, or on hers, which i could
not execute without going into a place where I fliould lofe my head if I were
found there. This defign wasfo well carried, that all they of Monaco beleeved
it themfelves, and made others to bcleeve it. This univerfall error, it may be, had
not for all that been faftned on Doria, if Julia had not taken a particular care to
make him bcleeve what all the world beleeved; and indeed to fpeak the truth, no
body could have exempted himfelf from this impofture : For this woman, having
fuborned Feliciana with gifts and great hopes, made a ffiew of chafing her away
with violence, and to make the matter be publiffied the better, fhe fent her back
to Genoua, where fhe was no fooner come but ffie repaired to Dona all in tears. I
think thy Highnefs remembers, that this mayd had alwayes been Jfabellaes con(i-
fident, thou wilt not find it ftrange then if P^'/rf did not doubt of her difcourfe,
when the affured him with a feigned forrow, that the Prince of Majferaa ha¬
ving maried the Princefs with her own confent , and not being able to forbear
telling her of the promifes which fhee had made to mee , ihe had been ill-
intreated both by the Mother and the Daughter , vvho had driven her a-
way outragioafly. It was by this artifice, my Lord, that Doria was dccei-
vcci; and whereas this newes troubled him, and poffeft him with fury, he
wrote it unto mc as foon as he heard it, as I have already declared unto thy
Highnefs. But this man, whofe high and generous fpirit makes the interefts of
his friends more fenfible to him than his own, underftanding that thePrince of
Majferan was at Genoua, refolved to puniffi him, and revenge me; and for this ef¬
feft he carefully informed himfelf of the place where moft commonly he was, but
fortune, that intermeddles with all things,favoured his enterprife, by Icting him
know, that the day following he was to go and fee the ftately Palace of Andrea
Doriahii nearKinfman, and whereas it was out of the City, he judged this op¬
portunity too advantagious to be negleftcd, imagining rightly thathe would go
thither with little company, fince, as I have before delivered, he viasatGenoua
unknown. The matter failed not to fall out even as he had conceived it; for he
was advertifed that the Prince of Majferan was in this walk attended but with
two of his fervants ; he went forth then fpeedily with the like number, and over¬
taking him in a place where few perfons could be witneffes of his aftion. As
foon as he wasfo near him, as he might fpeak to him, he asked him whether he
knew my name, and whether it were poffible he ftiould be ignorant that Ifabella
could not lawfully be his, becaufe ftie was mine &gt; but fince the thing was done, he
muft at leaft render himfelf worthy of fo noble a conqueft by the lofs of his life,
as I had bought it with my blood; in faying fo they both drew outtheirfwords,
and Dtria without attending the Vrince of M'aferans anfwer, attacqued himfo vi-
gorioufly, as he was conftrained to give ground: They that accompanied him
would have oppofed themfelves to this fury, but they that followed Deria would
not fuffer them fo to do; and whereas they were equall in number, they began a
juft combat, whereof the modefty of my friend kept him from telling me the pai^
ticulars; but in the end, notwithttanding whatfoever the Prince of Ma feran could
perform, the viftory fided with reafon, and Deria, after the receiving of a flight
hurt preffed his enemy with fomuch courage, as he ran him into the body in
four'feverall places, which made him fall down as if he were dead : A minute
after. Nature doing her latt devoir, he opened his eyes, and feeing Doria coming
from parting their followers, and giving order to his help to carry him to
fome place, he had yet fomuch ftrength, as to call him, and before he expired to
crave pardon for the outrage he had done mc, and to pray me to confider the pow¬
er of ICabellaeseyes for theexcufing of his fault; moreover he conjured hmi to
tell methat the Princefs had kept her faith inviolable to me;thcn he acquainted him
in few words with all the violences of her mother, with al the rcfiftances which
flic had made thereunto, and at the laft fwore that he was not he r husband, but that

<p>Julia had ufed this artifice, in hope to make mc away , as I have already told thy
H'ghnefs, not doubting but tlvat if I were dead flic fhould have carried her
daughter to all that flie had defired. Scarcely had that infortunate Prince made an
end of fpeaking,but he dyed in Doriaes armes, who with forrow remitted him int6
the hands of his fervants, to goe and provide for his own fafety; fo that without lo¬
fing time, and before this combat was divulged , he fent to hire a Feluca, and
without raurning into the City he imbarqucd himfelf for Naples ; for
in the uncertainty of the event ofthe combat he had brought mony enough
aboiit him to mak his retreat into that place , and had left a letter in
his Cabinet; which inftrufted one of his friefids With the order hee would
have taken in his affaires. He departed then fafely away in this fort, but the
next day he incountred the Pirate Arfalon, and in the manner, which thy
Highnefs underftood yeftcrday, became to Confiant mo pie .^utmj Lord, to make
all the rigor ofmy deftiny known t6 thy Majefty, I am to tell thee farther, that not
long fince Doria hath met with a flave of Monaco, who hath related unto him , that
as fooon as Julia knew ofthe death ofthe Prince of Majferan, anger and grief feized
fo upon her, as ffie died therewith in a little time; fo that Ifabella, feeing fhe
was Miftrefs of her felf, had fent a man into Germany to defire me to come and take
care of her State, and to receive her perfon for a reward ofmy fidelity : For fhe
knew nothing, cither ofmy jcaloufie, or defpair, which having carried me far e-
iiough frora the place, whither ffie had fent to feek me, beguiled all her hopes, and
deftroyed her felicity, by the fruitclefs return ofhim (he had imployed unto me;
fince that ffie lived in a very auftere and melancholick folitarinefs, faying openly ,
that ffie was refolved to renounce the world, as foori as ffie knew, that I was no
longer in it. And whereas there ran a bruit in Genoua about a year ago, that I had
been feen in Naples, ffie difpatched away this man for to goe and fee if it were foj
having made a vow , if his voyage proved vain, to ffiutherfelf in aCloifferfor
all the reft of her life; but whereas fortune hath never done any but extraodinary
things in ray adventures, ffie fo wrought, that this than, putting himfelf into a
French Barque to pafs over thither, was taken by a Pirate, whofe vefltUs lay under
the covert of a Rock, which is near to a place by the Italians called Torto Hercoles.
And whereas he had a grat number of Slaves, he ftayed not long from going to fell
them at one ofthe Iflarids of the Archipelago, from whence by divers ace ideuts
this man camz to Conflantinople, where Doria by chance knew him , asliavinwac
other times feen him in Rhodolphoes fervice. After all this, my Lord, it^ill hot be
difficult for thy Highnefs to imagine the deplorable eftate wherein Ifind my felf by
thy bounty, and by the propofition which thou haft made me concerning the Sul¬
tana Ajleria. I ffiould not be fo hardy as to fpeak to thcc in thefe'tcrmes,iri did not

to vanquiffithe moft viftorious Monarch ofthe world; and that for this reafoni
may hope to fee thee fenfible of my misfortune, to obtain pardon for my ingrati¬
tude, and to be heard in my juftifications. It is true indeed, that to cxcufe my fault
1 need no more than to befecch thy Highnefs to confider,^ that ifl could even baniffi

<p>Will render my end more profitable and glorious, command rae to feek out death
lUthe midft of thine enemies, audi ffiallnotbe long without teftifying by the lofs
of my life, that lam not ingratefull, but becaufe I cannot be acknowledging.
Andto incenfe thy juft wrath, I will fay further, that the chaftifement, which
I demand, will be inftead of grace to-me, fince that in depriving me of light, I (hall
no longer be fenfible of all the misfortunes wherewith I am fo heavily opprellcd;
1 ffiall ceafe to live, but I ffiall ceafe alfo from being rebellious to thy pleafure • I
fhall reftore the life which 1 ow to the incomparable Afteria ; and I ffiall dye for
the ^ory of Ifabella. In brief, my Lord, fincelcannotbe Aftenaes, becaufe my
love doth oppofe it, and my Religion doth forbid it; and fince I cannot likewiie
live for Ifabella, becaufe my duty do-th tie mc to thy fervice, both by a gencrall
right, and by a particular obligation, death is the onely remedy that remains for
me to get out of fo many miferies. If thy goodnefs had not broken off my fetters
and that 1 were ftill thy flave, now when that I know that the conftancy of Ifabella
hath triumphed over the artifice of our enemies, that I reign ftill in her heart, and
that on me alone her felicity or her happinefs doth depend, I would employ all
my endeavour to free me of my chains by a ranfom : Bur, my Lord, I am tycd to
thee by ftronger bonds; the obligations whereif» I am ingaged to thy Highnefs, the
benefits which I have received from thee, the honours thou haft done me, and the
laft degree of glory whereunto I am mounted, are too certain proofs of thy love,
and of thy confidence, for me not to be retained in my duty: It is then by thefe
facred bands that I amtyedunto thee, and which I cannot break witliout facri-
lege. Finally, my Lord, the thoughts of liberty, vphich pafs fora juft d;fire in the
minds of all men, were an horrid crime in me; and I may well promifc thy High¬
nefs, that 1 will never fo much as dream of it : And as I am generous enough not
to doe any thing that may blemiffi my love , fo am I yet more not to doe
anything that may wrong my duty. There is no need then of guards to keep
me from going out of thy Empire, being fully refolved to facrifife all my
pleafures , rather than doc any thing unworthy of the name which I carry,
and the choice which thy Highnefs hath made of my perfon, for to be the firft in
thy favour, as I am in thy Eftatcs. But without further deferring pronounce the
fentencc of death, fo juft, and fo much wiffied for. Ibrahim having given over
fpeaking, Soliman rofe up, fell to walking a great pace, and with his eyes fixed
on the ground continued in fodeepa mufe, as the Baffa doubted that he ffiould
obtain the effeft of his rcqueft ; but he was not long in this uncertainty ; for the
Sultan ftanding ftill, and beholding him in a manner that teftificd more grief
than anger, and more compaffion than wrath, faid unto him with all imaginable
kindnelTs that he held himfelf infinitely unhappy, in that poffeffmg fo great an Em¬
pire, that being fo viftorious and triumphant, and that being able to give felici¬
ty to fomany people, yet could not render the onely man whom he could love ,
happy. Upon this fo obliging a difconrfe,Jbraloim would have fallen on his knees,
but he would not fuffer him, faying unto him , that he would fein have obtained
fo much refolution of himfelf, as to part for ever from a man, who was fo dear unto
him; that he had debated the fame in his mind, when as he walked in that manner,
as he faW; but that at laft the affeftion which he bore him had furmounted his ge¬
nerofity, and that it was impoffiblc for him to refolve on fo grievous a feparation;
that he conjured him to cxcufe the effefts of his friendffiip, as he excufed thofe of
his love;andtoteftifie untohim, that as well as himfelf he did all diat he could, he
would permit him to goe atd fee Jfabella, provided he would pafs his word unto
him toreturn again within lix monthes; with this promife alfo, that if during his
abfence he could accuftom himfelf to this privation, he would give him his libefty
wholly and intirely. The Baffa was fo furprifed, and fo tranfported with joy , as
having caft himfelf at the feet ofthe Sultan, he was a good while without fpeak¬
ing , but at length, after he had recovered the ufe of his tongue, he rendred him
thanks for fo notable a favor,and told him,ihat none but Soliman could vanquiffi So¬
liman; that this viftory which hehad gotten over himfelf, was fo glorious to him*

to go to Monitroyhe would ingage his faith to render himfelf at Conftantrnople with¬
in the time that he had prefcribed; and thathe w.is not to fear that he would break
his word with his Highnefs,fincehe would keep it with his very enemies.After this
aifurance, the Sultan told him, that he did not doubt of it,   but that which obliged
him to require art oath of him fot it, was the knowledge that he had of tlie force of
the partion which reigned in his heart; and that his friendffiip would b;: fecured a-
gainft this  enemy of its content. J^r^/^/Vw fwore then Iblemnly, that nothing but
death alone ffiould keep him from accompliffiing hispromjfe. That done, Soliman
told him, that he would not have confented to his voyage, knowing that his affairs
were not compofed at Genoua,  had he, not had theniea,nesto have thefentence
revoked, which had  been given againft him.    And when as y/'r^/?/»? befought
him to to let him underftand, how he thought to perform fo unexpected a
a thing, the Sultan told him, that to comprehend his defign, he was butto
remeraber, how one of hisCi^^owA-,   remrning our offr^«f(?,   and ftaying at (jf-
noua, had been murthered in the ftreetes  by a popular commotion;    fo that
having been advertifed thereof by one of thcni that accompanied him , who
inftantly imbarqucd himfelf away,he had clrtf^all tire Veffells oftheGenouefes,that
were found in his Ports, to be arrcftcd; and that for the better favouring of his de¬
fign, an Ambaffador was the day before arrived fiom his Republique ,   whom he
had caufed to be put in prifon at Pera,   be frig perfwaded that he had doneuothing
unworthy himfelf therein, fince the Gemuefes had hik violated the Law of Nati¬
ons in the perfon of his Chaoux; how it was for to comnmnicate this affair unto him
that he had fent for him in the morning, but che fadnefs which he had tibferved in
his countenance, had hindred him from it, audcarried him into another difcourfe.
The Baffa then caft himfelf at the feet of the Sultan, to affure him, that' he would
never effabliffi his content on the ruincsofhis Country. Soliman told him,.thathis
generofity would not contradift his intention, and that fo favourable an occafion
might not be loft,   he would fend back this  Ambaffador  with  allthe   Veffells
which he had caufed to be ftayed, for to redeem his liberty, and that ofDsria, who
had fuffred fomuch for him.    Th^t he would write a letter to his Republique,
whichfliouidbeconceived in fuch exprefs tearmes, as they would without doubc
be mforced by fear to accord him more difficult thinges, than thofe which he defi,

<p>He grand Vifier was no fooner at home, but he fent thecom&lt;t
niand ofthe Grand Signior to the Baffa of the Sea, to return
him the Slave, with whom he had talked the day before; but
as he was generous and liberall, he caufed twelve Watches,
the faireft that ever had been found in all the fhops of Con-
ft oHtinopley to be carried unto him; for befides the difl^rence
of the inventions of them, their cafes were fo marvellous, as
the Emeraulds, Rubies, and Diamonds, made up the leaff
part of their beauty, the art far furpaffing the matter: And
whereas this curiofity is the greateft with perfons of quality amon^ the Turks^
having met with an hundred of them in a certain ffiop, Ibrahim could not choofe
any thing that was more gallant, more beautifull,or more agreeable to him, who
was ro receive them; but to render this prefent yet more magnificent, he put thefe
twelve Watches into a little coffer of Nacre, gamiffied with Gold and Turqueifes,
and fent them unto him by fix Slaves: As for that of Menacoy becaufe he was not a
man of any great quality, he fent him a thoufand Sultanins for his ranfom. After
whichheffiut himfelf up in a lodging apart, that was a good way from his own,
vyhich was too miich frequented with people,thcre to receive Deria at more liberty:
The Palace of the Baffa of the Sea t^as not far from Ibrohimsy fo that it was not
long before they brought him his deareft Deriuy to whom that Baflla in re^uitall of
that gallantry which had been ufed towards him, had in exchange of his fetters
given him a chain of Diamonds. It was in this interview, that thefe two friends
felt all thofe joyes and pleafing raptures, which true friendfhip caufcth in the foules
of two perfons, who for fo many years had been in defpair of ever feeing one ano¬
ther ; their hearts were at one inftant fo rcpleniffied With pleafure and admirati¬
on , as not able to exprefs together their amazement And their joy, they remained
a good while embracing one another. Without the ability to fpeak ; but at length,
Ibrdhinis ^alXion being the ftronger, it obliged him to open their firft dlfcdt/rfe by
IfabelUyincaWm^Doriahis Prelervcr, in giving him thinks for exppfing his life
todeliver her, and revenge him; and craving pardon of him for the pains he had
fuffered in his captivity, as counting himfelf the innocent caufe thereof Dorta

<p>it were true indeed that the Princefs loved him ftill &gt; He tvould know, of hinjj whe¬
ther the Prince of Majferan was an handfome man ? And as if his friend could have
divined what was done overall the earth, he conjured him to tell him, whethei*
he did not believe that//^^eZ/rf would be turned Nun when they ffiould arrive at.
Genoua ? In the end, after he had asked an hundred queftions, whereunto D^rta had.
no Icifuretoanfwerjhc perceived his error, and defired himtopardonhim for it
with fo much earneftnefs, as he could not choofc but fmile at it. But amidft all
thefe mutuall careffes,there were fome moments whereinDwrf.was furprized with
marvell, and whcnas reafon began to repoffefs its place in the mind of Ibrahinf, he
was aware of it; and feeing his eyes fattened on his habit, he eafily apprehended,
that he did not exprefs all his thought; wherefore not to leave him any lohgcnn
this uncertainty, he faid unto him, that for the renewing of their friendffiip in as
ttraita manner as formerly it had been, it was fit to tell him in few words, that
he was ftill Juftimano under the name of Ibrahim , and that although he wcie the
fervant of Soliman, yet was he for allthat the enemy of Mahomet.; that he defired
him therefore not tofufpcft him lighdy , fince he could not do fo without wrong¬
ing him ; that if he had not been too much preffed by the aflfeiirs which he vvai tq
communicate untohim, and which required fpeed, he would have recounted to
him, even at that very inftant, the wondei-fuU progrefs of his fortune, but he would
do that at leifure whilft they vvere in their voyage together; that in the mean
time he ffiould firmly believe hovv nothing was able to fhakc his faith, and that he
would live and die in the Religion of his Fathers.   Upon this difcourfe Dori*.
confeffed unto him ingenuoufly, that he had been ftrangely furprized with finding
him Grand Vifier, and the Sultans Lieutenant-Generall throughout all the extent
oi his Empire, fince to beth.u and a Chriftian feemcd to be two things incompa¬
tible; but inregard of that which hehad told him, he vvould afterwards forbid
his reafon to judge any more upon apparances: Hovv it was notwithftanding true,
that hehad believed that he was not abfolutely culpable, but hovv it was certain
alfo, that being unable to cPHCcive this adventure, hehad been troubled to think
in what terms he ffioifld dare to inform and clear himfelf therein.    Ibrahtm an¬
fwered, that he would eafily forgive him this injury, feeing he himfelf could^ not
in a manner conceive by what means 3 or by what wayes fortiine had condufted
him to the point wherein he then was: That inthemean fpacenot to lofe time,
which wasto be fo precious untohim, it was fit he ffiould tell him, that Soliman
had been fo good as to permit him to go and fee Ifabella; and that he might do it
with glory and fafety, the Sultan had found out an undoubted expedient tp (jaufe
the Sentences which had been pronounced againft  them, to ^e revoked.    But
whereas DffrM could not eafily believe that which he hc^rd, Ibfahim recounted e-
very thing unto him from point to point, juft as it had been refolved in the Sultans
Cabinet; but he did not difcover untohim, that he had ingaged his word for his
return within fix moneths, for fear he ffionld be aftlifted ^t it; for as fpr his fide^
lity he no way mifdoubtcd it.   Dorta finding that he purpofed to return out of
handto Genoua, told him, that he had loft a very affcftionate friend in the perfon
cf StmhaldoMio^N^%deado^ ficknefs, as the Slave of Monaco had informed him,
but that he had left a fonne behind him, the heir of all  his vprtucs and one that
promifed great matters.   Is he not called GiovAtmi 'Lodovico, replied Ibrahim, after
he had bemoaned the death of Simbaldo? Y^SyfaidD^na, and he w,s AoT^bove
a dozen years old when you went away, and yet then there was great h^P? of him.
Hereupon one bi-ought Ibrahim word, that the Slave of Mo»ac^ wa? come, which
made I).rM reprefent untohim, diat being to return to ^.«.*^,he held it not gt
that this Slave ffiould fee him in the habit he wore, becaufe he could not nqfliWy
forbear pubhffiing of k, which might prejudice hipi m^ch, or at leaftwife pblig«
him to make a publick mamfeftation of his advemurcs.    Ibrahim iigrecd w^
h.m therein, fo that he charged him, who brought him that meffage, to carry this
Maveto the quarter where theOfficersof his h^oufe were lodgedVwhich was a
great way off from his own, with order to tffe him well, and not to let hh^ go

felf to Doria, and defired him to work in fuch fort, as he might have the Letter
which the Princefs had wrote to him by this man, to the end hemight be affured
of her fidelity.    Doria told him  that the matter was not very difficult, and
that to oblige him to deliver it, he need but let him know, hovv he   was
ftill alive ;   and   becaufe alfo hee was to  fee him during their Voyage, it
was requifite  to tell  him,   that   hee had been a flave as well as they , and
freed in the fame manner, that he might not be furprifed when he ffiould fee him a-
bord the veffell. Ibrahim a^^roved of this counfell of his friend, and prayed him
to go inftantly and labour to bring him that preticustreafure, which was able to
make him happy. Dona condifcending thereunto, the Baffa caufed him to be con¬
dufted by tour llaves to the place where that of Monaco was, who a good while
would not part with Ifabellaes Letter, till he faw y«/?/w^w, becaufe he could not
bcleeve, that a man whom he had gone tofe8k for at Naples, fhould be at Conftan-
nople; but Doria fwore f o ferioufly unto him,  that Juflmiano was alive, and that
he (hould fee him within a few daies, as at length, knowing him to be a man of
great quality, and Juftmianoes friend, he fuffered himfelf to be perfwaded, and de¬
livered him Ifabellaes Letter, which he had with much ado preferved all the time
of his captivity ;  prefently whereupon Por#&gt; returned to Ibrahim, who attended
him with extreme impatience; as foon as he perceived him, and that they which
condufted him were retired, he lovingly imbraced him, and conjured him no
longer to defer his happinefs, bat Deria without anfwering him rendred him that
precious gage of Ifabellaes fidelity, which poffeffcd our Illuftrious Baffa with fuch
joy, that he could hardly obtain ib much tranquillity from his mind, as to read this
Letter: But at laft, after he had kifftd it with tranfports that cannot be imagined but

<p>Hardly could Ibrahim retain his teares in reading/y&gt;^f/7^fj letter, which had
made him change colour more than once, according as it was either more or   lets
obliging; and as jealoufie   and fer.r are undoubted markes of ftrong affeftion ,
thai which the Princefs teftificd unto him gave him at one inftant both griefand
joy; he was grieved that Ifabella ihould fufpee^x him of infidelity, he was not forry
that ffie was affraid to lole him; and as if he had not read it weil,  he began to run
it over again, and after he had made an end of reading it, he looked on afl fides of
the paper, to fee if nothing elfe were there written :   He read the fuperfcription of
it, he confidered it even to the very feal; and in the end bethought he fhould have
committed a crime if he had loft fo much as'one fillable of that pretious pledge
of Ifabellaes love. This letter (b mightily increafed his flame, that his unquietnefs
grew to be halffo much more than it was.    The difcourfe of the Princefs feemed
lo prefling unto him, as he began to fear in good earneft, left  ffie ffiould take fome
extreme refolutioi. before he could get to Monaco ; he concluded therefore to for¬
ward the matter as much as he could ,  and for a beginning he left Dbria,  after he
had caufed bookes to be given hira to entertain the time withall, and commanded
fome of his fervants to wait near untohim for to ferve him ;   the reft of the day
he beftowed in giving order for all things neceffary fcr his voyage   he commanded
a Chriftian Slave, in whom he much confided,  to caufe an habit after the Italian
faffiion to be fecretly made, and gave him more moiiey than need, both to pay for
it, and to procure the fidelity ofthe Jewes, who ffiould fell it unto him ; for it is
frora thofe kinde of men, that the great diverfity of Nations which people C^}fftau~

<p>remony at his departure from Pera; for it is the cuftom ofthe Sultan to receive no
Ambaffadors but fuch as have one of them on,according to the manner ofthe Coun¬
try. He was fuftained under the arms by two Capigibaffi ; the Baffa that condufted
him, marched two paces before him to prefent him to the Sultan, who received him
with fome civility :when as he had fainted theGrand Signior,he delivered thcLettcr
that the Republique had written to him,which Soliman gave unto a Dragomaujwho
interpreted it unto him for forms fake only,for he underftood it better than he. No
fooner had he done hearing him,but he caufed the fame Interpreter to tell the Am¬
baffador, thatthe injury which he had received in the perfon of his C^&lt;w«x, wasfo
great, that if hehad followed his juft fury, his head had anfwered for that vio¬
lence ; how it was for that he had caufed hira to be arretted, but that he had fince
changed his mind at the interceffion of a Chriftian flave, who had been afutor to
him for it,and that had found grace before his Highnefs; but that for returning him
back, as he was going todo,together with all the veffels which he had caufed tobe
ftayed in his Ports, and for forgetting alfo the outrage that he had received from
his Republique, they were to accord him one thing, which he defired of them.
And when as the Ambaffador had anfwered him, that the thing ffiould be impolli¬
ble if they did it not, he told him, how all that he would have was, thatthe Se¬
nate ffiould revoke the Sentence which they had pronounced againft Jujliniano, and
that Doria ffiould be no more troubled for the death of the Prince of Majferan; that
it viasjuftiniano to whom Genoua owed her fafety, and to whom he was to render
thanks for his life ; thathe remitted both him and Doria to his conduft, for the
putting of that in execution which he defired ; but that he ffiould take good heed
they faylcd not therein, becaufe if that ffiould happen, nothing ffiould be able to
keep him from making War upon Genoua it felf with all the forces of his Empire:
This Ambaffador was fo furprifed with hearing the Sultan fpeak of Juflmiano and
Doria, a% it had divers times like to have made him forget the refpeft which he ow¬
ed him, for to interrupt him , but at length after Soliman had given over fpeaking,
he anfwered him, that the thing he defired was fobeneficiall to the Republique,
as his Highnefs need not fear to be reftifed; that the merit of thofe two excellent
men was fo generally known, as the Senate had not obeyed the Laws but with grief,
and that doubtlefs they would be extremely joyfull of^ fo juft and fpecious a pre¬
text to infringe them. Afterthis Soliman difmiffed him, and told him yet once
again, how he ffiould remember, that in this occafion they were to fatisfie him, or
to have him their enemy ; howbeit he fomewhat careffed him in bidding him fare¬
well, and excufed the not receiving him with ^1 requifite Ceremonies for fome
reafons which he might not tell him ; that in the mean time he ffiould prepare
himfelf for his departure, and that he ffiould have his difpatch. When he was re¬
tired according to the cuftom, that is, without turning his back to the Sultan, /-
brahim camcforthof the Cabinet, and caft himfelf at his feet, to give him thanks
forfo many tcftimonies ofthe affeftion which he received every minute from his
Highnefs. But Soliman took him up, and told him, that eight years fervice well de-
fcrved that acknowledgment; that withall likewife in labouring for his good,
he ffiould eftabliffi his own felicity, which would never be perfefted till he faw
him contented • that the impatience he was in for his departure, was occafioned
by the defire he had of his return, and that it might no longer bc deferred, he
was to go and make an end of taking order'for his affairs, and that immediately
after noonhe ffiould come and bid him adieu, and bring Dena with- hira. Ibra¬
him anfviered to all thefe things with asmych generofity, as kindnefs; and for a
conclufion, he deeply protetted never to think himfelf acquitted of the infinite
obligations wherein he was ingaged to his Highnefs, but in facrififmg his life for
his fervice. He would have proceeded further, but the Stfltan interrupted him,
and once more commanded him to have no other thought than of going to fee the
incomparable IfabelUy and of giving life again to Solman. A^cr this thg Grand
Vifier durft not make any reply, but retired homewards to go unto his dear Do¬

Balfa was fain to fpeak to him before he  would heed him, or be drawn out of fo

thence, till he had at leafure confidered that Mafter-peece of Architefture, Ibrahim
told him he was contented   he ffiould , fo as he ftayd not long about it, for
that having goodlier things to ffiew him, and not having much time to fpare,
they were to raannage fo much as they had, till dinner was made ready, in letting
him fee all the beauties ofthe Palace which he had caufed to be built: That where¬
as he was skilfull in Painting, in Perfpeftive, in Architefture, in rarities, and in
all parts of the Mathematicks, he ffiould be glad to know, whether according to
his judgement all the rules of thofe fair Arts, and ofthofe excellent Sciences, were
found to be obferved there, as according to his they were.   But firft, fayd Doria to
him, I would fain know, how in fo little a time you could make up a building,
which for its greatnefs, and for the magnificence of its ftrufture, would require
the whole life of a raan, and the treafures of a great Prince.    This laft, replyed
Ibrahimy is the only neceffary thing, for with it is done in a fmall time, what whole
Ages, and all the induftry of man could not do without it; and both to anfwer
you, and to take frora you the means of troubling me with new objeftions, I am to
let you know, that having a purpofe to build this Palace,I eafily found out a way to
do it, as well fpeedily, as magnificently :  For difpofing of all the Revenue of the
Empire, I could want nothing fave Artifans to execute my defign, but fortune fent
incthcm ; for good luck would, that a great Architeft, two Painters, and two
Sculptors, having put themfelves in company together for to pafs outof Italy in¬
to Spain, from whence they had been fent for to make a ftately Palace for the Em¬
peror, were taken by Pirates, who afterwards fold them here at Conftmttnople; and
whereas I have alwaies been very carefull to inform my felf of places where any
Chriftian flaves were, that I might relieve them, I met with thefe fame, knew
what they were, and employed them for two whole years together; after which I
fent them back in a vcffell laden with riches.   You have peradventure heard fay,
that the Turkj do not fuffer the image of any living thing to be made, and that the
Alcoran feems to forbid it ; but as in all Religions herefies do from time to time
arife, this fame, which is compofed of nothing but abfurditics,hath not been want¬
ing ther.ein ; for fome remedy whereof they one day caft into the River of Adex^-
lia, that runs by Damafcus, two hundred Camels lading of Books of the different
opinions of their Religion, retaining but fix of them, which fince have produced
many others, whereof one maintains upon this Article, that the reft havemifun-
derttood that paffage, where their Prophet hadnoother meaning, butloforWd

Dona-was not yet refolved to quit fo rare an objeft, had  not the Baffa forced
him to enter, that he might obferve the Vaulting which fuftained the Paviglion,
whofe key-ftone was an Onix ofa prodigiou.s bignefs, and whereof the Artift had
fo well contrived all the colours, and made fuch ufe of them, as he had thereof
formed a Coronet of flowers, fo admirably well done, that it beguiled the fight :
The reft of the Vaulting was all of white Marble, the better to fet off fo fair a
work, but fo well joyned and poliffied, as it fecmed to be made of one entire ftonc
After he had fufficiently confidered fo rare a thing, Ibrahim caufed Dena to obferve,
that oppofite to the Paviglion, which he fo much admired, was another juft like
unto it; but before he went further D^-r/-* ftayed to confider a great low covered
Gallery which compaff d the Court about, and whereof the roof ferved for a Ter¬
race, with a rail and ballifter of a leaning height; ic was fuftained with pillars
of white and red Marble, and paved as the Court with white and black.   But
whereas /^r^/'/TW knew that there was fomewhat yet more marvellou'j to be feen,
he   made his dear Doria to pafs along under the fecond Paviglion, and although
the vaulting of it was fairer than the other that he had already feen, yet did he not
make any ftay there, fo much was he raviffied with   the magnificent Fore-front
of  Ibrahtms Palace, which wholly difcovered it felf from thence ; and truly
I muft confefs, that fee hadreafonfo to be, fince all that art and materiafls can
eontrihute to the beauty ©fa work, was eminently found in this fame. There ap¬
peared a great Building that took up the whole brcdth of the Court, which was
retrenched fome thirty pacesfrom the Houfe by a Balluftrade of Jafper and Por¬
phirie, and raifed on the Palace-fide the height of four fteps, which formed in the
middle an half pace of the fame matter.    The pavement of this Court was gray
and white Marble, and in the midft of it was a Fountain, whereof the bole was of
Oricntall Alablafler, traufparant as Chriffall, and fix foot Diameter, born up by a
pillar of'divers-coloui'ed Marble; the out-iide ofthe bole was inriched with
little Sea-iMonfters of half relieve, admirably  well done.    Roundabout the
pillar were four Harpies of Brafs, their paws reaching to the depth of the Cifteni,
and their backs turned oppofite the one to the other to uphold the pillar ; the tips
of their wings cxtendedalifo to the bottom of the Alablafter bole, as fecming to,
bear it up'; :they had womens faces, but Serpents writhen tails finiffiing in antick
foliage, which met together on the top of the pillar juft againft the Center of the
bole, whereunto likewife it ferved for an ornament: In the midft of thisbole was
a Vafe reverft, made alio of Orientall Alablatt:cr, which on its foot fuftained a
roundibaflsy whereupon were fet the three Graces, almoft quite naked, made of
Carmthianx».eta\l; they ftood back to back, ejefting Water out their breafts, and
eachof them holding a Coriiucopia, which met all together a little above their
heads; out of the flowers and friiits, which were reprefented there with fuitablc
pieces, made of Agates, Onixes, Turqueifes, Carnaline?, Topazes, and Emeraulds,
iffued fix fpouts of water, which fell down Jnto the bole, |nd difgprgcd themfelves

found at one and the lame time where withall to be laiishtd.    The Cittern of this
Fountain was of Marble, but wrought with fuch art in Mofuque vvorK, as there
appeared in thebottom through the water fifties, lo admirably well reprefented,
thatonc might bedeceived by them at the hrft hght ; this Ciftern had alfo round
about it a little Baluftrade of Jafper , for one to reft, and meditate upon.   After
that D&lt;»r/^had well admired this Fountain , hegave his whole mind and attention
ro'obferve the beauties ofthis marvellous frame; he faw then, that from each fide
rherewcnt awing of building, which extended even to the Baluftride of Jafper
and Porphirie,  and whereof the ftrufture and fymetrie was  fuitable to   the
middle front: Each ofthefe wings, as well as the grand fabrique, had a Co-
rola,   covered  over with ffieetes of brafs,   whereof the moity having received
an imprelTion of fire,  it had rendred then of a mixt colour between purple
and blew , which the Painters cannot well reprtfent,   and which ffiewed a
wonderfufl objeft,   being oppofed to the other ffieetes, whereunto had been gi¬
ven a tinfturcof gold.    The reft of the roof was covered in the fame manner ,
as well asthcPaviglions, whereof 1 have fpoken ;   but when as  Doria came  to
caft   his eye a littk lower, and to obferve that all the ornaments ofthis Fabrique
were of lafpcr, Chalcedonie, Agate, and Onix, he was fo furprifed , as he could
not forbear demanding,  whether this which he faw was not inchantment:   But
though the abundance of Feftons, of Trophies of Armes, Arabcfques, Vafes of in¬
cenfe. Frizes, Corniches interlaced with Drapery, extinft Torches, Cornucopi¬
aes, and Chaplets of triumph, gave him a world of admiration ,   yet was  he far
more furprifed to behold four and twenty Columnes of Touch, which feenied to
fuftainthe firft Order, and which were placed by two and two in equall diftance,
between each window;  the bafii and capitalls of them were of white and red
marble, in correfpondencie to the body of the building,  which was wholly con-
ftrufted thereof; but to preferve thefe Columnes,  and to render them withall the
more magnificent to the eye, they were twyned about with the leaves of Achanthes
ofbrafs guilt, which yet was no hindrance, but that one might diftinftly difcern
of what ftonc they were made, fo as the beauty of them might be admired for their
prodigious greatnefs.    Over the Entrata was a ftatue of5o/«&gt;»&gt;«» onhorfeback in
bafe relieve; and on each fide betvvecn thofe Columnes were fix Niches, filled with
fixgreatftatuesof women, habited ^X''&lt;««r//'«f, and reprefenting the divers Nati-
tions fubjefted to Solimon, who with one hand feenied to offer him their Crowns^
and with the other leaned on the Scutcheons ofthe armes ofthe Kingdomes, which
they reprefented.    After hehad well obferved all thefe marvailcs of Art and Na¬
ture, Ibrahim told him, that having yet many things to ffiew him,   which it may
be dcferved his approbation, as well as thofe he had already viewed, it was requi¬
fite they ffiould make a turn in the Garden, that all the outfide might be confide¬
red before he let him fee that the infide was not ill underftood; he made him pafS
then under a great Vaulting, which traverfed the whole body ofthe Houfe,   from
whence one defcended to the Garden by a large half pace of Porphirie. This Vault¬
ing was all of Mofaique work, compofed of different Marbles and Jafpcrs ,   upon
a ground of Alablafter, but fo wonderfully wrought, as an excellent Painter could
not with a pencill interlace a foliage raore artificially,   better obferve the lights^
and the (hadowes, nor make a fairer piece with liquid colours^ which by his mix¬
ture of them he renders fuch as he pleafeth, than this excellent Artifan of fo beau¬
tifull a work had done with fuitable pieces, whereofthe colours were all fimple
and n.iturall,aiid the joyning of them together imperceptible to he clearcftfighted
eyes. Jbrahim,  whofe impatience was extreme,  and who imagined, that every
moment imployed by him any other way, than in thinking of his departure,   was
an outrage to hii love, and a crime towards Ifabella, preffed Dona fo much ,   as he
made hira defcend into the Garden ;   howbeit he ftayed a little on the top of the
half pace the better to confider the beauty and extent 6f it.    He faw upon the firft

<p>dinary bignefs, about the which were feen upon the bafes of green Jafper fix figures
of fiflier- men,   as big as the life,  whereof there were three that held each of thera
a 1 rident in his right hand,   with the arm lifted up for to dart it;   and the other
three teftified by their aftion the joy which they felt  for having hurled theirs fo
rightly, as that they had therewith ftruck a Sea Monfter, which was reprefented
in the middle ofthe Round, lying half along on his fide ,   his head and his tail out
of the water, and with fo much art,   as  he feemcd to be fomwhat pained with the
hurts which the three Tridents had given him ,   and from whence iffued three
ejefts of water, that were in ftead of blood to him.    Juft oppofite to the half-pace
and the Round was a Grot, admirably fair,  both for the matter Uvhereof it was
tormed, and for the art wherewith it was made,  fo that Doria, being much ta¬
ken with this objeft, feconded the grand-Vificrs defign , and went on as faft as he
defired him; the Baffa, not to lofe time, caufed him to obferve in going along,
that on each fide of his Garden was a clofe arbor ,   erefted with porticoes of ver¬
dures, where the Gardiner had made it well appear,    that he was not ignorant of
all the beauties of Architefture, fince it had not any ornament there,  which was
not ofthe fame proportion, and ofthe fame fymetry, as was obferved over all that
ftately Palace.   He made him alfo catt his eye to both the fides of the Grot, ♦ from
whence there ran a Baluftrade of Jafper,  beyond the which was feen on the right
hand a Laberinth,fo artificially contrived, that it might be called a prifon without
agate; it being moft certain, that without at the leaft a prodigious chance, or be¬
ing taught by him that made it, onecoald not get out of this D-f^*?/^ , whatcare
foever a man took to mark how he went into it: Doria would fain have gone and
made tryallofit ;   howbeit Ibrahim-woald not fuffer him ,  but obliged hira to
look toward the lefLfidc ofthe Baluftrade,   where was feen a Grove of Orange,
Citron, Pomegranate, and Mirtle trees j  and although the profpeft ofthis place
was deleftablc, and the fent of it odoriferous, yet Doria paft by them to admire the
mervailcs ofthe Grot, whercunto they were then near; but wlfcrcas the defcription
of it would be too loug, it ffiall fuffice to fay, that it was of an Oftangular toriii;
that although it was ofa juft depth,  yet it was for all that fo lightfom ,  as afl
which the Orient hath of moft rare was there tobe feen: And to conceive a light
Idea of it, one muft imagine, that he beholds together all the maftcr-picces, or to
fay better,all the miracles of Nature; one muft then figure unto himfelf great rocks
ofChriftall, of Emeraulds, and of Rubies, where there was feen in fome of them,
thatthe Sun had not leifure to finiffi his work,  being without colour in divers
parts;  one muft alfo paint forth to his imagination that wonderfull ennamcll of
Orientall Shells, whereof the diverfity is fo agreeable, be it for their formes, or
for their lively colours, fo well mingled, and fo wellforted,  that of all naturall
things they are the faireft, and moftperfeft; one muft likewife conceive that in his
mind, which all the Painters cannot reprefent-,  I mean thofe great Conques of
Nacre,  where the bcamcs of the Sun leave fo beautifull an impreffion of their
light, as neither Opales, nor the Rain-bow have any colours that are not furpaffed
by the luminous Argent whereof they are formed , and which makes me name
them with reafon the favorites ofthe Sun.     But after all thefe things one muft
imagine yet an infinite number of great branches of Corrall, of all colours which
Nature hath produced, namely of all the Carnations, white, black, and ofthe co¬
lour of fire. There muft be further added to all thefe mervailcs the faireft congela¬
tions and the rareft petrifications, whereof Philofophers, or Hiftorians have ever
fpoken to us: Afterthis, I fay, one may conceive part of thofe things which Doria
beheld in this Grot, where all the artifices of water vvere feen admirably well
executed; there was a fall which ran from a rock of Chriftall, and which loft ic
felf prefendy under another, whereofthe noife wasfo charming, as there is not a
heart fo light, nor a humor fo fullen, in whom this murmure vvould not have ex¬
cited a pleafing fancic; and that fthere raay no doubt be made of the agreeable-
nefs ofthis inchanted Grot, I will fay no more, but that J^r^W himfelf, howfo¬

Gold, cnammclled with white and green, and placed in order upon ffielves of E-
bony, which were bordered with a dcntile of Goldfmiths-work, enarameled with
the lame colours. There were alfo in this Gallery between the windows a great
ruiiiber of Maps, both univerlall and particular ; and upon a Tablet over the
Books a many of Glubes and Spheres, different from one another, according to the
divers opinions of all them which have treated of fuch matters. In the fame or¬
der likewife he had placed all forts of Mathematicall inftruments, the faireft and
the bell made that ever were feen ; as concave Mirrors, Clocks, Olomeftres, Cir¬
cles of proportion, and Aftrolabes. But v\hereas Ibrahim contented not himfelf
with ntc.ffuy things, but would alfo have thofe that were for delight, he had
there a niin»berof thofe paintings, which by opticall reafons do make fuch excel¬
lent and charmingiUufions; for that purpofe then hehad Cilinders of feverall
j',ieatiicffe8, and to refreffi the fight of them which read, he had of thofe Chriftall
Triangles, which by the effeft of a marvailous rcfleftion do take and give all at
one time the colours of the Rainbow to all the objefts that are feen through them.
He had alfo divers magnificent Desks, Profpeftive-glaffes, and before the middle
window a Tabic of Ebony, garhiffied with Gold, and enammelcd as the ffielves ,
with aStandilh upon it covered all over with Emeraulds, fome dark, fome clear*
which made a foliage admirably well reprefented. At the end of this Gallery that
looked upon die firft Court, was a door which opened to the Terrace, whereof I
have fpoken, and which anfwered to the Paviglion in the middle, where the
Grand Vilicr had made a Cabinet of Arms, which he would needs have his dear

tliat his eye met withall, was a Trophy of Arms, fuftained in the air by the prodi¬

he would have ftayed a long time in Philofophying on all thefe fecrets,by maintain¬
ing, that neither water nor wind, could ever have the fame aftivity with fire and
fo by confequence that which he faw could not be without inchantment; but /-
brahim told him they vvould fpeak of it at leifure during the voyage they vvere
going  to  make,  and without barkening to him further, he made him go forth
at   a  door oppofite to that whereby they had entred, and which gave upon
the fame Terrace that anfwered to the end of the Gallery on the left wing
where   the   Illuftrious Baffa had caufed all the Turkiffi  Emperours  to bee
drawn ,   from   Othoman ,   who was the firft ,   to Soliman then  reigning.
But whereas he was not contented with having their faces reprefented but would
have the Othoman Hiftory alfo painted, there was in this Gallery fourteen great
Tables, in each of which was an Emperor as big as the life, and within the fame
frame all the principall aftions of his Reign; but the fame fo well done   fo di¬
ftinftly, and fo well ordered, as Doria was raviffied therewith, and plainly fwore to
Ibrahim, that he would not ftir out of that Gallery till he had confidered all thefe
Pi ftures attentively, and that he had expounded them unto him.   The Bafla decli¬
ned it as much as he could, butat length feeing his friend perfift in his obftinate
curiofity, he refolved to fatisfie him, upon condition neverthelefs, that he ffiould
not ftand to particularize all that he faw in thofe Tables:    And whcnas Dona
had ffiewed him that he was contented therewith, he requefted him to pardon him
if in the profccution of thofe painted Hiftories he faw a number of viftories gain¬
ed over the Chriftian?, which much againft his mind he had fuffered to be there
but that in the end he durft do no otherwife.   This faid, making ufe of an Indian
Cane, which he ordinarily carried in his hand, the better to make Doria obferve
what he was going to ffiew him, he began to fpeak in thefe terms.

<p>l[he Pourtrait of Othoman the firft Emperor of

<p>YOu fee, my dear Doria, in this firft Table, which you ffiall not fee above once
again in all the reft, I mean a Prince replcat with all vcrtucs, and abfolutely
exempted from all vices, who owed his fortune to his own proper valour, and
who alone laid the foundations of this great Empire: And indeed his memory
hath been fo reverenced, that even to this day all his Succeffors have held it for a
glory to carry his name. You may obferve in his Phyfiogminy that he was a Prince
as prudent, as the reft of the Table will ffiew him to be couragious.   This battell
which you fee afar off, is that which he obtaincdagainft the Teggiur ofthe Town
of Prufia; but mark a little how the induftrious Painter hath fo done it, as all
thefe figures feem to move, and thatinthisdiforderonemay know the viftorious
party; he hath done it fo too, that Othoman is eafdy difcerncd there: But if this
tight be well reprefented, this affault of that Town of PrHJta, and where he after¬
wards cftabliffied the feat of his Empire, wil not feem lefs marvellous unto you.
This pane ofthe wall, which you fee fallen down, and which lets you perceive them
plainly that defended it, is it not admirably well done ? Thefe other Towns
which you behold fo diftinftly, are thofe of Sinopa in Galatia, of Angauri in Phri-
via, of SebaftainCapadocia; and thefe which you fee further off towards thofe
Rockr, are the reft which he gained on Mare major.    As for this Land-skip, fet
thick with Town-s which you fee beyond Pr«/»4, it is of Natolia, that he wholly
conquered; and this Array which fccmeth to march, and whereof all the fouldiers
are laden with booty, is the firft that ever paffed into Europe,and that made ftrangc
havock under this excellent enemy. But without flaying to coofider the reft, let us
pafs on to this other Table.                                                                             Tbe

<p>IF the life of this Emperor had been longer;, he would have yet furpaffed his Fa¬
ther, both in valor, and in prudence, and we ffiould have feen the Table of his
viftories filled up more than it is; but whereas his reign indured but two years,
he had no more time than to take Andrinople, conquer a great pare of Thrace, and
bring alfo under his fubjeftionthe Towns of Pe^gamas, Edrenuta, Zemeniqua, and
fome others, as well on this, as on the other fide of the Helefpottt, which ycm lee

<p>The Fonrtraii ijf Amurath the fourth Emperor

</p>
<p>TO defcribe unto you the humor of this Prince, before I fpeak of his Triumph?,
I riiuft tell you that he had together both force and weaknefs, curtefie and cru¬
elty, and agility in his age; that he was both' terrible and loving; that he was in-
fatiableinffieddingof blood, and that neverthelefs he never put any one to death
but moft juftly. It was as well by thefe according contrarieties thathe rendred him¬
felf admirable to Pofterity, as by his valoiy which being feconded by fortune made
hira take P/:;^*^, the capitallCltie of Macedema, conaner Mtfid from Draguf, and
Mount iJfW*f* from the PW^w, two valiam and hiighty Princes, and the moft

ting Ibrahim, for to pray him to let him know whether thofe millions of armed
and nghting men which he faw in this Table, were not the piefture of all the Bat¬
tells that were given dming the reigns of all the Emperors. You have reafon my
dear Donay anfwered the Illuftrious Baffa, to be amazed at the prodigious number
c t men which this Table doth ffiew you, where the Art of the Painter hath as well
eternized his own glory, as that of ^»^«r.u/;, by reprefenting feven and thirty bat-

<p>THe nature ofthis prince cannot be well reprefented but by the lightning, which
terrificth univerfally, which ravageth indifferently, pafleth in a momant, and
periffieth in an inftant; all of them qualities admirably befitting JBajax^t y fur-
named by his fubje^s Guilderum,  that istofay,  the lightning of Heaven. But
whereas the remembrance of his life ftrikes me with horror, by reafon ofthe un¬
heard-of cruelties which he exercifed, it ffiall fuffife to tell you, that after he had
gotten fome battailes, which you fee prefented in this Table,  taken the Town of
Eritz^Ay and thofe of HifipoUsy Iconiumy Cafura, Mtgdia, and Ajfara from the Ca-
raman; and gained alfo by arme s from a Greek,  named Theodorus , the Town of
Damacia, and that of Delphosy which you fee here near hand; after he had,  Ifay,
facked all HungariUy Boffinuy and Croatia; defeated the French, Burgingnians, and
Hungarians, in that memorable battail of Nicopolis; after he had, I fay, filled the
whole Univerfe with terror, put all the Provinces where he paffed to fire and
fword,he loft in one onely battel his Empire, and his glory, ferving Tamerlan, who
had vanquifficd him,   all the reft ofhis dales; and at laft was conftrained, for his
geting out ofmifery, to make his tomb ofhis prifon, by beating out his braincs as
againft the iron barres of the cage, wherein he was inclofed; An aftion fo ftrangc,
it is impoffiblc not to bc moved with it.But let us fee how the eldeft ofhis children

<p>T is eafier to conquer, thanto reeftabliffi; to increafe ones felicity, than to retire
from a misfortune; ofa petty Soveraign to become a mighty Monarch, than to re¬
mount into a Throne from whence one is defcended. It is no little glory to Jofue,
after the utter difljpation of his fathers Sate , to have been the firft in raifing up a-
gain that mighty Empire, by regaining from Tamerlanthe City of Prnfia, which
you have already feen , as having been before the chief feat oftheir Empire, and
very near all that his Predeceffors had poffeffcd in Afia. He did the like in
Europe , as you may fee in this Table; and when he was returned into A§a , his
brother Mufulman, fortified with the fuccor of the Greeks, incountred him in
r^eWeriVt, gave him battail, which he wun, and taking him prifoner caufed him
to be ftrangled, after he had reigned four yeares. But this cruelty was repaid unto

thaty«f&gt;*/»w« did in his own perfon perform miracles at that battel, I whereof

came more cowardly, than he was valiant before, fo that Moyfes having rallied his
forces, which were difperfed by his deafeat, gave battel again to Mufulman,   who
ffiamefully fled, was taken, and brought to his brother, that quickly revenged the
death of Jofue by taking away his life.   But let us behold the fequel ofthe Hiftory

this fight, fo thathe was taken in^ mariffi with one of his hands cut off, whereof
they foon cured him by putting him to death. Now though tjhis Table be not

luftre under the conduft of Mahomety^NhQ after he had repulfed all them that had
atttacqued him, conquered Pontusy Cappadocia, atid all thofe other Provinces, which
the Painter hath fo well reprefented a/aroff; his armes were alfo viftorious in

edlikewife Serviay Falachia , a great part of Sclavonia, and Macedottia; chaccdall
the petty Kings out ofthe Icffer Afia to eftabliffi a Bcglierbey there, which is as
much to fay, as a Vice-Roy;, at laft, after he had performed a thoufand brave ex¬

ror of the T UKKS.
</p>
<p>THe Phyfiognimy ofthis Prince is not deceiving, and although it doth promift
us much, wee ftullyet find more: After then thatdiis Prince had defeated
Muflapha, the laft fonne of Ba\az,et, whom the Greeks had made to rife up againlf
him, as alfo another Muftapha his brother, whom the fame Greeks had likewife
protefted, he turned the fury ofhis armes againft them; taking from them the Ci¬
ty of Tbefalonica,  which the Painter hath   reprefented  unto us as fair as the
Hiftorians have defcribed it, and whereofthe perfpeftive is fo marvellous, as one
hath much adoe to believe that the running in ofthis gate is not effeft ive.   But let
us return to the Viftories ofthis Prince, who fpoiled the higher Mifia,  took the
To^Nn of Senderovia, conquered the Countries of Sarmian, and of Sarcan,tvfo
mighty Princes of the leffe Afia,   and the Town of Coni from the Caraman :" The
Hungarians having in the mean time broken the peace   which  they had con¬
trafted with him, he returned into Europe,   and was fb fortunate, that the Chrifti¬
an Gallies, which lay at the ftrcight of Helefpont to hinder his paffage,   were con¬
ftrained by foul weather to retire;   he in the mean while came to that memorable
plain, which gave name to the famoufett battel that ever was heard fpoken of. And
fee you not how the Painter hath been pleafed to reprefent it I Mark this Squadron
a little which gives ground, and this other which is broken; confider the left wing
which is routed; obferve this clofe Battalion, which is going to attacque this other
that is ready to fly: Asfor the body ofthe Battail, where you fee fo  great a dilbr-
der, and fuch a confufion of dead horfes, men overthrown, blood fpilt, and armcj
broken, it is here in this place,   where the Painter would reprefent the death of
Ladifiaus, which arrived in this battel, with the lofs very near of   all the Nobili¬
ty of Hungary; fome fighting to revenge the death oftheir Prince,  and others to
recover his body ;  but to ffiew clearly that the viftory was on Amuraths fide, the
Painter hath reprefented Renown,   which feemes to fly over his Troopes for to
advertife them of it. Howbeit not to ftand longer hereupon, it ffiall fuffife to fay,
that after the battel of Varnes he conquered Peloponnefus ; that he difmiffed himfelf
abfolutely from his Empire, which to took upon him again foon after, for to ob¬
tain a battel  againft  the valiant Huniades ; he made the King of 5o/^/4 alfo his
Tributary, which   was his  laft viftory :   For the couragious George Scanderbeg
Caftriot, King of Albania, who had been his Slave, and that had acquired unto hiin-
felf with fo rnuch  juftice the glorious  title ofthe Buckler ofChriftendom , opo-
fed all his cntcrprifes with fuch valour, as this great Prince, feeing himfelf forced
fo raife his fiegc from before Croya, dyed with grief and fpight at it.

<p>]T was not without fome caufe that this Prince would be furnamed Bovi, which
is to fay, Great, or the Terror ofthe World, feeing all his aftions have been fo
great, and high, that if his excellent qualities had been without blemiffi, this
Prince had been incomparable. He was great in his cntcrprifes, great in courage,
great in conduft, great in prudence, a great Poliucian, great in conqueft, great in
beauty, and in fubtilty of wit; but he was alfo great in impiety, in diffolutcnef-,
in revenge, in perfidioufnefs, and in ambition. The greatnefs ofhis courage, and
of hisenterprifes,carried him againft theGreeks, Hungarians, Trebifondtans, Mtfi-
ans, ralachians, Tranfilvanians, Bofniaus, Albanians, Rhodians, Ve;tttians , and divers
other people. In conclufion, my dear Dona, this Prince had to do with all the

was very skilfull in Painting, and even to the point, that he fent, as I havealrcad
delared, the Battell which he obtained againft the Sophy, drawn with his own haul
tmto the Venetians, who conferve it ftill unto this day in their Treafuric.   There * *
alfo a great number of his works tobe feen in the Seraglio:  He was very EIo!
quent, and nothing curious of the magnificence of Apparell ; and that which I
moft admire in him, is, that he alwayes refufcd thofe adorations which are accu¬
ftomed tobe rendred to the Turkiffi Emperors, never fuffering any to caft them¬
felves on the ground in fpeaking to him, nor to do him reverence on their knees'
And truly if this Emperor had not blemiffied his glory by that prodigipus defire
of reigning, which carried him to take away the life ofhim, from whom he had
received his;  to caufe two of his Brothers, eight of his Nephews, and asmanv
of his Baffaes to be ftrangled, he had been excellent in all things.    But to pafs o-
ver his Viftories lightly, becaufe time doth prefs us, I will onely tell you hi few
words, that be won a famous Battle of the Sophy at Zaleran-^ that hetookT^w-
ris, which he kept not long ; andKemanat\i\% return; he rendred himfelf Mafter
of Aladulta, after he had vanquifficd King Uftagelu; he paffed into Sina, where
he defeated Campfon Gaun, Sultan of Cairo, in a battel neer to Aleppo, which was
rendred untohim, as viell as Damafcru, and all the reH of Siria; from thence go¬
ing to Jerufalem, he conquered all Paleftma by the valour of Stnan Baffa, who ob¬
tained a Battel neer to G^^c.^; whereupon ^f//&gt;w, having paffed the deferts of £f*»f
fought a battel vvithThomembeyhard by Mat harea, and conftrained him to retire
to Cairo, where was given the moft memorable battel of our Age, for it lafted three
dayes and three nights in continuall fight ; but in the end Seljm was viftorious
and kirced the MamelHcks to abandon the City unto him; and having recovered
new forces, they were utterly defeated, and Thom^mbey taken prifoner.   After he
had given the pillage of Cairo to his fouldiers, as you may fee in this Table
where this drcadfull diforder is fo well expreft, he went and took ako Alexa»'
dria, Damiettta, Tripoliy and all the reft of Egypt and Arabia : One of his Baffaes
obtained likewife a great Viftory againft the Perljam, Butat laft, after hehad been
in fomany fights, won fo many battails, and conquered fo many Provinces   in
lefs   fhantvw) yea-rs, as he thought to return triumphant tothe feat ofhis Empire
he dyed at Chimrli, in the very fame place where before he had given battel cohis

that if he werea Chriftian he would be of all men the moft perfeft.    He h^h to¬
gether, both much valour, and much conduft; he is infinitely juft towards his own
pconle, and exceeding clement towards his enemies ; he is fo rigorous an obferver
of Ins word, a$ he  vvould refolve rather to lofe his Empire ,   thin not to
keep It,  when once he hath given it :    He is great in fpirit, great in judge-"

<p>hanged with black Velvet, fet all over with tears and flames imbroidered in pearl:
Here it was where Ibrahim defired his dear Doria to remember the things which he
ffiould fee in thischamber,more particularly than all the reft of the Palace, tothe
end he might teftifie to the incomparable Ifabella,that ffie had always reigned in
his heart, and that to conferve the memory of her, he would never optn his eys in
waking,without beholding fome marks ofhis love; he caufed him then to obferve,
that in the feeling of this chamber were five great Ovals,in each of which was aTa-
ble,&amp; between every of them hung feftons of flowers and fruits,all gik;the reft of the
feeling being done with corni(hments,whereoffome were of azure,fome ofburniffi-
ed gold. In the middle picce,which was greater than the reft,was a woman reprefen-
ted,\\homDoria prefently kncw,becaufe fhe had fomthing oilfabella in her,although
it was a very iraperfeft refemblance; for Ibrahim having loft her pifture, could do
no more but inftruft the Painter with the colour of her hair, with the form of
her face, withall the features of it in particular , with the vivacity of her com¬
plexion, with her ftature, and with her bofome ; for as for the air and graceful¬
nefs, which cannot be expreft, bui^in calling it the foul of beauty, it is a thing
that cannot pafs from our imagiiption to that of another, and that confeqiicntly
did not permit Ibrahim's Painter to make any marvellous pifture of Ifabella ; but
in conclufion it was refembling enough for to caufe them, who knew her, to judge
that ffie was thought of when this piece was made.   This iraperfeft refemblance
having entertained them a while, Doria confidered all this Table, and faw (as I have
already declared) a woman fumptuoufly apparelled, who trampled under her feet
honor, vertue, and love, which were feen reprefented with the marks whereby they
are known ; and that with her right hand, lifted up on high, ffie took frora for¬
tune, who appeared over her in the air, a little Crown , which ffie feemed to re¬
ceive very contentedly, with this Motto,  All for her.    Doria eafily comprehended
this Enibleme, and no way doubted, but thatthe Baffa had caufed it to be made
out of the opinion he had, that Ifabella had defpifed her love, her promifes, and
her conftancy, to cfpoufc the Prince of Majferan, who was but a petty Soveraign.
After he had commended the art of the Painter, and the invention of the defign,
the Baffa leading him towards one of the corners  cf the chamber, the better to
view the fecond Ovall, demanded of him whether this other Table would bcas
intelligible to him as the firft ? Doria approaching to it ,  and confidering it,
beheld a Love, in whofe face choler and fury were fb well painted, as it was eafie
to imagine that he himfelf hadburft his bow, broken his arrows, thrown away
his quiver, and torn his head-band, which were feen fcattered about hira; and that
which better expreffed his defpair, was, that having nothing left hira of all the
marks of his Divinity buthis torch, he plunged it, all flaming as it was, into a
fountain to extinguiffi it, with this blotto, I cannot.    Doria was fo ravifhed with
this Table, as he coifld not forbear confidering all the beauties of it, and whereas
the explication of it was eafie, he told the Bafsa, that he vvould pardon him for
that he vvould have cxtinguilhed fo fair a fire as that wherewith he was inflamed,
at fuch a time as he thought it to be unjuft, but that he held him happy for that he
could not do it, and for having conferved a flame,  whkh he could not put out
without a crime: After this he admired the Art of the Painter, and principally
of the torch, which this Love plunged into the fountain, where the excelknt
Workman had fo well reprefented that naturall antipathy betwixt water and
fire as never did any one behold a thing better imitated : This fountain feemed to
boil with choler to fee her enemy fo neer her ; and this flame defiring to eloign
it felf from that which would deftroy it, feemed exceedinglv to ftrive to get from
it, and rifing up on high in wreathing about the torch,mcltcd fo great a quantity of
wax, as all the fountain feemcd to be covered over with it.    Ibrah,m not mcrm
P,,r/^ to admire this piece any longer,conftrainedhim tolook upon thethird   cie-
firing him howfoever not to beftow much time in it, becaufe iliat Table did ont-
raze I fabella,as well as another which he ffiould fee akervvards: He flievved him

qually ; this woman was on the brink of the Sea, the agitation whereof ffie be¬
held with delight; in one hand ffie held a Crefcent, with the other ffie feemed to
p(;int at a Camelion, which was at her feet, and that leaning his body on a part of

<p>You will withput dpubt find another fanftuary,  faid Doria tp the illuftrious
Baffa, whp, anfwering him no otherwife than with a figh, made him enter into his
Cabinet, the door whereof was on the right hand ofthe chimney,  not far from
his bed, which after the cuftom ofthe Country was rolled up in a great Perfian ta¬
peftry Counterpoint of filke and gold.   But if Doria had admired all that hehad
feen in this Palace, he beheld with aftoniffiment the magnificence of this Cabinet
"whereofthe embowed roof   and   walles were inriched with a foliage of pretious
ftoncs, upon a ground of black marble, where birds,flowers, and fruites, werefcen
fo admirably well done, that the art furmounted the matter, although Topazes
Jacints, Opales, Emeraulds, Rubies, Diamonds, and Carbuncles were the colours
wherewith all thefe things were reprefented.    Round about this Cabinet were
ffielves of Ebony, fuftained by curtrofespfgpld, which projefted out cf the wall
wall by equall diftances, the edges, and uper part ofthefe fhelves,   were enriched
with Orpheury, enammelcd onely with white and black, the better to fet off thofe
things which were upon them; but to fpeak that in few words, and confufedly,
which would be too long to defcribe in order,  one might fee there Caskets of
different Ambers, great Vafes of Chriftall of the rock, of Cornalinc, and Agate ,
with branches of Corrall, which might rather bc called trees,   by reafon of their
prodigious greatnefs: Finally, all that Perfia, China,  Japon, and all the Oricntall
Countries do produce of moft rare, rich, and beautifull,   were found amaffcd to¬
gether in this place. After that Doria had faid all, that admiration, and amazcracHt
can make them fay, who love, and know rarities, they repaffed through the cham¬
ber, to go unto a door that was oppofite to that of the Cabinet,  whereby one en¬
tred into Ibrahims Bath, who, being accommodated with all exterior things, ac¬
cording to the cuftom ofthe Country where he lived, did not fail in having a
goodly and magnificent one. It was a place fpacious enough, in form Oftangular,
invironed about with feates, whercunto one afcended by four fteps of Jafper, and
Chalcedony,   whereof the twolowcrmoft werccovered with water even up to
the brim ot the third, the fourth being wholly out ofthe water:   At each of the
eight angles was a Colum, after the Corinthian manner, of Jafper mingled with
divers colours; the Columnes were planted on the fourth ftep, which ferved thera
for a pcdcftall, with their Bafes, Capitalls, Frizes, and Corniches; the Frize Was
carved in half relieve, where naked children were feen , who feemcd to combat in
the water with little Sea Monfters,   and to wraftlc with them, with efforts fo a-
greeableto their yeares, as the workman dcferved no little glory for the fame.
All thefe figures were fo lively fet forth, as they fecmed to move,   fo eafily may the
imagination bc deceived by things that are well reprefented;   over the Frize was
the Corniffi,  and above that juft perpendicular  to every Column rofe up a twy-
ning wreath of Oaken leaves, laid one upon another,   made of green Jafper,  and
bound with filets of gold, mounting up on the i ibbs of the vaulting, and meeting
the middle in the form ofa Chaplct of Triumph. Allthe walls were overlaid with
a compound ftone,called AventMrina,and whereof they fcemed to be framed, fo ex¬
cellently was this work contrived.But amongtt all the beauties of the place the grea¬
teft was, that between thofe eight Columns, whereof I have already fpoken, there
were as many Niches, four of which were filled with great Vafes of gold,  that
ferved to lay the perfumes in,   and other things neceffary to the Bath ; the other
four which feparated thofe former, were filled with four Nimphes of white mar¬
ble fo admirably fair, as Nature hath never made any thing more beautifull, than
thc'idca ofthis excellent workman :   Thefe figureswere allin different aftions j
fome of them feemcd to uncloth themfelves for to enter int^ the Bath;  others to
come out of it,  putting on their cloathcs again; but all with fuch art, asDoria
confeffed, that Sculpture had never ffiewed any thing more perfeft. He confidered
alfo that the water, which was feen in the Bath,   fell  into   it throiigh vHo
Vafes of Chrittall, which were held by two men , laid along on the brim of the
Bath and reprefented as Rivers ufe to to bc painted:   Out of one the Vafes ifliied
hot water, and out ofthe other cold ,  to the end one might by that mixture find

iet a many of filver Chargers, where in each of them were feen twelve great diffics
oi that which wc can the effence of porcelain, rcpleiiilhcd with divers fortes ot

.re not without great ftore of filver veffell, onely for magnificence; and indeed the
•:raiui Vifiers Ci'ibbord of plate was fo fumptuous, as Europe hath not a K.*ig that

5'oMeiigMvcn, great Vafes offundry formes a-.d of divers bigrteffcs, Flaggons ,
water Pots, andCifternes of gold , with Liouj muzles and Dolphins half imboft,
could not f)it)car telling Ibrahim that Ifabella vvould dyeforjoy, if ffie certainly
knew at what rate he bought the poffclfion of her ; but the Bafla returning him no
other anfwer thereunto than a figh, told Deria it was time to dine, that they might
attcivVnids go and take their leave of 5o//w.«;z; that in the mean fpace, whereas
ihciro.teiior ceremonies were different, although their minds were not, hehad
trivcnordei that he ffiould be ferved in his chamber. Dona went out then of this
Hall, after lie had obferved, that the Per/J"^» Carpet was fet all about with great
&lt;:ii(hioiii)f cloth of Gold, upon Carpets of the lame fluff, for Ibrahim and the
Officers of the Empire which did cat with him, to fit upon. The Baffa would
have conduft:ed his dear Dona to his lodging, but he would not fuffer him , fo
that he was conftrained to leave him in the hands of an Italian flave, in whom he
conhded for all things. Thefe two friends were not long at meat, for at this time
Ive and friend(hip produced the fame impatiency in them both ; the Baffa came
inu)f&gt;9r/4(rjchamber juft ashe was going out, having taken a refolution together
logo immediately to the Seraglio, that they might part away the night enfu-
iiig. The It.tlnw (lave affured the Baffa, that in the evening he ffiould have
kich anh.ibit as I&gt;(?r/.i wore ; for //'r.iW li.rd caufed him to quit that of a flave,
as loon as he was at liberty, and by the means ofthofe Jews, of whom Ihave
.already fpoken, procured him oneof the Italian faffiion. They went away
then to the Seraglio, where being arrived, Ibrahim made Doria put on a
Turkiffi robe, no ftiMngcr being permuted to fpeak to the Sultan but with this
ceremony. The Balfa entred in firft, to let his Highnefs know, that according to
his order he had brought his dear Doria ; Soliman ffiewed himfelf much fa¬
it-tied therewith, howbeit though he vvere fomewh.at impatient to fee him, yet
would he tor all that fjieak once more to Ibrahim without witneffes, wherefore he
&lt; anted him to pais along with him into his Cabinet, whither he wasno fooner

.-net, and retaining the tears which kindnefs .and amity would have ffied in this

<p>who 'never gave place to any man in generofity, caft himfelf at his feet, and pro¬
tefted unto him, that he would not depart before his Highnefs had teftificd that
he would rely on the word hehad given him to return precifely within the time
prefixed ; that he efteemed himfelf very unhappy in not being known to his High¬
nefs for that which he was, andthat being neither bafe, ingratefull, noralyarj
he was for all that fufpefted of thofe three crimes by a Prince, for whom he^
would facrifife his life with joy, who reigned in his heart far more abfolutely
than over his people, and who touched his foul with fo much tcndernefs, as he
plainly felt that he could not turn his fteps towards Ifabella, without turning his
eyes towards Soltman. Ibrahim pronounced thefe laft words with fuch^ear-

he raifed him up then in imbracing him, and promifed hira thathe would live in

<p>Elogium of our Illuftrious Baffa, as caufed hira to bluffi more than once; he fpake
of his valour, of his prudence, and of his conduft in great matters ; finallyhe af¬
fured him, thathe was as good a Generall of an Army, as he was a good and faith-
full friend; he told him further, that he defired him to receive his friendffiip as
he already poffeffcd his, having begun to love hira as foon as Ibrahim had made
known tohinis by the recitall of his adventures, what his merit was, and the af¬
feftion which he bore him ; moreover, that as all the interefts of Ibrahim were his
fo he gave him thanks not only for all the fervices he had rendred him, but for
all thofe which he ffiould render hira in time to come ; andfora mark of the ob¬
ligation wherein he would ftand ingaged to him for it, he conjured him to ac¬
cept of aScymitar whichhe gave him, whereof the hilt and fcabberd were afl
covered over with Diamonds. PonV» anfwered to all thefe things with all the re¬
fpeft that he owed to fo great a Prince, and being fallen on bis knees to receive
that precious eage of Solimans liberality, he was with a great deal of fweetnefs
and civility taken up by the Sultan, who prayed hira to affure Ifabella, that the
conftancy of her Jufttniano had been fb firm during the time thathe beleeved her to
be unfaithfull,as he durft fwearfor him, thathe had never fought after,nor affeft¬
ed glory, but outof the hope of dyincT more nobly ; he entreated him alfo to pre¬
fent her from him with a box of Gold, fet with Emeraulds, which was filled
with two Chains, the firft was of Diamonds of an excelfive greatnefs, and the fe¬
cond of Pearls, fo big, fo round, fo even, andfo clear, that the Oricm hath never
ffiewed us fairer. Ibrahim would have fpoken to render Soliman thanks, and to
have made himfelf the bearer of that Trcafure, but he impofed filence on him,
and fayd, that it would be enough for him to entertain//^^r/Ai with his own af¬
fairs, without charging himfelf with a complement from another. Butat laft
the Sultan being unwilling that Doria ffiould fee him capable of any weaknefs, and
feeling that this converfation could not long endure without his falling again in¬
to meiancholy, he told the Baffa that he had given order unto the tefqucregi-
bafli, who is the Grand Signiors principall Secretary, toraake up the Amb.affador
of Gemuaes difpatch ; that his Letter was conceived in fuch preffing terms, as that
Republique durft not refufe what he defired of it; that in the mean time, fmce he
muft refolve to fee him depart, he thought it fit that he ffiould go and give order
to his affairs, to the end he might as fpon as it was night repair to the Ambaffa¬
dor of G^w«'««&lt;'-f veffell, which hehad caufed to come from Pera to Conflantinople,
and would attend for them at the Port. This fayd, he difmiffed P^rw, after he
had teftificd much affeftion unto him, and retained Ibrahim for one moment more
to take his laft faiewell of him ; it was at this inftant that Soltman (hewed the
greateft marks of his good-will to the Grand Vifier, fince it is moft certain,

for him in another chamber ; in their way back they talked of nothing but great
Solman; DorM wasfo fatisfied of him, as he was conftrained to confefs, that he
ihould want common fenfe if he were not charmed by the rare qualities of fo ex¬

was fain to fpeak of the Princefs to him for to draw him out of it; wherefore he
dextroufly told him, that Ifabella would be aftoniflied at the prefent which fhe
(hould receive from him.    At this fweet name Ibrahm began to take heart again,
and fomewhat diffipating hisheavynefs,hctjmed alibis thoughts to his departure.
As foon as he was at his Palace, he entred with Doria into his chamber, where ha¬
ving fent for the Italian flave, he underftood by him, that  hishabit was ready;
whereupon he called the principall Officers of his houfe once more before him,and
told them that he was going to depart away upon that occafion wherewith he had
acquainted thera before, and therefore they ffiould give order to the Porter of his
Palace, that he might not be troubled for the reft of the day, but to fend  fuch as
came about gencrall affairs to the Baffa of the Sea, who during his abfence was to
deal for him: Afterthis he commanded them to withdraw, and remained alone
with Dona, and the flave that had brought him his habit.    Now the night be¬
ginning to approach, he held it time to think of parting,  and this flave being of
counfell with them, was appointed by him to go and take that other of Mona-
rn^ and conduft him to the Port, whether they would come to them.    Ibrahim
having put on hishabit, took  fome   Jewels  with  hin&gt;,  in   cafe   hee ffiould
ftand in any need upon the way by forae unexpefted incounter, and   percei¬
ving it tobe dark enough for them to go forth without difcovcry, he caufed
Doria to dcfccndbyaback'ftair, which brought them to a door that opened into

<p>Ever was voyage more profperous, than that of Juftiniano, ne*
never did the winds more juftly fecond the defires of the Pilot,
and never was the Sea more conftant   in calmncfs of weather,
than it was in bringing this Lover back again to the Haven,
from whence the tempcft had driven him.   But to favour the
impatience he was in to be with Ifabella, let us only fay, with¬
out particularizing his courfe, that after he was come to all the
Veffells, which the Grand Signior had caufed to be arrcftcd,
and drawn out of captiviy all the Chriftian Slaves which were found in the fe¬
verall Ports where they touched, by vertue of an abfolute power that he had from
the Sultan ; after, I fay, that he had paffed the Archipelago, and left Ciprut on the
left hand, this profperous Fleet arrived in a few dayes within fight of the Land of
Genoua : There it was where the Ambaffador began to reap the fruit ©f his voyage,
by the pleafure he took in thinking that he was going to enter into his City, as it
were in triumph, by bringing thither again thofe fb many Veffels which reftored to
the People their kindred and friends, to the Nobility their children and their
riches, and to the Senate the Grace ofthe Grand Signior, and the lives of two Il¬
luftrious Citizens.    As for Doria, he felt that motion in his foul, which Nature
gives to all thofe who fee their Country again after a long exile, and that not trou¬
bled by the unrulinefs of paffions following without refiftance the thoughts where¬
with ffie infpires them ; he had then an extreme pleafure ,   but yet it was a quiet
pleafure. Butfor y«/?/&gt;"^«&lt;», itwasnot fo with him, he did not look upon this
Land as the place of his birth, but as the refidence of Ifabella, and in an inftant
he paffed over again in his memory all that had arrived unto him there ; and his
tranfport was fo great, that joy produced fome effefts of ^lief in him ; he chan¬
ged colour divers times, he was unquiet and mufing, and if Doria had not forced
him to fpeak, and exprefs his minde by his difcourfe, it was to bc doubted in bc-
holdinghim, whether it were hope, or whether it were fear, that agitated his
foul; whether he regrettedCo»/?4)*r/»op/^, or defired Genoua; fo certain it is that
violent paffions pervert the ufe of the fcnfes.   Tears , which ought not tobe but
the marks of forrow, ferve fometimes for joy; and filence, which feems fo proper
for fadnefs, is often the efteft of an extreme pleafure ; but as we come to one and
the fame place by divers wayes, they were made contented by different caufes,
and expreffed their joy in feverall manners.    In the raeiin tirae they came ftill
ncerer to Genoua, but not holding it fit that Juftiniano and Dm.i ffiould enter into

<p>the City before the deliberation of the Senate was known, the Ambaffador caufed
his Ve'It 11 to caft anchor three miles from Genoua, and going to pafs into anothei^
akerhc had affured thera thathe would obtain their liberty , or be exiled with
,hem, he &lt; bierved that Alphonjo Sptnola, Captain of one of thofe redeemed Vef¬
fel 1   ai d brother to hira whom 'juftiniano had flain in defendlllg Rhodolpho,  hung
b ,ck, and v ould not follow him, whereupon he would needs know the caUfe of it;
but Alphonfo, vvhofe generofity was extreme, feeing himfelf obliged f(&gt;r his life, and
f,,. his liberty to Juftiniano, who during the voyage had teftificd unto, hini with
much refentment the grief hehad had for the misfortune wherein he had been
ingaged ; and knowing likewife that the death of his brother had hapned with
fomeiiiit'k, he befought the Arabaffador not to think it ftrange if he did not at-
tciul uLon him to Genoua, being abfolutely refolved never to enter into it without
his Deliverer ; that knowing his Father, as he did, he was well affured that he
would with alibis power oppofe them that would revoke the Sentence which had
been eivcn againft Juftiniano ; fo that to hinder his violence, he purpofed to write
unto him, that if he would have his fonne again, he muft pardon his enemy; that
his fortune was conjoyned with his, and that he would never have fuch a reproach
laid upon hira, as that a man, who had drawn him out of fetters, and brought
hira back into his Countrey, fhould not injoy the liberty which he had given him.
Alphonjo pronounced this fpeech with fomuch earneftnefs, as allthat heard him
were ravilncd with his refolution; and Juftiniano was fo charmed therewith, that
not .'l&gt;le to forbear imbracing him, and not fuffering hira to fay more, he conjured
him that he would not force hira to be ingratefull; that if nothing buthis blood
would fatisfie the revenge of his kindred, he would be moft ready to ffied it for his
fake, but having forae hope to ferve thera raore profitably in his perfon , when oc-
ca(i( 11 fliould prefent it fclf, he would fpare no care nor good office for it, fo as ic
might be done without offence to his honor; that he had performed  a gallant a-
ftion in defiring to ftay with him, but that he (hould do an unworthy one, and full
of inhumanity if he ffiould confent unto it ; and that therefore it was more juft,
that he ftiould go and dry up his fathers tears, and moderate his fury by the  joy
which hiblight would bring him, than to do a thing that would procure him his
hatred.    Alphor.jo did not yecld at firft to the defire of Juftiniano, but the Ambaffa¬
dor and I)&lt;7rM tiding withfaim,he was conftrained to fubmit to their fcnfc,and to let
his inclination be overcome by anothers reafon.    Thefe illuftrious friends parted
with fomuch adoe, as if Dona had not perceived by Juftmianoes watch, that the
time of the Senates Affembly preffed the Ambaffador to depart, if he would have
audience as foon as he ffiould arrive, they would have fpent a great part ofthe day
mthis noble conteftation, whereof all the glory confifted in obliging his enemy.

<p>thered together in a very great number, and they no longer doubting but that
thefe veffells, which now they knew, brought them back both their brethren , and
their children, fuch a noife of acclamations arofe on the fuddain, as they all fpake
without underftanding what they faid themfelves, and without being underftood
of others; wives called fpr their husbands; fathers inquired after their children;
fome ran into the City to advertife their friends of it; others ran out of it with
their whole families; they in the Veffells cryed to let them know whether all were
well at home; at laft fo great a noife was formed of all thefe cries and raurmures,
as the Ambaffador had much adoe to make his orders bc underftood : He comman¬
ded all tlie Qhieftaincs to Accompany him to the Palace, and particularly Alphon¬
fo not to be far from him; tficy traverfed the City in this fort, followed by the po¬
pular multitude, who ceafed not from teftifying their joy, both by their teares,
and by their acclamation. When they were at the Gate ofthcPalace, the Am¬
baffador advanced three or four fteps before his Troop, thathe might the better fur-
prife that honorable Company. At his firft appearing they fought to know the fuc-
ccfs ofhis voyage in his face, but as foon as they perceived all the Commanders of
their Veffells, the gravcft and moft moderate amongft thera could not chufe but
ffiew figncs oftheir amazement, and joy; and when this firft emotion was appea-
fed, the Ambaffador, haying made a low obeifance to the Duke, and the like to the
whole affembly, began to fpeak in this fort.

<p>IF the profperous fucccfs ofmy voyage had been an effeft of my conduft , ofmy
care, and of my addrefs , I ffiould without doubt have had fo much modefty
as to declare in few words the eftate of things, for to attend from fo honorable
an Affembly the praifej which a fervice of fuch importance would have dcferved,
without giving them to my felf; and I ffiould alfo have been fo generous, as to
have been fully fatisficd with the onely thought of having been profitable to ray
Country; but whereas Ihave no part in the glory of this aftion, but contrarily I
my felf am obliged for my life tothe Deliverer of fo many illuftrious .^Javesat
I have brought you back , and which are all, either your kinfraen, or your
friends, it behoves me, both that I may not be ingratefull in ray particular, and
that alfo I may keep you from being fo in generall , to report fathfully unto
you how the matter hath paft, to the end thatby underftanding all the circum-
ftances you may the better know, how it is the intereft ofthe Republique , which
makes me fpeak with fo much earneftnefs.
</p>
<p>You arc to underftand then, my Lords, that whereas the Emperor Soliman belie¬
ved, that the Law of Nations had been violated in the perfon ofhis Chaoux, he
thought that hemightdoc the like in that of your Ambaffador, fo that as foon as
I was arrived at Pera, and that according to the cuftom I had demanded audience
of his Highnefs, I faw my felf conftrained to pafs by his order from my Veffell into
a ftrcight prifon, without telling me the caufe therof, in fuch fort as he that came
to obtain the liberty of others, faw himfelf deprived ofhis own, and laden with
chaines. 1 was two dayes intreated in this manner with a great deal of rigor, and
I very well perceived by the countenance of them which guarded me, that they
believed my head was the onely price ofmy liberty. As I was in this unquietnefs I
faw the Aga ofthe Janizaries enter, who caufed mc to be told by Dragoman ofthe
grand Signiocs, whom we call an interpreter, that his Highnef^s willing to give me
audience had commanded him to conduft rae to Conftantinople without any ceremo¬
ny; this mutation furprifed me fomuch the more, for that I could not imagine the
caiifc of it, having been well enough informed, that Soltman doth not eafily change
hisrefolutions, .and that repenting is a motion of the foul which is almoft un¬
known to him: In the meantime I beheld my fetters broken off, without feeing

<p>tarried but one day longer before we arrived at the place, where h.* was retained
Solimofts Order had come too late to work that which he had formerly given, and
the fuccour of jujliniano had been in vain ; Now f leave it to be judged, whether
the reparation be equall to the crime, and whether Philippo hath realon to oppofe
the return of Juftiniano.    But not to conceal one important thins? that may lead
him to a gootf fenfe, I muft fay further, that Alphonfo, who cannot'^be worthily t-
nough praifcd, and whofe prefencc keeps nic from fpeaking more of it, knowing
how far he is obliged to Juftiniano, is abfolutely refolved to follow die fortune of
his Deliverer; it is by his order that I fpeak, and his filence doth fufficiently prove
this verity unto you; it is notbut to confirm what I fay that he iscome hither,&amp;:rto
obey JftftmianoyVjho would not let him ftay with him as he defired. At laft,my Lords,
if Philippo will preferve his fon he muft joyn his prayers to thofe of all the people,
who conjure you to accord the grace of him who hath filled your City with abun-
dancc,&amp;: all the families ofGenoua with joy; all the acclamations of gladnefs, which
you hear at the Palace gate,fpeak to you for pardon and mercy;but if you oppofe the
feverity of the Laws to prayers fo juft,fo preffing,and neceffary for the publick tran¬
quility, I have to anfwer you, that it is not to offend them, but to fatisfie juftice,
which ought to be the rule of thera ;  and that the farae Lawes, which will have
a crime puniffied, will alfo have vertue recompcnced.     If there be need of exam¬
ples of Sentences that have been revoked, all antiquity will furniffi us therewith :
Ariftides was baniffied by the Oftracifme, and repealed within three yeares after;
Cimon vJaseyiMedfron\ Athens y  and intreated to  return , even   by   thofe that
had driven hini away ;   at Sparta one Leontidas was ufed in the fame manner; a-
nubngft the Lacedemonians. Philoxenus had the fame fortune;   and if we will go to
Rofitey we ffiall find, that Seneca was baniffied by Claudius, and called home againby
him for fome praifes which hehad given him in a letter of confolation, thathe
wrote to Polibius his favorite; judge now my Lords,   whether flattery fpoken
with a good grace may enter into comparifon with the fervice that.Jnftmiano hath
rendred you.   But to pafs from antiquity to the   modern age, have we not
feen amongft the  Venetians HortenfioCcntarini condemned to a perpetual banidi-
ment, who returned into his Country a little after with the fame  honors   which
heformelyhad there ? And without going to feek for authorities amongft our
neighbors, which we may find amongft our felves, hath not one feen Antonia Pre'
^o2.&lt;i exiled for ever from his Country, who neverthelefs was by adecree from the
Senate reftored to his former liberty in Genoua? I could alfo find many other
particulars in Hiftory to confirm my propofition, but I think itmay fuffice,   that
Greece and Italy have marked you out the way, which you may  follow without
fear of failing, after fo many Illuftrious examples. Howbeit you will peradventure
fay, that albeit you could infringe your Lawes in favor of Juftiniano,  becaufe   he
hrth done you fuch great fervices, yet Doria cannot pretend to the fame grace, fee¬
ing he himfelf oweth his liberty to our Deliverer; but I am to anfwer you for the
glory ofthis difintcreffed friend, who hazarded his life, by a generofity without
example, to revenge the outrage which the Prince of 3/(i/^4« did to Jujliniano,
that this aftion fcemed fo gallant to Soliman, when as Juftiniano recounted it unto
him that he hath judged Doria worthy of his proteftion: Befides do you not ima¬
gine* that the interefts ofthefe two illuftrious perfons can ever be feparated.    And
to tell you all that I think in this incounter, prepare your felves to execute what
I h.ive promifed, or refolvc to lofe at the fame inftant all the commanders of your
Veffells, who have every one, as well as my felf ,   folemnly fworn never to enjoy
the liberty which Juftiniano hath gotten us,  unlefs   he be partaker of it with us.
As for me, vvho doe certainly know of what importance this aftair is for the pub¬
lique good, I ffiould think that I ffiould betray my Country, if I ffiould conceal the
eagernes vvhich I obferved in the mind of Soliman, when as he told rae that one ot
his flAves having found grace in his fight, had befought hira to pardon us; and that
he had confented thei-cunto, provided that you ffiould revoke the Sentences, which
yuuhad given againif Jt^jliniano ^nd Doria; wherein if you failed,he fworcinfury,

prey of defpair and forrow,   had not the fight of his Sonne been at length found
more powerfull, than the image ofhis paft misfortune: He knew fo diftinftly the
fenfe of Alphonjo by the motions ofhis face,  as being affiamed to be lefs generous
than he, he let his refentment be furmounted by fo noble an example, which pre¬
fently appeafedall the troubles ot his fpirit ;   fo  that feeling himfelf in a more
peaceable eftate, and feeing the Duke about to fpeak,  he to prevent him befought
him with teares in his eyes to reftore that unto Juftiniano, which his profecutions
had taken from him; it being juft, fince fie had rendred him a fonne, that he ffiould
render him his liberty.    This difcourfe fo raviffied the whole Affembly,that con¬
trary to their cuftom, and the refpeft of the place, they fent forth cries of joy,
which did not ceafe very foon; but amongft the reft the young Count of Lavagna ,
together with Alphonfo,vjho were prefent,   thought they fhould never have been
filent again;   the firft could not fufficiently commend this aftion, and the other
could not forbear faying,   that he was more obliged to his father for vanquiffiing
himfelf, than forgiving him life.     But after every one had praifed P/)/7/^;&gt;o as

touched ihtm v.-th compallion which looked on them, and thatthe others mfpired
all d,cm that beheld them with joy, the former were freemen that were made llaves,
and dielc were flaves to whom liberty was given : And if heretofore at Rome he was
crowned with glory that faved the life of a Roman Citizen, what crown, and what
glory was not &gt;i?w.t»o Worthy of, who by his generofity hindred notonleythe
death of fo great a number of men, but the utter deftruftion of his country ?   And
i lukcd iie was received with fo many acclamations, as never was fo univerfall a jov
icen in Genoua before.   This while the Ambaffador being fet forth in a Feluca with
yi!l&gt;hc,i\n and (ome others, and having a good way out-gone Jnnetins Galley, made
with .ill (peed to Jujliniano, who fince they parted from him had fcarcely fpoken
to Dona, fo much was he taken up with the thought of Ifabella.    As foon as they
werencTr enough tobe underftood , they began to talk to him of triumph and
glory, lu^t having the patience to ftay till they were aboord the veffell to let him
f now the happy (iicccls of their voyage.  Dona anfwered this interrupted difcourfe
with  crycsofjoy; but y«/?/w;./w made it appear by the moderation ofhis, that
his liberty was not the terra of his defires; he received his friends for all that with
a great deal of civility, and without attending their further relation, he would
have rendred them thanksfor their careand affeftion, but they had too much to
fay 10 permit him to fpeak.    The Ambaffidor would have difcharged the Senates
Commillion; &gt;4/pW/9 would have acquanted him with the generofity ofhis fa¬
ther ; another would have dclcribed unto him the extafie of the people ; and mau-
ver the coldnefs of the Nation, the impatience they were into fpeak all together,
iiKiSe a confiilion amongft them, which yet kept not J«/?/«;.t;7e trom clearly per-
'civing, that his generoiity was acknowledged, and his grace figned. But where¬
as the t;alley ftill approached, Julitmano fayd, that it was not juft they ffiould ftay
from goingto meet thofe Illuftrious friends, who came to reftore him to life, in
J eftoring him to his liberty :  He commanded them to weigh Anchor, which being
piefeiitly executed, they made towards the Galley, that, carryed along with fayls

<p>for him as Sinibaldo had had ; and conjured him to ffiew him the fame favour.  On
the other fide Doria, though he were not well fatisfied with Andrea Prince olMeU
phi, nor with Jannetin his Nephew, yet carryed he himfelt curteoufly unto hint
and then went and received the civilities of his friends.   During all thefe careffes'
Jannetin defiring to   give fome mark of efteem and joy to Juftiniano, caufed a lar-
gcfs tobe diftributed amongft the flaves, to the end they might row with the more
fpeed.    Juftiniano received this gallantry very civilly, and withall affured the
flaves, that when he came home he would remember that they had brought him to
the Port, as accordingly he fent them the next day two thoufand Crowns.    As
foon as they approached to Genoua , all the veffels that were in the Port, having
received a commandment to ffioot off all their Cannon when Juftiniano (hould ap-
pcar, failed not to falute hini ; the Galley anfwered them with four peeces of
Ordnance, anda volley of Musket-ffior, and the like did all that were on the
walls.   If one would^dcfcriBc the number of Citizens that were at the Port, the
acclamations of joy,  the thronging that was there to fee thefe refufcitatcd men,
thetumult that was amongft them in ftriving who ffiould come neareft to their
Deliverer, it would almoft take up a volume that ffiould treat of nothing elfe; it
were better then, that amidft this popular crowd we ffiould conduft Juftiniano to
the Senate, followed by the Count of Lavagna, Jannetm, Dona, Alphonfo, and all
the Commanders ofthe veffels, as alfo the flave of ^o»/ir£', -whom Juftiniano had.
en joyned not to budge from him.   When firft they appeared, the Duke out of more
than an extraordinary favour advanced to receive him, after which he appointed
all the Senators to take their places, and then commanded the Regifter of the Se¬
nate to deface the Sentences which had been pronounced againft Juftiniano and Do-
riUyand to read the abolition of them, which was conceived In fuch gentle and
advantageous terms, as it plainly appeared, that even their crime dcferved more
glory than puniffimcnt:  The reading whereof being ended, the Duke began to af¬
fure Juftiniano in the name of the whole Affembly, that .after they had fatisfied the
pleafure of Soliman, yet held they not themfelves for all that acquitted towards
him; that the Senate in gencrall, and they allin particular, were refolved not to
ftay there, but to teftifie unto him with more utility ,   that they were not wor¬
thy ©f the benefits theyhad received from him; that they defired him alfo to raze
outof his memory, as he was razed out of their Records, the remembrance of
the fentences which had been given againft him and his friend.   To this Juftiniano
anfwered, that inbaniffiing him they had fatisfied Jufticc, and that in repealing
him they had rather (hewed their clemency than their equity; that the fervice
which he had rendered to the Republique, was not confiderable, feeing he had
done it but to fatisfie his duty; and that alfo, in acknowledgement of the grace it
had done him, he fwore folemnly alwaies to hazard both his fortune and life for
the intereft and glory thereof, fo often ai occafion ffiould prefent it felf foi^it:
This fayd, he turned him to Philippo Spmola,  and intreated him to pardon AU
phonfo tor his friendffiip towards him, and to belecve that it could never have
found place in his heart, had he not perfeftly known during his voyage, thatthe
death of his brother had made hira ffied more tears, dian he had loft bloud ; that it
his generofity would permit him utterly to deface out of his mind the refentracnt
of that unlucky accident; he befought him to adopt him for his fonne, and to at¬
tend from him the fame fervices, and die fame obedience, as he could have defired
from him of whom he was fo unfortunately deprived ; but if that contrarily
the apprehenfions of Nature did ftill ihvite him to revenge, he promifed to baniffi
himfelf voluntarily; and if that were not  yetenotigh, he would lubraitto the
greateft rigor of Jufticc.    P^r%.wasfomovedw.th this difcourfe, as if hehad
not already figned ihe grace of Juftiuiauo in coiifideratifon of his fon, he could not
have fSn doing it,and embracing hini; fo true it is that vertue hath powerfull

ing abfolutely refolved not to confer his eftate upon his heirs, before he was cer¬
tainly affured that he was dead. Asfor D.r/;t, theCount cou d not get himtogo
along with him, though he would have been glad to have paft the reft of the day
in the company of his friend, but his kinfraen carried him much againft his will
away with them, having firft condufted Jufttniano as well as all the reft, to the
Counts Palace, where every one departing, except fome few whom he retained at
dinner with Ju(ltniano,he led him to thechamber of Leonorahis wife, who recei¬
ved hira with a great deal of curtefie, and fodid Sophronia, Leonoraes fifter, which
was there with her. But as foon as civility permitted him to retire, he turned
all his thoughts to Monaco-; and whereas he faw that the neccffity of good manners
would hole! him three or four days at Genoua to receive and to return the vifits of
his friends, he refolved to feud thither the fame day, the rather for that he judged
it tit to underftand the Princeffes pleafure before he went toher; he propofed his
defign then unto the Count, and defired him to let him have one of his fervants
for to execute it,and to put Into his hands the Princeffes Officer,whom he had found
a flave at Conftant inople. The Count could not refufe him fo juft a requeft, but on¬
ly told him that he was to dine firft ; Whilft they vvere attable their converfation
was no other than asking Juftiniano queftions concerning his fortune, Vvhereunto
he ftill anfwered with fomuch addrefs, as without faying any thing againft the
uiith, he difcovcred nought that might prejudice him ; howbeit he recounted un¬
to them his grief and defpair, whenas he believed in Germany that IfabelU had
maried the Prince of ^/.?j/cr4«, as alfo that having taken a refolution to die , he
V vent and irabarqued himfelf upon the Baltique Sea;that there he was made a flave
was carried to ConftantmBple,and given to the Grand Signior, where Dm^ arri¬

know thathe had been Grand Vifier, nor how in thatChargehehaduiightily fer¬
ved Chriftendom, for fear left this aftion ffiould have been ill interpreted by them
that could not dive into the bottom of his heart. Dinner being done, luftiniano
dclired the Count to permit him to go and write in his Cabinet before he was

allthat which his refpeft, his joy, and his paffion had infpired hira with, he gave
his packet to a Gentleman, whom the Count had afiigncd him for it; he praved
him to go, and come again from Monaco, with all the fpeed that poflibly he could-
and to add moreover to that favour the obferving the aftions of IfabelU    at fuch

ous perfons of the City cametovifit him, with an extreme impatience to learn
from his own mouth the fuccefs of his adventures. But v\hilft he is fatisfying the
curiofity of fo fair an Affembly, and telling thcni things which we know as veil

that although one of them belonged tp the Princefs, yet was he not known   nor

Ifabella, that a Gentleman from the Q,ount of Lavagna, andangther, who were
newly arrived in a Barque, defired to fpeak with her, and that they had order to
deliver their meffage to none but her felf    She was at that time in her Cabinet
where flie had ffiut up her felf that day to read over all the Letters vvhich ffie had'
received from Juftiniano; ffie was vexed then to bc interrupted in an imploymenr,
that made up together bothherjoy and her grief; ffie comraanded notwithftan¬
ding that they ffiould be brought in : But when ffie came to know hira, vvhom ffie
had fent to feek luftiniano, ffie was fo furprized, and fo amazed, out ofthe opinion
fhe had that his voyage was in vain, as the apprchenfion thereof keeping her from
fpeaking, gave the Counts Gentleman opportunity to tell her, tha.t luftmiano had
given him in charge to prefent her with a Letter frora him. This difcourfe re¬
vived her fpirits for a while, but fearing ffie had not underftood him vvell,ffie made
that agreeable name vvhich touched her heart fo fcnhbly, to bc fpoken to her once
again; whereupon the Gentleman told her, that the paper he had prefented to her
vvould fatisfie her better than he could.    She caft her eyes then upon the Letter,

and whereas it was late, ffie got her to bed without eating anything, notwith¬

her complements to the Count his Mafter, and to affure y«//»;^w that he was at-

<p>He greateft crime that you are guilty cf towards me is, that you came m to tell me
that you felf,which you have written unto me; I know well notwith (landing thatthe
neccffity of your antient misfortunes hath conftramedyou to carry your fclf in this fort ; ht
lam not ignorant alfo, that love is not accuftomed to make fuch fat isfatl ton to foveraian
reafon; the defires, which it begets in an amorous foul, feem alwaies Htfl unto it, and how
reafonable foever we be, it is a paw to us to condemn that which pleafeth us ;  find it not
ftrange then, tf I fhould wi(h, that you had feen my firft franfports, they would have pain-
ted out fo well unto you my fidelity, as I jhould no longer be troubled to affure you    that
time hath not changed my heart ; that death alone can break my chains;  and that if I
had theEmpireof the whole world, I wouldpy ay youtoacce'ptofit with as much affeHi-
Oft, as I ojfer you my State : tt is a rewardwhtch I owyot:-, and not a grace which I do
you; and the onely grief which I have at this inftant is, to fee that I can do nothing
whereunto I am not obliged; fo that aU that I can do m this encounter is, to proteft unto
you, that did I not ow it to the life of my father, which you preferved ; to the promife
which he made you of it ; to that which you received from me ; to fo many miferies
which you have endured for my confideration; yet do I ow it to mine ownfehcity, feetnf it
is certain, that I cannot be perfeElly happy tf I be not jo with you ■■ it is a nectffity that
love hath impofed upon me, and which reafon doth not difapprove of.    Come then, my
dear ^u^iniano, to teftifie unto me, that my hopes are not illgrounded, that your conftan¬
cy ii' immoveable, that you ftill love your

<p>They who know, by experience the effefts of love, will eafily imagine that
which the fight ofthis Letter wrought in the foul of Juftinmr.o ; he had for all that
a domeftique enemy, which went alwaies traverfing his pleafures, by putting
him in mind that he was yet a flave at Conftant mople, though he appeared a free¬
man at Genoua In the mean time the Count fent him word how hebejceved he
had forgotten, that he was in his own houfe, and that it was he which wasto en¬
tertain and honour his friends there. This rtproath of gallantry obliged him ro
go in unto them,who all left him a little after,f xcept Vena, to give him liberty for
to think of his affairs; but whilft he was fetling his houfe, the Count fent him all
rhe money which he had received of his eftate in his abfence, with order tc&gt; his
Steward to render him an accompt of it. Juftiniano was fo amazed, both at his
own riches, and the generofity of his friend, as he had much ado to refolve to take
that which was his own ; howbeit fearing to do an outrage to the Count, inftead
of doing him a civility, he received his mony, but would not fuffer the Steward
howfoever to particularife anything ofhis affairs; telling hira only, that provided
he could affure him he gave him nothing of another bodies, it ffiould fuffice for the
nuking up ofhis accompt; that in the mean time to make fome acknowledgment
for the care he had taken to enrich hira,hc gave him twelve thoufand Crowns.This
man fearing a check from his Mafter,playd t}\i\egcniTofo as much as he could,and la¬
bored exceedingly not to accept ofa thing which he earneftly defircd:but at length
he muft obey the pleafure of Jujliniano, who thinking of nothing hut Monaco gave
order for the making him clothes againft the next day ; and not to loic time, after
he had defired the Counts Officer to proviilc him attendants, to make up his Train
with all poffible care and fpeed, he went forth with his dear Por/^ to render the
moft important ofhis vifit,^, to the end he might the day following fatisfie his de¬
fires. They imp oyed all that day then in ceremonies; they were at the Palace to
do their duty to the Dukc; they were at Andrea Doria'i to vifit Jannetin;ihey retur-
jied to the Count; and to be wanting in nothing Inftmiano would goe home to
Philippo Spinola, vihere he was received with fo many tcftimonies of generofity ,

and therefore had fent to affure him, that the next morning he ffiould have a Galley

away without thanking hira for it: And whereas his amorous impatience niade
hin/delue t., be alone, that he might at the leaft think of the Princefs, though he
could not yet fee her, he was much ffirprifcd, and exceedingly vexed, to finde as
great a company in his chamber, as that which he had met widi abroad; for al-

not be long firft. This complement being finiffied, every one retired fave Doria^
whowi I.Id not abandon our Lover, untill he had reftored him into thearmsof
his Miitris. The night paft away with a great deal of unquietnefs and impatience
f )v Jn'hniano; but whatfoever refolution he had taken to be gone by the break of
day, he re uld not get out ofGenoua before it was almoft noon. In the end he ira¬
barqued hinudl in the Galley which had been prepared for him, taking no more
With I.; r. nun hi J dear Por/^, and fbraeof the Counts people for to ferve him: He
had at that inftant fo extraordinary a joy out of the thought that the term of fo
f!r&gt; t a navigation ffiould be the fightof7/^^tf//4, as it reflefted in his face,vvas feen
in hi  eyes, appeared in his difcourfe, ffiewed it fclf in all his aftions; and one
would have thought, that he went out of flavery in going out of Genoua, and that
Monaco wa$ not only the place of his birth, but that he was attended there to be
dec tared the Conqueror of all Natious, to receive the honor ofa Triumph, and to
mount into a Throne; that he was alfo expefted by the Princefs for to be crowned,
not by the hands of fortune, but by thofe of love. And whereas he had not fo much
ambition, as defire to be beloved, the Empire of allthe Earth could not have given
him a joy fo fenfible,as that ofthe heart of Ifabella. This Princefs imagining right¬
ly, that Jufliniano would not be long before he came to fee her, had given order at
the Port, that as foon as a Galley ffiould be difcovered from Genoua--vilrdy ffie
fhould be advertifed of it, being perfwaded that they would not let lufl-iniano come

<p>thorough the midft of them, and fo he marched till he came to the Portall of the
Caftle , where the Princefs attended him.    When as firft he appeared ffie advan¬
ced to receive him, fo that to fave her fome ftepps, and to follow his inclination,
he went as faft as poffibly he could, and kiffed her roab.    It  was at this  inftant
that thofe  perfeft Lovers felt that which cannot be expreft ; and albeit they
had refolved on both parts to contain themfelves,   and had alfo prepared their
minds for the making of fome complement to one another in this incounter,
their filence,   and then  their interrupted difcourfes , made it apparent to all
that beheld them ,  that excefs of pleafure excited fuch a trouble in their foules,
as would not permit them to exprefs all that they thought; but to conceal this
agreeable tranfport from the eyes of her fubjefts, the Princefs caufed luftinia¬
no to enter , after ffie had falutcd Doria with a gteat deal of civility :  When
they were arrived at Ifabellaes chamber, all that had accompanied thera were
obliged by refpeft   to withdraw,  two or three excepted, which remained to
entertain Doria , whilft the Princefs talked with Juftiniano.    Never were two
hearts rcpleniffied with fo much joy;   never had two fpirits more charming
tranfports; and never did two amorous perfons' fo perfeftly exprefs the mo¬
tion-; of their foules by their onely lookes ; they faid both of them together,
and at one inftant , that they had alwaies   loved one onother; that they ftill
loved  one another;   and that they Would love one another eternally: But af¬
ter this dumb language had made all their apprchenfions to pafs from one heart
to another, Juftiniano began to render the Princefs thanks  for all her   goodnefs
towards him ;   but ffie, not able to fuffer the continuanceof this difcourfe, con¬
jured him  to remember,   that their interefts could not be feparated ,  and that
owing him   all things it was unjuft to thank her;   efpccially having done no-
thing'^for him ,   than what ffie coifld not chufe but doe ;   namely to weep for
his abfence,  to fear his changing , to apprehend his lofs, and to renounce afl
the pleafures of this life, fince ffie could not have that of feeing him.    Jujli¬
niano anfviered thevennto,  that this neccffity ,  which ffie had impofed upon her
felf, was fo fair a mark of her affeftion, and fo glorious for him , that unlefs
he ffiould be the moft ingratefull of men,  he was obliged to thank her eter¬
nally ; As for the reft, her teares being of fo ineftimable a price , ffie muft not find
it ftrange, if being  unable to render her any fervice that could  merit that
honor , he refolved at leaft to tell her often,  that he knew well he was unwor-
of it.    This converfation was interrupted by the Sergeant-major of the Ga-
rifon    who according to the  commandment which the  Princefs had   given
him for it ,   came to demand the word of Jufttniano ^ this GaUanterie fur¬
prifed him as pleafingly, as the  former which had been done  him upon his
landing at the Port; and as he was no lefs civill, than J/^M/^ was obliging,
he faid unto her with a low voice, and beholding her with eyes full of love,
and refpeft, that a man ,  who knew not how to rule his defires,   and that would
die her Slave , was not in a ftate to command others:   But what reafon foe¬
ver he could allege,  he muft obey Ifabellaes pleafure ; yet was it not for all
that but upon condition, that ffie ffiould give the word as well as he,  and.
that he ffiould   not, but after her,   finiffi this myfteric of Warre,   which at
this time was abfolutely guided by love.   For as if thefe two illuftrious per¬
sons had agreed together about this gallanterie, the word ,   which the Princefs
Lave to the  Sergeant-major , was found to be Jt^ftintano-   and that  whi^
%ullintano gave, after he had long refufcd to doeit, was the fair name of//4-
iella     This conformiticoffpirkandthought was equally pleafing tmtothctn;
forthough they knew not what each of them had faid,  yet did  they undcrftand
i^by a cXkment between them; for Jufituiane affured the Princefs, that raauj

to fee her he would obey her with joy, her prefence having
this partkular charm, that ihc rendred all places alike a-

ing ffiort, they quickly arrived whither they were to go; whereat firft their talk
was of the beauty of the place, of the fituation thereof,  of the ornaments which
had been added to its naturall graces, and other indifferent things; but as foon as

an hearing her talk ; but at length, feeing that this reafon did not content her, he
yeelded unto it. They entred then into a great green Arbor, which on the one fide

livered : Yet was it not they whom deftiny relerved for this fuprenie difc^race- fo'
the Baffa having moderated his fiiry, would have our lives once more depend' ab¬
folutely upon the caprichioufnefs of fortune ; he ordained then, that cf thirty
which we were, no more than three ffiould fuffer; and the lot fo favoured the d- -
fire I had to die, that I was one of thofe unhappy men, according to the fenfe of
othcrsjthough in mine own heart I was ofa con trary opinion.The two that proved
ray companions in this fad adventure, were without doubt the worthieft of all the
flaves, they were young, handfom, and courageous, and even fuch as the very Ex-
cutioners themfelves, who were to take away our lives, had fome regreet to
fee, that chance had made a choicefo unjuft according to their thinking, fothat
one of them moved with compaffion, went and advertifed the Baffa, that in lolin;*
us he would lofe th e propercft flaves that ^vere in Cenftantinople, and the fitteft to
make a prefent of to his Highnefs.    The Baffa, who repented him already of his
violence, inregard of his own intereft, and yet defired that fome one of us ffiould
be puniffied, refolved at length for the laft catt, that of wc t/jree butoneflienJd
dye, and that according to the firft order, chance ffiould ftill be the abfolute niaftcr
of our life or of our death.    The lot was not more favourable to me in this la(t
incoiinrer, than in all the former, and I was the facrifice deftined for the publiquc
f feiy ; I was then prefently bound more ftraitly than before;  they made nie my
felf carry the preparations of my puniihment; and without boafting 1 can avow,
that I  faced death with tranquillity enough : 1 dare not almoft fay, that in this
wofull eftate you were the only objeft of my thought, yet it is true how I imagi¬
ned, that this obftinacy of fortune, in chufing me ftill to be ("acrififed, was an c'^t^
of your defire, and that fhe did not judge rae unworthy to live, but becaufe yoii
judged rae unworthy of your affeftion.    In the end I received this fentencc, as if
it had been pronounced by you, and in that thought I wenttoray puniffimcnt with
fo much refolution, as bred wonder and compalTion in them that beheld me.   As
for my felf, I was far from being afflifted at mine own proper miferies; I had
fome delight in my fetters and chains; and the very fight of death could not keep
mc frora having forae happy raonients; for my love, doing its laft and utterniult
indeavour, in following me to the grave, perfwaded me, that if you had feen the
fame Juftiniano, upon whom at other times you had accunnflated glory, be ready
to yeeld up the ghoft in adoring you, with the moft cruell torraents that the rage
of tyrants hath ever invented, you would at leaftwife have breathed fcJrth fome
fighs, and ffied forae tears.    The Princefs, not able to endure that he thould cunci-
jiucthis difcourfe any longer, fomuch trouble did this deadly image excite in her
foul, affured hira with a great deal of tcndernefs, andher eyes full of tears, that
this narration touched her   fo fenfibly, as albeit (lie could not doubt but that he
had cfcaped this perill, yet could ffic not chufe but be in fear for hini, and feel fiich

<p>many things of my conftancy and refolution to Soliman, as it begot a defire m him
to fee me; io that fending a coraraand to deliver me, I received order by a Truche-
man to go unto the Grand Signior.   Totell you , Madam , what this change
wron-ht^in me would be to no end, fince it is eafie for you to judge, that he, who
fo much defpifed lite, received it not with much joy; and I dare fay, that 1 ftood
in more need of conftancy to refolve to live,  than another would have had to re¬
folvc to die : Howbeit Iwent to his Highnefs, and whatfoever averfion I had from
life, yet did InuL forbear rendring him thanks for granting it to me. When firft I
appeared before Solimanhe began'to fpeak to me; for whereas he knew before that
\\\.\s of Italy, he beleeved that I would underftand a language, which at Couftan-
f/wop/f they caU the fr^w^^toung, and fpoken there by every one for the commo-
ditic of commerce, and which alfo I underftood perfeftly, becaufe it is no other
than r, corrupted Italian.    It was not,forthat this Prince, out of an extraordinary
curiofity proper to thofe of his Nation, is not acquainted, not onely with allthe
Orientall tongues, but with the Spanifh, the French, and the Italian ; howbeit in re¬
gard he doth not exercife them, he underftands them only, without being able to
fpeak them with facilitie: neverthelefs I muft for the prefent except the laft,which
in confideration of rae he learned afterwards very perfeftly.    It was then in that
laiiguage,wherof 1 have fpoken, that he demanded of me whence I was, what was
my birth and profellion, and by what adventure I came into the power of the Baffa
S:rAn.    \ anfwcrcd him that I was a poor Italian Gentleman, whofe life had no¬
thing', remarkable enough wherewith to entertain fo great a Prince; and that the
only char.ccof Warhadmademea flave at Argier, where the Baffa had bought
me not long after.   1 confefs 1 had fomewhat ado to difguife the truth, but being
refolved that I would never be heard fpoken of more, I did not tell what I Was,
foi tear if it had been known, and that it had been difcovered hovv I could have
given a (iifficient great ranfora, intelligence would have been fent to Genoua ofmy
being atConftantmople.   Soliman told me then, that I had fomething in the air of
my tace, that ffiewed me greater than I had delivered my felf to be, and that all the
rules of phyfiognomy were falfe, or I had not fpoken fincerely unto him.    I recei-
\cd this dffcourfe with a great deal of refpeft and modefty ; aker which he talked
tojne ofthccuftoms of my country, of war, of fordfications, and when he percei¬
ved by my antwers that I was not abfolutely ignorant,though in diis occafion I was
not forward lo ffiew my ielf very knowing, or of any great wk ; there is notanv

<p>an obltinate rage to perfecute me, when it fees that I am refolved for the greateft
misfortunes, and that death paffeth with me for a foveraign good, it withdrawcs
me from that Port, which I held to bemoft fecure, to expofe me to the tempefta-
gain by apparent felicities: But it may be too ( faid I further fighing) that there is
fome juftice in its crueltic; the temerity which I have had to love, and to hope to
be beloved f.fthcmoft admirable perfon that ever will be, is not yet fufficiently
pnniffircJ; grief, defpair, exile, imprifonmcnt, and certainty of death, arc not tor¬
ments proportionable enough to my crime, which being infinite,demands alfo an
cttrn .11 chaftifement: Lctus fuffer then ( condnued I ) fince the incomparable Ija¬
bella is not fatisfied, and let us accent of the life, which isgiven us for apunifli-
mcnt, and not fora grace. It was afterthis manner. Madam, that I refolved to re¬
ceive all that fortune prepared for me, with a defign no longer to oppofc my
xeafon againft her humors, and blindly, and without refiftance, to obey this invifi-
ble power, which mocks all human prudence; which puts us into the Port upon
the point of fuffring ffiipwrack ; which precipitates us from the top of happinefs
Into the abjfme of mifery j which ovcrturnes Thrones; which dcftroyes King-
domes; which caufes Kings to die; and to fay all in a word, which foveraignly dit-
pofes of the whole Univerfe. This refolution being ftrongly cftabliffied in my mind,
Ifoundmoretranquillity inmy fclf;andthoughl was alwaies infinitelyfad, yet
for all that it is certain, that my melancholy was more fociable; and to fpeak truth,
it was in feme fort neceffary that I fliould find my felf in this eftate; for Soliman fai¬
led not to fend for mc the next day to talk with hira; and this fecond converfatio n
havingfatisficdhiinmorcthan the firft, there paft not a dayafterthat, whcreini
had not the honor to confer with him: Hiftory, War, Geography, the Mathema-
tiques. Painting, and Mufick were the fubjeftof thefe entertainments: And where¬
as this Prince loves the Sciences paffionately, and that the Orientall people are
notatthisdayadifted to them, he was raviffied to fee that one of his Slaves was
notignorant in all thefe things; fo that I may fay with truth, that there was not a
man in all his Empire , whom he efteemed more than my felf. In the mean time I
am to let your Exccllencic underftand, fince you will know all my fortune, thac

ihen, that Zdebis, the Chief ofthis fedition,being fallen fick ,  had forfaken the
Camp, and was redred into the Capitall City of 7V&lt;«to/w, with the beft Troops ot
liis Army; whereof 5o/fw^« having been advertifed, he refolved to go andbefiege
him; notdcrbting but if he could get hira into his hands he ffiould eafily prevail
overall the reft. This defign, having been approved of, was not long before it was
executed; wc marched direftly to this City ; approches to it are made; trenches
are caft lip, batteries are raifed;   and in a few daies the avenues   to it are fo well
clofed lip, as it is impoflible for any body to goe in or out.   At length, to abridge
this narration, Zellebts, being in a (hort time ieco\ered , defended himfelf focoii-
ragfoudy, that after he had fuftained three affauks w ith great lofs of ours,   the be-
fieged were ftill in cafe to make fallies every day, which extreniely incommodated
om Army.  During all thefe paffages 1 had divers times befought his Highnefs to
permit me to venture my life for his lei vice, which 1 could not obtain, oecaufe a
Slave is not fuffred to bear armes: I lived then in this fort with a great deal of vex-
.uion, tofee my fclf in a (hamefull idlenefs atluch a time,   when as occafions were
foi^itcn prefented, wherein I might have dyed Nobly.  As I wasinthis njelancho-
Ivahe Grand-Signior, being much incenfed to fee this Town hold out fo long,
1 el' dved that his Army llioulcd periffi there, or t arry it by force; and for that effeft
he caufed a generall aflault to be given: And though there were a body ofthe enc-
n.ierAimy in the field ,  he commanded neverthelefs that they ffiould not carefo
much tor the ruard of thcTrenches, as for the attacquing ofthe place; and the rea¬

our fouldiers hearts Soliman, who was prefent at this fight for togivcdireftion in

<p>followed only by two thoufand Janifaries, but he was quickly cleared in it, for he
had not marched fifty paces, but that he faw the reft of his fouldiers come in dif¬
order, having avoided the fury of the enemy, who was purfuing them ftill.   5*//-
man no longer doubted then but that this was Zellebts his Array which attacqued
his Camp ; and being a Prince of a great and generous fpirit, he purpofed to fight
with them : But as he was ready to march direftly to the enemy, he was much fur¬
prized to behold from the Towns fide, that not only his fouldiers had abandoned
the affault, but that Zellebis in the head of thofe of Chientaya, went beating them
before him in a terrible diforder. As for me, who always followed the Prince with¬
out other arms than a light chain, which 1 wore on one of my legs, I affurcdly be¬
lieved that he was loft, as indeed without almoft a fupernaturall affiftancc it is cer»
tain that he could not have cfcaped: He was clofed up in the midft ofhis ene¬
mies, his Army was difperfed, fear had feized upon his Troops, and if an advanta¬
gious plot of ground had not been met withall to put part of his Forces,  and his
Perfon in fafety, this mifchief had been v/ithcut remedy. But, Madam, muft 1 tell
you how it was by my means, that this day, fo unlucky in the beginning, had a glo¬
rious end.? Yes, Madam, I muft tell it you, and fince my valor was but an etfeft of
my defpair, and that you were the caufe thereof, it is juft to let you underftand
how it was by you that I faved both thelife, and the glory of great Soliman.   Re¬
member then, if you pleafe, this verity in the procefs of this Narration, to the end
I may not be accufed of vanity in delivering things which I had not executed
without you: I ffiall tell you then. Madam, that in this univerfall diforder I
conferved fo much judgement to obferve, that on the left hand of that quar¬
ter where we were, there was a place which Nature had fo well fortified, as with
very little defence it was impoffiblc to be forced; I advanced then boldly to ffic
Grand Signior,andmaugre thcprcfsllethim fee what I had already noted, and
caufed him to perceive,that in attending the rallying ofhis troops he might be there
not only in affurance, but in an eftate to keep thofe ofthe town from joyning with
them that were without.This advice having fatisfied him, he comraanded to go and
feiz on that plot;but as if the enemy had been acquainted with this defign he advan¬
ced to difpute it with us. There it was. Madam, that I ceafed to be flave for to be a
foldier,for having taken a fcimitar which I found amongft the dead bodief,I got in¬
to the head of our troops, with fo much refolution ,&amp; fo much good fortunc,as I did
things there which I dare not relate: in the cnd,Madara,I infpired our foldiers with
fuch valor,as reafuming courage wc repulfed the cnemy,8c feized on the place,where-
of I have already fpoken to you.But when I faw Soliman in fafety,! went and caft my
felf amidft fome of our forces, which were fighting ftill with thofe that were come
out of the City ; and perceiving that our fouldiers were preparing to flic, in hope
to get to the place where 5&lt;j/&lt;w^» was, I threatned to kill them if they returned
not to the fight: This fo extraordinary a difcourfe being feconded by fome effefts,
which fecmed marvellous unto them, they refolved to follow me: Behold mc then
the head of this couragious Brigade, whom I condufted fo fortunately, as I made
them carry that in two hours, which a whole Army could not do in fix weeks be¬
fore   At laft. Madam, being refolved to periffi,or do fome great matter, I fo hotly
Durfued the enemies, that after we had killed a great number of them, made tfic
reft to flie, and put fear into all the remainder, I drove them even into their town,
where being emred alone with them, certainly I performed things, which made mc
olainly fee, that defpair is more powcrfuller than vafor ; but whatfoever I couJd
Eave done, doubtlefs I ffiould have fallen there if I had not called to niinde, that
the breach being abandoned, I might through that place ""^^ °"^^°^i"/^

die Arms of the Empire in it, their courage began to abate, and foon after to give

jlmiild not ha/zard a Battell, for that the Town was loft, fothat they retired; and

Qaarters.    After this he made a fign for every one to withdraw; I would have o-
byed like thereft, but he let me know that this Commandment extended not to
r :, and that he dehred I ffiould ftay with him.  It was then, Madam, that Soliman
f). rni&lt; untedmyinfenfibility,by forcing me to begin to ferve him with amity, and
iiot v^ith ahmpleacknowledgeraent, as I had done before; and indeed to fpeak
truth, one muft have renounced all reafon not to have been moved with fo much
generoiity.   He intreated me not as his Slave; he fpake not to me as to his inferi-
cur ; he care [fed me not as his equall, but as if I had been an hundred degrees
ihove h'ni, both in my birth, in my merit, and in my valour: And to teftifie unto
i.ie that thiod'fcourfe was not a flattery wherewith he meant to recorapcnce me, he
fware to me that it would be long of me if I did not reign in his Empire as abfo-
b'.tcly as he himfelf, and conjured rae to furnifli him with the means for it, becaufe
without me he fliould be conftrained to be ingratefull, fortune being fo much his
enemy, £.s he could not do goiid to the only man he loved, if I were not willing
to it   lib.    At laft, Madam, after an hundred of the moft conjuring proteftations
ih'uc.nbe imagined, and afterhehad prayed mc above an hundred times not to
think ill of him for the propofition he was going to make me , he undertook to
periwademeto quit my Religion for to imbrace his, becaufe, faid he, without
that he r-iuft be ingratefull, 1 muft be a flave, and he muft likewife be the moft un-
happy.;t men, there not being a more cruell adventure (^continued he} for a ge¬
nerous Prince, than not to be able to recompence a gallant aftion, and tobecon-
ftraineuto leave a perfon in fervitudc whom he loves, and whom he eftceras fo
much, as to divide his Empire with him.    After that this Prince had faid all that
generofity and affeftion could make one to fay in a like encounter, I befought him
not to afflift himfelf unjuftly,fince I was going to give him the means to recorapcnce
nie,not only for the fervices I had rendred hira,but for all thofe which I ffiould ren¬
der him in time to come. Hereupon fuch a joy appeared inhis face,as fully affured
mc that he had expreffed the meaning ofhis heart; but it continued not long,when
as 1 humbly defired him to reftore me my chains, and to leave mc to the liberty of
my Religion;that I demanded irons of him,to teftifie that I would not go out ofhis
fervice,&amp; that I befought him not to ask any more of me a thing, which I would uot
doe for the poffeffion ofthe Empire ofthe whole world, for fear i ffiould be infor-
ced to difplcafe and difobey him. What ! faid Soliman unto me, ffiall I give chaines
to my   Deliverer ? ffiall I retain him ftill to be a Slave that raakes rae to reign?
ffiall I bind the hands ofhim that hath crowned rae &gt; and with a ftrange injuftice
fhall 1 make him a captive that hath made me viftorious^  No, no, it ffiallnotbe
faid, that I could not recorapcnce them, that have ferved me, but with a fliamcfufl
fervitude: The demand, which thou haft made me, is worthy of thy generofity, but:
this recompence would be unworthy of Soliman. He had queftionlefs proceeded fur¬
ther, had he not obferved my countenance to change, andfearing thathe had dif-
plcifed me, he began  to ask mc pardon, when as I perceived that I was wounded
in the left arm by the blood that trickled out of the fleeve of my habit,' fo that
doubting that I would fall into a fwoon he called in company ;   and notwithftan¬
ding any thing I could fay he would nccdes fee my wound fearched, which was not
found dangerous, but which might have been fo ,  had the dreffing of it been any
longer leiaidcd. It is a ftrange thing that I did not perceive it, andifthepro-
pc tion    which Soliman made unto me,    had  not moved me fo violently,
as t'. make my wound burft out a bleeding,  I believe   that I had gone away
without heeding it.   Soliman caufed nicto be caried into a Tent, withfo great a
care, as one would have faid, that on the confervation ofmy life depended that
of his.    I began then to beno longer regarded as a Slave, but as the favourite of
the   Emperor;   every  one  obferved and careffed me,   and even he that had
bought mc, that had laid rae in irons, and had condemned rae to die, was one of the
moft carefoll ofmy health.    In the mean time Soliman entred the&gt; next day into the
Town with all the ceremonies of a Prince, that is Vanquiffier ofhis rebclhoL-s lut.-

<p>X Mch avarice and vioknce had baniffied from them; they threw down ffieir .rm '
and craved pardon; howbeit there were forae of them, who fearing to rendcS
v.-a-cb they had taken away, made ftrange Propofitions: But theGrand Vfficr hr
ing wife and prudent, thought it would be better to make them hope forGrfr^"
than to make them ftand indread of chaftifement, for fear left putting them in de
ipair they ffiould be carried again to fome new violence. He promifed them then
to (peak to the Grand Signior for thera, and to affure hira that the newsof his
death had fo afflifted them, as not able to be revenged on thofe who they believed
tiadcaufecl it, they would at leaft be revenged on the enemies ofhis Religion* This
difcourfo began to calm their fpirits, and whereas this multitude feeras always in
luch like encounters to have but one foul, which makes thera operate, though thev
be compofed of perfons of different thoughts, they foffered themfelves at length to
be perfwaded that their crime ffiould not only be unpuniffied, but alfo be recom-
pencedj as a mark oftheir zeal and affeftion.  In the mean time the Grand Vifier
difpatched away with fpeed to Solman to advertife hira of this diforder, and to be¬
fecch his Highnefs if his affairs would permit it, toreturn unto Conftantinople,for
tear fome newfedidon ffiould arife there; how it was unlikely, diat the Chrifti¬
ans, Jewes, and fuch Turks as had been plundered, ffiould not complain of the out¬
rage had been done them, and that thefe complaints ffiould not be purfued with a
i5ew mifchief : He informed him alfo, that the affairs of Hungary went not very
well, and that his prefence was neceffary for the good of thingl.  Soliman received
this unpleafing news with a great deal of grief, being ferry to leave the viftory o-
ver Zellebis to another, howbeit he judged his return to be of too great importance
to be deferred; fo that after he had given the command of the Array to the Baffa
Sinan, and inftrufted him with the order thathe would have him to hold, we de-
paitedfor   Conftantmople with as little company aspoffibly we could, to theend
the Army might not be weakned, I fay we departed. Madam, for fince that fortu¬
nate day whcreinray defpair was foadvantagious for rae, I was infeparablefrGm
Soliman ; I had a part in all his fecrets, he told rae all his thoughts, and my advi¬
ces, and my counfells made up moft of his retolutions.   His return^ to Cenftantino¬
ple produced many effefts there, he gave joy to the innocent, fear to the guilticjand
hopetothe Jewes ard Chriftians; andtruly all thefe apprehenfions were not ill
grounded, for he rewarded thofe that had been faithfull unto him; he feverely pu¬
niffied the feditious; he caufed all that had been taken from the Jew^s and Chri¬
ftians to be reftored to them ; he made their Chappells and their Houfes to be re-
edified; and for their goods which they had been robbed of, and could not be
found, he paid them with his own money. After this , Madam, tranquillity was
more folidly cftabliffied in Conftant inople, than it was before ; yet did not the Em¬
peror judge it fit to return into Natelia by reafon the affairs of Hungary would not
fuffer him to be fofar abfented from it. During this intervall I had the honor to
talk every day with Soltman, and to receive fo many marks of his amity, as I could
no longer refufe him mine; but whatfoever good will he bore rae Of I ™ay be
permitted to fpeak fo) he could not forbear perfwading me to be of his Religion,
whercunto I fb ftrongly oppofed my felf, in letting hira fee the ridiculous errors
which it teacheth,as not able to raake him angry with mc, I forced him many dnics
to laugh at them. In the mean time it hapned, that one morning he fent an extra¬
ordinary exprefs for me, and juft as I entred into his chamber, a Baffa, named Ru-
ftan, who hath maried a daughter of Solimans, and is a cunning and dextrous man,
entred in alfo with me: When I was come in,Seliman told mc,that hehad bought a
pifture of a Merchant, that was come from Tauris, which he would ffiew me, for to
know whether he had not been cozened, and whether it were true ihat he had skill
in painting: He gave mc then a cafe covered with Diamonds, which I opened
with fo great a tranfport, as if Solman had had a quiet fpirit he had perceived ir;
for. Madam, if one may fay, without blafphemy, that there is any thing in the
world which doth rcfcmbleyou, k is certainly this pourtrait;  and whereas the
pifture which you gave me was taken from mc, I believed at firft that it was it.

how I had at leaft this advantage, that he confeffed I had reafon, and that he would

1 had more civilities than I dcferved. Howbeit 5o/;»/^« was conftrained a little af¬
ter the departure of Ruftan to interrupt his amorous thoughts, for to think ofthe
affairs of Natolia, ij^hich fince his return to ConftantinopievJere very much changed-
for as foon as Zellebis had been advertifed by his Spies, that the Emperor was de¬
parted, he took as much care to joyn with his enemy, as he had ufed before to a-
voidhim : And yfihereasSinan had order to give battell, when occafion ffiould
ferve-for it, the two Armies were not long before they incountred together. If one
ffiould alwayes judge of the event of the fight by the number of the Souldiers, it
is certain th"t the Baffa would have vanquifficd Zellebts, who had a great many
fewer than he, but he was fo unfortunate, and according to fome, of fo fittle under¬
ftanding, that he let the enemies Army take all the advantages of the field, whe¬
ther it were for the fituation, or the wind, which drave all the duft and the fnioke
in the faces of ours, whereby they we're extremely incommodated.  It hapned alfo
that when the Battell began, the Sun was covered with clouds, fo that the Baffa Si¬
nan not having obferved on which fide it wzz..   cr not having fore-feen that it
might break forth,he placed his fouldiers with their eys juft againft it,who foon af¬
ter perceived that this light which blinded them, kept them oftentimes frora being
able either to ftrike their enemies, or to avoid their blows. At laft5Madam,the Sun
cleared the defeat of the Baffa, and the triumph of Zellebts, and the Emperors Ar¬
my,was fo routed, as in above eight day? after a thonfand fouldiers were not found
together.    This news very much afflifted Soliman, and whereas I was the only con¬
fident of his pleafure, and of his grief, I received order to come unto hira ; but 1
was fcarcely entred into his Cabinet, when as he fell to asking of me, whether 1
would have him diflionoured ? Whether I had refolved to let that be loft which
I had gotten ? Whether I had taken the Capitall Town of Natolia to ferve for a
retreat to a coward, which had blemiffied the glory ofhis Arms":" For at length,
faidhe unto me , the Baffa .&lt;&gt;/!^4» is retired thither, after he hath loft a battell, and
after lie hath kt mine enemy take the Arms of the Empire : Now judge, Ibrahim,
condnued he, what I am to attend from thee; thy vaJor hath once already cfta¬
bliffied ray glory, it is again by thee that I muft hold it; from thy hand it is that
I will have the head of Zellebts, and from thy arm that I look for viftory: Oppofe

tor the conqueft of all the world : But it is too much importuning thy Highnefs
to a&lt;k a juft thing of thcc with fo many reafons; and it is, as ic were, to commit a
crime to raake any doubt of obtaining it. Soliman heard me with agrcat deal of
iinquietncls,and whenl had done fpeaking he was a pretty while without anfwe¬
ring me : And although the thoughts of men arc hard to be known, yet I well
obferved, that chokr, reafon, and amity reigned fucceffively in his heart;   but at
length, after he had di/putcd with himiclf, he faid unto rae with fomewhat a more
quiet countenance. That not being able to change his mind, nor being able like-
wife to rid himfelf of the affeftion he bare rae, he had found out an expedient
which I could not refufe him, unlefs I were refolved to incur his hatred;'and
which he would grant nie, if the 3/«p/;n, who  is the bead of their Religion,
thought he might do it without offending the Prophet. He propounded then unto
mc, only to take the habit of the Turks, To the end that being believed to be fo  he
mi-htconkrChargcsuponmc, .and keep rae about him: And to perfwade'the
people that I had changed ray Religion, he would fo order k, that the Muphti
Ihuiild aflure all the world, that he had performed the ceremony of it in private in
thcMolqueot the Seraglio; that he was confident this raan loved his head too
well to reveal a fecret ot fo great importance ; tJiat in the mean dme I might live
a t .hi iltian under the habit of a Muffulman, and render hira the happieft Prince of
the Earth. I contef^, that I had more ado to anfwer to this laft propofition. than
tothe. titer; howbeit 1 requefted hira to remember,thatdiffimulation was not to
go fo tar as to the Alt.irs; that ovc and war did many times permit foch thing,
but that Religion required much fincerity ; and that in the fame which I profcK

<p>fhould make no further reply unto him ; that allthe grace he could do me was to
permit me to go and confult with the Patriarch of Cenftantinople, and the Religi¬
ous men of Pera, about an occafion wherein they had as much intereft as I • for it
maybe, faid he unto me, after I have favoured them fomuch in confideration of
thee, I may very well deftroy them for the fame caufe , and on them revenge my
felf of thy infenfibility, and ofthe anger I am in for that I cannot leave loving
thee, to the end thou mightft puniffi thy felf: But go, continued he, and let mc
hear thy laft refolution within two dayes: for otherwife I ffiall be able to take one
which may make thcc repent, that thou haft fo ill acknowledged the affeftion that
I fiiil bear thee, maugre thy obduratencfs.    When he had given over fpeaking, I
withdrew with a profound refpeft, and confidering with my felf what I had to do,
it fcemed juft unto mc not to rely upon mine own proper fenfe in a matter of fo
great importance.    Thofe menaces of 5'o/wm?; would not have ffiaken me, had
they been addreft to noi.e fave my felf,  but the fear of involving fo greata number
of innocents in a mifchief, which ought not to have regarded any but me, made
me refolve to have recourfc unto the reafon of c thers, mine not being free enough,
nor fufficiently difintcreffed to operate juftly in  this incounter.   The averfion
which I had for life, being abfent from you, helped to perfwade me too, that my
Religion permitted not that which was defired of me. I affembled then the Patri¬
arch of the Greek Church, and his principall Calviers , for the Latin is not yet
eftabliffied in Conftantinople ; and whereas I had feen them oftentimes after I was
there, I propounded the matter unto them, with all the circumftances which I bc-
1-ieved was neceffary to tell them, to the end they might thel)ctter undcrftand the
importance of the affair: I let thera know the extrenie affeftion which Solman
bare me; the menaces he ufed againft thera in confideration of me ; the promifes
I had received from him if I did that which he defired ; at laft I expofed the mat¬
ter fincerely unto them juft as it had paft, and without difguifing ray fenfe I gave
them to underftand, that provided they might bc in fafety, I ffiould bc glad they
would find that I could not fatisfie Solimanhutviith the lofs ofmy life. They be¬
gan a difpute then, which lafted a good while; they would nottruftto their me¬
mories, but would look over their books, and not judge turaultuoufly ofthe affair.
The opinions wercdivided for an hour and more, anJeitherfide feemed to have
very ftrong reafons to maintain their party; but in the end the Patriarch told them,
that as amongft us we daily fee religious men fent foa-th in the habit of Merchants,
or Gavaliers,forthe converdng offouls,fo the fame difguiferaent raightbe permit¬
ted to one, provided it were for the fame caufe, and that the fole intereft of Chri¬
ftendom carried me to this deceit, which certainly would bring me to happinefs
in heaven, and to glory on earth, if Icould refolve to execute it generoufly; that
the power which I had over the fpirit of Soliman, might peradventure be fo great,
as to make him doubt of his Religion; that it may^be his convcrlion raightbe
referved for inc; and that if this ffiould happen, it would render the greateft fer¬
vice to Chriftendom that ever was rendred unto it ; that thereon peradventure
depended the fafety of an hundred thoufand perfons; and that in conclufion his
advice was, that I could not fail in this occafion.   This opinion being become ge¬
ncrall amongft them, they conjured mc to fubmit my fenfe to theirs, in Satisfying
Sol,man,and that they would ingage their confcknces to me, that mine ffiould be
difcharged of allfault in this incounter, fo as I let not ray felf be blinded with
frcarnefs, and that the proteftion of Chriftendom were the only motive that car¬
ried me to this difguiferaent.  I did what I could to oblige them to change their
advicc • I made an hundred objeftions, and an hundred demands to them ; 1 told
them, diatalthoughlffiouldnotbeararmsagainftChriftendoni, as I was fully re¬
folved not to do, yet I ffiould not alwayes forbear hurting it, if I icrvcd   n oth r

As foon as the Sultan faw me, he came to me, .uid beholding rae with a fixed eye,

giving him leave to fpeak to me, I affu: ed him that I came to obey hira, Provided

fooner faid thus but that without knowing what I would have , this Prince aflu-
ved me that they were granted unto rae; I befought him then to hear me firft, to
the end that orecipitadng nothing I might never give him occafion to complain
ofm-     A ttt^r he had given me the liberty to fay what I would to him, 1 humbly
re.iiielied him not to take it ill, that being his Slave I ffiould be fo bold, as to capi-
ii.l'ne with him, and give bounds to his Authority; for, my Lord, faid I unto him,
I do not confent unto this difguifement, which thy Highnefs defires of me, but up¬
on condition that thou ffialt never fpeakto me to putthat in effeft, which I am go-
ini^'todoinffiew; that thou wilt permit rae to have always about me in die habit
o{a Slave, a Prieft ofmy Religion, whom I will procure to come from one ofthe
Hands of the Archi-pelago; and that which is the moft important, that thou ffialt
never command me to bear Arms againft Chriftendom : If any of thy Subjefts,
faid I to hira further, ffiall rebcll, as Zellebis-fif thou wik conquer Perfia; if any o-
ther of thy Neighbours that is not Chriftian, ffiall oblige thee to make war upon
hira, or if thou wik render thy felf Mafter of all the reft ofthe Orient, hold
me for the bafeft of thy Slaves if I fpaic either my blood, orniy life, for the glory
of thy Arms.   If thy goodnefs doth not refufe me this which I beg of thee on my
knees, difpofe of me as thou pkafeft, I am refolved to follow thy direftions ex¬
aftly, and to obey thee in all things.    S.oliman was fo contented with the obtaining
of that which he defired, as he fwore unto me above an hundred times, that the
three things which 1 had demanded, ffiould be inviolably obferved. But not to lofe
time, laid he unto me, 1 will have thy change publiffiecl prefently, to theend the
people may not bc furprifed with it; in the mean fpace I will go and give order
for the Muphti to come to rae, and will command him to repair to thee eight
dayes one after another, to make the world think thathe inftrufts thee, and pre¬
pares thee for this Ceremony, which ffiall oblige thee to keep thy chamber the

dam, not to prolong this difcourfe with vain repetitions, the bufinefs was done as
it had been propounded, and this dumb ffiew was fo well carried, as no body bc-
3eevcd it butto he fo. As Icng as I kept the houfe I was vifited by the chiefeft of
the Empire, who judged rightly, that the affeftion of Solman having no other ob¬
ftacle to hinder hi.n from imploying me, would without doubt bring me into an
eftate able to ferve them, as indeed it was not long before I perceived that their
conjeftures were true; for the fecond day after ffiis impofture, I found, that 1 had

ready to march, when 1 had fatisfied the civilities of the Ceremony, fo that at
fuch time a§ I went firft to falute himinaTurkifli habit, I found that that, which
J believed fliotlld haveb*cn one of my ordinary vifits, was a farewell for rae to go
and command-the Army of Natolia.  I will not tell you , Madam, the joy which
this Prince ffiewed in this occafion, it wasfo great, as my tongUc hath notancx-
preftion powerfull enough to paint it forth unto you; but in the end to let you
fee in whaicftate 1 was with him, I have but to tell you, that after hehad fully in¬
ftrufted mc about the affairs of Natolia, and that he had commanded me to take
upon me the Conduft of his Army, he told mc,thattodonic jufticc, and to pu¬
niffi the Baffa Sinan borh for the cruelty he had before times ufed towards nie, and
forthecowaidifche had ffiewed, his pleafure was, that yeelding mehis place, he
ffiould withall take that in my fervice which 1 had held in his, naraely. Madam,
that he ffiould be ray flave as I had been his. I muft confefs here, that without play¬
ing the generpfo this propofition grieved me very much, and notwithftanding afl
the refpeft I had to Soliman,as foon as he acquainted me with his intention I caft
niy felt at his feet, humbly to befecch him not to coraraand rae the doingoffo ex¬
traordinary a thing, nor to require, that a man who had been my Mafter, ffiould
be reduced to mifery and infamy; that for my part, Icould never refolvc to put
hini in tbains that had commanded me, and who, it may be, was more infortu¬
nate than faulty: I .-reprefented then unto him that the fate of war doth often¬
times mock at humane prudence; that force and number do not alwayes fuffice to
have the better; andlaftly, that viftory doth not always attend upon valor and
juftice. After all thefe reafons, which peradventure had not been potent enough to
move him, 1 begged the liberty and fortune of this man fora recompence of afl
the fervices which 1 would render him, and befought him tobe contented with ab-
fenting him from the Port, by fending him to be Governor of forae one of his
Provin^^e^.   Soliman refifted my rcqueft at firft, but afterwards confented thereunto,
upon condition that the Baffa ffiouldknow how rauch he was obliged unto mc;
then hegave me a Letter for him , whereby he was commanded to r^^mit the re¬
mainder of his Army into my hands, and ftraightly imbracing rae, Go,faid he unto
me, my dear Ibrahim, whither thy glory calls thee, where mine requires thee, and
where viftiory attends thee: But when thou ffialt bc accumulated with honoutj
when thou (halt have re-eftabliffiedthat of my Arms, and triumphed over mine c-
nemies, come and receive the recompence that I ffiall prepare for thee, and quietly
enjoy the fruit of thy labors. Juflmiano having obferved fome change in Ifabellais
face, thought it was fit for him to fay, Uperceive, Madam, that this name of Ibra¬
him doth furprize and aftoniffi you,but your aftoniflimcnt will ceafe, when I ffiall
have told you, that in changing of habit I did not change my name, andthat ihis
which 1 bear, is the fame with that of Ibrahm amongft the Turks.   It is true, an¬
fwered the Princefs, that I.was ftrangely furprized by this name, but it is true alfo,
that my aftoniffiment is not yet finiffied; for could it be poffible that you ffiould be
that Ibrahtm of whom the relations of the Levant hath told us fuch wonders?
whyfe vafour hath done fuch miracles, who hath conquered a part of Verfia, gam¬
ed fo many great battails, caufed Soliman to bc crowned at Bagdet, and who pafktli
for fo extraordinary a man, as it is not believed the Orient hath ever had the like.
Now, I pray you, hold me no longer in fofpence, but after you have cleared that
unto me whkh I ask of you,   purfoe the fequek of your Hiftory, and acquam t me
cxaftly With all that hath befallen you.    I know very well. Madam, rep yed jujti-

fclfbut being true and fincere I muft confcfs,that I am thatlbrahim whora fame hath

Countrey perfectly) I affured them, that in leading them to the fight, 1 would be
the firft tilt would be ingaged therein ; that 1 would perform the part of the foul¬
dier, as well as of the Generall of the Army ; that I would referve my felf no¬
thing of all the booty which (hould be gotten from the enemy, but the fole plea-
fureof having inriched thera.    After this difcourfe, they made ffiouts of joy,
which perfwaded rae that I was agreeable to thera. Then carae all the Commanders
to take the Oath of Obedience to me, and to affure me that they would follow me
to the death : That done, I marched direftly to the enemy, who was not above fif¬
teen or twenty miles frora us ; but whereas he had been advertifed that the Slave
whichhadfakenC/3;VKf^M, was Generall of the Array that was comming to at-
taque him, the remembrance of what had paft made him to fear that which was to
iniue, and for that reafon he difcamped in haft, with a purpofe to redre to a fide of
Natolia, where it had been impoffiblc to have forced him   to fight.    When I per¬
ceived his defign by the way his Array took, I refolved to prevent him, by caufing
ray forces to raarch a whole night with all poffible fpeed : The matter fucccedcd fo
happily, that my Army having had leifure to reft three or four hours, began to
fee  that  of Zellebts  appear ,   who being  foon  advertifed   of this warlike
ftratagem, entred int(9 fuch defpair for having been furprifed in this fort, as he re¬
folved to accept ofthe Battell which 1 prefented unto him.    I wasgladto un¬
derftand his defign, andtoinfpireniy Souldiers with the fame thought, I affured
them, after I had given order for all things, that the juftice of the caufe we defend¬
ed was a prefage of the viftory; that it w^as eafier to puniffi Rebels, who carried
a domeftique enemy in their hearts, which reproached them with their crime,
than to vanquiffi men whofe Arms were lawful!; that they whom we were to fight
with, being refolved for it more by fear and neccffity, than by valour, it would be
but too eafie for our glory to remain viftorious :   I reprefented alfo unto them ,
that the travail they had endured in gcing fofaft, was not difadvantageous unto
them, it being raoft certain, thatthey which fly are wearied more than they which
purine thera; that the etidof the War depending on this battell, I was refolved
to vanquiffi or to dye; andthat all the favour I demanded of them was, to fol¬
low the way which I was goingto ffiew them.    I h?d no fooner doneipeaking,
but they teftified unto rae, both by their ffiouts andby their aftions, their defire
to fight; fo that not fuffering fo noble a heat to cool, I marched on forCmoft to the
Enemy. I will not ftand. Madam, to particularize this battell, fince it would be
to abufc your patience, and be wanting in good manners, to cn:ertain you fo long
with matters of war; it fliall foffice then to tell you that which regards mc direft¬

fhall only fay. Madam, that at firft the enemies received us couragioufly, and thac
they repulfed us feverall times with fuch ardour, as defpair did more in them than
valour in us; butafterthatthe viftory had hung ballancing on either fide, and
that^thehopcof carrying it had poffeffed each party more than once, it wa   mv

<p>band, and the other at his faddle-bow ; he was alfo many times armed after the
Perfian manner, fo as no way doubting but that it was he, I brake through the prefs
to meet him, and calling him by his name, I told him, that the fame Slave, who
before had vanquifficd him in his chains, was come to make hira fatisfaftion for
that outrage in Arms ; I fpake to him in this fort, becaufe I had underftood that in
a fpeech to his fouldiers, after he had heard that I was Generall ofthe Arniy,hc had
told them in a jeering way, that I was ftill fo tired with wearing of irons, as  it
Would be eafie for him to overcome me: Howbeit fortune difpofed of it other-
wife, not btcaufe he was not a more valiant man than 1, but becaufe I was more for¬
tunate than he.    As foon as he underftood that which I have told you, he feconded
my deiign; and that we might the better enter into a particular fight we freed our
felves, as well as we could, from thofe that invironed us, and being feparated from
the reft,we began our combat. I doubt not, Madam, but you will be aftoniffied with
that which I am going to acquaint you with, fince it is certain, that one will have
much adoe not to be ibrprized with a thing which hath no example in all Antiqui¬
ty, and which your imagination would not fore-fee.   It hapned then. Madam,
that fome of ours having obferved this aftion, and having told it to their compa¬
nions, this rumour fpread it felf fo fuddenly amongft the two Armies, that as if
thofe two great bodies had had but one fpirit, which had animated thera,they took
both of them the fame refolution, and confided fo in the valor of their Chieftains,
as they determined to befpeftators of the viftory, which they attended from them.
They of my party faid, that they would not ffiare the glory of this day with me,
and that I would carry it away well enough without their fuccour; and others-
muttered, that he who had known fo well how to begin the war, knew alfo how to
finiffi it giorioufly.    At length. Madam, the moft earneft to fight, feparated them¬
felves to behold us; and as if there had been fome inchantraent inthis adventure,
every one retired to his own Enfign, and in an inftant the field ofour combat pro¬
ved to be in the midft of two Armies in Battel! Array. This event furprifed mc in
fuch fort, as it had like to have coft me my life; for whereas, maugre the heat of
the fight, I had conferved fomuch coldnefs ancl judgement, as to mark what was
done, and to be aftoniffied at it, going to turn about my head towards my fouldiers
to '^ive thera affurance that I fought for thera, I furniffied mine enemy with fuch an
opportunity, as being loath to lofe that advantage, he ftruck me fo great a blow
with his Scymitar upon my Turbant, as I was almoft bcrek of my fenfes, and if by
good hap it had not turned in his hand, I had certainly been loft : Hereupon arofe
cries from both parties, which amidft their confufion teftified their thoughts unto
us; and whereas mine had obferved, that I had received this blow by looking at
them, they would have advanced, which I perceiving by the enemies countenance,
I feparated my felf fome dozen or fourteen pacesfrom Zellebis to charge them not
to ftir, and to confirm them in that defign I returned to Zellebts with fuch courage,
as they were perfwaded it would not be eafie for him to furmoiint rae.  Howbeit
we difputed this viftory a long tirae,and verily this man combated with fuch heart,
as g.ive mc a great defire to fave him; fo that his horfe having thrown him to the
eroimd upon a blow that I unwittingly gave him, I told him that if he would ren¬
der himfelf I would promife to get his pardon of Soliman; but being got up again
with fory, and having anfwered me, thathe would have the viftory, c)r die, I
^vo^ld not combat him with advantage, fo that being alighted from my horfe wc
beean a new fight, which was more infortunate for him than the former: For feel-
ling my fcS hurt in the left arm, the defire which I had to vanquifli redoubled m
fuch manner, as in a litde tirae his death put fear into his Array,and joy into mine.
Some of his foeing him fall would have advanced to revenge his loL^, or to reco¬
ver his body, but they were fo rudly repulfed, as they were conftrained to change

this aftion was glorious to me: And whereas he had an extreme deiire totee me,
1 had order to return unto Conftant mople as foon as Natolia ffiould be peaceable, and
that 1 had fecured all the revolted places. I was not long before I was in an eftate
to obey him, for whereas Zellebts was the onely man that remained ot the tVace ot

found amongft them vvhom thereft vvould obey ; the equality of their birth and

ffiould command, and this diffenfion put them into fuch diforder, as they were

pardon, or to puniffi, I commanded them to yecld, promifing to make their peace
with the Grand Signior, but threatning that if they did not accept of the pardon
which 1 offered them, to extirpate them utterly , and to caufe all the Deru/s, and
all the Calenders to bc baniffied from out of the whole extent of the Turkiffi Em¬
pire. This was done in a conjunfture fo favourable, that they all with one voyce
refolved to render themfelves; there was not a Town which did not open their
Gates, receive a Governor from my hand, and a Garrifon ftrong enough to keep
them from rebelling another tirae; and for raore furety, I caufed allthe Deruis and
Calenders to be difarmed, reprefenting unto thcni, that the profeffion of men of
Religiondidnot permit them to have Arms; and that their crime could not re¬
ceive a lighter puniffimcnt, than to be contented that the raeans of their future of-«
fending ffiould be taken from thera. At length. Madam, after I had fet an order to
all things, I returned to Cenftantinople, where for a recorapcnce of that little I had
done, iS'o//w4« raadc rae Baffa, and Grand Vifier, which is the prime Charge of
that Empire; for it had fo fallen out, that he vvho poffeffed it died in my abfencc.
I did all that I could to refufe this honor, but in the end I was conftrained to
acceptofit, both by the Commandment of the Grand Signior, and by the coun¬
fell of the Religious men of Pera, and of the Patriarch ofthe Greek Church,
whom I ftill acqu.inted with allthat befell me, by a Prieft difguifed like a flave,
which alwayes attended on mc, alleging this reafon to me for it, that the more
power I had, the more utile I ffiould be for Chriftendom. Behold mc then the firft
perfon of the Empire next to Soliman, but with an Authority fo abfolute, as never
was there Subjeft feen fo independent from his Soveraign. I was fome time in-
Itrufting my felf in the Forms and Ceremonies that are to be obferved in dif-

<p>to give him an accompt of his voyage, he learned, that the bufinefs had paft in an¬
other manner; for Ruftan had been fo dextrous, and fo happy in his enterprize as
he had forcibly carried away the perfon whom the pifture which Solman had'gi-
ven him reprefented: But, Madam, this perfon was not Ff//'Ar/r»4, and this adven¬
ture is fo deplorable, that although it be not intermingled with my fortune but
onely in regard it is the foundation af a war, which I am obliged to lelate yet
would I let you undcrftand it, feeing you will bc acquainted with the whole courfc
ofmy life, did I not fear to importune you with fo long a Narration. The Prin¬
cefs interrupting Juftiniano, defired him not to fpeak to her any raore in this fort
and to tell her, n^t only all that which had befallen him, but all that which he
knew concerning thelife of Soliman; it fecming unto her, that this Princefs lo¬
ved him too well not to have his Hiftory joyned to his; whereupon Jujlmiano be¬
gan thus.

<p>The Hiftory ofthe Frincefs Axiamira.

<p>'A S foon as .R»/?rt«, after he had quitted his Veffell in ^/wfr^/w, and had taken
X\ another upon the River of Araxes, \vas arrived with his fouldiers difguifed
at Maz^anderon, which is a Town fituated on the bank of the Cajpian Sea, and the
Capitrillof Hircania, at this day calledDiargument, and had caft anchor in the
Port, he underftood that the Princefs Axiamira had been there a pretty while, al¬
though it was rot as yet the feafon wherein ffic ufed to come thither; but forfomc
difoider which had hapned in the Sophies Court ffie had advanced her voyage.
^«^^»,fecing fuch a wonderful! good hap for the comraenceraent ofhis cnter-
piize, thought of nothing elfe but to feek the means how hemight be introdu¬
ced into the Caftle, for the which he began to fall in with the Merchants of the
place, and to part with fome things thathe had brought thither, at a price much
below the ordinary, to the end his defign might fuccecd the rather; as indeed
hehad not been eight dayes in the Town, but he received order to let the Prin¬
cefs Axtamira fee the goodlieft things he had ; he obeyed this commandment
with joy, being in good hope that ff//.vrf«4 was with her: He carried her then a
great many Mirrors,little Pi&amp;ures,and curious Watche^which are the rareft things
amongft the Perfians; but he was exceedingly fuiprifed and aftonithed whcnas wai¬
ting in Axiamiraes chamber for her coming out of her Cabinet, he heard one call i
maid, that had brought him in, Felixana, who, though ffie was very fair, refembled
not a whit the pourtrait which he had:this amazement doubdefs was great enough,
but it redoubled more whcnas the Princefs Axiamra entred into the chamber, and
that he certainly knew ffie was thcOriginall of that fatal Pifture, which hath fince
caufed the ffiedcling of fo much blood, and fo many tears. He was fo ftrukcn with
this fight, that at firft it gave the Princefs occafion to think, that being a Merchant,
and not accuftomed to converfe with great perfons, he was outof countenance;
howbeit at length he told her in the P^r/4« tongue, that within a little while he
ffiould have rarer things yet to ffiew her, hoping by this artifice to have the oppor¬
tunity tofee the Princefs once again, the better to confirm him in the belief that
what he beheld was true. Axiamira, giving credit to his words, bought onely
a Looking-glafs, and fome Watches, and then ordained him not to fail in letting
her have a fight of thofe rarides he fpokeof, as foon as they were come to his
hands. Ruftan retired in this fort, but fo full of confufion and aftoniffiment, as he
was a long time before he could bcleeve that which hchadfeen, and longer yet
before he could refolve upon what to do in fo unexpefted an event. What! fayd
he to himfelf, as he told me after his return, is it poffible that Felixana ffiould be
turned into Aximira &gt; that the daughter ofthe Governour oiMa^anderon Ihould
bccpmc the daughter of the Sophy ofP^r/F^? or that through an extraordinary ad¬
venture a Merchant ffionld be fo daring as to affure a thing to Solman, whereof he

<p>fo mightily, as he was ten or twelve daies hck upon it, during wuicn tune nt uia
nothing btitp-ifs up and down in his mind .ill the reafons thatmight induce him,
cither to the forcible carrying away ofAx.'.:n,rra,oi-to the reftraining hmi from it:
On thecne fide he thought, thatthe Grand Signior having made choice of hini for
the fervice of his amorous paflion, he (hould be but badly received, if at his return
he only brought back for the fi uit of hi.-; voyage, that Felixana refembled^ not the
pic^urcwhicli had been given him ; He feared alfo that Solimans hope being fru-
ftrated, that which he had of being Beglerbei of Syr/a would be fo too ;  Wherefore
regarding the matter after another fort, he laboured to find anothers  fatisfaftion
in his own. But the more he confidered the defign of carrying away of Axiami-
r.i l)y force, the more obftacles he found therein; he was not powerfull enough
to force the Tow n or Caftle, and the retirednefs wherein the women live over all
the Orient, permitted him not the means to work upon any ofthofe that were neer
the Princefs for thekiborning them : But above all things, the fole apprchenfion
that Soliman ihould not approve ofhis defign,and ffiould be offended to underftand,
that inftead of forcibly carrying away the daughter ofa fimple Governour, he
ffiould have forcibly carried away that of one of the raightieft Princes of the
world, put hira into an unquietnefs that cannot be expreft; and I verily believe
by diat which 1 could conjefture out of his own relation , that this laft fear had
abfolutely maftered his foul, and carried him to return without cnterprizing fur¬
ther, had not the raisfortune of the unhappy Axiamira raade hira change his opi¬
nion, and brought her to contribute her telf to her ov;n ruin, without thinking
of it.    This excelknt Princefs took fo much pleafure in fiffiing, and was fo deligh¬
ted with this fport, as there were lew fair dayes which ffie imployed not in this
maritime chafe ; and whereas all Perfta was quiet, having no war either domeftick
orforein, ffie went to this innocent warfare, more accompanied with fiffier-meu
than fouldiers, and almoft without other arms than nets and hooks.    During the
time that Ruftansficknds lafted, he obferved that -/4.v/^w/m was two or three days
a fiffiing, and having dextroufly informed himfelf   from forae Merchants who
dealt with him, that the Princefs ufed oftentimes fo to do, he underftood what I
have declared, fo that no longer judging this defign, whichhe had believed to be
impcflible, other than a httk hazardous, and having a Veffell that was an excel¬
lent Saykr, well forniffied withall things, and never a Mariner but which was a

<p>end they ffiould not marvail 2t his departure, he to obtain permilfion for it caufed
the Princefs to be told, that having received advertifemcnt how a vcffell of hii
Country was within three or four daies to beat a Port that was not above ten
miles from A'faz,anderon,he was refolved to go and wait for it there,to deal for fonic
commodities which he thot^glit he had had, but had forgot to bring along vvith
him; that at his return he vvould not fail to let her fee the rarities, whereof hehad
fpoken, not being able to do it fooner by reafon of his ficknefs :  And to (hew that
he intended to return again, he fuffered himfelf to be unpayd by forae Merchants
that were in his debt.    He parted then in this manner, leaving the Princefs very de-
lirous of his return, in regard of her inclinations to fuch rare things • but where¬
as he had no defign to eloign himfelf much, and had obferved how'the Princefs
ufed ordinarily to take that way whereby became thither, he put his veffell into
the covert of a Creek three miles from the Port, where the point ofa Rock advan¬
ced fofar into the fea^ as they that cane frora the Towns fide could notfee them
which were there, before they were fo near as they could not decline a fight.   It was
here where Ruftan refolved to attend the Princefs, being confident that ffie vvould
not be long before ffie came thither, becaufe he knew it was the place moft proper
for her fport: In the mean time to beguile the veffels, which palling by might dif¬
cover him, he fet up the Flag of Per(ia in his Main-top, and caufed all his men that
appeared on the deck to change their habit; for the cunning of this raan had pro¬
vided for all things, and had not oraiited ought that could conduce to the hap¬
py fuccefs of fomifchievous a defign. Now accordingly this deplorable Princefs,
noway doubting of the treafon that was intended againft her, refolved the next
day after 'Ruftans departure, to recreate her felf on the fea; but to make up her mif-
fortunc, flic would not that day go a fiffiing, but onely take the air, and pafs away
the time more freely with her women.   In   the mean feafon Ruftan had made a
fpeech to his fouldiers and Mariners, vvhom he had gained with gift.s, to encourage
them to well-doing,  if it hapned thathe ffiould command them to attacque a
veffel. He told them, that what he defired of them was the leaft exploit he could
expeft from their valour, fince it was a veffel without Ordnance, and more laden
with women than fouldiers; that above all things they ffiould beware of doing
any outrage to the Ladies; but for the men, that they ffiould not fpare them, k
being neceffary that none ffiould cfcape which might teftifie ought concerning this
Aftion.    After this he fet a fentinell on the top ofthe Rock to difcover when
Axiamiraes veffell fhould come out of the Port, for to advertife him of it.    The
impatience of this Raviffier lafted not long; for, as Ihave already declared, the
next day after his departure, the Princefs refolved to go and take the air :   no
fooner was ffie on the fea, but the fentinell advertifed Buftan of it, who with all
fpeed fitted his ffiip, and prepared his men to do that which he had commanded
them.    Scarcely had he given order for every thing , \vhcnas the Princeffes vcffell
appeared; ffie was fitting in the Stern upon Cuffiions of cloth of Gold, with all
her women about her, and attired like an Amaz,cn, as her pifture reprefented her,
having a Dart in her righe-hand, upon which ffie leaned : As foon as ffie perceived
Ruftans veffel, ffie rofe up fuddainly to obferve it, as if (he had forefcen what was
to arrive unto her ; this firft apprchenfion was quickly feconded by another more
grievous one; forjuftas the Princefs rofe up, .K«/&gt;?« changed the defign hehad of
following her,  that fo hemight draw her the hirther from the Town, into that
of letting upon her immediately, fo that he commanded his men to make up with
full fails to the vcffell, and board her, exprefly forbidding any Ordnance to be ffiot
off, for fear of lofing that which he meant to preferve, and^that the Caftle too might
not thereby take up an Alarum, and come to the fuccour of the Princefs.    This
was not fo foon fayd as executed ; Axiamiraes veffell was boorded by that of Rt*-
ftan, who firft of all leaped into her, for to fave the Princefs from perill, and to en¬
courage his men. Which feconded him fo happily,  as the refiftance of Axiamrm
Guard was in vain ; the furprife and aftoniffiraent wherewith they wercfeilcd,
ferved not a little to make them be fo eafily vanquifhed; for in a quarter of an hours

fuither otF, totiirow themover-boord in fackshalf filled with fome heavy things,
which afterwards was accordingly executed.   When they had funk the Princeffes

his fouldiers to keep themfelves continually ready to fight, and unto two of his

affift her, though it was rather the effect of his intereft thanof his pitty, caufed the
Princeffes women to have fome comfort amidft their misfortune :  They laboured
all ot them together then to make her come to her felf again; and a little after fhe
affured them by a deep figh, that ffie would foon be fenfible ot all her miferies; and
?.ccordingly within a while ffic opened her eyes; but not being longer abk to make
any refiftance, and feeing Ruftan by her, whom ffie knew, though ffie had never be¬
held him but once before, and that he had changed his habit, ffie was conftrained to

<p>end that nonebut ffie might undcrftand what he faid unto her. She made fome dif¬
ficulty to agree thereunto, but at length ffie was forced to obey.   He recounted to
hex chen, how her unhappinefs was an effeft of herbeauty; but he did not tell her
that 5o//fw^« had loved her under the name of Felixana, onely he acquainted her
that her pifture had begot this love, and confequently the defign which he had exe¬
cuted; howbeit he perceived that Axiamira did not bcleeve him, fo that to perfwade
her the better, he ffiewed her pifture to her, which ffie prefently knew, and calling
her women to her to look upon it, ffie put them in mind, how the Sophy having
caufed her to be drawn one day with Felixana by an excellent Painter, whom for¬
tune had brought into their country , he had coramanded many coppies to be made
of them, which he had given to Merchants for the publiffiing of her beauty all a-
broad, and that of Felixana whom he infinitely loved.   Upon this difcourfe Ruftan
Was no longer troubled to conceive, hovi Axiamira had been taken for Felixana,
eafily imagining that a Merchant, who itmay be underftood not the Perft an tongnt
very well, might be deceived in taking the pifture of Felixana for that of Axiami-
YA, and that of Axiamira for that of Felixana, and much the rather, for that the Mer¬
chant had got thofe piftures without ever feeing the Princefs, as we came to know
afterwards. But to return to this afflifted fair one, after that Ruftan had acquain¬
ted her with the caufe of her misfortune, he would have inlarged himfelf upon the
magnificences of the Seraglio, upon the excellent qualities of Solman, upon the
excefs of the paffion which he was in for her, and have perfwaded her that her un¬
happinefs would make her happy. But this generous Princefs, not able to endure a
difcourfe fo far diftant from her fenfe, fayd unto him with a voice much ftronger,
than the weaknefs wherein ffie was would feem to permit her; do you bcleeve then,
that a perfon which might have fucccedcd to the Crown of Perfia, can refolve to bc
the flave of Soliman ? to fpend her life in prifcn ? and to have for her companions
infamous creatures, who are for the moft part the refofc of Pyratcs 1 No, no,Axtit-
fuira came not into the world but to reign, and her death ffiall make it foon appear,
that ffie knows not how to obey : Fortune hath put mc into your hands, but mine
ftiall deliver me out of them.   After this ffic mufed a pretty while very profoundly,
Ruftm not daring to anfwer her for fear of further incenfing her ;   then fuddenly
(peaking again, and addreffmg her felf to him, Can I hope,  fayd ffiee unto him,
tor any fincerity in a man thathath fo cruelly betrayed ? me and can I belecve that
what he hath told mc is true ? for how can it bc imagined that Soliman, whofe re¬
putation is fo great and fo fair, ffiould be capable of caufing an innocent Princefs to
be forcibly cai ried away for to make her his flave ? and how can it yet be concei¬
ved, that this Prince, whojis fayd to be fo amorousof a certain Roxelana,  and
who hath loved her fo long, could be in a paffion for a pifture, yea in fuch a paffi¬
on as hath obliged him to violate the law of Nations, to forget naturall equity, to
outrage a Prince as mighty as himfelf, and to do an aft fo ftrange as it is without
example in all Ages ? Tell mc then, I conjure you, faid the unto him, the true caufe
of my difafter, and hide not from me that which time wiU clear unto mc but too
well.    Ruftan feeing her mind a little quieter in all appearance, thought he might
gain her by gcntlenefs;   wherefore he affured her with all the ardficc that poffibly
he could ufe ; how all that which he had told her was true, but how it was true
alfo, that the image ofthe Seraglio, which feemed fo dreadful! unto her, was a nocer
effeft of her grief; that all the grace he would demand of her was nooUier, but
that ffie would live untill ffie had feen 5o/;w4», which favour ifhe might obtain of
her, he was well affured, that the fight of fo excellent a Prince would make her
change her opinion.    Yes, faid ffie, interrupting him, I will live, if n»y g"ef will
permit it • but I will live only to feck out the means how to revenge the death, that
Iwill£ivc my felf, as foon as my complaints and cryes have made fome one to

heed with a great deal of care, not to leave any thing wherewith ffie might hurt hcP
felf, which (tie perceiving faid further uato him. You may take from me iron,fire,
and poifon, but not the will to die, and by it I ffiall alwayes find means to cMecute
my defign: Ruftan would return her no anfwer, knowing full well that flie waS
not in an eftate to be perfwaded.   After this he caufed her to be fcrred very care-
folly without ever entring into her chamber, yet did he for the moft part hear all
that ffie faid to her women ; for fearing left (he ffiould offer to get out ofthe Cab¬
bin for to go and caft her felf into the Sea, he lay alwayes at the Cabbin-door*
not daring to truft any body with the guard of a trcafure from whence he hoped
for all his fortune. I will not recount unco you the generous and pitifull difcourfes
of this infortunate Princefs daring this voycge, fince it would but augment the
regret, which you will have for her lofs; For^ Madam, after a Navigation profpC*
rous enough; after they had paffed over albthe Cafpian Sea by gayning the Coaft; on
the left hand; after they had arrived at the River of yir&lt;f.wj, which difimbokes it
fclf into this Sea; had traverfed by Land thorough the Whole Countrey ofColehit'
da,novicalledMtngrelta j-^heve Ruftanhttodkhiin to his former Vcflfeil again&gt;
which had ftayed ftill for him there ; had travelled Mare mayor, or Pontns EHXtuttj^
from one end to another in its length; after that, I fay, they were come to the Bif-
pherus of Thrace, in a place where they even touched the ffioar, there arofe fo furi¬
ous a wind, as they were conftrained to take in all their fails. And whereas the Pi¬
lot had advertifed Ruftan, that he forc-faw the comming of a great ftorm, and that
within an hour at the furtheft, he thought that in regard rhcy were not far from a
place where the Skiff might eafily land, it would not bc amifs to pcrfWade tfit
Princefs to go affioar, feeing they were within Solimans Dominion, and where they
needed not fear to abandon their Veffell.    He caufed then one cf the Princdfe*
women to be calkd untohim for to acquaint her with the perill wherewith they
were ihrcatned, that ffie might propound unto her the avoyding of it by the means
which I have related; this Maid, who out of the fear of death approved of Ru.
ft ans propofition, did all that ffie could to get her Miftrefs to imbrace it: But this
couragious Princefs faid unto hervvith an admirable conftancy, that ffie was re-
folved to attend the foccor of Heaven, imagining indeed, that the ftorm wherewith
ffie was threatned, could bring no alteration toher fortune which would notbe
advantagious to her.   Daring this conteftation the Sea was moved in foch fort, as
It was out of all probability, had the Princefs confented to what they detifedof

<p>without ceafi ng in the mean time to ufe their tittermoft indeavour to with-ftand it;
but at laft they were fain to give way to this violence, and refer their lives to the
conduft ot fortune. Already had the Pilot abandoned the Helm,his Compals ftood
him in no ftead, the Maft was all to ffiattcred, the Sayl-yards torn off, the Tackle
rent in picccs,thc Veffell took in water on every fide, the fouldiers cried out in
defpair, the Mariners abandoned themfelves to grief, the Princeffes women were
all diffolved into tears, Ruftan himfelf had almoft loft his underftanding, whenas
in the midft of fo generall a confternation he heard the Princefs cry unto him with
a quiet fpirit, and with a feded and confident voyce; at length Axiamira ftiall not
be a Slave, ffie ffiall dye v/ith glory, Heaven is armed for her fuccour, and (if I de¬
ceive not my fclf) her death fhall be the caufe of her revenge.    Scarcely had (he
finiffied thefe words, v/henas an hideous wave hitting the Veffell with an unexprei-
fable impetuofity,daffied it with fuch vioknce againft the point ofa Rock, aj
they fuffered ffiipwrack in that very place.   I will not tell you. Madam, that which
Ruftan himfelf could not tell us, for this mlEfbrtune was fo fudden, as in an inltanc
he found, that of all his Veffell he had   nothing  left him but a plank   which
floated to his hand, as he was labouring in the water, and wherewith he faved hU
life by fuftaining himfelf upon it; for this man was fo fortunate, as without other
induftry than ftrongly faftning hirofelf.fo this plank, the Sea (which according to
its cuftom retains nothing ofall the rapines that it makes) caft him on die (hoar,
ivhere he remained almoft in afwoontill the tempeft was over, which was not long
firft; fo as it might have been faid, that this Princefs had ferved for an oblation
to pacific the fury of the incenfed waters'; for two hours after ffie had fuffred (hip-
wrack, the Sun beginning to appear, diffipated the darknefs ofthe night, and the
tempcft, and reftored calmncfs and tranquillity to the Sea. _ Ruftan, being wholly
come to himfelf again, got up to the fide of a Peock to fee if he could difcover a-
ny mark of fo fad a wrack, but he could difcover no other thing than forae of the
Tackle and Planks of his Veffell, which the waves had brought to Land, fo that de-
fpairing of any comfort he went to the ihabitaticn that was neareft to the place
where he was, and ftayed thefe certain days to make fearch, if at leaft the body of
Axiamira might have been found, as alfo to meet with fome means for him to re¬
turn to Conflantinople: As for the Pcincefs,all his care in vain,hc found indeed feme
dead Souldiers and Mariners along the ffioar,but of her he never could have any ti¬
ding-;  fo that the unhappy Axiamira is doubtkts without life, and without fepul-

place where Prince danger, the youngcft of Solimans fonnes was rcfiding,yet w^ould
he not demand any affiftancc from hira, for fear he ffiould be obliged to tell him .1
thing which was to be concealed; wherefore he had recourfc to the Governor of

wrack, who forniffiing him with all things requifite for his journey, he returned
by Land to Conflantinople with fo melancholick a countenance, as at hrft fight one

m:ra e, as neceffary for ray felkity, flic was to be intreated after another manner
and if my love would have conftrained me to have recourfc unto violence, 1 (hould
have gone in perfon in the head of an hundred thoufand men to make fo noble a
conqueft with honor; ffie ffiould have been brought in a triumphant Chariot, ancl
not in the Veffell ofa Traytor and impious man; I (hould not have thought ot
poflellints her till 1 had kt a Crown noon her head; and if Icould not have ob¬
tained her, 1 ffiould have chanped my love into refpeft, and with admiration have
looked upon a blil ■ that was lorbidden me : But Ruftan did not believe that I was
capable of luch noble apprehenfions, he hath judged of my minde by his own ; he
thought becaufe he is violent, that 1 (hould be wicked; he hoped fora recompence
of his crime, and out of an inhumanity which is without example, he hath betray¬
ed an innocent Princefs, he hath putaftain upon ray life which I ffiall notbe able
to detace, and hath reduced my foul to an eftate never to be comforted. Then ad-
drelTing his fpeech tothe Princefs, as if (he could have heard him, and calling to
mind her laft words, which he had caufed to be repeated to him more than once, he
cried out with an exceeding tranfport. Yes, Axiamira, thy death ffiall be the caufe
of the revenge which thou defireft, and the grief which I ffiall have for it all my
life, ffiall bc inftead of an eternall puniffimcnt unto rae : There needs no Arms to
invade my State ; there needs no proclaraed Enemy to fight with me, I carry one in
my bofom which ffiafl alv/ayes furmount me; repentance and forrow ffiall be in-
feparably with my fpirit, and the image of fo unhappy, and of fo beautifull a
perfon fhall accompany me even to the grave. Soliman having been conftrained
by the excefs of his dilpleafure to give over fpeaking, I did what I could to reftore
tranquillity to his foul, but his grief wasfo vive andfo ftrong, as I needed a great
dealof time to vanquilh, or to fay better, to moderate it. Behold, Madam , the

that ofthe Adventures of Axiamira as much as poffibly he could,in exaftly rccoun

deliver the truth of things to Ijabella; in the mean time, whereas ffic was in iiiuct
impatience, and that night began to come on, ffie defired him nottolok fuch pre¬
cious minutes, butto profecute his difcourfe. I v/ould willingly have had you dif-
pence with me, anfwered Juftiniano, for leading you once more to the wars   but
fince you will be acquainted with all my fortunes, I am to let you underftand' that
being abfolutely determined not to wear a Turbant unprofitably for Chriftendom
I had no other thought but to divert the Arms of Solman from Hungary, where I
knew he had a deliga to imploy his greateft forces; the lofs of Axtamira furniffi^ed
me foon after with means to put fo juft a refolution in effeft : For whether it were
thatfomeof thePrinceffes women were faved by a prodigious good hap, and had
acquainted Tachmas with the caufe of the death of his daughter ; or that the a-
boad, oifuddeii departure of Ruftan,whohad alwayes paft at Maz^anderon for a
Merchant of Couflantmople, had begotten fomefufpition ofthe truth, advertifenient
came that T^i^/'/^^j was levying a mighty Array: Tne* Truce which had been fo
long between thefe two Princes, could be no obftacle to this war , for it had never
been obferved exaftly; and forae particulars had often committed afts of hoftility
on either part, fo that according to the Maxims of State, a plaufible pretext could
notbe wanting for an  Army to raarch into the Orient, as of ten as Solman had a
mind to it :   hi the mean time it happened that the Georgians having paft over Eu¬
phrates, did much fpoil in Cemagena, robbing all that went to, or came from Mefo-
potamia, fo that the Sangiacs of the Province having complained of it, and feeing
that Sohm^v-i took no order therein, they paffed to Diarbech, where in all the Coun¬
trey about Birthathey did grsat havock, and rendred that with ufury which the
Georgians had lent thera.    This conjunfture fceraing too favourable unto rae tobe
negleftcd, I repaired unto 5&lt;7//»?/iw, who notwithftanding the advertifemcnt hehad
received that Tachmas had put himfelf into Arms, could not be drawn for all that
to think of this war ; the image of Axiamira reigned ftill in his heart; he could
not refolve to fight with the Father, whofe daughter he had caufed to periffi ; and
if fome refentment of glory had not been ftill remaining in him, I think he would
rather have let Tachmas invade his Empire, than oppofe himieJf againft him.    But
to ffiew unto you how hardly this Prince was drawn to make a war, which he
believed tobe unjuft, I have no more to fay, than that after I had ufed all my ad¬
drefs to remonftrate untohim, that the war of Perfia was a thing nodonger in
his choice, fince knowing what his Governors had done in Diarbech, and Tachmas
hajring an Army on foot, he was not to doubt, yea though he wre ignorant that he
t|Is the innocent caufe of Axiamiraes death, but that he would fall upon him; that
after I had told him how it was alwayes advantagious for great Princes to begin
the War; that it was a mark of love to his Subjefts, not to fuffer the fire tobe
brouuht into their houfes; andthat I had made hira alfo to confider, that at laft
it\v()uld be better to be in an eftate to fficw grace to his Enemy, than to receive it
from him ; that in this occafion it did not concern his particular glory alone, but
that ofthe Empire; that being innocent of the misfortune of Axiamira, he was
not to fear that heaven would becontrary tohim ; andthat if this death was tobe
lamented, it would fuffice to imploy his tears and fighs therein, without beholding
the blood of his Subjefts ffied.    After all thefe things, I fay, he made no other
anfwer, but Axiamira is dead for me, I muft facrifice a part ot ray State for her; and
that my Subjefts may not murmure at the Conquefts which I (hall fuffer Tachmas to
gain upon me, I will labor to obtain others  of the Chriftians, without obliging
thcc, as I have promifed, to ferve me therein. I vow unto you, Madam,   that this
difcourfe furprized me extremely, -not knowing which way to oppok my fefl a-
gainft a will fo fully determined: And that which put me into further defpair ot
being able to execute ray defign was, that the Mother and Wife of the Einperour
hated me with a ferret hatred, becaufe I had always favoured Mujtapba and ^m^ger,

cuted as the Grand Signiors, it was not long before he was brought to me.   In the
mean fpacc Iwas refolved to fpeak no more ofthis war to Soliman, untill fuch time
as that which I projefted fliould utterly fail rae. As foon as Mnk Aral vfas arrived
at Conftantmople, 1 talked with him in private, and after I had ingaged him abfolute¬
ly to do what I would have him, I difcovcred my defign unto him, which never¬
thelefs I covered with thegood and glory of thcEmpire^ to the end too he might
ferve mc the more faithfully. But this man told me, how he held it fit that the Stars
fliould bc obferved, and his books confulted with a little about this war, becaufe it
might fo happen, that without any impofture or lying he ffiould bc obliged to per¬
fwade Soliman to this voyage; and howfoever, though the ftars did not concur with
our intentions, yet would he be fure to keep his word with me. I parted with him
in this manncr,having firft intreated him to make a ffiew ofthe beft cSe^s ofhis Sci¬

<p>after lie had made his obfervadons, came one evening to me with a contented look
and affured me, that his Science was falfe, or I ffiould Crown Solmta, King of p,/
fta. it IS certain, Madam, that I did not believe the difcourfeof this man, but onelv
icemed to give credit to his words, tothe end I mightnot difoblige him, although
the fuccefs of thingsafterwards made k good The next day he went to Solman
ancl with a confident countenance told hira, that the war of Hungary would prove
u nlucky to hira ifhe undertook it, but that of Perfta glorious; and affured him fur¬
ther, that if he eutred firft into the Enemies Countrey, one of his Slaves   whom
he very much loved, ffiould Crown him King of Perfta.  Mule accompanied this
difcourfe withfo many circumftances, which would be too long to repeat, as at
length Soltman, who was very fcrupulous in al! things,which he believed cara'e from
above, prepared himfelf for this war with as much precipitadon, as he had had
repugnancy to kbel:ore.    As foon as AIulc was gone, he fent for me, to command
me to alter all the direftions which he had given, and to caufe all the Troops to be
inrolled for Perfta : And whereas this Prince carried an unmcafurable affeftion
to me, he had charged ^«/e not to difcover any thing of that to rae which he had
faid to him, defiring to make me believe how it was in confideration of me that he
with-drcw his Arms from Chriftendom, thereby to ingage me the more to his fer¬
vice. Whilft things were in this eftate, an accident fell out which began to give
great hope of this voyage of Perfta, and to confirm Soltman in the good opinion
•which he had of Mule Aral; for it hapned that one/^/^w^, Satrape of Caramama,
a man of great account with the Sophy, who had maried one of his fifters tohim,
and though ffie dyed a little after this Mariage, yet did this aUiance render him
more confiderable than before.    This man, I fay, having received forae out-rage
from that Prince, after he had ferved him in divers incounters with the cxpcnce of
his blood, requefted of me that I would obtain fome place of fafety for him with¬
in iSoZ/w^wj Dominions. I will not tell you, Madam, what this excellent man did
in this war, fince it is certain, that his generous aftions doc well deferve a rela¬
tion in particular; neither will I ftand to recount this voyage exaftly unto you;
'whereforc,that I may not abufe your patience, and make the beft ufe of the reft of
the day, I will only tell you. Madam, that having had a Commandment to conduft
the Vant-Guard with ^/4W4, Iwas fo fortunate as I furprized Tauris without any
refiftance, which at the firft aftoniffied the Enemies, who neverthelefs left not to de¬
fend themfelves couragioufly in all other incounters. Tachmas performed wondeis
in his own perfon, and fo did alfo one Deliment; but at length fortune in two ran¬
ged battels declared her felf for us; fo that as foon as Soliman was arrived in per¬
fon, he had almoft no other imployracnt than to receive the Deputies of Townes
which fubmitted to his obedience.    A part of Aftyria and Mefopetamia were fubje¬
fted unto him, but in fuch fort, and fo abfolutely, that from the Mart of BaUera,
which ftands at the mouth of Euphrates, entring into the Gulf of Perjia, even to the
laft Town, they rendred all unto hira.    The moft notable ofthis great number
were Caramida, Medinum, Orfa and Ancefa; but that which Sofiman rejoyced mofi:
at, was the reduftion of Bagdet, where he was Crowned King of Perfia by the hands
of the Caliph, who to do me honor, and to teftifie that I had contributed fome¬
what to the happy fuccefs ofthis war, would needs have me ferve in the Ceremony,
and help him to fet the Crown on the head of Solman; fo that by this circumftance
nothing was more to be added to Mule Arals Prediftions, who at our return was
recompcnced fufficiently.   Afterthis, his Highnefs beftowed fome time in giving
direftions for all things before his return to Conjlantinople, where he was refolved
to be received in triumph, but a little ficknefs that he fell into by the way defer¬
red this publique rejoycing, which neverthelefs was performed within a while af¬
ter ; and I may fay that this Triumph was as happy for mc, as it was glorious for
Soliman^ feeing it was there that I came to know Dona in the habit of a Slave, who
can recount unto you. Madam, that fortunate dayes pafl^ige raore agreeably than I

asyouhaveddivercd him, he may be filled the wonder of our Age, and if my
Religion did not forbid it me, I would quit my Countrey with joy to live under
his Dominion. This difcourfe raade Jfiihnuxm to tremble, but Doria laying
hold on her fpeech, confirmed her yet more in the advantagious opinion which
(he had of ^o/zw/t;;, and y«y?.'«/&lt;2wbeing\ come to himfelf again, affured her that all
which he had faid of him was very far (hort ot the truth. This fair Troop enter¬
tained themfelves in this fort, untill that being arrived neer to the Caftle, the
Count and the Marquis came to meet the Princefs, who entertained them with a
great deal of refpeft. The Count, to acquit himfelf of theCommiffion which
the Senate had given him, faid unto her, thathe was not come only to congratu¬
late with her for the happy return of Juftiniano, but alfo to give her thanks (For it,
as the moft important fervice that ever fhe could have rendred to the Republiqiie;
that this favour from Heaven was doubtlefs due to her vertue, and to the vowes
ffie had made for him, rather than to the defires of the Senate, who had rendred
themfelves unworthy of it; how to teftifie unto her, that the prefept: had utterly
defaced the remerabrance of the paft, he intreated her that ffie would honor Geuoun
with her prefence, whcnas ffie had refolved upon the triumph of Juftiniano y to
theend that by the pomp and magnificence which they would bring unto it, tftcy
might at leaftwife teftifie their joy, although they could not teftifie their acknow¬
ledgement. This difcourfe made Juflinianoes heart to pant, and the Princefs to
change colour; for the underftood vvfell enough, that the triumph he fpake of, was
to be her mariage. She anfwered with very much modefty, that generall caufes be¬
ing without doubt more favoured of Heaven, than particular interefts, it was to
be certainly believed, that Juflmiano had Been reftored to his Countrey for the on¬
ly glory of the Republick; and that having neverthelefs encountred her parti¬

the Senate, thanto receive any from them; but, condnued ffic, interrupting luHi-

<p>Rcfently after fupper the Princefs, perceiving that the Marquis
was gon from the company, demanded of the Count  whedier
it were true that he had brought the French liberty into Geuona^
as he had formerly told her during the time of her folitarinefs.
It is fo true (anfwered the Count ) that if you knew in what
faffiion we live, you would be furprifed with it; Howbeit your
amazement would ceafe as foon as you ffiould knoW the wit,hu-
raour, and addrefs ofthe French Marquis. And feeing his pre¬
cepts arc not oppofite to pleafure, but yet conferving Vertue with a great deal of
retpeft, he was not much troubled to find out followers, both amongft the men and
the Ladies. But is it poffible ( faid y«/?/«/&lt;iw ) that he could vanquiffi thatjeloufic
which it fo naturall to thofe ofour Nation ? He hath for that ( replied the Cpunt )
made ufe of an artifice, which he alone was able to invent: He obferved within a
little time, after I had raade hini known to all the perfons of quality, every love in
Genoua, and wrought fo well by his addrefs, that in a ffiort while he was the univer¬
fall confident thereof. When as he faw himfelf mafter of all mens fecrets, he began
to perfwade us all in particular to the French liberty ;   to call us Tyrants over our
wives; and to make us comprehend that there was extrenie injuftice in prohibiting
converfation Unto Ladies, who alone could render it agreeable; That as for him, he
was refolved to ra.akc thera happy whether they would or no : and for that effeft
Cfaid he unto us) all they that have fifters muft permit me to fee and talk with them ,
to the end that having made them know, how Vertue ought npt to be untraftable^
andhow they think more harm when they are by themfelves, than they Would do
if they knew us raore particularly, I may make that fuccecd which I have projefted
for your advantage.   Befides (faid he unto us) this effay cannot be dangerous • for
whercaslneverhave an affeftion that lafts above a week, you need not fear'that
I ffiall make any great progrefs therein.    Each one in particular durft not refufe
him that which he demanded, as being his confident; fo that in a ffiort time hee wa«
introduced intoall the Honks of quality,raauger the foverity of fathers, and there-
fervednefs o mothers.    For he hath fo complying a fpirit, that he knowes how to

Hereupon all thofe ofhis faftion cryed it up with a great applaufe, and his advice
was followed, although there were fome that did not allow of it: The women al¬
fo made fome diffictflty thereof; but at laft the Marquis prevailed. He changed then
the whole Order ofthe company, faying it was the cuftome of France, that converfa-
tion ffiould be the greateft pleafure of a bal; fo that he played the mafter ofthe Ce¬
remonies in fuch manner, as in placing every one, without ffiewing himfelf affeft-
ed therein, hee placed each one according to his inclination. After that it
was a good while before he would fuffer the Violins to play, that the more com-
modity might be given to talk ; and in this fort, every one for his particular inte¬
reft, found himfelf fo fatisfied, as there was not any but avowed, that they had ta¬
ken more delight in this affembly, than in all the reft that ever had been. Sinccffiat,
he hath wrought fo well with nine or ten intcreffed perfons, as we meet two or
three times a week five or fix families together, where verily he delivers fadi plea¬
fing things, as cannot be repeated unto you, without lofingmuchofthcirgrace.lt
muft be acknowledged (faid the Princefs) that this is a rare man, and defcrves that
I ffiouldinformmy felf by what happy adventure hee hath preferred Italy hdott
jFr^wf^, for I have heard thathe is a man of quality. You have reafon. Madam (faid
the Count) to call it happy for us, but it hath not been happy for him, though the
end was to him glorious. I belecve (faid Jufliniano interrupting hira ) that her ex¬
cellency would be well contented to undcrftand his fortune. And I ( replied the
Count) to obey her, if I did not fear that the Marquis will not give me leafure for
it, but will come and interrupt my recitall thereof I am much deceived (faid Dorii)
ifhe doe not give you all the oportunity ypu can defire; for I have well obferved
that the faire Emiha hath not difpleafed him; and that being gone from hence, be¬
caufe ffie was not well, he followed her carefully with his eyts, and ifl miftake not,
he is gone to feek out fome occafion to fee her, or to premeditate fome letter, or
verfes to exprefs his paffion. The Count being of Pom^i opinion, yeelded to the

<p>The Hiftory ofthe French Marquis.
</p>
<p>I ffiall tell you then, Madam, that the Marquis is of an illuftrious Houfe, and of»
Province inFrauce, the name whereof is not in ray remembrance; and without
particiflarifing any thing more ofhis life, than the laft aftion which gavf him unto
us, you are to know that his vertue begot him envie , and confequently enemies ift
his country. And whereas he had alwaies lived at court, and in the warres,the late
King Francis ffiewed him a great deal of refpeft and good will, although hee was
as then but very young. Hc had not been wanting then at the battell of Pavy, where
he had performed wonders in perfon, and fo happily for his g!ory,a3 the King him¬
felf had been a witnefs of his valor; yet were there afterwards for afl that three
Gentlemen in his Country, whereof the one was called Marse, the fecond Beniers,
and the other Dtncourt, amongft whom fell out a quarrell, occafioned by the doubt
of his valor. Marse had hated the Marquis ofa long time, fo as it is credible, that
being unable to finde out any other meanes to deface his glory, hee publiffied
openly, albeit neither he, nor the other two, had ever parted from their houfes dii-
ring the warre, that the Marquis had fled frgm the battell of Pavy. This difcourfe

but r,t kngtli, after the found of trurapets,the oaths, &amp; other ceremonies requifite m
foch like aftions, they began their corabat, wherein they both ffiewed a great deal of
adrds and valour. At the firft Marse fecmtd to have fome advantage ofthe odier, he
appeared more aftive,niore ardent,and more vigorous; but towards the midft of die
combat it was eafie to judge, that Beniers had made fpare ofhis forces togiv^the o-
ther leafure to t pend his. Marse grew faint,&amp; the other fo couragious,as no man had
ever feen one fiaht more valiantly. They were a long dUie before dicy could hurt one
another; for it^hapned that thofe two f words,which each of them had, and that car¬
ried terror by the eyes to the heart of thofe who beheld two men armed in that man¬
ner, were notwithftanding againft their intention a meanes to make the combat en¬
dure ; in regard that the left hand fword ferved to ward the blowes which they gave
cne another, afwell as if each ofthcra had had a buckler.    When they perceived that
their own armes kept thera from dcftroying themfelves, they caft away their fwords
both at once, and falling a grapling together with a great deal of precipitation they
had recourfc to their daggers •" But Beniers being the ftronger,'and the more delyver,
hath Marse down under hira, and his hand wherewith beheld his dagger being in¬
gaged under the others, Beniers feekes for nothing elfe but a place not defended by
his cuirace where he might kill him, &amp; already had he his arm lifted up fortoftabb
hJm,whenas theKing, who would not lofe amanwhichhad ffiewed fo much cou-
rage,thrtw down his warder in the midft of the field to make them leave off, which
caufed the people to give a great fficut for joy, whereat Benires turning his head a-
bout gave hlarsk oportunity to disingage himfelf, and in this manner the Kings au¬
thority finiffied their ccrabat. But admire. Madam, the caprichioufnefs of chance, by
this which I am coming to tell you : The Marqui?,about whom the quarrell was,ar-
rivcs in poftat the very fame Towne, where the corabat was fought; he askes where
the King is?and whereas the people are never well informed of things,he is only told,
that he is beholding a combat, which he hath permitted unto two Gentlemen, who
had required it ofhim. This novelty touches him with curiofity; he goes without
further inquirie,or any thought that he had any intereft in this affair: he comes thi-
ther,hcc beholds the combat a while amongft the multitude,makes vowes for Marse,
whok demeanor and perfonagc pkafed him, wiffies againft his own proper intereft
that he may carry away the viftory, and without knowing it takes his enemies part.

<p>fhamc, defpight, and fury. There is one then ( faid he unto him that had acquainted
him with this bad newes) which dares accufe me of cowardife; and even the Kin
who knowes full well whether I tied from the battell or no, in ftead of puniffiing thfs
Impoftor, does him the grace to permit him the combat ; renders himfelf judge of
it, is ready to heap glory on him , and to declare him viftor if he furmountshis e-
ncniy.No,no,I cannot fuffer it,and I muft caft my felf difarmed as I ani,into the midft
ofthe lifts; 1 muft fight with them both together, or afunder, it matters not which fo
as I may be revenged, or die giorioufly. As he was in this refoludon theKing threw
down his warder to make the combat ceafe; and though the Marquis his minde was
much troubled, yet had he obferved that Beniers was in a condition to be viftorious
over his enemy, at fuch time as the King had given that fignal! of peace; which put
bim into fuch ftrange choler, as hee refolved to break through the prefs, to goe pre¬
fent himfelf, and in perfon demand fatisfaftion for the ontrage had been done
him by fo black a calumnie. What ( faid he to himfelf, in feeking ftill to approach
neerer) the King takes care for the life of a man that fpoyles me in my honour! hee
hath not permitted the combat then,but out of hope that my enemy would vanquilli,
fince affoon as it appeared that he had the worft, he retayned the hand ofhim that
would have ftabbcd him, and faved the other from the puniffiment which he was go¬
ing to receive: But it is juft that he ffiould periffi by my hand; and that I ffiould
be revenged by my relf. Inthemean tirae the prefs was fogrcat, and the people
fo thronged together for to hear what the King faid to Marse and his adverfary, as
the Marquis could not come neer hira, till he had told them, that their courage had
obliged him frora having either of thera acknowledged for the calumniator: and
that in perfuance ofthis grace he commanded them to publiffi every where,how they
knew from his mouth,that the Marquis had been one ofthe formoft in the front ofthe
battell; that he had been one ofthe Uft which he had feen fighting about him; and
that if all the reft had done their devoir afwell as he, hc had not loft his liberty .Then
turning himfelf to the principall perfons of his Court, I am (laid hc) a witnefs of
that which I fay ; and if any one dare make any doubt ofmy fpeech, I will raake him
feel what the difplcafure of an incenfed Prince is. The Marquis feeing the King
leave off fpeaking, caft himfelf at his feet, and furprifed in fuch fort, both the
Court, his enemies, and the King himfelf, as it was a good while before hee could
be heard, fo great was the murmure. But at length,after the people had been com¬
manded to filence, the Marquis fpake to him much afterthis manner. I know very
•well. Sir, fince your Majeftic is fatisfied ofmy courage, that I ffiould be fo too; but
it is not fufficient for your glory, that they whom you favour ffiould be valiant, ffiey
ought alfo for the juftifying of your judgement to be thought fuch by allthe world;
And therefore (if I may be permitted to fpeake fo) I cannot indurc that they, who
have traduced me two hundred leagues from the battell, ffiould not by experience
undeftand, that 1 know not how to recoil, either in a generall, or particular combat:
Grant me then out of juftice that, which you have granted out of grace to mine cne-
mie ; your equity and your glory is concerned herein, and you cannot refufe me
the combat which 1 demand,witliout covering mc with ffiame and confufion. The
King having attentively heard him, faid, that his refentracnt was noble, buthe
could not for his own glory accord hira that which he defired : That the publique
teftimony which he had given of his valour, was more glorious than the death of
his enemy, who by his comniandment would bc conftrained to ipubliffi all his life¬
time the contrary of that which he had reported; That ifhe Ihould permit him
the combat, he ffiould feem to pofterity, that he himfelf had made d&amp;ubt of his va¬
lour ; that it would be to equall him with his enemy, which by no means he would
do, neither was it juft he ffiould. The Marqui.s hearing the King fpeak after
this fort, wasfo feifed with fpight and grief, as he could not anfwer him. Inthe
mean time the King, advifing with the chiefeft ofhis Court about what fatisfaftion
hemight give the Marquis, never heeded his going away; for fuddenly thruffing
himfelf amongft the prefs, hedidfo, as before he could bc followed hetookpolt,

of ficknefs.  As for Marse, as foon as he knew that he was returned into his coun¬
trey, hc fent hira a challenge; whereunto he anfwer?, that ui regard of the Kings
charee  to the contrary, he could not accept of it.    The Marquis neded with this
refufall, refolved to force hira to fight ; and watching for him a good while after
in a Wood, that was not far from ^4r.re/houfe, and whither he went oftentimes
to walk, he perceived one morning a Provoft-Marffiall, accompanied wkh two of
hisfellowf, who carae along thorough the Forreft; he hid himfelffor fear of dif¬
covcry, and heard that oneof them named him, and faid that the King would have

afar off; buthe was much aftoniffied when hc faw them enter into Mar ses houfe :
whereupon he no longer doubted, butthat it would be impoffiblc for him ofa long
time to find an opportunity to fight with him.   He informs himfelf more particu¬
larly of the bufinefs; remains certain daies about this houfe, and at length learns,
that thcProvoft-MarffiallwasfenttoyW&lt;tneto apprehend him ;  for the King had
been advertifed both of his retreat, and of the time when he departed to return in¬
to has Country; So that oppreffed with many niisfortunes,he refolved to go and pafs
away certain raoncths in fome other place,  hoping that in the mean time they
raight peradventure be wearied with continual! guarding of Marse. Hcwcnt then
into Provence for his more fecurity, where one ofhis particular friends lived, thaf
was retired frora the Court. Being there, he underftands that the Kings difpleafurc
is pacified, and that his encmie is dead; fo that the impoffibility which he faw to be
revenged, makes hira take the refolution never toappcar again at a Court, whofe
Prince had not intreated hira very well. He paffeth into Italie, as being Mafter of
his Aftions and Eftate ; and after he had feen all that is remarkable on this fide the
mountains, heftaied in theend at Genoua, where fuch pleafant things have arrived
untohim, as one vvould hardly belecve they were true, they were foextraordi-*

thefe paffages; but I vvould fain know, what caufe Morse had fo to h|ite hira? I
rather think Madara ( replyed the Count) that there was fome love in the quarrel;
ifl be not deceived, Af^ne had four fiftcrs,and die Marquis but one; andthcy were
both neighbours together in the country, fo that vifidng one another very often,

<p>IBRAHIM, or                Part
</p>




<p>hon, hc repairs to the Marquis, fpeakes tohim ot-(W&lt;tr;cj bifters,aiid demands ofhim
which of them pleafeth him moft.    Heanfwcrs, that they pleafe him all alike;
that the eldeft is plump, fair-hayr'd, white-skin'd; that ffie hath agrcat dealof
fweetnefs in her eyes, and in her humour, butthat it is great pity ffie is no taller.
This man, who was called Alfac, beleeved that this was ffie which touched die
Marquis his heart, fince he found but this little defeft in her.    But the other pro¬
ceeding on in his difcourfe^he thought it was the fecond; for (faid the Marquis)
the advantagious ftature ofthe next; that ftately look ; that dark hair; that ovall
vifage; and that noble pride, which appears in her port and all her aftions.
Would render her incomparable, were her complexion fomewhat dearer, and that
ffie fpake a little more than ffic does.    I was deceived (faid Alfac then) and it is
this fame that hath vanquifficd him.    But (continued the Marquis) the mouth of
the third; her white teeth; that quaintnefs which ffie hath in the ayr of her face;
that merry and joviall humour j andthat which goeth beyond all the reft, that
charming and paffionate voice ,    which ffie governs with fo much art, gives
her fuch a grace, as would make her fumiount all hearts, were it not foralittk
inequality of humour that appears in her.    Nay now I know not which of them
it i.s, faid Alfac to himfelf; but for the laft (continued the Marquis) it muft bc
acknowledged, that that freffi and vermilion hew, proceeding from her youth,
which may be named the foul of beauty; thofe fparkling eyes; that black hair;
that comely neck; that mean and well proportioned ftature; thofe white hands;
and that which is moft inarvellous in the age of fifteen yeares, that nimble wk,
ivhich renders her the entertainment of a company ; which makes her talk very
agreeably of all matters ; and which puts a particular charm into every part of
her;deferves almoftthc whole heart of a worthy man, ifffie did notliveinthe
Country, and had but for fix moneths onely breathed the air ofthe great world:
but that originall fin which takes off much of her value, and the fole thought
that fhe isacoimtry Gentlewoman, is a foveraign prefervative for a raan ofthe
Court.    Alfae was then very much perplexed; howbeit hc conceived that the ob¬
ftacle which the Marquis brought to this laft, was the leaft confiderable; andthat
thereby he would conceal his paffion.    But this conjefture was not for all thatfo
ftrong, as hc   durft   fettle his judgement on it ,  as on an indubitable thing.
He preffes the Marquis yet in another manner, and precifely dcraands of him,
whether he be in love or no ; the Marquis, who thought hc was not to fpeak fori-
rioufly, anfwers, that he is, more than all the men of the wodd; the other in-
treats him to tell him with whom ; and the Marquis, who believes that this man
Ihathno hidden defign, is contented to tell him , for to keep hira ftill in doubt,
thatk fufficeth he affureshim,how in that which he loves, all thcbcautks ofthe
body,and allthe graces of the mind,are incountred; and that a mafter-peeccot
Nature might be made of it, if one could fee together, what he loves afunder.
^Ifac comprehended nothing   by thi5 difcourfe   ,   although it were true in
the Marquis his fence, who indeed was in love with thefe four maids; in each
©f which he found things that touched his heart, and others that did not pleale

Tlo^c • thatUe did not hate him; and that ffie fufpe ft s notwithftanding that he
hath a mind to her which fings, although according to Alfacs opinion it ffiould
beto the youngcft.   Howbeit he conceals his unquietnefs from his Sifter, and re-
foivesto found thera all, charging this not to fpeak aword to the reft of what
had paft between them.    She withdraws, and the fecond arrives with a look and
a modefty diat made him bekeve he ffiould be much troubkd to draw anything
outof her concerning that which he defired to know.   But he was much ama¬
zed, when as at the firft propofition which he made to her of it, ffie freely told
hira,but with forae little preparation before hand, that ffie beleeved the Marquis
loved her eldeft as a Sifter; that he delighted to hear the third fing; that the wit
ofthe laft did not difplcafe him; but as for her, ffic thought that he had given
her fuch tokens of his efteem of her, as he had given to none of the reft; and
that he had at fundry times fpoken to her in that manner, as ffie could no longer
doubt of it.    Howbeit, that for three or four dayes laft paft, ffie thought that to
fpight her, or to raake her more favourable unto him, he had caufed cne of her
Sifters to fing more, and had eyed the youngcft more than he ufed to do.   That
as for her, ffic could alwayes rule her will by his, but if he would permit her
to fpeak the truth, ffic muft confefs unto him, that ffie could be contented to mar¬
ry with a Courtier, being fo ftrongly dif-inclined from the Country, as ffie could
hardly refolve to talk with them that came to vifit her.   Her Brother promifes to
doe what he can to content her, and having charged her to be fecret, he difmiffes
her, and fends for the third.    What ffiall I make of all this (faid Marse to him¬
felf) I cannot learn yet whether the Marquis be truly in love or no, however I
am fure that I have two Sifters which are already defperately in love with him,
but it may be, continued he, that the other two will clear this enigma unto me.

demands ofhim at the firft daffi, whether it were to propound a Lover unto her
that he had fent for her fo in fecret;he anfwers her,that ffie was not deeeived,for in¬
deed it was to ask of her whether the affeftion of the Marquis did fatisfie hcr&gt;
She replyes laughing, that the obligation which ffie had unto him for having

<p>fvver him cruelly.    After this ffie went away finging a Song which the Marquis
had made for her, and left Marse fo confounded, as he could fcarcely bcleeve
what he had heard.    But at length the laft arrives, and whereas hc knows that (h:
had more wit than the reft, he alfo imployes more art in fpeaking to her .• He
cajols and carreffes her; calls her his Favourite, and his deareft Sifter; and af¬
ter an hundred proteftations of good will, conjures her to deal ingenuoufly with
hini; and to oblige her the more, confcffes unto her, thathe is in an extreme paf¬
lion for the Marquis his Sifter; and bclecving that he is fo too for her, he defires
her^ to tell him the truth of it, and if it be fo, to ufe him kindly,for fear he ffiould
oblige his Sifter to oppofe his affeftion.    She anfwers  thereunto with agrcat
deal of wit, that ffie would think her felf infinitely happy to be facrififedforthc
felicity of her Brother; but as for that which concerned the Marquis, ffic was to
tell him, that her life had not yet been long enough to bc able to difcern a feign¬
ed affeftion from a true; that it was fo little a while fince one had given over
intrcating her like a Girl, that ffic durft not as yet rely on her judgment; that in¬
deed it was true, thw Marquis had taken fome fuch particular care of her, as made
her think he did not wiffi her ill; andwhercashe was the firft wo.'"thy manthat
had fpoken civilly unto her, ffic confeffed freely unto him , ffie coulcl not chufe
but be obliged tohim for it; butthat therein ffic promifed to follow his direfti¬
ons exaftly.    The addrefs ofthis maid was not fuch, but that her Brother percei¬
ved by the change of her countenance that the Marquis pleafed her raore than (he
made ffiew of: But whereas he defired to have the liberty to think of fo ftrangean
adventure, he fends her away, injoyns her to bc fecret, and affures her that he •will
alwayes teftifie that ffie is dearer to hira than his other Sifters.    When ffic was gone,
befell a walking up and down (for the Marquis knew all thefe things aftcrwatd
by the third of thefe Gentlewomen, who out ofthe conformity that was betwixt
them continued ftill his friend, maugre all their diforders) and having been a while
without fpeaking; What, faid lie,the Marquis fhall make my four Sifters bc in love
with him, whilft himfelf peradventure is not taken by any of them, and I ffiall be
fo unhappy as not be able to touch the inclination of his one ? He will laugh in
his mind at his conquefts, and ray misfortune; and whilft tothe prejudice ofmy
houfe he ffiall be laden with the favours of fourraaids, I ffiall get but cold civili¬
ties from her, whom I love paffionately , and that alone can make up my fdicitic
But,continucd he, what counfell can I take ? If I have recoufe to violence; ifl quar¬
rell with him ; if I fight with him, and will make him explain himfelf by force,
for the intereft of my Sifters, then I ruine my felf with her; I lofe the hope of ever
poffeffing her; and it would be an ill way for one to prove his love unto a generous
perfon, to kill her Brother.    It is better for me then to diffemblc a while; to ob¬
ferve all his aftions; to endeavour yet to difcover whom the Marquis is in fovc
xvithal! ; and if at laft I can learn nothing certain , then to propound unto him
the choice of my Sifters, in demanding ofhis.    Behold in what fort Marse rea-
foned with himfelf .about fo intricate an affair (at leaftwife he hath recounted k
fince in this manner.)    But as Marse was thus troubled at home, fo was the Mar¬
quis in fome fort with his Sifter, who having another defign with herf~elf than
the marrying of Marse, would have him difpenfcwith her for entertaining hitn
any longer, and permit her to take all hope from hira.    Howbeit the Marqtus,

fourfokmaides whora I can love, isfo great an inhuraanitie, in the humor wherein
I am, as if you confider it ferioufly you rauft needs repent you ot it. But, anlwerea
his Sifter laughing,  you doc not love thera,  for how can you fhare your leU a-
raongft fo many &gt; 'Not love them ( replyed the Marquis) naughty Sifter, come, you
doe not know me, if you believe as you fay; for it is raoft certain that I love them
with ^11 ray foul; and that in all ray life I never found my fclf fo conftant,   nor f o
amorous. And whereas this maicl could not very eafily comprehend,  how a man
could love four at once, andtearm hirafelf conftant: for to make her underftand it,
he told her,  that by a very extraordinary adventure hehad no great affeftion t or
any ofthcra in particular, but meeting in thefefour perfons feparately, with that,
which he would have in one alone, he was fo defpcratcly in love therewith ,   as he
was never in fuch a paffion before. He told her further,  that ordinarily when he
found any thing that was amiable in a woraan,   he excufed the defefts which were
in her, and becarae in love widi all her perfon; but that in this incounter, through
a caprichioufnefs of love, he was Wounded in another fort. For, faid he ferioufly ,
it would be impoffible for me, in the eftate wherein my mind now is, to love any of
thofe maides fingle; and I ara never raore joyfull than when I fee them all four toge¬
ther. I behold the whitnefs ofthe firft; the look ofthe fecond;   I hear the voice of
the third; and admire the gcntlenefs ofthe laft. In conclufion, lam fo fatisfied with
this manner of loving, that when I could, by an unheard-of miracle, take from thofe
four maides all that doth pleafe me in them,   to make thereof a Ma^er-piece and a
niervaiJj fuch as I raay imagine, yet ffiould 1 rather chufc to love them as I doe.   For
in ffiould love but one of them , 1 ffiould be without confolation when ffie were in
chokr; whereas contrariwife 1 am never altogether unhappy :   ifl have angred the
fair one, the brown one regards me favourably;   and if I am out with the ferious
one, the merry one comforts me with her jocund humor;   and when it falls out,
that I am upon good tearraes with all the four, I have fuch delight as cannot be ex¬
preft. One prepares a bracelet for rae,   another ties a band about my hat,   a third
gives mc powder and effences, whilft the fourth caufes her .pifture to be drawn for
the love of me. In purfuancc hereof, I fing a fong that is agreable to all four, which
each ofthcra applies to their own partkular for a mark of my affeftion, and which
they al!_ commend with addrefs and joy : and that which is yet more worth than all
thefe things, is, that this paffion is fo fair and fo extraordinary, as the end of it can
never be unhappy.    For when as I my felf would contribute to mine own mine , it
IS impoftible that ever I ffiould arrive to that infortunate terme , which for the moft
part hniffies all loves, I mean marriage. If I ffiould love one ofthefe maides, it may
be that utterly lofing all reafon againft my cuftom, I ffiould alfo mary her;   but lo-

ver unto her Brother the defign vvhich fhe had, gives him to underftand, that du-
ring his abfence, a Gentleman of their Neighbours, extreme rich, of great coura?f'
and of much fpirit, had fallen in love vvith her; and that he being to return from
fhe Arn. y in a ffiort fpace, ffie was afraid left fome mifchiefmight fall out between
him and Marse.    It is not that I have any affefti, n for him, faid this Maid   but I
muft confefs to you, that I will never mary Ar^r.fe, though I think I could refolvc
to be the others Wife.    Come, my dear Sifter, anfwered the Marquis, doe not dif¬
guife your thoughts; fay that you are in love; that your pafsion is violent, and
vvith thefe charming words you ffiall obtain of me all that you can defire- I'will
return to the Court eight dayes fooner than I vvould have done, to leave you the
liberty to ufe Marse as you pleafe ; but when I goe I will leave our Mother an ab¬
folute power to mary you according to your own mind ; for I ara fo glad to fee
that you are not infcnfible , that I love you for it far niore than I did.   As they
were thus talking, Marse arrives, the Marquis hides himfelf againft his Sifters will
gets out at a back-gate, mounts on horf-back, and rides to Marses houfe, vvhich
was not far off, where he finds thofe four fai r Sifters, or to fay better, his four l\li-
ftreffes, all of them more joviall than ordinary, for they had every one in particu¬
lar fome hope to be the Marquis his Wife, by reafon of the propofition their
Brother had made to them of it.   They had alio attired themfelves extraordinarily,
to give hira new wounds; for they knew Well no day paft w ithout his vifiting them.
The eldeft had a garment on of green cloth-of-Silver, whereof the fleeves were
tyed up with carnatioii-filver'd ribbon, and her hair with the fame, which did
not misbecome a perfon fair-complcxioned.    The fecond had on a night attire of
pure white filver tinfell , which gave a kind of luftre toher fcriousand raodeft
afpeft ; the third alwayes glittering,was in a waftcoat of gridilyon fattin, fet all 0-
ver with filvcr oes ; asfor the youngcft, though her garment was plainer than
thereft, yet was it the gallanteft ; her habit was nothing elie but filvcrd tiffany,
imbroidered with flowers, lined with carnation taffata, and her head was cover¬
ed over with carnation and white feathers, which raui!: needs doe well with a young
perfon, whofe hair was black, complexion clear and lively, and eyes wonderfully
fparkling.    All thefe Sifters were much amazed in themfelves, at the care which
each of them had taken on one and the fame day, in fetting forth themfelves as
much as poffibly they could; and the Marquis wasfo furprifed to fee them all at
once with fuch magnificence and jollity, that he could not imagine what ffiould bc
the caufe of it; for commonly they obferved diis order amongft themfelves, that
dieie was one alwayes carelefly dreft, to theend that each of them in their turn
might fficw, both affefted handfomnef s, and handibnie carelefncfs.   But at length
theMarquis accoafts thera, divides his comp ementsand looks, comraends them all
four together, and without knowing what was in their thoughts, does things which
confirms them in their opinion.    He talks to them of love openly , fwears that he
is in fuch a paflion for them, as he was never in the like before; and whereas their
minds were prepoffeffed, they bcleeve that it is an addrefs of Court to fpeak overtly
ofthefe matters, and to leave it to her, whom one !oves,to apply it to her felf.    She
whomhebehelclbeleeved,that it was as much as to fay, it is for you ; and thofe
whom hc did not behold, beleeved, that out of refpeft he durft not encounter their
eyes, in fpeaking of a thing which might make them bluffi; in fine, they were all
very well contented and very well fatisfied.    The Marquis, who did not love to
make unprofitable vilits,demands new favours of them; hc will have a bracelet

toTxplIin hirafelf, withftands it, parts from this fair company , carries away the
bracel t,and conies back to his Sifter, who was very melancholick.    For it had
happened, that her Lover being returned, had furprifed her talking With Marse •
and whether he had underftood ofhis defign, or that ffie had before acquainted hiin
with it  diey had falutcd one another very coldly, and had talked as men that took
pleafure to contradift each other.   So that, faid ffie to the Marquis, after ffie bad
recounted unco him that which had befallen, I fee the matter in a cafe to break
forth, and fuddenly to produce fome mifchiefj it we doe not look to it in time-
No fuch thing, afifwered the Marquis, for whereas I have promifed nothing to
Marse, and that he too h.ith not fpoken to me of his love to you, or of any pur¬
pofe he had to marry you ; I raay tell him ifhe moves me about it, that I am en¬
gaged to another, and to raake that true , caufe your Lover to come to me,
audi will prcmife him my confent.  I know that thereby I ffiall baniffi my felf
from a place, where I have agrcat deal of pleafiire ; but fince I am of neceflity to
begone away within eight dayes to the Court, I could not make a better end of
this adventure.    For yf/&lt;?rjc forbidding me his houfe, I ftiall have a fair occafion
to write them a letter of adieu and defpair: withall, continued he, I perceive that
I begin to accuftorae ray fclf to the favours which I receive from thefe Gcntlcwo-
Hicn, fothat now thchappinefs which love gives me, being turned into an habit,
it is no longer hapinefs tome.    The Marquis his Sifter wasfo aftoniffied to hear
him talk thus, as ffie could not forbear laughing at it : They paft the evening in
thisfort, and not to lofe time, the Marquis his Sifter advertifed her Lover , that
the next morning he ffionld repair to her Brother to acquaint him clearly with
the intentions he had for her.    The note which ffie fent failed not to work the
effeft ffie expefted from it; her Lover comes juft as the Marquis is rifing, fpeaks
to him of his paffion for his Sifter, ffiews that he covets his alliance, and inthe
end expreffes his defires fo clearly, thatthe Marquis without further delay leads
him to his Mothers chamber, who favoured her Daughters wiffies, propounds the
matter unto her, gets her to agree unto it; and whereas this Lover was abfolute
Mafter of his Eftate, and of his own will, they refolved to acconipliffi this Mariage

<p>within four dayes, to the end that the Marquis, who was to return to the Court
might be at his fifters wedding. Thfog^s being in thefe tcrmes,   Marse arnves, who
</p>




<p>was come on purpofe to his Miftreffes Mother, to difcover his defign unto her. A
foon as the Marquis faw him enter, he defcends, he goes and imbraces him, invites
him to his fifters wedding, before he acquaints him to whom ffie is to be maryed-
feemes to believe that he is not intcreffed therein; talks to him of dancing and
joy; hoping thereby, that ^^rje,  feeing the matter refolved, would not explain
himfelf further, and peradventure would alter his mind. As indeed, Marsehearlni
this difcourfe, and knowing that his rivall was returned, makes no doubtbutthe
Marquis fpake the truth, onely he doubted,  in regard ofthe manner of the Marquis
his fpeech to him, whether he had obferved that he affefted his fifter.    He was mad
that he had not declared himfelf fooner, and that he was arrived fo latc; and in this
unquietnefs, he knew not whether he ffiould goe in or no, to be thefpeftator of his
Rivals trytmiph; whether he ffiould quarrell with the Marquis, though he knew
not as yet that he was faulty; whether he ffiould depart away without faying any
thing unto him; or whether he ffiould trouble this wedding with fome ftrange vi¬
olence; in fine he was fo confounded, as not knowing what to doe in fo unpleafing
a conjunfture, he fuffered himfelfto be condufted along by the Marquis, whofe
adrefs in this occafion was fuch, as without feeraing to perceive any change in his
countenance, he ftill continued talking to him of diverfion and joy;  and that too
with imbracing and putting hira gently on towards his Mothers chamber; where¬
unto as foon as ever they were entred, the Marquis prefented his brother-in-law to
yl&lt;/^rjc, who faluted him very coldly; in the mean time hehad leafure to tell hij
Mother and his fifter in two words, that to keep Marse from ffiewing his hatred
and refentment ,   he was not to be left alone  with   anybody.    Afterj'that civili¬
ties  were rendred on either part ,  the Marquis thought it was fittting that he
ffiould entertain the company; hc began then to  quarrell with his fifter , for
that   ffie   was the caufe of his rejoycing at a thing which was repugnant to
his mind;    but  withall he   was wcH affured,   that this   thing ffiould never
give him joy again , either for her*, or  any other ,   and thac  this compli¬
ance was no doubt the greateft mark he could render her of his love.   Marsi
hearing  this difcourfe, demanded ofhim,  whether   he meant   mariage by thai
which he fpake ? and the Marquis without further delay,   anfwered him laugfiing,
that it was of that deftroycr of lovc; of that Tyrant of libertic; of that enemy of plea¬
fure ;   which moft commonly disjoynes all that Love hathutifted ;  which difco*
vers all the defefts ofthe mind and humor,   to perfons that believed they were al¬
together perfeft ;   and that which was worfe than ail the reft for hira,   which ba-
niffics love, inconftancie,   and gallantry frora amongft men, to introduce into the
ftead of it, jcaloufie of honor, a falfe conftancie, and domeftick cares. So that, a$ you
fpeak ( replyed ^4r.f€ interrupdng him ) you believe it may be that you ffiould
muchobligeoneofyour friends, ifyou ffiould   mary his Miftrefs to another.  Ifhe
ffiould tell rae, anfwered the Marquis, that he would raary her, I ffiould not con-
tradift his intent, for I am fo much an encmie to conftraint, as I never oppofe any
thing; but otherwife ifa worthy man ofmy friends (hould appear to me extremely
anwrous, I doe not think I ffiould doc hira any great wrong ,    if I ffiould deprive
him of the meanes of marying hi^ Miftrefs,   in cafe his paffion ffiould diforder him
fo far,   as to give him a defire to doefo: And in the humor that I am, the greateft
proof of affeftion that I can render unto a maid, when I become inaraoured of her,
is not to marry her: yea, and I have met with forae, unto whom, the niorefavou-
rably to receive my affeftion, and to teftifie unto them th» refpeft which I bare
them, I have declared at the firft fight, that in becoming their Servant,! had ik) de¬
fign to become their Mafter; and in affuring thera that I was their flave, I affured
them that I would never bc their Tyram. It may be, replyed &gt;W^r;^,   you have not
alwaies fpoken fo openly; that I havenot, anfwered theMarquis, when I believea,
that thofo whom I loved had wit enough not tofufpeft that I had any fuch bad in-

you cond ran, have nothing in thera that caffies with reafon ; nor ahomain am
Ih t they havenothing indiera but that which is bad; for I have too much love
for the Sifter, and too much refpeft for the Brother; btit howlocver I am confi¬
dent that you will not follow thera.    It is true, faid Marse, tartly enough , that
inconftancie is not that wherewith he is to bereproched; and I know not whe¬
ther on the contrary, Vertue oppokd will not prove to be the onely crime that may
be imputed to' him.   The Marquis perceiving that the other was preparing him¬
felf to anfwer, and peradventure with bitternefs, continued to fpeak of the injuftice
of men in the dikerning of things.    For, faid he, if the diverfity of good books
renders a raan knowing ; if diverfity of voyages ferves him for an agreeable ftu¬
dy, whkh illuminates his mind, and informs his judgment ; if the diverfity of
fair arts is a knowledge that pleafes; if the diverfity of tongues paffes for a lau¬
dable curiofity , why ffiould one think thatthe diverfity of loves can produce no¬
thing diat is good ^   And why will one have the grace of novelty •, which is
the charm of nature , to be a defeft in love &gt;    For my part , faid Marse,
I wil! no longer oppofe this doftriiie, fince an univerfall change cannot be but
advantagious for mc, glorious for forae, and equitable for others.     The hidden
fence ofthis fpeech was eafily underftood by all thecorapany ; but the Marquis,
who inthis occafion did not d ;iire to dive into things, alter'd the difcourfe, and
faid unto yl/.:rje, that his Sifters muft needs honour this Wedding with their pre¬
fence, and that he rauft rejoycc with thera, for that they are not fo neer to flavery.
The honour that you will doe them, anfwered Marse;, wil! furprife them , not
becaufe your civilities hath not given them occafion to attend more from you,
but whereas this newes is unexpefted, it is fit that I ffiould goe and advertife
thera of it, tothe end they raay prepare themfelves to receive the grace that you
will doe thera.    The Marquis preffed him extremely to pafs away the reft of the
day with them, but he would by no means ftay ; He invites him alfo to his Sifters
Wedding, talkstD him of Bak, Lutes, Mufick, and of all the entcitainnicnts u-
fuall in fuch like Feafts: whereunto the other anfwered ftill with fpeeches ofa
double fence. The two Rivals quipt one another civilly, which doubtlefs might
have produced fome unlucky adventure, had not the raerry humour ot the Mar¬
quis fweetned the converfation.    Marse took his leave of the company, with a
forced countenance, which raade them conceive that he had ftrange unquietnefs
in his mind.   He went home then with fo much e^rief, as hc could not longer con-
ceaUt, and to miiiiffi k in fome f brt he defired to make his Sifters partakers of it.
Hefendsfor them, acquaints thera with the mariage of his Miftrefs, tels them that
the Marquis isunfaithfull, inconftant, a cheater, a courtier ; that cares fornothine
but to pleafe himfelf; that hath made a mockery of them ; and then recounts all
their converfation unto them.   Thefe four Sifters were not more amazed at this
Wedding whereunto they were invited, and the lightnefs of the Marquis his hu¬
mour,.

<p>mour, than to know by their Brothers difcourfe that they were Rivals, and equal-
ly beguiled ofthe hopes which they had conceived.    At firft they beheld one ano¬
ther, as if they would filently  reproch each other for concealing themfelves in their
defignes : But the third ofthefe maids, whofe mind v/as not fo fenfible of grief^and
that could not be long without giving feme marks of her humour,after ffie had pau-
fed a little,began to fpeak,and faid with atone ofthe voice of admiration,    I mnft
confefs the Marquis is wonderfull dextrous,   that could deceive f-bur inteieffed
maides; and though I did infinitely efteem him, continued ffie,  I did not think he
liad had fo much wit, nor that he was fo unv/orthy of my friendffiip. The miiidcs
of the three others were not fo moderate; and though the eldeft was of a very fweet
difpofition, yet could ffie not chufebut ffiew her refentment.  The fecond, alwaies
haughty, nianifefted hers,   by feeniing to ffiare very much in that of her brother •
but as for the youngcft, ffie was vext to the heart, for having fo ill affured herlirft'
conqueft; and albeit ffie had a great deal of wit,   yet ffie could not forbear ffiewin^
her choler.Howfoever the third  continued ftill faying, that this adventure wasa
new charm, which ffie difcovered in the Marquis, and that ingaged her to efteem of
him the more. In the mean time the wedding; day arrives; 'Marse feignes himfelf
fick becaufe he would not be at it; the fifters cxcufe themfelves upon their bro.
thers ficknefs:   Howbeit thethird makes a fecret match with one of herkinfwo-
meiijthat dwells not far of, to goe and fee this feaft in difguife; they mask them¬
felves then very bravely, and appear in that affembly accompanied with certain
niendifguifed too as they were. As foon as they were entred into the rooom, the
Marquis knew her that touched his heart ftill;   he   approaches to her, makes her
an hundred complements, and continues telling her, that he loves her paffionately.
But ffieiwithout reproaching him, anfwers,  that ffie does not doubtof it, andthat
the conformity which is between thera ought to work fo fair an effeft.  That never¬
thelefs it was fit they ffiould a little better examine their thoughts,   it fecming juft
unto her, that two perfons,   which made profeffion of beguiling all the world in
gallantery, ffiould not be beguiled between themfelves.  Thisfaid, this gcndewo-
man made the Marquis fit down by her,   whilft the reft of the company were dan¬
cing, and with a raoft pleafing relation acquainted hira with all that had paft, be¬
twixt her brother,   her fifters, and her felf. Hereupon they promifed much good
will one to another, eficeming too much of themfelves for ever fpeaking together a-
gain oflove. Shecounfelled theMarqnis not to come at their houfe ,  but fince he
was to be gone to the Court the day following ro fenda compkment to her brother
and her fi(ters,as indeeed hc did.iThe Marquis e-^ok poft the next raorning, leaving
his fifter very well contented, Marse in defpair, three ofhis fiifers in cholerenough.
&amp; the other latisfied.Ever fince that,Madani,there hath alwaies been a fecret hate be¬
tween thefe two houfes, until fuch time as Marse made the report that caufed the
cmobat, which Ihave;. recounted untoyou,8c that confequently hath fo happily forus
brought theMarquis into Italy.   I confefs, fiid the Princefs, that the hiftory hath
much delighted inc; and that I am much obliged unto you for a?cquainting rae vvith
fo gallant and extraordinary a man. As ffie was faying fo,   the Marquis came into
the chamber again;   whereupon ffie began to charge him for keeping fo long away
from a company,   which found his infinitely agreable to them-But he with a re-
fpeftive boldnefs, anfwered ,   that knowing very well how the Count would im¬
part fome part ofhis humor unto her,   he feared not to acknowledge,  that bdng
in doubt he fhould not alwaies well remember what ffie was, and alfo what he was,
he went away to expofe himfelfto the lookes ofthe fair ^^milta,   to the end that
having his heart re[)leniffied vvith love,  he might have nothing but veneration for
her. Ifabella could not forbear laughing though ihc bluffi'd in looking on Jufltnta-
no: vvho told the Princefs, that this forefight and refpeft ofhis, mentcd a great deal
of acknowledgment. And I too am refolved not to bc ingratefull; but I fear when
as you know mc, faid ffic to the Marquis, that you will have a paflion for me quiw
contrary to that wich you feem to fear.   For in fine, whether if be conftancy or ob¬

mon y       a    fo unjuft as to defire that our fenfe ffiould lule that of others, to
approve of nothing but what pleafeth us, and to condemn all that contradifts
our Tinions.   And they which are ofthis humour, hnd in therafclvcs wherewith
^o maintain their kverity.   They fay , that whereas there is but one reafon m all
things, there is but one way to be followed; that all they which cfloign them¬
felves from that, doe goeaftray, andthat fo they maybe juftly blamed     I ac¬
knowledge, Madam, replyed the Marquis, that there is but one reafon, but 1 mam-
tain allo^, thatk isfo difficuk tobe known, as he who thinks he hath found it,
is oftentimes further from k than others, which without judging foveraignly of
any thing fimply, follow the fenfe wherewith Nature hath infpired them.    And
indeed to fpeak truth, if it be neceffary for the equitable judging ofa matter, that
one ffiould bc look from all, andfo indifferent as to lean equally to each fide, or
to fay better,not to lean to either; hov/ is it poffible that any man ffiould be fo hardy
as to make any judgment ofthe aftions of others,principaIIy of that which regards
Love? But fince I have been taken at Genoua for an Aftrologcr, permit me to
play the cunning raan inthis encounter; I fay then, Madam, that our reafon is
notfo abfolutely loofed from fenfe, bat thac our temperament hath a great ffiare
in our opinions; andthat that juft mixture ofthe four humours, which renders
the fpirit fo clear and folid, and our health fofound, is fcldom found inany bo¬
dy.    There is alv/ayes one ofthcra that predominates over the reft, and by it we
aft according to the pleafure thereof; we ace grave, merry, chokrick, or patient;
infcnfible, or pafsionate.    And certainly it is not fo much the rigour of a melan-
cholickmans Miftrefs, that raakea hira cry out, figh every minute, ffied tears, pafs
away-Bights without fleep, rave from the purpofe, talk alwayes of defpair , and
appear with a langor, that feeras to be an effeft of an extreme affliftion; as the
power of this predominant hunioiir, which forces hira to receive all things after
this fort.    And to prove that which Ifay, wc are but to confider, that if the fame
rigour were addixftto a man ofmy humour, he would receive it in another fa¬
ffiion; the jollity and joy which proceeds from the temperament, is not eafily
troubled by things without; and certainly , that which makes the melancholick
man complain in Love, would giveme occafiou to laugh; that which makes him
to figh, would induce me to make verfes of gallantery; that which makes   him
weep, would quite cure rae ofmy pafsion ; and ifl ffiould pafs nights without
fkep, k would be, doubdefs, to give Serenades v I ffiould not rave inconverfing,
to weary others, arid make them hatcnic; I ffiould not entertain my Miftrefs with
my defpair; nor ffiould I fill her imaginadon with fad thoughts, which putdn&lt;^
her into a bad humour, might make her to ufe me ill afterwards.    But contrarS

<p>ly, I would talk to her ftill of all the delights of them that love one another ; and
whereas Love is alwayes reprefented in the midft of fports,   laughters, and'plea,
fures,  I would indeavour to infpireherheart with joy, that folmight theraoi^
eafily introduce love into it, to whom the painters do alwaies give a bed of flow-
ers, without ever laying him on thornes.   In fine , Madam,   far from perfwading
my paffion unto her by the langor of my face, I v\7ould ffiew her fo much fatisfafti¬
on in my eyes,   as ffic might very well perceive that her dominion would be plea*
fing to me; and that I would not bc like thofe people newly conquered,who by their
melancholy makes one bcleeve that they arc alwaies meditating fome revolt. There
arc alfo two kindes of Lovers, who by the humours which predominate in them
are made to doe ftrange things , the anxious, and the chokrick. Andffioughthe
former are not fo far eloigned from the melancholick   , but   that they have
fome  conformitic together;    nor  the chokrick   from that fparkling humor,
ancfthat fire which animates me; yet are they for all that differing in many things.
The anxious is fatisfied with nothing; the poffeffion offelicities, which he hath dcli¬
red, moleft him; he wiffies for quite contraiy things ;  he loves and hates ail at a
time; he hath a fecret enemy within himfelf,  that mingles bitternefs with all his
pleafures; he beleeves when his Miftrefs ffiewes him favours,  that (he is too prodi¬
gal! ofthcra, or that ffie deceives him; in conclufion he is eafily difpleafed; nothing
can content him; and when the perfon whom he loves gives him the leaft caufe of
jealoufie, it is enough for him to meditate on a murther. A man like mc , in fuch
a like occafion, would mock at his Miftrefs,  and his Rivall; a melancholick man in
France would fight very couragioufly, but as for an anxious man, Steel, Iron, and
poyfon, would be the leaft armes that he would make ufe of   As for the chokrick,
he would receive the rigors of hisMiftrefs withtrajifpoits of fury, fofar forth as to
offer affronts to her, to threaten her with all things; but as fhe dotides, which form
the tempefts, are diffolved when thunder breakes forth,  fo this man of choler hath
no fooner exhaled his fire by his cries, but he goes outof hirafelf,  and one onelv
look ofthe perfon beloved finding yet fome impreffion of heat in his heart,  doth
therein eafily kindle that again of lovc; Finally he is cifily angred,  and is as foon

almoft infcnfible; and cold predominates fo much in them,  as k it arrives that love
warmes them a litde, they are capable of enduring any thing :   For they are fo pow¬
erfully furmounted by lazinefs,   that for fear of ftiring they dare not change their
Miftrefs, but fuffer all things without complayning.   You fee then, Madam,^ that
the diverfity of the humours of the body cuntributes much to our appreheniions i
and that one and the fame thing is feen after a quite different manner.   And if we
will give credit to the Aftrologers in this behalf, they will tell you alfo,  that Sa'
turn by his influence makes all the melancholicks aft, as I have declared; that they,
over whom Jupiter predominates, are ofmy humor;   that Mars inflames the foules
of thofe , whom he governcs, with the fire of choler ;  and that the Moon infpires
thofe,   whom   ffie   commands,   with a coldnefs , which makes them almoft in¬
fcnfible. You will tell me it may be,   Madam , that thefe Starres are fofar diftant
from us, as it is hard to comprehend how they exercife an abfolute power upon
men; but ifyou confider that which they doe in the univerfall world,  you will the
more eafily belecve that which they doe particularly in man: for in fine the diver'
fitie pf feafons is derived from them ;  and this fucceffive change of heat and coW,
of flowers and fruites, which arc feen every year, is found alfo in our felves.  Wc
haveourfcafonsaswellastheyear,  and even as age changes our temperament,
in changing our humours, we likewife change opinions.   The fecond age of life)
which is the fidl for lovc, fcldom fayles in producing of violent paffions, whicli
are often followed by imprudence and indiforetion. As for the third, the paffions
therein are not fo lively, but withall they are better governed : One conccalcs the
piftures which he hath of his Miftrefs;  One no longer ffiewes the bracelets ot W'l
which ffie gives; One hath as much care of her confervation as of his pleafure ; ana
k h in thi» age alone, where gallantry, a little   reafon, and a great deal of love.

<p>After theMarquis had given over fpeaking, and left the company very much
fatisficd with his wit, jHfliniano,v/ho v/ould not abandon reafons party, and who
defired the Princefs ffiould think it was not out of caprichioufnefs and fancy thac
he had veneration for her, anfwered theMarquis in this fort. You combat rea¬
fon with fo much force and addrefs, as it cannot be eafily beleeved that you doe
not know her; and the fame wit which you have made ufe of to overthrow her
dominion, nianifefts fufficiently unto us that you are one of her fubjefts; and if
at any time you quit hcr,it is only in this pafsion, from whence fome, who are not
acquainted with the nobknefs of Lovc, would baniffi her. But for al! that it is
certain, that ffie finds a place every where ; that ffic can bc the Miftrefs of all men;
that ffie can fubdue all the pafsions, and all the griefs of the mind ; make thofe of
the body to bc fupported without impatience; withftand our temperament, and
the influences of the Stars ; and by her infinite force makes us vanquiffi our
felves, by obliging us oftentimes to deftroy our own pleafiires.
</p>
<p>To know this truth,we arc but to confidcr,that the humours which predominate
in us, theconftellation ofthe Stars, and that change which time works in our
temperament, do not change anything but our inclinations, which certainly arc
caukd by all thek things: Howbeit that is not powerfull enough to delude reafon,
who no way depending either on the melancholy humour, or on the Stars, can al¬
fo judge foveraignly of all the apprehenfions wherewith ffie infpires us. She hath
a feat more trankendent than our inclinations, whkh many times are found tobe
very low, and correfted by reafon. All Andquity would forniffi us with exam¬
ples of it, and the wifeft have left us marks of owing all their vertue to their rea¬
lon, which having made thera prefer the ftudy of Philofophy before their inclina¬
tions, hath kept thera from being the raoft infamous amongft men. And truly it

<p>clinations (hould have the conduft of our lives : And to make it apoear Z'
we have a deftiny more noble than that fame, we are but to obferve thatT
Creatures, which move not but by inftinft, have one like unto it and prn
rail to al! their kind. All Harts feek diBamum when they are hurt all B d
cf feafon fock for the Spring-time, and fly from the Winter withoilt favlinf
which the Lyons doc not, nor fo many Birds that doc not ffiift Country Thi?
inftinft then is feen in all the creatures without ever failing, even as the race of th
Sun, the courfe ofthe Rivers, and all other things which doc cot depend of them'^
felves, doe alwayes follow the firft order that hath been given them, and that isfo ne"
neceffary to them, as they cannot fail. But as for man, it is not fo with him • he is
abfolute Mafter of his thoughts, and of his aftions; nothing forces him wffiine
violents him, and he is fo independent from al! things, as he can even attenipt ui&gt;on
his own life, as was often feen at fuch time as it was lawful! to prefer death before
fervitude. It cannot be faid that this aftion, which deftroyes Nature, is an effeft
of a naturall inclination; there muft be then a more powerful! reafon ffian our in¬
clinations, feeing it is certain, that of all the interiour apprehenfions which Nature
gives us, there is none fo ftrong, fo predominant, nor fo univerfall, as the defire of
life. In the mean time, fince there have been men found able to vanquifh it by rea¬
fon, it may bc confequently beleeved, that there arc a great number of others, who
can force their inclinations, and judge foundly of all; and who, without confider-.
ing that which pleafeth thcm,confidcr only that which ought to pleafe them. For in
conclufion, our inclinations doc not move in us fo powerfully as one may imagine
they doe; they having nothing common, as I have already faid, with this inftinft
of unrcafonable creatures, which forceth a whole kind to doe One and the fame
thing, and which is inftead of reafon to them; fince we fee, that not onely all Nati¬
ons, all Provinces, but all men in particular, are fo different one from another, that
many times there is more difference between an Italian and an Italian, than between
the whole Nation^and that ofthe Perfians and Tartarians.Our inclinations,!f wc will
know them well, are no other than a fecret motion, that carries us without violence
to pleafe our felves more with one thing than another; fome love the Woods better
than the Rivers; and others the Waters better than the Forrcftg, and that raay be per¬
adventure by temperament; they leave not both of them for allthat to know, mau¬
gre their inclinations, the beauty of thofe things, and to delight in them, which
doe not touch their minds the moft fenfibly. But to ffiew that it is fomewhat too
weak a thing to deceive reafon , we arc but to confider, that ufe alone forces our
inclinations. Liberty, which is fo naturall to al! the World, is a good that is not
defired by all the women of Italy; cuftome onely makes them find their houfes large
enough for their walks; and the place of their devotions far enough for their voy¬
ages. Judge then after this, whether reafon can fuffer her felf to bc vanquifhed
by enemies which time doth furmount. As for the paffions, I confefs, that they
are a little more difficult tobe deftroyed; but yet I maintain, that if reafon will
oppofe them, ffie will appeafe them, and reftore tranquility to the mind that is mod
troubled. If reafon then will aft, it is certain, that, maugre the force of tempera'
ment, the influences of the Stars, and the ages of men, wc ffiall fee the mclancho*
lick fociable; thccholcrick patient; theflothfull more aftivc; a young Lover with¬
out inconftancie, and without indifcretion. I acknowledge neverthelefs, that there
is a kind of paffion, or to exprefs my fclf more clearly, a kind of Love, which rea¬
fon cannot deftroy. This impotence pxroceeds not, for all that,from her weakiiefs»
but it is becaufe ffic never deftroyes that which ffie hath eftabliffied; and becaufe
this Lovc, whereof I fpeak, is rather an effeft of our reafon, than of our paffion;
and truly, when a Lover hath, in the perfon whom hc loves, met with the beauty
ofthe body, ofthe mind, and ofthe fold; when as Venue is mingled with all thefe
charms; when as his vowes are not rejefted • when as he fearcs but the incon¬
ftancie of Fortune, and not that of his Miftrefs, it is impofsiblc to fay otherwife than
that reafon is the Mother of a pafsion, that doubtlefs cannot diforder the mind;

<p>He morn-ng bringing joy and delight again to this fair
Troop, the Princefs would needes have the Count and the
Marquis beftow that whole day too upon her, and to pais k
away the more agreeably ffie led them to Monton, a little
Town, fome mile from Monaco, where the Princes of her
Houfe had built a magnificent Paviglion, which ffie defired
to ffiew unto theMarquis. &lt;-/£milia finding her felf better
that night, raade one alfo of the company, fo that theMar¬
quis was in the beft humour of the World. And whereas the
Princefs obferved that his refpefts werenot dif pleafing toher kinfworaan, fhe faid
to the Marquis, for to oblige hira to talk , that whereas love ought to be without
fupercherie as well as war , he having not as yet declared himfelfto bc i/£miltai,
ffie might by his obfervance and fervices be induced to bekeve that he was capable
oi a folid affeftioii^ and fo ingage her further than was fitting. &lt;'y^mtliahla{kti
at this difcourfe, and the Marquis \vithout giving her leave to fpeak, affured the
Princefs, that he ffiould not long conceal himiclf, andthatthe Count could con¬
firm this truth unto her. Indeed, laid the Count, he hath not ufed to keep himfejf
from being knowen, and if hewodld take the paines to recount unto you th'e Srll
adventure that befell him at Ge&gt;ioH.t, his addrefs would appear to the beautifull (vf*
tnilia, and the relation no doubt would give your Exccllencic much content. With¬
all it will be better walking towards the evening, than in the midft ofthe day, and
you cannot pafs it away better. The Princefs , who was perfwaded, that the Mar¬
quis his adventures could not chufe but be very pleafant, intreated him thereunto
with a great deal of civilitie; hc excufes hirafelf a while, but in theend ffie con¬
jures him to it in the name ofhis laft Miftrefs; It is ffie indeed, anfwered he, that is
moft powerfull in my h^art, and that makes mc to obey. The Princefs condufted
them then into a Cabinet, that was open on four fides , and whereof all the walks
were of criftall glafs from the top to the bottom , that fo the profpeft might bethe
more free. After they were fet down there on feates of ebony, covered with carna¬
tion .Uld filver tinfell, the Marquis began his Hiftory in this fort.

have declared ray felf the proteftor ofthe liberty of you Ladies; and who in conclu¬

Deliverer. I tell you all thefe things, that you may not think it ftrange, if in the fe¬
quel ofthis difcourfe you underftand fome adventures , where the civility ofthis
hde the raountaincs is not regularly obferved. I know, anfwered the Princefs, all
that you have done forthe publique libertic; theCount hath already ac(]uainted
me, that the galanterie, which is feen now at Genoua, is an effeft of yours; and thac
in the end you have been fo powerful! in perfwading the- vertue of women, as there

to make you comprehend it, that I fay to you ffie foemed fair unto me. In fine, ffie

I had painted forth ray love,to her Miftrefs; but though 1 had imployed all tS

agreeable unto her ( for I  had talkecf with her twice at the window bXTZll
oiLucretia ) but that afterall 1 was noc to pretend to her affeftion.    1 confefsIh
for this time her reiiftance provoked rae more than her be^utv.  Behold me then ic
folvcdto know from whence the impodibility of my enterprife procectkd;  I call
la Roche to my fuccor, and command him to leoair to Lucretia, and to imploy all
his cunning to difcover Livtaes true thoughts. He preffes her,  he intreates hei he
thre.iten; to abandon her,   and yet for all that ffie acquaints him with no part ct"
that he dclires to underftand. At firft ffie tells hira , that ffie knowes noffiing; after

remedy; and laft of all, without any thought oftellinii him that which he reqnired
ihe faies that Livta is ingaged in an affeftion to another ,   whom ffie will not name!
This newes put me into choler,   and made me refolve once more to temptthelide-
litie of Lucretia; to which effeft I gave la Roche a diamond, therewith to oblige this
wench to meet him one evening, and difcover untohim the v.hole truth of I;fMf;
hiftory.     My liberalitie failed not to perfwade her better than his eloquence, (he
nicetes him in a place fir enough out oi the v.ay to be overheard of any but my felt,
^vho umkrflood what ffie faid without her perceiving it; and there, after (he had

my Miftrefs was making an end of dreffing her,   and that (he was doing ibraethiiie;
about her head, where (he had no need of rae , ffie obferved that I looked out at the
window with a great deal of attention, and that I had alfo pulled up the grate. And
whereas fiie asked of me ivhat it was 1 looked at fo earnelfly, I anfwered her boldly,
that it was at the worthieft man of all her lovers; meaning your Mafter, who then
paffed along thorough the ftreet.   I fear me&gt; replyed (he fighing, that you and 1 are

And for my part, I confefs unto you, that 1 (hould bc more fenfible fora raan of his

tert fell not out fo, for ftill I conferved a littk affeftion, and a great deal of de¬
fire to be revenged.    But before I would refolvc on anv thing, 1 was willing to bc
vet better informed ofthe raatter, andto underftand certainly whether//orz-f^-
L lay concealed at Leanders.    It was ray good hap, that ^aleno, whom que¬
ftionlefs you know , and that hath a wit very proper to irabroyl an intricate
affair ,  proved   to be a  dear confident of his.     And whereas we had con¬
trafted agrcat friendlhip together at ray being at i?owi?, I went and fought him
out    and^having found hira , I foon obtained  of him what 1 defiredf.^     He
told' liie , that not above an hour before he parted frora Leander; how it wa$
true that Hortenfo lay concealed in his Houfe ,   by reafon of an amorous ad¬
venture v/herewith he was very much troubled ,   becaufe he was   inaraoured
ofa ndvce oi Cinthtoes, named AureLa, withwhom Hortenflo had had a parti¬
cular comraercefor a good while together : How he was in good hope , Hortenflo
going away, and having no further pretenfion there, that he might have decla¬
red his love to Aurelia , but how far from that, Hortenflo, not onely remained hid
in his houfe, but had alfo obliged him to carry a letter to this Gentlewoman, to
crave her pardon for his parting away without bidding her farewell, excufing
hirafelf upon this, that his grief for leaving her had kept him from doing fo. He
told me likewife, that Aurelia had received Hortenfio's letter tvith much teftimo¬
ny of affeftion ; that Leander had been greatly tempted to difcover unto her how
ffie was betrayed, andto make his profit of his friends deceit; but that in con¬
clufion friendffiip had prevailed with him above love.    That being returned to
Hortenflo, he had very much preft him to let him know why he was unfaithfull
to Aureliat how hehad freely anfwered thereunto., that his inclination was to
Ltvia; how for the other, he ferved her out of acknowledgement, it being moit
certain that he was very much obliged unto her.    How after all this he had de¬
manded of hira, whether a friend of his ffiould difoblige him in thinking of her,
fince he loved her but for confideration^ Uow Hortenflo wasnetled with this dif¬
courfe , aM had teftificd unto him that he would not endure it.   Behold, Madam,
theeftate of things ; Livialowed Hortenflo, and was beloved ofhim; I loved X#-
via, and was ill intreated of her ;   Aurelia loved Hortenflo ,  and was  betrayed
by him ;  Leander loved Aurelia ,  not daring  to difcover it unto her ,  and
was an inftrument of his friends treafon; falerio was Leanders confident, and be¬
trayed him for my fake ; Lucretia for being faithftdl to/^ ^cff^f, was unfaithfull
to her Miftrefs; in fine, we all of us almoft did that which we ought not to have
done.   The bufinefs ftanding in thefe tcrmes, I refolved to fpeak once more with

contemning negligence, I faid unto her in fomewhat a bitter niaiiLr fw
be,taireff Uvta, that being unabk to merit any thing of you as a Lover   v.7 ^
the quality of a Gentkraan-Uftier I raay be perraitted to help to lead ion    f
i&lt;now not, anfwered ffie, with aforious countenance, what renders you fobold.
to interrupt me in my way ; but I know very well, that if you have not a m
pole todiipkafo me, and did know my humour, you would not be fo incoiili
derate as to dare to fpeak to me with fo much liberty; for I make profeflion ofa
modefty, which cannot fuffer fuch things, and which you raight very well under
ftand by the coldnefs wherewith I have alwayes treated you.    I confefs that the'
difcourfe neded mc ; Icould not endure this fevcre vertue in aperfon diat had
none but for me ; andthat reprochingme with her rigour, feemcd as though fhe
Would make nie ferve for the triumph of her Lover.    I retained her then by the
arm, as ffie was offering to goe away, and in a quipping and jeering manner, be¬
holding her with a malicious fmile, I faid unto her; icis true, Livia, that! have
been raffi and inconfiderate in daring ro lift up ray eyes towards a perfon of fo ex¬
traordinary a vertue, as cannot fuifor one to adore her; as cannot endure one
ffiould fpeak to her of Lovc; as loves even darknefs, and hates the light, bccaiif: k
niight difcover that which ffie would conceal from moft men.    Indeed, anfwered
ffie, I hate the Sun, becaufe by it I fee you.    It may bc, faid I unto her with thefame
countcnance,and looking juftly on her, that you do not hate the Koon fo much to¬
wards raid-night.    Whereupon (he ftrove mightily to get away, but in regard!
held one corner of her vail, ffie durft refift no turdier, perceiving plainly that I no
longer refpefted her.    Nay, faid I unto her, as ffie would have gone from me, yoii
muft hear me whether you will or no, for fince i t is a futc of Love, it is but juft
that you ffiould hear me, as well as you have heard niy Rivall ; and that to bc well
informed ofthe juftice of our caufe, you give him audience in the night, andnie
in the day; for] doe not defire that in confideration ofme an handkcrcher ffiould
be hung in the Window; that LwrrffM ffiould defcend into the garden; that a door
which feem? to be ffiut, ffiould be left open; nor that I ffiould bc a gallant, who
feems to be abfent, and yet fades not to be at the adignation which is given him.
Verily Livia's aftoniffiraent raadc nie almoli- repent for what I had fpoken, but in¬
deed I could not contain ray refentment.    The firft diing that Livia faid afterthis
difcourfe, was; h.hLucretia,youhawe betrayed me f But this Wench,who inthis
occafion appeared to mc to be the moft dextrous and daring that ever was,anfwered
her with an extreme precipitation; I Madam ! would to Heaven you were not more
betrayed, in acknowledging that which I never revealed.    In the mean time , l»
Roche, who had heard allthat I faid, wasr iich vexed at my enga^m^ Lucretia by
my difcourfe; fo thatapproching to me, f e faid foftly to rae in French, 0 Sir^
what have you done? I doc not know, faid I (fepping a little back, but, if thou
canft, re-accommodate this diforder.    During this, Lucretia fwore falfe oaths to
heiMiftrcisfor the clearing of her innoccncy; and the ^oor Livia was fo furpri-
ledj as file could refolve of nothing ; in fine, wc v.creall four exceedingly perplex¬
ed ; I was vexed for having fpoken fo laviffily ; Lucretia was much troubled in
juftifyin;&gt; her felf; my Agent knew not what to doe, either for Lucretia, or forme;
and Z-zr/.f could think ofnoth ing that would fatisfie her : She vvould fain-have
railed on me, but ffie faw that I was too much acquainted vvith her affairs to be
incenfed more; She could have been contented never to have feen me again, but (he
feared left partin.a; away without faying any thing unto me, I ffiould publiffi that
which I knew. At laft, (hc vvould willingly have recalled me,for I vvasftept a lit¬

<p>ic,arprocheduntoL,^/.,andfaidunto her forthe juftificatfon ofi;.rr../-*, with a
kenSg irnccritic: I knoi very well, Lady, that I do put my felf in finger of being
turned away by my Mafter,   in dikovcring a thing unto you, which he grf^tly la¬
bours to conceal, but the condition wherein you are, and the innoccncy of Lucr^^'f'
forces rae to open it unto you. Know then, continued he,   that whatfoever he hath
faid unto youis not theeffeft of niybodies treafon, butofAftrology, which he un¬
derftands pcrkftly. It is a kicnce wherein he is become fo expert,   that if I ffiould
recount unto you the mervailcs, which I have heard hira tell, you would be migh¬
tily forprlkd with it. And whereas he is paffionatdy in love with you, feeing you
very rigorous to him, he hath fpcrtt every  night for thefe eight dayes in con¬
templating the Starres,  and turning over his books,   to dikover the caufe
thereof, and without doubt it was by  this meanes that he is come to know that
whichhe hath faid unto you: he hath ffiewed me, condnued hc,the garden, where
you were, in a great s}afs,  though I would   not undcrftand what you faid.
Trudy the invention ofthis lad amazed me ;  it was in vain forme to make fignes
unto him to hold his peace; the raore unquietnefs that I ffiewed, the more he conti¬
nued fpeaking; and 1 may fay that 1 was never in greater pain, for I heard all that he
faid. But whereas! faw that he went confounding things, andthat from an Aftro¬
logcr he would quickly make me pafs fora Magician ,  in talking of an inchanted
glafs,   I refolved to help forward this trick,  that fo I might make him hold his
tongue, Vv herefore I called him fomewhat rudely,  and having commanded him to
withdraw, 1 came to X/fM with civilitie enough,   juft as Lucretia was faying to
her boldly, how (he had already heard it affured indeed, that I dealt with telling of
fortunes. And having fainted her for the better colouring ofthe bufinefs,   I feemed
to bc very angry with la Roches imprudence, in difcovcring to her a thing ,   whicfi
I would not have known, inregardof the brutiffinefs of the people, who imagine
that one cannot obferve the Starres, without having commerce with the Dcvill; and
know not how to put a difference between Aftrologic and inchantments.   But
hnce the fault was done, I defired her to oblige mc to her difcretion, by not publiffi¬
ing that which had been told her. I faid unto her alfo, that parting from the Court
of France, I had paft through Provence , where hapning to be lodged near to a great
Noftradamus,  fo admirable in this fciencc, as it was not known whether he ffiould
be tcarmcd a Prophet, or an Aftrologer , I had been fo happy, as to touch his incli¬
nation, andto gain his friendffiip even to the point to teach me apart of the ex¬
cellent things he knew, either for Aftrologic, Phifiognom'y, or Chiromancie.   In
hne, 1 (pake to her with fo much art, as ffie beleeved me; and beleeved too that L«-
cretia^a, innocent, who on her fide played her part fo well,   as ffie made me affia¬

<p>fclf much perplexed, when as this old man faid to her i n a grave tone that m
men had imployed all their lives in this ftudy,and had taken upon ffiem'ffie naaie f
Aftrologers, but that few had come to the point of defcrving ir.Then turning him t
mc with a more open countenance, he faid unto me, that iTi were fuch a one as hi^
daughter told him, he would ferve me with all his heart; that he was very mu h
affefted to men of merit, and to the lovers of fciences, whereofthe vulgar wer
ignorant; and that in conclufion, if, he ffiould tell me truth, he muft confefs that i^n
times paft he had given himfelfto judiciary Aftrology; but that the trouble of do¬
meftick affaires had kept him from excelling therein ; howbeit that he ftill kncwe-
nough to be able to difcourfe a little with me of it, if* I would come and viUit hini
at his houfe, whereof he ffiewed me the door. I leave you to judge, Madam in what
a cafe a man raightbe , that knew not fo much as the names of the Signesand Pla-
nets; I made ufe of confidence then in the incounter, and told him that I vvould
not fail to come and take outaleffonwith him, and affured hira that he (hould
have a fcholler of rae, vvhich vvould receive his inftruftions vvith a great deal of
joy. Leonardo Q fo is this man called _) took this true fpeech for a modeft
civility ; and faid unto me again, that he ffiould be glad to hear me tel! him
fomething of his fortune; and to perfwade me that he was knowing he faid to nie
alfo, that he had a great clefire I ffiould goe and difpute vvith him a little in his Ca¬
binet, that he might know whether the Planets ( except Mars and Saturn^ whofe
influences be the happieft, are not they whofe pararclls are the greateft. Now forme
that ffiould have been healed of a quartan ague vvith a word lefs terrible than this
I faw it was time to retire , vvhich I did after I had told him again that I vvould
very ffiortly come home to him and ffiew him my ignorance. He vvould have obli¬
gee! me to enter prefently vvith him , btit I excufed my felf dextroufly from it, and
fo departe4, after I had falutcd Livia civilly enough, and beheld Aucretta vvith a
iign, that teftificd unto her how I was forry I had given her fo much unquietnefs
info little a time. I was not four ftepps from them but regarding this adventure
with a more quiet eye, 1 found it fo pleafant, that I had no other paflion but to
make it laft as long as I could : And this manner of revenging my felf appeared fo
fweet unto me , as I thanked la Roche above an hundred times for finding out this
invention, feeing it had fucccedcd fo well. Now entring into my lodging I met
with Valeria, unto whom I gave an accouilt of all that hapned unto rae , wherewith
fie was fo furprifed and raviffied, as he could not believe that which I told him, fo
much did hc fear that it was not true. He would not rely upon my word, but would
have the teftimony ofmy Agent too; and though I was offended at it, yet was he
above an hoWCr doubting whether it were a jeif, or a truth, which I told him. But
in the end, perceiving I fpoke ferioufly he believed me, and this trick fo pleafed hij
humor, and touchedhis inclination fo mightily, that hc loved rae a great deal the
more for it.lt was advifed thanifince the father had had a part in the dcccite,and that
the bufinefs raightbe divulged, that it was better to have me pafs for an Aftrologer
than for ah impoftor, and to fow the bruite of it about the Town, before Leonardo
Ihould have leifure to difcover that hc had been gUlIcd: But I oppofed this advifca
</p>
<p>food while, for, faid I, no fooner ffiall Ibc confidered as a Contemplator ofthe
tarrcs, but they will come and ask mc an hundred queftions, whereunto I (hould
not know what to anflvcr , fo that I cannot tell how to turn my fclf in this affair.
What yoii ffiall anfwer, faid my Agent &gt; You ffiill infwer, continued he, juft as o-
thers doe; fometimes I, fonietimes no, bc it favourably or fatally, and for the reft,
much good may it do them ; for in conclufion, 'an Aftrologer never warrants any
thing. Valeria fell a laughing at this difcourfe, and told me likcWife for the uphol¬
ding of this opinion, that this fciencebeing fo dilficuk as it was, it might be that
chance would make me prophecy fooner, than all Aftrologicall rules and fpeculati-
ons; That I was but to (peak alyvaies obfcurely; never to affirm any thing with cer¬
tainty; to confider a little the quality and age of perfons; to fpeak fcldom of the
paft, or theprefent, vtfithout good information threreof; andof tlic future to din

countenance and his difcourfe that he was, I will not fay, an Aftrologer   but  \
</p>




<p>leaftwife a man that was addiftcd to extraordinary fciences; howbeit I did

<p>I was there. And this too is one of the leaft things he can doc ; for if I fhall tell
you the truth, I have feen and heard a pifture fpeak, and that is it whkh caufes
the confufion wherein you fee me. Leander was fo furprifed, as Valerio told nic that
he changed colour at it, and earncftly intreated him to bring him acquainted with
me, which he promifed to doe, upon condition that he ffiould not publifh what 1
had told him, for fear I might bc fufpefted to be a Magician; and that at lcn&lt;^th
after many other difcourfes on this fubjeft, they parted very well fatisfied one of
another. And for a conclufion, Valeria f2.id unto mc , this is the firft fod I
met withall; then he recounted to me how hc went unto the Academy, where he
had imparted to a great many the Wonders that I did ; that to publifh them the
better, he had told them unto them in their ear, and had prayed them not to
ipeak of it, or at leaft wife not to name me; that going from thence he went and
made a turn about the Market-place , where he had met with a man , who re¬
counted unto him part of the things that he had told in fecret to the Academy, as
one that was verily perfwaded of it; which had fo aftoniffied him, as to keep
his countenance hc was fain to enter into a Tennis-court, where hehad found a-
ncther man, whom he knew not, that was talking very earneftly to five or fix per¬
fons, which hearkened to him very attentively, and affuring thera that Iwas the
greateft Aftrologer ofthis Age; ancl that hehad feen mc doc an hundred things,
whi^h he recited unto them. That whereas he could not forbear laughing, he had
fet himfelf merrily to contradift him, but that this raan without going about to
feek for reafons to convince hira, had told hira roundly, that he fpake in that raan-
ner, becaufe he did not know rae, but that he fpake upon certainty, for that I was
one of his beft friends, it being not an hour fince he parted from rae; fo that after
he had recounted all thefo things unto me, faid r'".j/^no, defpairing of making a
better encounter than that ofthis man,I came away to find you out,fo fatisficd with
my lye, as if it ffiould alwayes fuccecd fo luckily, I would raake a vow never to
fpeak truth again. After we had laughed well at this adventure, and rightly ad¬
mired the fantafticalnefs of the World, which loves to bcleeve, or at leaft to pub¬
liffi bad newes, and prodigies, we faw my Agent return, whofe voyage had had a
quite other fuccefs. He had met but with few to publiffi that whichhe defired
ffiould be known,fo that being mad for having done fo little for a man ofhis humor
and addrefs, be had refolved not to come back till forae good adventure bcfdl him.
He had fought then in vain for fome one to deceive, when as a Maid, naraed Camib
la,-who feryed Aurelia, faid to hira in paffing clofe by him at fuch time as on:
could fcarce fee, follow mc. It is fufficient to fay, that this Lad was brought up
in my fervice, to make one be affured that he followed her foot by foot, for fear of
lofing the fight of her. This Wench led him into a by-lane, where few folks
came, for it was almoft nothing .but garden walls; When they were arrived
there^ Camilla told him, that a perfon very confiderable, both for her merit &gt;
and her beauty, attended a fpeciall fervice from me; that the reputation which
I had of being the civilleft of men , made her hope that I would not refufe her; and
that if I would do her this grace , I ffiould not fail then to be at a little garden

dif-reet as he is knowing. But at laft after a reafonable long cominunication, where
Camilla ftill affured, that ffie would by no raeanes ferve fuch a Mafkr, ffie told me ,
that I was not to fail,   if it wcrcpoffibk, in being at that garden door the fame
nieht when as the Moon was down;   or if 1 could not bc there accordingly , that
then 1 would be there the next night at the fame time ; that ffic would be .ready at
that place to give me entrance, and her Miftrefs in the garden, where I ffiou d fpeak
with her. 1 conkfs, when la Roche related this unto us that I could not chufe but take
sreat pleafure in it, ^and much defire to read the note that was written to me.   If I
had as happy a memory as a ^#w^»^« Heros , I would recite it unto you without
changing a illlable, but fince I hive it not, it ffiall fuffi'ce that I do tell you in gene¬
rall, how Aurelia intreated me with a great deal of ci vilkie and affeftion ,   that I
would imploy that niervclous kicnce,  which 1 exercifed fo nobly, in fetting her
wind at reft; that from rae alone ffie expefted fuccor for her unquietnefs, and that in
fine,if I v/ere a Frenchman(which according to her fence was to fay civill) I would
not refnk her. Valerio was fo raviffied with this encounter ;   my Agent was fo glad
of it; and at firft daffi I found it fo pleafant, as we paft away an hower very merrily.
But whenl perceived that Valerio would have mc try this adventure, ray pleafure
diminiffied by the half: The more I oppofed his will, the more he perfifted in Van¬
quiffiing mine; it was in vain for rae to reprefent my ignorance unto him, thedif-
ordcr that might arrive unto rae by it, the perplexity Wherein a man would find
himfelfto be, when he rauft fpeak of that he does not know; for to all thefe objefti¬
ons he had wherewith to anfwer rae.   Hc in the firft place laid it down to mc for a
ground, that to the end I raight not be taken for an impoftor by Leonardo, and to au-
thoril'e the cheat which hc had ufed to an hundred perfons, in affuring them that
I was a great Aftrolo ger, it was neceffary,   that I ffiould ufe two or three one after
another; that otherwife I ffiould lofe the reputation which he had gained me ;  that
ifl refufcd to meet Aurelia, it was irapoffible bttt ffie ffiould fpeak ofit to fome bo¬
dy, and fo I ffiould be cryed down ,  and out of abilitie to be revenged of Livia by
this artifice ;  that I cduld notracetwitha fairer occafion toraake ffiew ofmy art
with facilitie, in regard it required but the beguiling of a maide,' who doubtlefs
was well perfwaded already ofmy fciencc, fince ffiehad been fo hardy as to intreat
me to come and fpeak with her; that in fine, feeing ^«rtf//&lt;« had been fo weak as
to belecve things juft as one vvoulcl defire ffie ffionld bcleeve them , it vvould quefti¬
onlefs be very eafie for me to fadsfic her; And for a conclufion,faid he unto me, ffic is
young, (he is fair, (he wiU meet you in a garden ,   and irt the night, judge now af¬
ter all this, whether you are not to go thither. It is certain that this laft reafon mo¬

nude no longer queftion what I ffiould doc; wherefore I prepared my fclf for it,
and for the more fecur i ty,   Valeria and my Agent armed themfelves to attend rae at

could not fear that the univerfall adorer of women,   ffiould be betrayed by a wo¬

what niore;and that Leander vyas the fame in whofe houfe 7/or/-f«/;o lay concealed*
1 remember all this, faid the Princefs, interrupting him , and to teftifie it unto you'
I remember that Leander loved Aurelia, and durft not tell her fo much, becaufe Hor.
tenflohad ionie coranierce vvith her, although it was //methat poffeffed his heart
and that L(f;*«^i?r play'dbut an outward part in being conftrained to fcrvetheim-
pofture of his friend, and to carry Hortenflees letters to, Aurelia as ifhe had bccnab-
ient, though indeed he lay concealed in his houfe for to goe every night unto Ljvi/
in a garden.Since it isfo,faid the Marquis, I am then but to tell you, Madam,that
^fter Leander had been povverftilly perfwaded of the wonders which r^/mo had told
him I could doc, he changed the refolution he had taken to ftay till//orffw/a had
broken oir with Aurelia,\nto that of difabufing her by a pretty fubtiil way, it (he h-d
had a true ground for it, an.l that I had been fiich a one as he beleeved me to be. And
behold how hereafoncd with hirafelf; I am going, faid he, to Aurelui for a letter
which (he is to give mcto day for Hortenflo, whora ffie beleeves to beat Naples, or
on the way thither, ffie hath already fhewed a great deal of grief for his ablence;
now ifl can bring her to fpeak of that again, I will tell her ^hatValeno hath told
me of the French Marquis; fo that ifffie ffiall happen to bc curious to fee her abfeni
Loverbythefcience of this man, ffie ffiall likewiie fee that hc is not aiNaples-^ that
he is ftill at &lt;7fw«^; that hc loves another, and by thefe meanes I ffiall deftroy her
affeftion to hira, and it raay be raake ray profit of this diforder. This refolution ta¬
ken, he goes to Aurelia, who after ffie had given hira her letter , fayled not to fpeak
ofthe abfence of her Friend, to ask of hira whether he thought it would notbe
long ere he would return ? Whither he had not taken this feparation heavily ? and
whither he had not already a longing to fee him again, though it were but lately
fince he went away 1 Yea fo great a one, anfwered Leander, who would by no
meanes lofe fo fair an occafion, as I ara almoft refolved to try the fciencc ofa gr^ac
and excellent man , that is not far off. Aurelia ftraitway would needes know of
him what he meant by that which he faid, whereupon he recounted unto her all
that Valerio had told him, and a great deal more; that I raade the dead to fpeak, and
thofe that were abfent toreturn again , but in fuch a raanner, that one faw the per¬
fons , whom one defired to fee, as if they had been effeftuaJly in the place where
diey feenied to be; and that this was done without inchantment, and by naturall
Caufes, but hidden from moft part ofthe w^orld; that one muft be very skilfull inthe
knowledge of ideas and fimpathies for the comprehending of aliy part ofthefe
niervclous effefts; but in fine, how he was certain, that what hc faid was true. v^«-
relia hearkned to this difcourfe with much attenfion; at firft, fhe feemed to doubtof
that which Leander told her, but it was doubtlefs to make her felf the more alTn-
red ofit. For after he had confirmed the matter unto her, as ffi.e defired it; andthat
hehad told her my name, fiie demanded dexteroufly of him where I lay, andby
what way one durft propound fuch things unto rae, feeing I was a raan of quality)
and that raade no publick profeffion thereof. He anfwered her, how it was tobe
done by requeft, and that ifffie defired any thing ofme, he had a friend that wast¬
ry intimate with me. She thanked him, andfocivilly gave him to underftandthat
ffie would be well contented vvith his cleparture. He was no fooner gone, butflic
calledC&lt;«w///rf, vvho was the confident of her fecrets (for ffie recounted afl this to
me afterwards) and reported faithfully unto her all that Leander had told her.And
for a conclufion, ffie (hewed her that ffic was abfolutely refolved to fpeak vvith me,
and to intreat rae to let her fee her dear Hortenflo , of vvhom ffic had not taken her
leave. They rcafbned a while upon this fubjeft, but at laft lovc prevailed vvith her
above &lt;^ood raanners. Camilla told her Miftrefs, that ffic knew a raan by fight vvhich
ferved mc; fothat without further delay ftie chofe rather to write to rae, aslhave

to me     1 anfwered to this dikourk with a great deal of fubraiffion ; afterw.ods
helpikctomcof the reputation which I had for Aftrology, of the things that ffie
had been told ofme, and how much (hc had defired to fee me.    I received thefo
oraifes with a carelefnef-, refpeftfoH enough for all that, which doubtlefs made her
belecve that I thought I well dekrved it.    And ftill to gain time I lengthened this
difcourfe as much as poffibly I could; but ffic, that came not thither to makeconi-
pkmentsfaid with a low voycc, as though ffiehad been afraid to be over-heard,
though there was no body there but Camilla, that kept Sentincll at t.ie Cabinet-

mc that it would be eafie for you, ifyou will, to fpare rae the labour to   tell
you that Which I defire of you, fince without qneftion you know it already.
It is certain that this difcourk furprifed rae after a ftrange fort; audi beleeved,
in the confufion wherein I was, that I ffiould find nothing to anfwer her with; but
at length, after a great conteft with ray felf, it is for the fame reafon, faid I, that
your raodefty ought not to keep you from fpciking; for feeing it is a fecret which
I am not ignorant of, what you ffiall fay of it ought not to add any thing to your
confufion.    It is true, faid ffie, but I ffiould be glaclder to hear it from you, than
tohave it delivered by me; be not therefore fo lieorous, andif itbep6ffible, doe
that which 1 defire without my telling it you.    This pbftinky made rae almoft
mad, and 1 vow to you, that the modefty of the fevereft Miffrefs that ever I had,

ita, 1 ffiould be willing enough not to oblige you to the doing bf a thing that
feeras unprofitable to you, if Iliad not a fecret reafon which confTraincs me there¬
unto; and fince I rauft let you underftand it, know, that by the force ofmy art,
I can tell not onely that which you defire ofme, but whatfoever hath arrived unto
you,that which you think at this prefcnt,and that which ffial befall you hereaftcr;buc
if by a plain and faithfull relation, jou doe not ffiew the confent you bring to
that which you would have rae doe for you, it will bc irapoffible for me to ferve
you; and beware, faid I unto her, lifting up niy voice, left that which you call mo¬
defty, bc not an effeft of the doubt you have of my Science, in defiring by this
effay to affure your felf of it.    There rauft be confidence in this myftery, continu¬
ed I, for I doe not work onely by thcordinary Wayes of Aftrology, but I think I
have gotten fome extraordinary knowledges which go beyond thern:And to teftify
it unto you, 1 will prefently tell you, if you defire it, all the moft fecret thoughts

with a great deal of precipitation , and faid to mc almoft trembling, feeing it is a
tnbtite which I muftrCnder unto you, I am refolved for it; then ffic redounted
unto me that which I knew already without inchantment, Im can, that fhe loved
Hortenflo; but ffie told rae afterwards that which I knew not, namely, that ffic
would have me ffiew her that Lover, whom ffie beleeved to be at t^aples, but was
fldlX at Genoua.   This propofition put rae into a ftrange diforder ; I Void her at
firft, that the matter was not eafie; that it behoved her to have a great deal of cou¬
rage to undertake it; thatthe appantion of Spirits, which Were not at that time
many other but a fantafticall body, did alwayes bring fear along with it; and
that ffic ffiould think well of that which ffie defired, before ffie undertook it.    Shd

open countenance that her confidence pleafod me; and that I was raviffied to f
a perfon of her Sex have a Spirit hardy enough for an enterprik which made til
boldeft to tremble.   But to make it fuccecd, ffie was to write a note, according
the tearnis which I would diftate unto her, and let me carry it away to make m^
figures upon it, affuring her that I would tear it as foon as the myftery was finilli^
ed ; and that this amongft the Learned was called, the making of a covenant with
the Ideas.    She made a little difficulty at it, but having told her how I could doe
nothing without that, ffie confonted thercuntO;and by good hap there was a pen and
ink in the Cabinet, and a Table-book, wherein we found a white leaf.   She besan
then to write what I diftated unto her,    which ifl be not deceived was much af.

</p>
<p>Whereas her mind was already pre-occupatcd with the opinion of my skill,
thefe equivocating words, of an Angel of Light, of Darknefs, of Conjuration, of
blcffed Spirit, of Heaven, of Apparition, of Vifion, and of Fear, failed not tocon.
firm her in this belief.    And then too I pronounced all thofe great words widi fo
imperious a tone, as I perceived her to be terrified therewith.    After this, ! would
needs fee her hand alfo, and would have her fix her looks upon me; I demanded
of her the hour and day of her birth, and made many other obfervations, which
would be too long to recite.    But at laft, all thefe devices being over , I quitted
Aurelia, after Ihadprondfed her that within three nights ffie ffiould fee her dear
Hortenflo, and fo Camilla came to conduft rae forth.    In traverfing the Garden I
obferved that Camilla hid her face with a great deal of care, for fear left I ffiould
read the fecret of her heart in her eyes; and whenaa I perceived it, I faid tohsr,
laughing for the raaking up of the Comedy , in vain, Camilla (for fo had I heard
Aurelia call her^ doe you feek to hide your eyes from rae, when as I plainly fee your

that was naturally merry and joviall, if yoti know my fecret, doe not tell it unto
my Miftrefs, for then will the poor Naftagiobe turned out of doors.    I had fuch a
mind to laugh at this fimplicity of Camilla, as I got me out in haft, for fear I fliould
burft out into laughter, or be ftifled in the place ; howbeit I told her in going fordi
that I would be difcreet.    I found Valeria in fo great an impatience to know what
I had done, as I could not make him refolve to ftay till we came to our Lodging
to recount it unto him, for we had not made three fteps but we ftood ftill, fo tkat
little lacked but we had paft all the night in the ftrcets; bur at length we came dii'
ther, where I recited all this unto him.    Bur the pleafure ofit was, that I had been
fo accuftomed fo fpeak to Aurelia in a grave tone, as I delivered every thing un¬
to him juft as I had faid it.    And to make up the matter, there were fome inftan-
ces, where I was not very certain whether I were not indeed the fame which I gave
cut ray felf to be.    When as I ffiewed him Aurelia s Letter, he demanded ot me
what defign I had in raaking her to write it ? What defign, faid I ,  even to have
it to fall into the hands oi Hortenflo, who bclecving that Aurelia knows he lies con¬
cealed at LfW&lt;rr^ houfe ,   in regard ffie writes unto hira, will not fail to be at the

a great deal of unquietnefs; and I ffiould without doubt have rather given fome
marks of my refentment t.i ray Rivall, than have caufed a letter to be delivered
•into hira; but 1 never needed four and twenty howersto cure me of fuch a ciif-
cak. 1 kit then nothing raore for Uvta, but an extreme defire to trciible her plea-
lure- fo that to arrive thereunto, I had as much patience, as was requifite for me to
havcinthis incounter. We fet our felves, T^/.m and I, fome dofcn pacesfrom the
door,out of which Hortenflo was to come,under the jetting-out portall of an houfe ,
that was buik after the and que manner. As for/rfi?or/7^ he approched nearer, yet
not fofar frora us, butthat we raight hear all that he (hould fay unto hira. And
whereas it wascxtrcrac dark, and that his way tycd him to pafs by th'" place where
we were, ive conceived that we ffiould hear, without being perceived, how he
wt.iuld receive this meffage. As indeed, he was no fooner come forth but 1 heard my
Agent fay unco hira, that Aurelia havhig underftood he was in Genoua, had fent

hiraielf be taken, when he had no mind to it; Hortenflo then was coiiftrayned to be
contented with that which had been faid to him. We heard him ftamp with his foot
on the ground, chap his hands together, and fay with a kind of voycc, which ffiewed
both aftonilhment and grief; what dcvill hath difcovered to Aurelia that Iwas
here? It rauft without doubt be an effeft of the fecret paffion of Lww&lt;^fr, who hath
hoped by ruining mc with her to eftabliffi himfelf in my ftead. Some three fteps from

pretty while after. We underffood this accident,  both by the difcourfe which h*
held, and becaufe he ftood ftill. We got us up, Valerio and I, againft the wall • but t
ronfefs to you ,  that this adventure was not pleafing to me: I was fo affra'idth \
Hortenflo vvould not feek as hc ffiould do for the letter, and fo my defign IhonM
fail, that I may (ay I was never in more -.inquietncfs.  Me thought he vvaittoofar
from it to find it; that he had forgot the place where he had let it fall; that perad¬
venture it was near to me, though I did not perceive it; in fine, I was even vvij.
.ing to feck for it vvith him; and my imaginadon fo troubled mc, as I believed]
fivv it in twenty places, where certainly it was not. And when ray mind was
deceived in this manner,  I was in a pain that cannot be expreft; For whenas 1
ti\oUiiht that I fa'?v it in a place,  I underftood by Hortenfloes going diathcvveiit
troni it, vvhich fo madded aie, as I had like to have loft al! patience. But at length
after he had fought up and down a great while for it, and that he had faid an hun¬
dred things, which would have pleafed a man that had no intereif in the affair   1
hcai d hini upon a fuddain fay with much joy , at laft I have got you again, and
have not lolf ray labour: Whereupon he went prefently away, and  1 retaining V,\lt-
lerio, who would have continued follow ing him, told him, that if the like (hould
befall me again, J fhould go wild; that this adventure was both too pleafing, arid
too offenfive, for mc to be once more expokd unto it; and that withall wehadno*
thing elfe to do with him. Wc got us away then to our lodging, where we found my
Agent, howbeit we went not to bed before we had laughed fufficiently at the a:d-
dent ofthe letter, and at all thatwhich Hortenflo had faid in feeking for it.    Inthe
mean time he was come to Leanders houfe, where after he had read the letter, whicli
he knew to be written with her own hand, he was confirmed,  as we underftood il-
ter, in the defign of feeing her. Hc beleeved, that all thofe words, of blcffed Spirit,
Angcll of light, and darknefs, which Aurelia had taken for markes of inchantiueDt,
•w^ere termes of galantry, that could not part frora a fpirit that was ranch incenfed,
He firmly refolved then to fee her the night enfuing; and thereby to conferve her
to himfelf^ preferve the reputation of Livta, and deftroy the defignes ofhis friend,
ivhonvlie waspcrfwaded had betrayed him; for he could not conceive hov? Ame¬
lia could come to knovj any thin^ of h\m other vtaies.    But at length day came,
which I paft away with an impatience that holds mc ftill; forthough I had thefanic
very day two very pleafant coiiverfations with tvvo men, whereofthe one niocktat
Aftrology, to oblige mc thereby to fpeak of it,  and the other faid that it was the
cxcellenteli: of all Sciences, to carry me to the fame things yet will I not fpeak there¬
of; for even as I am now talking, I am in haft to tell you, that affoonas the time of
Hortenfloes alfignation approched, I went and put my fclf in ambufcado,   with arc*
folution to fee the end ofmy inchantment. Now it hapned, thatthe weatherbeinj
extreme hot, Aurelia lay in a low room,   whofe grated windowes were upon the
ftreet, and where Hortenflo had often talked with her. But, Madam , to give youth:
full pleafure ofthis adventure , I am to tell you, not onely that which I faw, ana
that which I heard, but thatwhich paft between AureliaandCamilla,\shovcc(m-

how it would not be effcftively Hortenflo vthich ffic ffiould fee, but fomething that

la unto her, that it is Hortenflo w hich makes this noite, or to fay better his phaii-
tafnie ? 1 do notbelc:ve it, anivvered Aurelia, howfoever open the window, and
pull up the iii-ate. This wench had no fooner obeyed, but perceiving Hortenflo, they
both of them gave a sreat ffirick ; Camilla finding her felt as very a coward , as ffic
bdieved ffie v\as; and Aurelia being nothing fb confident, as ffie had thought ffie had
been. Hortenflo expounded this aftonifliment after another manner, and believed
that the choler fhe was in againft him , put her into that cafe vyherein he faw her,
nameiy vvith a countenance extremely changed,and her fpirit fo confounded, as
ftic could neither fit ftill, run away, nor behold him. And whereas he was corac
thither onely to appeafe her, he faid unto her that at laii: this Angell ofdar|^nefs
Was come by her conjurations to fee an Angell of light. O rae, fiid Aurelia, it is
the voice of Hortenflo ! but I am not able to anfvver him ; nor is it to fpeak to him
that I have vvilhedto fee hira. In faying fo, her exceeding fearfo reaniraated her
forces, as ftie was able to get away into a Cabinet, whereof the door was open.
Asfor r^/w///^, ffie vvould fain have foflowed after her Miftrefs, but her aftoniffi¬
ment kept her from if. Not being able then to do more, or to fay better, not know¬
ing what ffie did, ffie hid herfelf under the table. Hortenflo was fo amazed at that
vvhich hc faw, as Aurelia could hardly be more. In the mean time , that he might
get her to come back again , and knowing, that ffie could hear him well enough
trom the Cabinet where ffie was, belaid unto her with a languilhing voice to
move her the more; Am I come fb far then, Aurelia, onely to fee you, and will not

tohim out of the Cabinet to be gone; and that flie made a vow how ffie would never
fee Hortenflo more; unlefs it were Hortcr,flo indeed. He who believed that ffie meant
he V, as no longer Hortenflo, by realbn tA his change, called to Camilla , with an in¬
tent to defire b.er ihat ffie would get Aurelta to come forth to hini again; but fcarce¬
ly had he named her, when as this wench, who had marked on which fide the door
of theC.ibinet was, moved herfelf with fuch vioknce to get from under the table,
for to eic.;pe away, as ffie overthrew it, together with the^light that ftood upon it,
which in turning down was cxtinguiffied; The noife which the table made, the
cries of C..vw/7/.i, the voice of Hortenfio, and the darknefs , fo frighted Amelia ( for
ffic believed that al! this diforder was caufed by the phantafme') as ffie fell into a

<p>as it were better I ffiould want good manners,  then deprive you ofthe pleafure of
hearing it. I wil! tell you then, Madam,fince your filence feemes to permits me fo
doe, that Valerio hid a fetvant, called Vefpa, whofe inclinations were proportiona
ble to his condition, being of fomewhat a dull fpirit;  he never came a nights into
the chamber where we vvere,  but to help to make his Mafter unready, and then
went prefently to lye with la Roche in a room which was foparated from ours one
ly with thin bords and tapeftry hangings, fo that fpeaking never fo little lowd one"
niight hear from the one place what was faid in the other.   When la Roche and Fef.
pa were a bed, this laft demanded ofthe other, whether it were true that I knew all
that was done in the world, as he had been lately told&gt;L^ Rache,who meant to make
himfelfmerry with him,   affured him that it was fofar true,   as that I perfeftly
knew what any body did, if I did butjinowthe name of the perfon. Alas, faid Fel
pa then,   I would not be bound to fcrve with fuch a Mafter! For how ffiould one
fpend his life with a man,   to whom one durft never tell a lye ? It is fomewhat an
hard cafe, faid my Agent, fpeaking a little lowd,  to theend wc might hear him;
howfoever it muft be fo. I liad as Iccfe dy, faid the other, as have my Mafter know
all the lies that 1 tell him, when as I   return from fome place, where I have ftayed
longer than I ffiould: for, as you know, we want not excufes for the ftcaling of an
hower to beftow in our pleafures;   Mounficur was not at hobic; I waited for hima
long time; he ftayed me with a purpofe to have written to you ; I foughtforhini
in divers places; your clothes were not done;  I was to fee as I went along whither
your Gittern were ftrung or no ; and fo ,   according to the diverfity of occafions,
diverfity of pretexts are alwaies found : But as for you, I do not fee hovv you can
live j you durft not, I affure my felf,    entertain tvvo three of your companions
whilft he is at the Comedy, and pafs away an afternoon in making good cheat. I
durft not indeed, anfwered my Agent, unlefs it were at fuch a time, as I know hc
had great affairs in hand, and fo had no leifure to think of me.   Neither could you
have the pleafure, faid ?^(r/p&lt;?, to recount his fecrcts; to fay he is in lovc vvith fuch
a one ; he goes often to fuch a place ; he writes to fuch a perfon; and that which ij
the worft, ifhe hath ill intreated you; whether it bc in revyling you ; or in threat¬
ning you with the baftinado; or if occafion ferves,   in giving you a whirret on the
car; you durft not complain to your friends of it: Whereas to me, it would bcthe
depriving rae of a great confolation, ifl could not fay to one;   he is raore fantafti'
call than aMulc; more extravagant than a Hobgoblin; and togivehim toalldie
devills in hell when he is untoward. For when I have faid all this, I return home,
as ifl vvere well revenged, and had faid fo much to him himfelf. As for me, faid
la Roche,   mine is none of the worft, and I am feldom in the cafe you fpeak of I
wiffi it may bcfo, replyed the other , hovv ever you muff needs confefs, thathe
vvould very much incommodate me   in one thing; for hovv could one ferve hitn
well, or be well clothed, if a man ffiould not make forae profit to hirafelf of the
money that paffes through his hands; I ffiould bevery forry to fteal ought fi'om
any body, but in that cafe I muft be excufed. It is not to hord it up, that I take any
thing, but to do him credit vvith it ;  and then the recompences vvhich Mafters
make us is not fo great, but that we raay vvith forae juftice recompence our felves.
For that, faid la Roche, you have reafon; and there I lofe a fair oportunity, vvhich
you enjoy.    You are fo unhappy too,  continued Vefpa, that as I perceive you dare
not think of quitting him, ancl of looking out for a Maflcr fecretly, as we common¬
ly do, when wc find not our felves well vvith him vvhom we ferve : and to con¬
clude, I ffiould chufe rather to be in the gallyes,   than in the fervice of this man: I
fhould not have fpoken thus freely to you, added hc fmiling, for fear he (hould have
known it, ifyou had not told me, that hc is to know the hamc of them vvhofefe-
crets he defire to know; for as for that vvhich I am called by, he will be coufcned
in it, becaufe I took it upon me but when I came to Genoua, by reafon ofa fmall ad¬
venture which befell me a 5^«o«»^, of whence I am.   You would have reafonfor
that you fay, replyed my Agent, vvho was willing to put hira in fear,  if he did
not know mine;  but if to morrow he ffiould have a defire to know what I have

<p>dcjiie he would alfo know what you have fayd unto me; for otherwife his foi-
ence'would be very confufed. Then am I undone, fayd Vefpa, but howfoever, ifhe
muft kn. -vv all that I have 'fayd unto you, let him know alfo that I never took much
frora my Mafter^t a time, to the end that he may be contented with making me to
he turned away. We burft out then, Valeria and l^ato fuch a laughter, as he could
no loneer doubt but that we had heard him widiout inchantment. And where -
iis there wasa back-door that opened out of their room upon the ftaires , he
rofe in haft, and got him away , fo that wc never heard of him after. The
reft cf the night was fpent in fleeping, but the next day I had employment
eiioi+gh ; for I was fcarcely out of bed , when as 1 received a Note from
Aurelta, whereby ffie prayed me that ffie might fpeak but one Word with me at the
Garden door, where I hadformerly been, out of which ffie would come forth, and
feem as though ffie had met nic by chance. I raade fome difficulty of going to her »
but at length Valeria conftrained me thereunto. As foon as I came at her, being ftili
pale,and amazed with her laft nights adventurc,ffie faid unto me,that having been ad¬
vertifed fince morning, how Hortenflo was effcftively at Genoua, and had never been
abfent from thence, ffie found that ffie had great caufe to complain of me, for that

</p>
<p>this reafon is fo forcible, as I cannot deftroy it; but fince it is true, that nothing
can refift you, do rae the favour that Hortenflo, who as I have been told, lyes fecretly
at Leanders houfe, that he raay go a nights to fee a mayd whom he loves, may no
longer love her; or if it be poffible, thathe may dcfpile and hatcher. Thispropofi¬
tion began to put me into fuch choller againft Aftrology, that little lacked but that
I had left Aurelia without an anfwer ; howbeit my wit ferved rae yet this once again
dextroufly enough : For I affured her ffic was il! informed of the matter, and that
Hortenfio dad not lye concealed for any new love, but that being grown kalous of
her, he had feigned a voyage to Naples, the more cxaftly to obferve her aftions; and
that without doubt file was beloved of//'i9rf&lt;r«/(S', asmuch as ever ffie had been. This
poor Gentlewoman was fo fatisfied with thatwhich I told her, as ffie verily belee¬
ved it; and fo I left herewith a great deal of joy. As I was returning home I was
mightily furprifed, to fee how the people began to note mc, and point at me; fome
faying, that I was a learned man ; others, that I was half a Prophet; thefeVame
that I was an Inchanter; thofe, that I wasa Sorcerer. There were fome too than
not far frora the truth, took me for an impoftor, and fcoffed at me ; at leaftwife I
interpreted their looks and their aftions fo. I went then in a rage to'find out Vale¬
rie, whom I met withall fome three or four fteps from my lodging. I did not re¬
count unto him what had hapned to me, but I quarrelled with him for that he was
the caufe ofall the confulfon Iwas in. He, that was ready to burft with lauehter.
asked me whether I had not given hira order to publiffi ray kicnce &gt; Yes fayd I un¬
to him, but not to make nic pafs for a Magician. You know, fayd he unSo me, ftill
laughing, tkit Fame atignients every thing ; and then what is it you complain of &gt;
all the world is fatisficd with your skill, andthat which ffiould more content you.
you are revenged both o your Rivall and of your Miftrefs, by giving them fo much

to come to us; I would have declined his encounter by entring into my lodging,
but r.r/.r/. told me thathe had promifed him raya cquaintancc,and that he was too
near then for me to avoyd it. fodeed he was fo near as I could not anfwer Valerio fo

<p>Hortenflo, but accept of his fervice. 1 was fo confounded with all thefe adventure^:
aslfcarceknew which way to turnme; howbeit fccmingtoconfiderof all thathe'
had told me, at length I affured him, that if he continued loving and ferving he
he ffiould be beloved of her, provided he acquainted her with his paffion.   He went
away very well fatisficd, and Valeria demanded of me, how I hoped to keep niv
word?I anfwered him,that at lafi Aurelia would be weary of Hortenfloes defpifing her-
that Leander by continuing to fcrve her would touch her heart, and fo would think
thatheobtainedthatby the power of my art, which was due to his own induftry.
But, fayd I untohim, no\y that we have a little reft. Ictus so into our lodt^in/*
howbeit we were fcarcely in the middle ofthe Hall, when turning my headab'out 1
perceived Leonardo the father of Ltvia, comming to me with an open countenance
vvhich made me conceive that he had fomething to demand ofme.    I received him
with a forced civility,which might have made him know,if hehad heeded it,th at the
light of him had put me to a non-p'us. And to give him yet more liberty to perfe¬
cute mc, Fii/fm, who took great pleafure in all thefe things, made ffiew of taking
his leave of mc, and went and ftayed for me in my chamber.   Then began Leomrdo
to tell nie in a ferious manner, which vexed rae exceedingly, how he was a(h.inied
that his firff vifit was to requeft a favour frora nie, rather than to let nieknow that
he was in love with the reputation which I had gotten in fo ffiort a time; but in fine,
that he niight oblige me by his freedom to ufe the fame to him, he befought me that
1 would caft a Figure to difcover who it was that had got an Emerauld Ring which
was loft QUtof his houfe.   I rauft confefs, that I found my felf then info ftrange
a cafe, as if by wiffiing 1 could have become a Magician indeed, to get out of this
crofs adventure, I verily think that I ffiould have wiffied it.    What ffiall I do, fayd I
to my felf ? What counfell am I totake? And what can I anfvver tofo predinga
difcourfe ? It concerns not now the beguiling of an amorous mayd, or an ignorant
Lover; it is an old man that fayes hc knows Aftrology, that will difcover my igno¬
rance as foon as I ffiall fpeak ;   For to tell hira a lye about this Ring, it vvfllde-
ftroy it felf :  It vvere better for me to deal freely vvith him ; he will be obliged to
me for undeceiving him ; and then all things well confidered,  I had rather fpoil all
ray defigii.s than put a trick upon a raan of this age. After I had determined to doe
fo,   I took   a more ferious look upon me for to tell hira, how it was true, that
heretofore I had underftood forae principles of Aftrology (for I could not refolve to
confefs my felf to be direftly an impoftor ) how upon that ground my friends had
given me the reputation of knowing fomewhat ; but that none ofthcra had ever
any experience of it; how it was true alfo, that I had many times delivered my (elf
to be more knowing than I was, in fome occafions jwherc feigning was rather a gal¬
lantry than a crime; but as for hira, I defired it (hould appear, that the reputation
which Ihad gained was not fodear unto rae, as his friendlhip ,  feeing I con¬
feffed ingenioufly unto him, that I did not know enough either in Aftrology, of in
the other fciences depending thereupon, for to be able to tell him that whichhe
defired of me.    This difcourfe fb clear and true had nor the effeft I expefted from
it; for very far from being believed, Iheard Leonardo fay unto rae fouling, HadI
not known by the report of others, that you are a learned man, your humility
would fufficc'to perfwadenie that you knowniuch. Ifwcar unto you,fayd Ilaugh-
ing ( for I could not poflibly forbear ) that I know nothing. Even this which you
fay, anfvvcred he, is that which confirms me in ray belief of you ; and thus niodeft
and djkrc t&gt;continucd he, ought they-to be who know much ;  for their fcience
makes ihem to be known well enough, without any intermixture oftheir vanity-
If I were what you think me to be,fayd I interrupting him, I would acknowledge
it to you; but it is certain that I do not merit the honour youdonie. Ihavealrea-
dy told you, anivvered he, that this humility is the greateft fciencc of afl; it b^"

as though he had loft a letter, ;^hich a brother of his had written him from Nap/esi
that after he was gone, Livik feeraing very fad,  and her father having demanded
ofher what ffie ayled, ffie had told hira, that the ring , whicl] (he had given to Hor¬
tenfio was loft to the end he ffiould not marvell ifhe fa\v it no longer.This dicourfe
niade'rac wonderfull glad; I took the paper from la Roche the better to diffemble the
raatter, .tnd uling a great deal of civility to i eanardo,   I delired him to cxcufe the
libei tv which 1 had taken. He anfwered mc, that with him J was juftified ,   provi¬
ded I would not refufe him. I conkfs that the occafion of gulling him Was fo fair^ as
I ffiould have had much adoe too forbear; and Leonardo too had fuch a mind to be fo,
ashewouldhave beendifobliged more in not being gulled ,  than in being gtflled;
befides, it was in vain for rae to tell him the trifth again, which he would not un¬
derftand, do wh.it I could. He began again to prefs me; I refilled yet a while; but at
laft, when 1 faw that hc would needes have me devine,! fpake to him with more cer-
taincy than an Aftrologer, and more clearly thin aOr-acle, if he would have under-
iloc d me rightly.  After I had made a turn in the room vvithout fpeaking a wordj
I ni.ide a ftop juft before him, and faid unto him; hitherto I have done what I could
todilkniblc the little knowledge I have,   that I might not do any thing which
■would clifpleafc you; but fince you will needes know it, I will confefs freely unto
you ,   that i have already caff a figure for it upon the intrcaty ofa kinfwoman of
Liviaes;   fo that difguifing th^ truth no longer, I ara obliged to tell you, thata
man, whom ytiu faw this morning in a riding fuit,   is he which hath the ring you
fpeak of Who w^uld ever have believed it, faid Leonardo, that a raan of his faffiion
and qualitic, had been capable of fo ftrange an  aftion^   But young people that
have covetous fathers, are many times carried to ill habits by neceflity;-howfoever
1 miifl knd ou^this ring, and ifit be poffible demand it of him thathath taken it a-
Way Without charging him that he ftole it. After this difcourfe he gave me thanks,
and raade rae promife to come to fupper tohim. An hower after he was gone,
came an old fellow, who had ferved Leonardo about thirty yeares,   prefented to mc
by la Roche, that told mcwith a fimplicity which made meto laugh, how being re¬¬
folved to return into his Colmtry,  and carry With him the little money which hc
had gotten, he befought me that I would caufe him and his treafure to be tranfpor¬

faid my Agent then, Without ray Mafters medling in it;  and when I hadconfirmed
him in this opiidon, away they went together.   But whilft r^/mo laughed atmv

<p>refembled that ofa thief, as he was fomewhat affraid to fpeak to him. Hortenfio an¬
fwered thereunto, that hc would think himfelf happy,  ifit were to command hini
any thing. How curtcous he is? ( thousfit Leonardo yyith himfelfas he delivered to
mc afterward } and what a pitty it is, that fo handfom a man ffiould havefo bad
an inclination? Then taking courage, belaid untohim ,  that having underftood
there was a ring in his hands, vvhich had been loft out of his houfe, hc defired he
might fee it. And wh ereas Hortenflo was furprifed vvith this difcourfe, he feenied
to be fb confounded, as Leonardo no longer doubted but that he was guilty. 0 nie!
cryed Hortenflo, what is this I hear ? I do not fay, replyed Leonardo,   that you are
faulty, but the party from whom you had it. How unhappy am I,   faid Hortenfi
interrupting him ? Afflift not your felf, replyed Leonardo, forthe hand which &lt;iavc
ityoUjliath alone committed this fault, andfo you are juftified with me,   Whilft
I cofi.ir do did what he could to conceal from fiini the bad opinion hehad ofhim
he was perfwaded, that this man knew the truth ofthe matter; andto juftitie Li-
z-i.i as much as poffibly he could, he affured him that he alone was culpable; that
healoiK had deceived him ; that he denyed notbut that this ring was in hishandj-
and therefore he acknowledged he had juft caufe to complain ofhim,    Thisis
ffrangc, faid Leonardo to hiraielf-, that the more I would cxcufe him , the more he
accufes himfelf !  I fay it to you again , continued the other, that I alone am wor¬
thy of puniihment. No Hartenflo,fayd Leonardo, you (hall not perfwade me to it; fur
I am well informed ofthe truth ofthe bufinefs. VVhy then it is b:ft forme, anfwered
Hortenflo, not to make any further denial!,  but in reftoring you the ring to con¬
fefs ingenuoufly that I was conftrained by an inevitable neccffity,   to do you this
wrong. I know well enough, rc'plyed\Leo;iard.-'. what youth is capable of, and what
neccffity will make  one doc. Hortenfio,   feeing Leonardo fpeak fb gently unto him,
and believing,fo ill did they undcrftand one another , that he knew all which had
paft between L«i'/^ and hira, believed alio that he was to make his profit ofthis oc¬
cafion, and to (peak plainly unto him. Since you know, faid he to hira,how to ex-
cufe my errors,    will  you bc pleafed to render them legitimate ,  in giving
me   leave to marry Livia'i   you know ray birth, and you raay know my eftate
when you pleafe. Marry my daughter J cryed Leonardo, this propofition isfo plea¬
fant, as ou.^ converfation (hall end there , for I do not think that yon have reafon to
continue it any longer, after I have affured you neverthelefs that I ffiafl be difcreet.
Saying fo, the old man went a\ray,and left Hortenflo more amazed, than ever he was
in hislife,forheno way apprehended that Leonardowould accufehim of thcft;andto
perplex him yet further, J?«rf//.j appeared , vvho believing, according as I had told
her, that/forff^j/o had not concealed himfelf but becaufe he was   jealous, vvould
#« pajfant have laid (brae raanner of gallanterie untohim. But he, vvho was not in a
cafe to diffemblc,   and that faw well enough hovv his lovc to L/w^ was upon
breaking   forth ,    faid   unto her fomewhat    rudely ;  you drove  me  zway
at fuch time as by your direftion I came to wait upon you,  think it not ftrangc
then if after that I never do fee you more; and to recompence the lovc vvhich
you have borne me with fbmefrccnefs, know, that 1 am ingaged in an affeftion,

were to do in fo crofs an adventure. In the mean time, Aurelia fo rcolycd upon my

ijivcn him, and that he had ufed all his endeavour to draw thccrime wholly upon
him(elf;for as foon as Lucretia perceived Leo&gt;iardo,(he advertifed them of it; where¬
upon Hortenflo was conftrained to hide himfelf in a corner of the Garden where
they were, it being impollible for him to i:et forth without being feen. When (up¬
per time approached, I went thither; fori was not lorry to feck foraii occafiou
of feeing in what cafe Ltvia was in af cr fo many odd adventures; as I was going

ment for the nun who was afraid of robbing by the way ; that after a thoufand
devices, he had madehim get a ff ride upon a pale, as it were upon an horfe ; and
there having bound up  his eyes, and tyed both his hands and his feet, he left him
talking themaddelf things inthe world,outofa conceit hehad that he was flying in
the air,and that to keep him from being robbed by the way,hc bad taken his money
from him without his perceiving it.    I rebuked him for his foolery, and having
commanded him to follow me, I entered intoLeonardoes houfe, juft as hc was go¬
ing to accoft his daughter, who feeing me, would have pulled down her Vail over
her face, but he not permitting her fo to do,told her, that a man, to whom ffie was
ingaged for therecovery of a Ring which was fodear unto her, well dcferved to
have the pleafure of beholding her. We were both of us then very much abaffied,
for I knew nothing of that which had p.ift betwixt him and Hortenpo ; and ffie feared
that her father would give her fome cruel check or other.    Howbeit I was not fa
taken up, but that I heard, in regard I was advertifed of it before,  hovv the poor

eafie to imagine that, he was but in an ill taking ;  and touching my felf [^1'
middeft of theamazenienc wherein Iwas, I felt fome joy inhcpingto (eeanend

her by the hand, Wliar, faid he unto her, a man hid about my houfe ! wemuftfeej;
every where, fori will not have this fofpition reft with any body; come, ^;;r.''/;,),

Leonardo commanded all the doors to be ffiut, and leading Aurelta, and caufing L/:«
vvith all the reft of the company to follow, he began firft to fearch in the Gardea
We had not gone four fteps, but they perceived this man tycd on the pale, who raade
a great coil as it were to go the fafter.   Thelight of him arrefting all the troup,
Leonardo asked whether this was his daughters Lover ; ^welialookcd onZ/Wwiff;
L/17.J began to take a little   heart, hoping they would fearch no further, and fu
Hortenflo would not be found.    But going formoft, I untyedthepoorfot, andfaid
to L(fo«4ri5io, that this was without doubt the knavery of ray fcrvaiit,who was will-
ing to raake ("port vvith the fimplicity of this man.    Hc was no fooner untyed^ but
following his imagination, Behold, fayd he, how at length I am come into ray
Country ; it is fit I ffiould kils the earth where hrft I drew my breath. And when a;
Leonardo dcm:indcd ot him, what it was that he did. A1 afs ! Mafter, fayd he, are you
alfo come into my Country, withall this goodly company ? La Roc hi approaching
fayd to him foftly, you have not done all that I enjoyncd yon, for do not you per¬
ceive that you are ftillat Genoua   The poor wretch grew then foaftonHhed aste
could not anfvver a word.   In the mean time -^«rf///j having told Leonardo, t\[t
this was not he ffie fbught for, we continued going on.  And when Leonardo\\i^
demanded whether there were nothing behind ajafmin hedge vvhich was rightbe-
fore us;Horten/io, vvho faw thathe ftiould be difcovered, becaufe thcArborwhere
he was hidden was hard by it, refolved to ffiew hirafelf^ rather than tobe takra
vvith the manner.    He went forth then boldly, and fpeaking to Leonardo ; Seek no
furthcr,fayd heunto hiin,l am he alone who is hidden here,and that wifl notoppoft
the revenge which you will take of me for it.This is not amifs, fayd Leonardo tome,
I feek for my daughters Lover, and I find a Thief.    You  think peradventure,fayil
he unto hira, to fteal another Ring from mc, but 1 will keep you well enough from
it; and in the confideration of your Father, who is a man of honour, I will onely
fee ure my felf of your perfon.    Aurelta thought Leonardo was wild, in taking tia-
tenflo for a thief; Leander and Livia beleeved the fame thing; Hortenfio himfelfkncS
not what hc meant by it; and I alone was he that could clear this Enigma.   And»!
Iwas preparing to ("peak, Hortenflofaid to Leonardo, that he had loved his daUEh-
ter two years ; that he had had the Ring from her; that he was no thief; and that
he might know of her whether hc told the truth or no.   Aurelia-would hayci^o-
ken, but choler would not fuffer her ; Livia indeed had love enough to have ton-
firmed thatwhich Hortenfio fayd, but ffie was retained by ffiame, howbeit ffie iinj
fain to furmount it, when her Father asked ofher, whither that which he hcird
was true? for flie anfwered, how hoping that this mariage would notdilpU'ilf
him, it was true that flie had given him that Ring for the firft obligation thereof.
Leonardo had no fooner received his daughters anfwer, but taking nie afidene
confulted with me about what he ought to do in this encounter; for he did "^'^''

me that! was beloved of Hortenfio, whereas I no fooner encountred him, but I fee
hira maryed to another, whkh (hews that your Aftrology is falfe. As for me, faid
Leander, you perfwaded methat Aurelia did not love Hortenflo, in the mean time
the proof ffie hath rendred of the contrary, teftifyes the untruth of your books. And
for my part, fayd the Traveller, hc promifed to fend rae into ray country wirli ut
any danger of robbing, and lo I ara ftill at Genoua.    All this was fpoken to rae fo
precipitoufly as I was Vurprikd with it ; neverthelefs being fully refolved to con¬
tinue no longer an Aftrologer, I made ufe ofthis occaffon; for caufing Lucretia to
approach, that (he might witnefs thatwhich I meant to fay, I befought Leonardo to
pardon mc for that I was going to confefs unto hira, feeing ray gullcrie had had fb
happy an end for hira; and that hc would call to raind how it was not long of me,
that he did not believe rae to bc no Aftrologer.   I recounted unto them my love to
Ltvia; in what manner I knew her fecret, and confequently all that I have told you.
And after I had obtained Lncretiaes pardon as well as mine own, I made it appear
that I had fatisfied thera without Aftrology : For, fayd I to Leonardo, you asked rae
for your Ring, and I have made you to find it ; to Livia, Ihave told you the raoft
concealed particnlais of your adventure ; to Lf&lt;«»^«', I raade you hope for the pof¬
feffion of Aurelia, vvhich (hc proraifes to you her felf; to Aurelia, I have undeceived
you frora Hortenflo,and made you acknowledge the fidelity of Leander; to the travel¬
ler, I promifed you that you fliould not bc robbed by the way, and I have kept my
word with you ; for I am fure  you are not in cafe fo to be,   la Roche havfog pro¬
vided for that by taking away your raony, which I coraraand him to reftore unco
you prefently; fothat you fee I have not failed in my promife to every one: for
touching my felf, fiiyd I laughing, you perceive I am he alone for whora I have
done nothing; fb that to recorapcnce nic in fome fort for fo many unprofitable pains,
savant me Valertoes pardon, vvhich efpecially I demand of Leander, as of the moft
offended, but withall the raoft obliged to his friends gullery, fince without him hc
durft never have thought of the happinefs which he poffeffcth.   In conclufion, faid
I to them Ifill laughing, whereas you know that I am a dangerous enemy, I counfell
you, as perfons whom I efteem, to receive rae for your friend. They burft out then
into fo great a laughter, as they thought they ffiould never have been quiet again
to hear the compkiiient, which Leonardo made me,who affured me that the pleafore
I had given hira by my relation, wasfo great, as hc ffiould alwaks remember it,
as an iraportant fervice which Ihad rendred him, and thathe would not for any
thing but that this gullery had been, it was fo diverting : Ltviatold me next, that
ffie was ofher fathers mind, and though ffie had denyed me her love,yet did ffie pro-

unto me tor drawing hira out of prifon, as hc could not chuk but fwear an invio¬

cuted as i had mentioned it;  in the mean time Livia and Aurelta, having talked a
pretty while together alone, called Hortenflo and Leander to them, and fuchthinf"!
paffed between them, as they found themfelves all four extremely contented. CimI}'
and f^j/fr/o being come, anda fair conclufion made on all fides, thewhole compa¬
ny fupped with Leonardo, though none but I was invited. Howbeit thac I may not
Madam, further extend a relation, which is already but too long, I fliafl tell you'
that within a while after I was bidden to their wedding, whither I came with more
lovc than all thefefour together had ; fori had enough for every woman of the af¬
fembly.    But at length,night being come, I left them maryed and contented; 1 fjy
contented, becaufe I ara not an  Hiftorian but forthe firft day of theirNuptialj
which orciinarily is full of joy and gladnefs. Neverthelefs that which troubled iiie
afterwards was, how not able to keep thj nutter from being   divulged, the
fame people who had pointed at me before as at a Magician, looked upon me then
as on an impoftor, and jeered mc in foch fort as I durft not peep out of doors. Eiic
it is alfo true, that the fame adventure was the caufe of a greater good unto me;
forby the Count of Lauagnes curiofity I got the honour of his acquaintance and
friendffiip, which hath likewife produced yours too, Madara, and hath alfo given
me the nobleft paffion that ever I had in ray life. I muft confefs, fayd thePrincels,
that you are incomparable, and chat in regard of what I have heard, there is non:
but will fay how you are a dangerous enemy, and a pleafing friend.    Ah, Madam,
fayd the Marquis, do not ruin me with zAmilia ! no, no, fayd this mayd, for I pro¬
mife you not to judge of you but by your felf^ who, as I bekeve, will perfwadenie
that, which her Excellency fpeaks of,  better than ffie can , as eloquent as (he is. I
would fain know, fayd Dona, fpeaking to theMarquis, whether they from whom
you take your love, may pretend ftill to your friendftiip.    Yes, anfwered hc, pro¬
vided they have been favourable tome; for as for the reft, they arefo indifferent
unto mc, as it would bemorc advantageousfor them, that I ffiould hate them. This
is a pretty difcourfe indeed, fayd Jufliniano,fince that by this reafon,thc fair ty£milii
ought not to be cruell unto you, to the end ffie may by receiving your lovc favour¬
ably pretend one day to your friendffiip, I confefs, faid the Count, that the Marquis
his opinion teaches me a new tenet, which I did not belecve could be poffible; I have
always heard it fayd, that friendffiip is many times a way to love, but that lov;
ftould bc the way to friendffiip, is a thing whichhath but few examples, and no
reafon at all. This difpute would be a little too long, fayd the Princefs, b5tn forthe
time and the place, and I think it were fitter forus to return unto i^/'^-zco before
the ending ofthe day, which will not permit us to walk; but this agreeable dif¬
courfe hath given us fb much fatisfaftion, as we have no reafon to regret it.   TIk
whole company then arofe;thc Count led Ifabella;the Marquis&lt;i/£milia;Jufliniano and
Doria went together; and the Princeffes women, together with other of her fervants,
followed after without order.   All this fair troop went aboord ofthe Galley whicli
brought them thither, whereofthe Princefs never made ufe, but when ffic went to this
place.   The reft ofthe evening was wholly imployed in talking of theMarquis his
adventures, each one repeating in particular that which had feemcd moft pkafant
to them thciein.    Ijabella likewife caufed her kinfwoman, who had an excellent
voyce, to fing; the Marquis plaid on the Lute, and fung alfo with the beautiful i/f-

' Count to return unto Genoua, not daring to ftay longer ma
place whither hc had been fent. Hc took his leave then of the
Princefs , who defired hira toaffure the Senate ofher acknow¬
ledgement, and that ere long ffie would be at Genoua her fclf to
rei/der thera thanks in particular for the honor they had done
her; The Marquis alfo kiffed her robe ; ffie careffed him very
much, and prayed him to remember, that hc left a Miftrefs at
^Monaco, ffiewing him Emilia. The Marquis anfwcrcd laughing, that hc ffiould not
fail therein, and to the end ffie might not doubt ofit, hc would take the libertic
to write unto her. 1 ffiall be glad of that, faid the Princefs, and will enjoyn c/£-
?»/7/Vi to receive your letters. In the mean time Der/Vi, who was in lovc vvith the
Counts fifter-in-law, named Sophronia, began to be in forae unquietnefs for that he
did not return unto Geuoua; yyhich being obferved by Jufliniano, he conjured him
to abide no longer at Monaco, and to go along vvith the Count. Doria withftood it
a while, but at fengih hc fuffred himfelfto be perfwaded to that vvhich he defired,
TheMarquis wasfo dextrous, as he took the opportunity, whilft the reft were
conipknicnting with the Princefs, to approch unto tAmilia, for toaffurehcra
little more ferioufly than hc had ufed to do, that he had fuch thoughts for her , as
he had never before but onely for two or three cf all that great multitude ofvvo-
mcn vvhich hehad loved inhis time ; it is likely he vvould have faid more unto
her, had net the Count gone away. They departed out ofthe Princeffes chamber-j,
accompanied by y«/?«ww3 who condufted them to the Port, where they imbra¬
cedonc another with a great deal of kindnefs, and alfo renewed their friendffiip
with new prcttflations. Having weighed anchor, upon the Counts Signall given,
the flaves fell to rowing, and in an inftant thegally was carried far from the ffioar,
and frcm Juflixiano, vvho in returning to the Caftle beganto fear, thatthe Princefs
would prcls him to declare the end of hisHiftory, and likewife toconfider vvith
aftoniffiment the deplorable eftate hewasin; but going infenfibly along towards
the Princefs, he found himfelf in her chamber, before he was aware thathe was
come thither. This fad thought had already painted fuch a melancholy in his face,
as Ijabella perceived it as foon as he entred, and for wich ffic quarrelled vvith him,
laying that it proceeded frcm the abfence ofhis friends. Juflmiano, furprifed vvith
this dikourfe, laboured to recolleft hi niklf, and told her, he had been fo accuftom.

that ftie retained one of your Rivalis in her fervice,  ^/£mtlia, perceiving that this

make it ceak, continued cjLmilia, but prepare your felf to undcrftand the moft fan-
talfick adventure, and the ftrangcft incounter,   that ever you heard off: You are to
know then, faid ffie going on, howthat great reputation of beauty which the Prin¬¬
cefs had all over/t&lt;«/y,bep;ot a curiofity at one and the fame time m the mindes of the
younz^Vxinceoi Salern(y,andDonT emando de lAendoz^a,   who for a long time had
been in the War of Milan under the Marquis of Guafl; and albeit they knew not
one another ; thoup'i the one was of Italy, and the other of Spain; though the firft
was at Naples, aiir', the other at Milan; yet took they both of them the fame refolu¬
tion. The Princ&lt;! of Salerno was handfom , of a good mine,   and full of fpirit; and
whereas in ftudying the Mathematicks, he had learned to defign, hc had afterwards
applyed hi^iifclf to painting, and was become fo excellent in that art, as few Mafter*
in Italy had done braver things than hc.   This young Prince being refolved to fee
whether fame did not flatter the Princefs , and knowing by the example of others,
th« it would be no boot for him to prefent hirafelf at jifo^^iro with an equipage
proportionable to his condition, he concluded to go thither difguifed ;  and that
he might the cafilier find out the raeanes to approch unto the Princefs,he purpofed t&lt;#
fay that he was a Painter. Don Fernando de Mendei&amp;d, as I have already declared, ha¬
ving a like defire,  and a like curiofity, ufed alfo the fame meanes to content it:
For as the Prince of Salerno Would pafs for a Pairtt'cr, fo Would Don FerfiofiAo, wh^
underftood mufick perfeftly,   pafs for a Mufician. They difguifed thtmfolve^ then
after the manncrtheyhad refolved On, andwithotit knowing ought of oweano^
thcr, they came to Monaco at the time which 1 have noted; and when as the. hope of
feeing you again, and the Princeffes compliance for me, had rendred her mekncho"-
ly more fociable. The firft that arrived at Monaco was Don F^YMndo,   wkb retained
this name onely, leaving that of Mendoz^a, as too illuftrious for hirtiA^oiii hc pre¬
tended to bc. And whereas the Princefs had ordained a long timt before,  that no
ftrangcr ffiould enter into the Town, without firft advertifing her ofit, they came
prekntly and told her, that a man, which gave himfelf out to be a Mufidanj defired
to enter. At firft ffie thought not to have feen hira, but as forme, Who had ho other

<p>ter, tothe end wc might fee whether he were skillfull enough to keenn   f
forgetting that which I had alre.vdy learned in Mufick; and to oblige her n TrT
nyme, I caufed her to remember the paffion which ffie had told me you^d^
had for this excellent art; and it was without doubt that in this fort the fole ^^^'^
lidcration of you introduced Don Fernando into the Caftle ,   although the PrinT
had the goodnefs to tell me, that ffic fliould be very glad there could any thine b
met withall, which could keep me from being weary of Monaco. But in theed
Don Fernando appeared, and albeit both the Princefs and my fclf found fomethin'
that was great in his countenance, yet fufpefted we nothing of the truth, attnbn^
ting that foftv ayr to the Nation, whereof he faid he was; for he did not conceal
himfelf from being a Spaniard, in regard, though he fpake Italian  well enough
he would yet have been known by his pronunciation.    The Princefs demanded of
him, of whence he was, whether he was going, what he could doe ; and to all thole
particulars he anfwered exaftly. As for^his fcience, he defired the Princefs that ft-
would be the judge of it,   and hear him fing. She would fain have referred herfelf
to mc, but giving her no leifure to command rae unct) it, I fent foraVioflanda

held the Princefs with a great deal of attention ,   and alfo how hc bluffied two or
three times. But whereas the greateft beauties ftrike everyone with admiration 1
took his bluffiing for a mark ofhis refpeft, and his attention for an ordinary elfeft
of Ifabellaes beauty. When that was brought which I had fent for, he took a Lute
and truly touched it reafonably well; but when he had plaid on it, and that toim
he had taken a Violl in his hand, he perfwaded us yet better by his play, that he was
A Spaniard,than he had done by his pronunciation,lt being raoft certain that it is im¬
pollible to play better:   Hc fung alfb with a very good grace, and with much art;
As for me, I confefs unto you that I was raviffied vvith rr.    And whereas the Prin¬
cefs perceived the fatisfaftion that 1 received by it,   and was refolved to pleafe mc
as much as ffic could, ffie demanded of Don Fernando, whether he would abide with
her for fome time to be my Mafter ?  He very well contetJted vvith this propofition,
told her, that ffie did hira too ranch honor, and though his purpofe was not toraake
any ftay at Monaco, yet ffiould he efteem hirafelf infinitely happy,   if hc could bea-
ble to render her any fervice. Thus fee you Don Fernando lodged in the Caftle, and
in the rank of the Princeffes domcfticall fervants, but more yet, of that of her le¬
vers. For as we know afterwards, hc became fo defpcratcly in love with her, ashc
refolved to do all that he might for to gain her to himfelf, by any way whatfoever.
Certain dayes after, the Prince of Salerno, vvho gave hirafelf the name ofLucilio, ar¬
rived alfo at Monaco,  and according to order it was told the Princefs, hovv there
was a young Painter, vvho faid, be came from Rome, that defired to ffiew hcrfome
fmall pieces ofhis own drawing.   She who, as I have already declared, fought to
delight me, commanded him to be brought to her ;   Don Fernando was at that time
in the Princeffes chamber,  vvhom I had caufed to corac thitherto hear a Spanifc
ayr, vvhich had extremely plcdfed me. The Prince of Salerno being come tothe
Caftle, entred into the room, where we were ,  with a profound refpeft , wd

how (helcvcd you ftill, and that although the greateft part of the Worid bdieved

would bcthe means of ruining all their defigns, and depriving  them of her|fight
for ever.    Wherefore they i-elblvcd to continue with her as long as they could;
carefully to obferve her difpofition ; to pleafe her as much as polfibly they could ;
and to work according to occafion. ■   For afterwards we underffood both all their

Howfi ever he made choice of the firft, and indeed was one ofthe beft Mafters in the

I think hepiitall the difguifements of Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury, and of all theo-

cefs cnoligh to content the extreme paffion wherein he was for her, had intreated the
Painter in private to draw her pifture for him , and kt no body know of it.   The
manner of Don Fernandoes raaking this   propofition begot fome fofpition in the
Prince of Salerno; and the manner alfo of his excufing himfelf from embracingit
made Doal'ernando obferve him with the more care;fo that paffing over again in tiieir
memory how they had lived together before, they found wherewith to augment
their f iifpitions, but not wherewith to doubt of that vvhich they thought. Afterthis
they never lived wel together;thcy traduced one anothers profeffion;the Painter faid
that he had heard better finging at Rome ; and the other affirmed that all the defigns
ofthe Prince of Salernoes Piftures were flolnfrom antient Painters.One dayasthey
were inthe Princeffes chamber, they entred into a difpute before her, andby diat
liberty forgot the perfonage which they reprefented ; yet was not ffie offended atit,
but contrarily took pleafure inhearing them.   ThePainter would have his Artcar-
ry it from Mufick; he fayd thatit was the imitator of Nature; he vaunted thathe
could beguile the eyes, and deceive reafon by theillufionsof perfpeftive; hefayi
moreover, that it was Painting which made men live after their death; that it was
ffie which erefted Trophcis for the viftorious; that by her we fee battels which w
had not feen; that by her we know Alexander and all the Heroes of Antiquity ;thit
by her we make voyages without ftirring out of our Cabinets; that by her V7efe:
our friends though they be abfent; that ffic was a vifiblc Hiffory,   a mute Poefie;
and to fay all, that ffi^was fo excellent, as a good Painter miglit almoft boaft hira¬
felf to be the creator ofthe things which hc reprefents.    The Mufician, who would
not give place to the Painter, maintained, that there was thefame difference be¬
tween Painting and Mufick, as betw een the body and the foul ; that this firft was
wholly materiall andgrofs incomparilbn of the other, which wasakogetherfpi-
rituall; that   if Painting erefted Trophcis tothe viftorious, Mufick fung dieir
viftoryes; that the one touched nought but the eys, whereas the other, afl celclli-
all and divine, wrought upon the very foul vvith fomuch power, as ffieexdted
or appeafed the paffions as fhe pleafed ; and by this fweet tyranny rendred her fclf
abfolute miftris of all reafonable perfons. Hcfayd farther, that to judge rightly of
the advantage which ffiehad over Painting, we were but to confider, tliat the beft
illufions ffie can make, do alwaies work a greater effeft upon the rude vulgarthan
on Worthy people; that indeed ffie raight ffrike thefe vvith admiration, but ncvct
utterly deceive them, fo that ffie operates raore powerfully upon the ignorant than
on the able.    He added, that it was notfo vvith Mufick, which did not predomi¬
nate ablblutely but over reafonable perfon : that to have wit is not enough forusto
become her fubicfts, and bc charmed by her; but we rauft alfo have, not only fou"!
knowledge of this Art, but likewife a great and noble foul; fothat quite contra¬
ry to Painting, the more able   we are, the more we fuffer our felves to be vanquilh'
ed by her charms: That the other was but a deceiver, vvhich pays us vvith nothing
but apparcnces, and fb impotent, that ffic can do nothing of her felf, or to fay bet¬

men fecmed too trankendent to me for perfons oftheir profeifion, and I began to
look on the Princefs in a raanner, whkh teftifyed unto her how ranch I was amazed
thereat, when as DonFernando, perceiving it,  took prekntly upon him the humor,
vvhich is ordinarily attributed toMuficians; and witha caprichioufoefs,whercin no
feigning appcarcd,he gave an hundred geeringquipps tothe Princeot5^/^r«^, who
played his part as well as the other; fothat returning out ofthe amazement which 1
had been in, I reflefted no further upon it, but heard the reft oftheir difpute with
great delight; for they raade fb pleafant a Satyre againft each others profeffion, as
the Princefs herklf, fpight of her raelancoholy, could not forbear  laughing.
Howbeit ffic would have them become friends before they departed; and having de¬
manded of them why they bore fuch a fplecn one to an other ,   for ffic had been ad-
vertiicd of it, they were much troubled how to anfwer her.    DonFernando,  being
ever the bolder, fpake firft in this incounter, and told her, that on his pare ffie was
the true caufe ofit. ThePainter, exceedingly furprifed with this difcourfe, knew
not what to think thereof; when as Don Fernando profecuting it ,   gave them to un¬
derftand, how that which made hira fo avcrfe unto hira ,   was the thought he had,
that when he ffiould be ^oni from Manaco, the Princefs could not chufe but remem¬
ber him, becaufe ffie ffiould alwaies fee his Piftures,   whereas if it were his ill for¬
tune to depart from thence, ffic would prefently forget him, nothing remaining of
him that might make him be remcrabred of her.   If this jcaloufie did not fficw as
much malice as affeftion, replyed the Painter, 1 (hould fear the Princefs might take
it well at your hands,  but as 1 believe her to be very equitable, fo I think ffie will
find the coldnefs which is betwixt us better grounded, when as I ffiall tell her, thac
our diflenfion proceeds from our not knowing one anodier. Or it may be, faid Don
Fernando interrupting hira, frora our knowing one another too weil. Never a whit
replyed the Painter, for you are as unskilfull in painting, as I am in mufick, and fo
wc are but bad judges of each other; and it is the Princefs alone, which will one day
put a difference between us, when as ffic ffiall know me b.ttei: and that the defignes
which I am about (hall bc wholly finiffied.   The Princefs, who thought he fpake of
thcddignes ofhis Piftures, told hira, that ffieknew hira enough already to admire
all that he did. And whereas Don Fernando would have replyed,   ffie forbad him,
and commanded them both to live better together afterwards, than they had done.
They anfwered, that they would obey her as much as they could, and fo retyrccl
with a great deal of unquietnefs. The Prince of Salerno found Don Fernando too har¬
dy for a MuUcian, and found alfo, that ail his fongs were too paffionate,   too amo¬
rous, and fuiting too much with the Princefs, for to bc fung without defign. In fine
bethought, that ashc was capable of difguifing himfelf like a Painter , fb might a-
nodierbe of difguifing himfelf like a Muikian. Neverthelefs this likely fofpidon
continued not long with him; and confidering how much raen ofthis profeffion arc
careffed by great perfons, he no longer racrvaiied at his boldnefs;   hefound like¬
wiie that his obfervations upon his fongs vvere ridiculous ; for, faid he, as we un¬

<p>heW many times as his Rivall, paint foexcellently ; for he coBld not imaffinc tH
a man of quality could underftand this Art fo perfeftly. Thefe divers thoughts
never for all that fo well fetled in their minds,  but that they paft often from th^
one to the other, and fo were alwaies ready to* quarrell one with another. Som -
times the intereft of their Nations was the (Kcafion of their difputcs;  andifth*
Princefs authority, joyned to the fear which theyhad of venturing themfelves un^
feafonably, and dcftroying their defignes, had not kept them from it, they hacl
without doubt fought more than once.   In the mean time the Princefs and I Hved
without fufpefting any thing ofthe truth;  Howbeit I remember, that onedayi:
came into my thought, that there was fomething extraordinary in Don FerMiwdo-k\:
teaching me an ayr which I found to be cxtreme.'ly paffionate, and of his own m-
king, I demanded of him laughing,   whether it  were [poffible for him to fpeak
fb oflove, without being ;in love. He anfwcrcd me thereunto,  that   he could
not , for thatit was impoffible for him  to fp^ak againft his heart.   But, faid
I unto him, may not I bc your  confident, and may not I know the perfon
for   whom you make fuch excellent things ?   You would no fooner be niy con¬
fident, anfvvcred he, but you would be mine enemy , vshcrcfore I will not tell you
anything, nor ffiall you know it but when I can no longer conceal it.  I confefsmj
fimplicity unto you, fbr my firft apprehenfion being over, I believed that I had fome
ffiare in this difcourfe;   and fearing  I ffiould bc obliged to intreat   the Prin¬
cefs to turn Don Fernando away , if became to lofe the   refpeft which he owed
me, I preffed.him  no further,  contenting my felf with being his fcholer , and
not his confident.And I was fo affraid to part with him ,  as I never fpakeof
this matter to the Princefs, who paft a good part cff her time in feeing the Prince
of Salerno paint.
In the mean fpacC thefe two difguifed Lovers finding no reafon for them to difco¬
ver themfelves, were even in difpair with it. They faw the Princefs every day more
firm in the refolution ffic had taken; for whereas they were dextrous and intereffedy
they had fo gained fome ofthe Princeffes Offker.'j,   as by them they knew allthat
did pafs, and all that had paft.  1 have told you already, that the Princefs imployed
a good part ofthe day in feeing him paint, this entertainment agreeing better with
her melancholy, than Mufick; It was then impolfible, but that, being good as (ke is,
the Prince of Salerno fhould often have occafion to talk with her;   and in thofe in¬
counters ,  ffie had found fo ranch fpirit and civility in hini, as one day ffie preikd
him to let her know where he had led his life.   And whereas hc had taken a refolii'
tion, which you ffiall undcrftand by and by, he anfwered her, that he had neverhid
any other Mafter but the Prince of Salerno, who was one of the moft confiderable,
both for his birth and riches, that was in allthe Kingdom of iV4^/&lt;ri; that it had
been in his late fathers houfe where he had learn'd to know the faffiions ofthe world
better, than ordinarily Painters do ; and that not long before, through a mifcbaftcr,
which he could not avoid, he was come away from the Prince of Salernoes fervice;
But, Madam, continued hc, though I bc from him,  I cannot chufe but fay, thathiJ
inclinations are great; that hc loveS glory and vertue, for touching his wit, id'
not for me to judge ofit.   I mervail ,   faid   the Princefs unto hira, if hc be (uch as
you fay, that you would leave him ; for being great in birth, mighty in riches, and
fo vertuous as you paint him forth to be, he muft alfo without doubt be liberall, (^^
that I do not fee any reafon for your abandoning   him.     That  is it,    Madjm)
infwered he, wherein I can not fatisfie you; howfoever I can affure you ,   that uc^t
to you, there is no body in the world whom I would ferve vvith raore affeftion. k
Was in this fort that the Prince of Salerno began to give good iraprcflions of himfeli
to the Princefs,that he might prepare her the better to his defire; and divers tim«'
the Princefs and he had fuch like converfation*.  At length that Mafter ofhis hor(e,
whom he had fent to Naples, returned unto the Town difguifed as he ufed tobe,
and acquainted him, that hc had left at Villa-franco, which as you knowisiicir

he fecmed to have in the Prince of .S^/^rw, or the fear he was in left he fhould be
forced to quit the Princeffes krvice, was the caufe of it.  After the reading of this
letter I knew by her difcourfe that it was a propofirion of mariage, and a declara¬
tion of love. She faid to the Princes Meffenger, that his Mafter did her an honor
which fhe was unworthy of And whereas this Governor would have inlarged him¬

and here you fee one by me, faid the Princefs, ffiewing him the Prince of Salerno,
who hath drawn rae his pifture, and I doubt not but it is very like him^fincel
can affure you that he is one of the beft Painters ofthe world. This gallanterie gave
great hope to the Prince of Salerno,  and filled the mind of Dan Feruimdtt\nth diC-
pair. In the mean time the Princefs told the Princes Meffenger, thathe ffiould have
her anfwer the next day, and then commanded her Officers to have a care of hira ,
and CO conduft hira to the lodgings where ftranger&amp; were entertained.  They were
no fooner gone, but the Prince of 5;«/(fr»o making ufe of the liberty which the
Princeffes goodnefs gave to all her krvants  when fhe was in private. I rightly fore¬
faw, Madara,   faid hc unto her, that the Prince of Salerno would not make me

drefling his fpeech to the Princefs, with an intention to ufe a trick for the dcftroy¬
ing of the Prince of Salernoes defignes (whom he did not imagine was fo near

\ would have had me live with him, after I had taught him fome Spaniffi Aires, but
, having been acquainted with the famafticallnefs ofhis humor,   I would not ferve

to puniffi the lying and malice ofthis impoftor, who dares traduce a man fo info-
Icntly, whom certainly he does not know, and a Prince too , who cannot be abfo¬
lutely without merit ,  fince he is capable of the defign to fcrve you; He hath been

hirafelf heard his own fentencc pronounced; neverthelefs he had reafon enough
lek to uk his uttcrmoft indeavour to conceal it,  for kar he ffioiild be fufpefted ot
the Princefs. As for Don Fernando, the joy which he teftified for this adventure was
fo great, as the Painter was the raore confirraed in the opinion which he jid. After
th? Prince of Salernoes Meffenger was gone,&amp; thatuhe Princefs had given him a di¬
amond of great value, and that ffie had commanded him to bc condufted io the
Barque,vvhich wasto carry him back to his Veffell, thePainter craved  leave of
her that he might accompany him widi the reft, for he durft not fpeak to him, faid
he, unlefs it pleafed her to permit hira. You are difcreet, faid the Princefs, and this
refpeft merits more dian this which you demand ofme.  The Painter having ob¬
tained thispermidion, went and overtook his Governor, to falute bra ;  this raan ,
who was inlfrufted as he ought, ufed him like a Painter, and dexteroufly giving
hira the commodity to talk with him,this Prince willed hira to return unto Villa-
Franco,  under pretext of racnding fomething about his veffell, and t©fend the
Mafter ofhis Horfe the next raarning difguifed unto him , with as much money as
as he could bring. Now you arc to ^ underftand ,   that  the day before he hapned
to meet and know an old Souldier, which foractime had born arraes under his Fa¬
ther, and whofe life he had faved, being at that tirae Sergeant of one ofthe Com¬
panies of the Garrifon. The Prince of Salerno coraeing to know him , found the
raeanes to fpeak with him in private, and after he had given him three hundred
piftolets,hc made hirafelf known unto hira  This man raviffied to fee the Son ofhis
old Mafter, but raore yet with his liberality , teftified after his manner,both his
acknowledgement, and his joy. In the mean time thePrince of Salern0,whohid
not raade himfelf known unto hira only to inrich him,told him how hc was to ferve
hira in a bufincs that concern'd all his happines. This man told hira,that he was his
fubjeft, and his obligee, fo that confequently he raight expeft any thing from him.
Then the Prince asked him, whether he lived alone in his houfe, and having learnt
that he did, he asked of him further, whether he could not fuboi n a Fifher-man
with mony; thisSouldier having anfwcrcd hira, that the poverty of thofe kind
of peopk did not permit him to doubt but that he ffiould find out an hundred in
ftead of one, hc gave him wherewithall to gain him, without difcovcring any pare
of his defign untohim, affuring him only that this Fiffier-man ffiould be expofed
to no perill, nor have ought els to do, than to carry his nets: Thatwhich made
the Prmceot Salerno do dius, was, for that he had obferved how juft at ten of the
clock m the forenoon the ordinary Guard ftill ufed to rife, and thereby had con¬
ceived, that they whichfawaFiffier-raan go forth laden with his nets about nine,
would not be there at five in the evening, andfo confequently hc might come in
again accompanied with two men attired like Fiffiermen, and laden with nets as
he was, without any nodce taken of thera. After he had reafoned thus with him-
icft, he refolved to execute that which he had premeditated fong before, judgina

concluded, he fought for the means to execute it.  This Sergeant brought him
b i(her-man into a place apart, whom he inftrufted with that which he would ha *
hini to do ; and thenextday this man went out ofthe Town about eight of t^
clock in the morning lacslcn with nets, and (as I have already faid) before the Gua d
wasriitn; but when it was towards evening, hegave over fiffiing, and went t
meet with two Souldiers difguifed like Fiffiermen, who carae by Land from th
Prince ot Salerno's Veffell, which was at VtUa-Franco, and waited for hini at a cer¬
tain Reiidezvouz which had been appointed hira : Having ffiarcd his nets amonefi
them, he re-cntred into the Town, and incountring none of thofe fouldiers at
the Gate which had feen hira in the morning, nonotice was taken of them, andfo
they went along with him home ; where they ftayed till it was night, and then
thefe two men having left their nets there, were condufted by him to the Sergeants
houfe, in which they abode concealed untill the Prince of Salerno had need of
iheiii. By this device there entred everyday two fouldiers into the Town, who
carryed two Piftolls and two ffiort fwords hidden in the nets, wherewith they were
laden.    But whereas there wasto be thirty days before the threefcore fouldiers
which he had deftined forhis entcrpri2e,could enter, he was in an extreme impa¬
tience; howbeit he concealed it fo well, as we could never perceive it. Inthe
mean time he had gotten him a ladder of cords, wherewith he purpofed to bring
a dozen fouldiers into the Caftle thorough the windows ofhis chamber, vvhich o.
pened upon a place where no body ufually paffed, and where no body could trou-
ble his defign ; for upon thediforder which had been between him and the Muli-
cian, theyhad been lodged affundcr. For the reft ofhis Souldiers, hehad refol¬
ved to fend thera under the conduft of the Mafter of his houfe, and that Sergeant,
to the gate of the Town, for to render themfelves Mafters of it, whilft he (liould
carry the Princefs away by force, for which effeft his X'effell was to be at the
Port.    But whilft he attended for the entrance of all his fouldiers, and that dm
Fernando alfo attended the return of hira from whora he hoped for fuccour in hi?
enterprize, they lived better together than ever they had done, and in fficw they
loved  one another cxtreracly,  though indeed they hated and obferved one an¬
other as two encraies. Asfor Don Fernando,he had (during the defign which lie
kept clofe} fallen into a ftrift league of friendffiip witdi one ofthe principall Inha¬
bitants of Afonaca, whora the Princefs had made Captain of the Gate.   His M
admittance into this mans houfe, was to teach his only daughter^o fing,  after*
wards his converfation grew fo pleafing unto hira, as he frequented thither very

thought which hewasin, turned his eyes upon this Captain,   and having heard
him fay divers times, that the people began to murmur againft the Princeis, for
that it feemcd ffie had refolved all her life-time to make a defert of if/o»«&lt;r»j and
Utterly to ruine the trade thereof, by the difficulty which there was of entringinto
it, he refolved to confide in him, as he hid,   after he had blinded hira firft with i
great funi cf money, vvhich hegave him. Andthat which made him not doubt but
that the Gentleman, whom he had fent, would bring him Troopes, was, becaufe
he knew the Armies of Spain were very powerfull in Italj,   and that if he couU
tiicc render himfelf Maffer of this place, ffie ffiould not only be juftified, but quia-

the Princefs had'had her unqu etnefs, as well as her Lovers; for thatLicutenantot

continued even unto the end. For when hc had learned thek Aires, after they had
been repeated unto hini above twenty times, yet did he not fing thera very vvell .
NcverthelelsthePrincefs would hear no other thing,   howfoever I intreated hei
to the contrary; fo that Don I ernando was thereby rec uced to that point, as he could
not fee the Princefs unlefs he would fing his Rivalls fongs: Which he did vyithfo
much conftraint, as he raade rae to laugh at him ; For ftill I was perfwaded that he
did k out of caprichioufnefs and pride,  though indeed it was out of jcalouhc.
As for the Prince of 5^/mw, another adventure befell hira.   When as there lacked
but two dayes of the time wherdn all his Souldiers were toconie in, the Princefs
reraembrcd how ffie had heard hira fay, that he could draw the pifture of one that
was abknt, that ffiould be like hira,and thereupon believed that by the inftruftions
which ffie could give hira he raight peradventure draw a pifture that would re-
kmbk you, though hehad neverleen you. She propoundes the matter unto him,
affures him that hc ffiall infinitely oblige her if he can do it;   and though ffic told
him not precifely who ffie perfon wasfoat (he defired the pifture of,  yet he knev7
that undoubtedly it was yours which ffie would have. At firft hc faid ,   that hc be¬
leeved hc could not do it;but after he had thought on it a little, I will endeavour.
Madam, faid he unto her laughing ,   to content you, provided you will have the
goodnefs not to intreat rae as an ordinary Painter, and that you will acknowledge
unto me, after you have feen it,  that it is the pift are ofthe man, who of all the
world honors you with moft refpeft, and loves you with mott paffion. You know
too much fora Painter, faid the Princefs unto hira bluffiing, howfoever I will
pardon you this boldnefs, and will acknowledge that unto you vvhich you fay,
provided you prefently go in hand vvith your work. The Painter having for an¬
fwer made a love obeifance, went to fetch a cloth and colours for him to work
in her chamber.   When he was arrived there the Princefs vvould have had a great
glafs taken away,  which hung right oppofite to the place where he had feated
himfelf,for fear the Sun vvhich gave full upon it, ffiould mar it; But he prayed her
that it might not be removed, becaufe as he l^aid,   it ferved to eafe his fight.    The
Princefs then began to defcribe you as you are, and particidarifing unto him all
the features of your face as vvell as poffibly ffie could, ffie thought ffie had inftruft¬
ed him fufficiently. Whereupon hc began to defign this pifture, and paufing at eve¬
ry draught that hc made, as it vvere to recolkft his memory,  at length he traced
out all the reft. And after the Princefs had caukd him to alter fomething,   ffie pro -
feft that it was very near to the farae which ffie defired ;   but for fear hc had for¬
gotten what ffie had already told him,   ffie reprekntcd unto him again the colour
of your hair, of your eyes, and of your complexion. Then he took his palet, and
his pencills, and tricked the pifture, vvhich certainly refembled you a little,   but
lefs tl an when it was only traced out with the cole. The Princefs mervcllcd here-
at; and knew not whereunto ffie raight attribute the cauk ofit;   for confidering
every feature in particular, ffie faw that little lacked but they vvere juft as ffiehad
ttguivd them, and yet for all that the whok put together foarce refembled you at
all. Bui the Painter nothing abaihed at it, told her that it was but a trickine   and

licr, that tojudge vvell of a picture ,   one was net to look uponit whilff itwasa
doing, andto difcern the faults the better of that which he was about,  (he w.isto
let him work an hower upon it without look'ng on him. The Princefs believed
him, and taking me away with her to the other end of the chamber, we left him
alone; but we were much amazed, when he liad advertifed us that his work was
done,   and that hehad brought it into the light for us to judge the better ofit,
tofee that it was his own piftnre v.hich  he had drawen, and not yours.   Tk-
Princefs then perceived plainly, that this was not a matter of chance, and in an in¬
ftant calling to mind fomany things,  as ffie had feen withoutthmking of theni,
ffie made no doubt but that there was fomewiiat, vvhich was myfterious enough in
this adventure; Yet had ffie fufficient conffancy of mind not to ffiew all hei araa2e-

well forefaw, faid ffie unto him with a f.-eming fimplicity,   that this glafs woHJd
make you fpoyl  your work; And I am very forry, continued ffie,   going towards
her Cabinet, that you have loft your time, and 1 too. If this pifturc,faidthc Prince

W  reXid in dis manner all the evening, without being able to judge cei tain-
l!Mlether this Painter were the Prince of Salerno, or forae one of his fervants
l\;tl   had f^^^it to be "bout the Princefs,   howbeit wc believed hira to be rather
diefirft than the other: And after we had exarained thematter ,   it wasiefolved
that this   Painter ffiould the next day bc turned out of ^ci«^c.,without letting him
know that he was fofpefted to be a Prince , and alfo without any other ill ufage ,
than baniffiinghim. With this intention the Princefs went to bed, and would have
rae lye with her that night, it being irapclTible for her, as ft^^^^^^^J'^o have any hope
oftleepinc, as long as you ffiould have a Rivall in ;i/o«&lt;tc^. Whilft the Princefs and
1 were ag'itating in thisfort, the Prince of Salerno, who had found that all his hope
conliifed wholly inforce, refolved to defer his defign no longer, and to execute it
the night enfuing;he went then to feek out that Sergeant with whom he held in¬
telligence, and to fpeak with the Mafter ofhis horfe,   to the end his veffell might
not fail to be at the Port juft at the bower which hehad appointed, andthathe
fliould deal in fuch fort, as all raightbe ready againft need ffiould be. He gave them
the tirae and the fignall ofthe enterprife,   and thinking that hc had well difpofed
of every thing, he retyred into the Caftle as he ufed to do,  taking but two piftolls
and a fword along with him, which he caryed fecretly into his chamber, in cafe
any violence ffiould be offered him before his defign could be executed.   If the
Prince of Salerno was bufied, no lefs was Den Fernando; For hc had underftood fome
dayes before, by the return of hira whom he had fent into the Mtlanefe, that accor¬
ding to his? and the Marquis of Guafls direftions , he had brought him ftore of
mony and Jewells, together with five hundred men, which were come thither not
in a body, but two and two in a co.upany, and fo were lodged in all the Villages
about ^(?K/ff«», with exprefs order to render thcnilelves all upon a certain night&gt;
whereof they fhould bc advertifed , within a mile of thcTowu; Sothat PflflF^r-
wWoftaydfor nothingbut the return of the Captain of the Gate,   who was gone
to Genoua, and whofe faith he had corrupted. This m.an , for our ill fortune, or to
fay better for our good fortune, came back as hc defired, fo that the next morning,
which was the very fame day wherein this Painter finiffied the pifture that re¬
fembled you fo ill, he went and found him out,   and having given him to the va-
Icw often thoufand crownes in jcwells, hc confirmed him by this liberality in the
defign he had undertaken. But not to prolong ray dikourfe, it fufficeth that I tell
you, how after he had difcovered hirafelf to this man to be that-hc was a good
whik before; after he had perfwaded hira,that the retirednefs wherein the Princefs
lived, would in the end undo Monaco; becaufe, faid he,  it was impoffiblc, havine
no Prniceto deknd it,   but that fome one or other would feize upon it; after he
had told him, that this place was too important, for to be left undefended under
the Government  of a mayd ;  and that foeing it was to pafs into the hands of
.trangers, he was todchre that it raight fall into the power ofa man, who would

things, I fay, this man charmed with the prefent benefit, with the hope of T^

Princefs, he promifed Don Fernando, who communicated his whole defign'^
him, to deliver him the Gate whenfoever he pleafed.Hereupon hcknt that Ge"T°
man, which belonged unto him, to carry his direftions to  all the feverall pi
where his fouldiers were, to the end they ffiould precifely meet together withi^*^^^
mile of Monaco an hour after midnight, and that they ffiould repair to the sate f
the Town as fcon as they could fee a flaming Torch on a Tower. The ftranccnef
of this incounter was, that the very fame night wherein thePrince of Salernoyjn
to execute his defign, Don Fernando refolved, without knowing ought ofhis Rivalls
affairs, no longer to defer his interprizc, purpofing to die, or to render himfelf
Mafter of the Town, and poffeffor of the Princefs :"fo that whilft wc were all the
afternoon feeing the Prince of Salerno paint, he had been taking order for all things
as well as the Captain of thcGate. Their defigns being in thefe teinis. Youmafc

yet more, continued ffic, when Iffiafl tell you, that juft about two hours after mid-
night, which by an extraordinary chance proved to be the very point, boffi ofthe
Prince of Salernoh and Don Fernando''s enterprize ; that firft having caufed twelve
fouldiers to enter thorough the window of hischamber with thehelpof ahder
of cords, and commanded the Sergeant to go and feize upon the Gate ofthe town
that hc might forcibly carry away the Princefs in hi$Veffell,which wastobeatthe
Port at the fame hour,wc heard the outward chamber-door broke open;whereupon
the Princefs gave a great skrike, and without ftanding to know what the matter
ffiould be, the firft thing that came into her thought was to put on her clothes, to
the end ffic mightnot be found in bed, wherein I helped her vvith all the fpeed
that poffibly I could.    In the mean time her woraen ciycd out at the windowes,
but the Princeffes Officers lay in a quarter fofar of, becaufe ffie never feared any
thing from the Towns fide, and the Prince of ^^/frw's execution was fo fudden,
as fcarcely had the Princefs gotten on a Night-gown vvith much haft,but he entred
into her chamber followed by ten fouldiers, having left two at the Caftle-gatc, wb
had ftabbcd the Porter upon his awaking.   I leave you to think what the Princefs
became in this occafion, when as maugre her refiftance and mine,maugrc her tears,
and maugre her cryes, ffie faw her felf carryed away forcibly, by thefe fouldiers,
and led outof the Caftle.    I can indure no more, faid Jufliniano, wiffi as much
grief, and almoft as much choler as if hchadfeen his Miftrefs carryed away bj
force. Have patience, faid ^yEmilia, for yet you do not fee all our Enemies. VVhen
as the Prince of Salerno had forcibly carryed away the Princefs, I followed her all
in tears, and catching faft hold of one of the corners of her gown, we went in this
fort even to the Gate of the Town, neither thcPrincefs nor I having the powerio
cry out, fo much were  we feized with fear, and our judgements troubled
The Prince of Salerno found not the matter fo eafie as he had believed it; for the
Sergeant, who had gotten the Ward, and that was toraake ufe of it for the fur*
prizing of the Court of Guard, and cutting them in pieces , arrived juft at the
gate, as the Captain that ferved Don Fernando, was delivering it up to his men, wkff
were come thither under the conduft of the Gentleman which belonged unto
him, after they had feen the Signall on the Tower.   And whereas he had oiderto
dye, or to render himfelf Mafter of it, what refiftance foever he met withall, ht
had already begun a ffiarp and bloody fight, when as the Prince of Salerno, ana
thofg that kept the Princefs, arrived at that place. And being a Prince of a grCJt
courage, after he had commanded his ten fouldiers to look well to the Princefi, W
went with his fword in his hand to fee what the matter was. Never was there any
thing more drcadfull than that fame night; Don Fernandt, who lay not in the Ca¬
ftle that night, who was ready at the gate to receive in his men, and who was in
the head of them, when as the Sergeant arrived there, thought hc was difcovcred,

having obferved that Don Fernando was   in the Head   of the Troopes which he

<p>flight by Sea, nor any fecurity on Land for him, with fo little company. It is credit
ble, confidering what I have faid, that feeing himfelf in that eftate, and pcrceivin?
that the Prince of Salerno, followed by fome of his men, niade towards the port
he with his Souldiers mingled amongft them, and entred into his Veffell with hini'
the darknefs of the night favouring the defign,   which doubtlefs hc  had to kill
the Prince of S alerne, and tomakehirafelfmafter of his Veffell.   For when theday
began to break there was a great noife heard on the Port fide,   which made every
one to get up on the walls for to fee what thematter was. The Princefs andlwent
upto the top of the lodgings where we were, which looked upon the Sea, and
whereas it was grown very light, we faw a Veffell, that was making from the Port
and on the hatches a great number of men fighting together, whereof fome tumbled
alive into the Sea, and others fell down dead at their enemies feet. In the midft of
this diforder-we knew the Prince of Salerno and Don Fernando by thek apparell,who
combated with fuch violence, as moved thePrincefs to compafficJh, but at length,
the Vcffell ftiil getting further of,we faw that after a long combat thefe two Rivalls
remained fighting almoft alone, and prefently after both of them tumble downup-
on the hatches; and fo on an inftant the Veffel vanilhing, wc could no longer dif¬
cern thofe two couragious LoverSjWho more happy inthis fad adv£nture,than they
were aware of, made the Princefs ffied teares of pitty; but ffie ffied them abundant-
ly,whcn as in her return unto the Caftle ffie beheld fo great a number of dead bodies
as the ftrcets were even   covered with thcni. The Prince of 5/2/(fr«of/Mafter of his
horfe was found living ftill, as well as hc whom Don Fernando had ftntirXQtVt
Mtlanefe; and it was by their meanes that we came to learn the particularities ofthis
Hiftory, which without them I could not have told you; for the Princefs underftan-
ding who they were, caufed them to be very carefully looked unto, thaf ffie might
iearn that which I have related. The Captain ofthe Gate , and the traiterous Ser¬
geant were found amongft the number ofthe dead, and as if the Prince of Sdcr-
noes yiafker of hi%horfe, and Don Fernandoes h^ent, had prolonged theitllvesbut
only to tell the Princefs what ffie defired to know, they dyed within a few dayesof
their hurts. As for their Mafters we heard afterward,   that being fallen dovyn ask
were dead,in the manner as I have toli you,ch£ remainder of the Prince of Sakrmii
men having made an end of killing thofe which  had followed Don Fermmiolt
Mendoz^a; andbe\ieyin2, their Mafter to be dead, three or four of them took up
the body of Don Fernando for to caft it into the Sea, when as the Prince of Sde/fn
coming out ofhis fvvoon,   and feeing what they were going to do, recovercdfo
much ftrength as to forbid them from it; generofity being greater in him than hi-
tred, or revenge.     This   commandement of the Prince was executed , andthit
too offering whether hc had any life remaining in him; and when it was reported
untohim that he ftill breathed, he charged them to have as much care of him is
of himfelf; as, indeed he was looked unto and treated in the fame raanner. I vvilnot
declare the converfations ofthefe tvvo Rivall unto you,but in brief it fufficethtoW
you know, that the Prince of Salernoes generofity fo nearly touched the heart ofJ|**
Fernando, as he ceafed to hate him,and would needs land with hira at Naplesto'^
throughly cured thcre.And as if on the healing oftheir wounds that of their minds
had depended,they furmounted the love which they bare to the Princefs,the tirft out
of rea(bn,and the other out ofhis pride.And each ofthcra following bis own fim
they fent to the Princcfs,&amp; wrote unto her, the laft with rhodomontadcs, according
to the humor of his Nation, and the other with a great deal of civility; befeeching
her to remember that ffie had promifed her friendffiip tothe?rince of Saltr^i
and praying her alfo to attribute allthat had paft to the paffion of thePainter i*'
cilio, and not to him ,   who vowed alwaies to feek occafions to ferve her, andto
publiffi every where,   that ffic was the admirablcft creature on the whole earth.

<p>^H E N as Jufliniano was retired to his lodging , and that hehad
coramanded his fervants to leave him alone, after they had
gothimtobed, his iraagination reprefenred untohimmore
lively, than ever it had done before,  the inconfiderationofhis
voyage; the promife hehad made to Soltman tot awn mo
hira;the neccffity, cither of breakinghis word with a prince
who hadfo much obliged him, or to quit his Miftrefs: Alas/
faidffie, how unhappy ara I, andhow iraprudent havelbsen^
what ffiall I do in fo deplorable an eftate ? What ffiall I fay to the Princefs ? Where¬
fore came I to Monaco f Had I the defign to betray her , in coming to marry her,
and then to fteal away from her the very next day ?  Or have I paft ray word for to
falfifie it? No, no, that was not ray defign ; I defired to fee Ifabella, mylovear-
ried me unto it, and doubtlefs it ought to carry mc unto it; and were I to difpofe
of ray folf again, I ffiould ftill do the farae thing. And could I, faid he alowd,re-
fufeto fee Ifabella &gt;Thcn turning himfelf about with precipitation, he recommen¬
ced his complaints. What, continued he,   did Iconic to thePrincefs, only to ac¬
quaint her that I was Grand Vifier; that I was the chief of all the Orient; that I
was the Favorite of a great Prince; and afterwards to abandon her to grief and
difpair,  and fo return again to enjoy all thofe greatneffcs ? Ah no, Juftimamhwi
bafe;   he  will not  quit a Princefs, who is not unhappy  but for the love oi
him;   he will not facrifife her fo cruelly to the pleafure of a Prince, who
raay find raen  enough in his Empite ,   that will take the place whichhekW
there;    For in   fine,   if Soliman loy es us,    this princefs loves us too ; n"'
if  1 have   friendffiip   for  this Prince,  I have love for Ifabella.   Let us not
balance thematter any longer, let us injoy the good we liave, and let us not

to fortune : let her intreat thcc ill, let her perfecute thee, let her purfue thee every
where, it imports not, fo as thou doft nothing contrary to that which thou oweft
to Ifabella. It wasinthismanntv that Jafliniano agitated in his mind fo difhcult
a thine to refolve on ; and honor and love tyrannized him fo crUelly, as his rea¬
fon was almoft loft therewith. But at length, after he had paft the greateft part of
the night without fleeping, hc generoufly refolved to fpeak plainly to dicPnncef?,
and in this defign preft with wearinefs and thought, fleep furprized him whether
he would or no, or to fay better, a dull and melancholy vapor brought a fcnfolcf-
nef3 upon him, which yet could not keep his iraagination from reprefenting ftill
unto him the deplorable condition wherein he was.  Day being come, he founci
himklf fo altered, as one would hardly havcbclccvcd,that the miferies ofthe mind
coidd info little a time have brought fuch a notable change to the face. As foon
as the Princefs was in an eftate to be feen, fhe fent him a complement to advertife
him ofit, whereupon he came ftraightway to her Cabinet, but with acountenancc
fo pale, and eyes wherein grief was fo vilible, as Ifabella was fuj-prifed with it; But
whereas ffic did notbelieve thathe had any caufe to be afflifted, ffie thought he was
fkk, told hira thathe (hould nothavecomeout of his lodging in the cafe hc was
in, asked him what hc ailed ? whether hc had a feaver ? whether it were ftill on him?
and finally propounded very many queftions unto hira, whereto Jnfltmano anfwe¬
red not a word. For upon the point of executing that which hc had refolved hc
felt fo cxtraordmaric a trouble in his raind, as he fuddenly paft from palcncfsto
redncfs; hc was taken at firft with an univerfall ffiivcring which made him to trem¬
ble , and then with fo great a burning, that hc feemed all on fire. The Princefs fee¬
ing him in this cafe, conjured him again with more earneftnefs to acquaint her
with the caufe of all thefe alterations in hira, thatthey might labor to give fome
renicdy unto it. Alas! Madam, (faidhe unto her with fomewhat a low voice, that
he might not be heard by one of the Princeffes Woraen, who was at the other end
of the Cabinet) the knowledge Which I ffiall give you of my difeafe will not make
you find a remedy for it; for it is of a nature not to be cured,  but by death.   Yet
if I ffiould fuffer it my klf alone, 1 would not complain of it; but I am afraid that
k would be contagious for you; that the knowledge which you ffiould have of ic
would incrcak my grief by caufing yours ; that I ffiould be more infortunate in
your perfon, than in mine own ; and that in conclufion you would be yet more to
bckmented than I, who defcrves the miferies which opprefs mc, fince I am the
cauie of all yours.   The Princefs judging rightly by thisdifcourfe, that there
was (ome great matter to be known, commanded her woman that was ftill in the
Cabina, to go and ftand at the door for to keep any from coming to interrupt her

you fear fo much to give me a part in your griefs ? No, no, caft off this fear, and
permit mc to tell you, before you acquaint me with that which I can neither di.

lieve that when you ffiall know the p^int where at this prefent wc are, you will
finde that 1 have reafon to be greatly troubled in refolving to acquaintyouwithit,
Why, faid the Princefs, exceedingly impatient, concerns it life, liberty, or honori
if it bc the firft, provided I may die before you, 1 have felt forrows (harper than
death; ifit be tne fecond, and that I may be a flave with yoa, I will accuftom my
felf to wear irons; but ifit concerns honor, I confefs that wc have reafon to defpair,
and that to conferve it, any thing is to be done : you fee, faid ffic unto him, tbatl
am prepared for the greateft misfortunes, and for fuch as feem to bc the ffirtheftoff
fronimc ; hold mc no longer then in pain, ifit be true that I have any powerovcr
you. J»j?/'»/&lt;»w feeing he could not avoid it, went on with his Hiftory from the
point where he had left it, he recounted unto her his pains, his un-quictncfs,and
his joys, when as he knew that ffic was not inconftant; that not knowing whatds
to do, he had been conftrained to acquaint Soliman with his whole life; and confe¬
quently, that the permiffion which hehad obtained toconie and fee her was but for
fix months only, having ingaged his word to that Prince to return unto hira pre-
cifely within that time. Judge (after this,Madam, faidhe with fighs thatWellneer
fuffocated hira, and that fcarcely fuffered hira to fpeak} whether my complaints
be not juft&gt; whether I am worthy of your favour, and whether death alone benot
the remedy which I can find for my miferies. For confider (I befecch you) the pi¬
tifull eftate whereunto I am reduced; vsffiich way focvcr I turn rae I fee you ilill
infortunate, but unhappy and infortunate only forthe love of mc.  Ah Madam!
if you knew how touching this objeft is, how fenfible and grievous it is, you
would eafily apprehend the evill that I fuffer; it is fo great, as there is no expref-
fion ftrong enough to reprefent it well : You have believed me to bc dead, and I
have thought that you were inconftant; your vertue hath been tryed by a long ab¬
fence, and my crime hath been pimifficd with flavciy; but when as fortune feenied
to be weary of perfecuting us, vvhen as your conftancy was fufficiently known, and
when as my crime was puniffied enough, ffie made fome truce vvith us: I knew? tba:
you lived for nic, and you were not ignorant that I always lived for you. I am
returned Mac^am, but muft I repeat it once again ? I am returned a Slave, fortune
hath but Icngrlicned my chain, and not broken off my irons. You feem. Madam,
continued he, by your filence to tell me that I had done better for your reft, not lo
have returned, and to have left you in die belief of my death, than to conic forw
affure you that I do live, but that 1 do not live for you. I think,Madam, that realon
is on your fide, but it is a reafon which I cannot follow. My voyage i.s not an eP
of my reafon, nor of my will; I never ftuck at the taking of this refolution, W'
lowed my fenfe and my lovc, and my paffion fo raightily blinded ray reafon,asmy
foul abandoned it folf wholly to joy. 1 no longer thought that I was to return i'

choofo but do. In the racan time I have no fooner feen you, but I have bchdd y

no niorc.The Priiicel^s, vvho had heard him with a great deal of attention,   alfo-
ni(hmcnt, and forrow, was alfo a good while without anfwering him ;   agitating
in her fclf fo difficult a thing to be refolved. She was then leaning with one arm
on a littk table of ebony, looking on Juftiniano , who durft not lift up bis eyes for
fear of incountring thofe ofthe Princels, which were full of teares;   But at length
this generous perfon, who had a great and noble foul, brak off her filence, and faid
unto hira with a conftancy, which hath fcarce any exaraple; I confefs, ray deareft
Jufliniano, that our raifcries are fo great, as 1 could not forefee them; and one had
nectl ofa mi 111 I, that is firm indeed , not to He abandoned wholly   to   grief,   in
an occafion where it is fo hard to fatisfie together, both honor and love: I confefs,
continued (he, that thcfc two padions reign both at once in ray heart; but I confefs
alfo, that the laft cannot bc fatisfied without the other; and that in conclufion , to
exprefs ray thought unto you, had I not found a raeanes to fatisfie them both, I
(hould die, and let you goe. For know, that I am too generous to fuffer you to
teftifie your lovc unto me in an unworthy way ;  and lam ravifhed to fee you love
glory, as much as me.No,Juftiniano,you rauif not break your word with a Prince,
who h.ith fo much obliged you; forfo ffiould you be both ingratefull and perfidi¬
ous; neither muft you too abandon a Princefs, who loves you fo dearly;   forfo
(hould you be both crucll and unfaithfull; and ifyou love her perfeftly, you can ne¬
ver doe it. 1 know full well, anfwered jufttniano vvith a deep ligh, that death alone
can acquit me of that which I ought to doe. That is not ray meaning, replyed the
Princefs, and to clear it unto you ,   you rauft return again to that generous Prince
who hath loved you fo ranch;  I am no lefs obliged to hira than you, fince I ow
your life unto him; and for this reafon , together with that of honor, I will not
hinder you from it:but withall you rauft perrait nic to follow you.Oh.'Madara,faid
jHftmiano , do you think well of that you fay ? yes, anfwered ffie, I have thought
well upon it,   and    am refolved for it. But whereas lovc can never vanquiffi ho¬
nor in myfoul, Iwill not follow you as a vagabond, and fcrfak en one, you ffiall
mary mc here  ,   and  that   done , I will follow your  fortune over all   the
earth. You have told me already, that SeUman permits you the exercife of your Re-
li2ioii,l mayenjoy the fame gracc,either as paffing for your flave,or for your vvifo.
And then again, 1 have not forgotcen that you have told rae , how this Prince hadi
made you hope,  that if he could fupport ,your abknce during the tirae ofthe fix
riionthes vvhich he hath given you, hc would grant you your full liberty: Let us co

It would be enough indeed for fortune to make me feel my own miferies, during
fo fatall a voyage,   without inforcing mcto refent thofe which ffiould happcnto
you. Let me depart then. Madam, or to to fay better, let me dye. I will doe ncidier
the one, nor the other, faid the Princefs, and in this occafiou you ffiall not difpofe
ofyour felf. Neverthelefs it is needful! that you fhould giveme a publiquc afl of
your will, before I can execute mine. Refift mc not, Jufliniano, unkfs you defire to
offend me; foffer me to follow yon with honor,  and put me not in the conduion
of increafing the number ofthofe indifcrcet ones, who many times have folkwctl
their Lovers, without being their wives. Think of my glory, I conjure you; and
think too, that ifyou abandon me, I may peradventure be capable of forgetting k.
Do not expofo me, I befeech you, to chat perill, fince it is greater for me, according
to my apprehenfions, than the drcadfuUeft tempeft that you can defcribe unto me.
And fear not I pray you, continued ffie, either ffiipwrack, or Pirats; if weperilB
together, wc ffiall dye almoft vrithout grief; if we oe made flaves,  you willhelp
me to bear my chaines; or if wc be foparated , the fory of thofe barbarians (hall do
no more, than what you would now do.   Ceafe, Madam, from adding to myfor-
row, faid J*5/?&lt;»*&lt;»» interrupting her,   complain of my misfortune, but complain
not ofme in this crnell adventiire.   When I parted from Conftant iuople to come hi¬
ther,   I blindly followed my paffion; but at this prefent. Madam, Ivvillblmdly
follow reafon: She will not have you follow   a wretch, and an infortunate nun;
Do you not conl5der, how if it fhould happen that I ffiould dye,  in what ancflatc
you would remain ? Ah! my dear Princefs (if Imay be permitted to call yoa
fo ) give over fo wofull a defign: Live in tranquility , whilft I go and combatmy
evill fortune at Conftantinople; with a promife, ifl cannot overcome it, not tofr
vive her viftory very long. But itmay be we ffiall not be fomiferablc; SoUmtinb.^
a great and vertuous foul;   that which I am going to doe may pleafe him l&lt;
may bc moved with my teares and pray ers;   he may break that invifible chain
which tyes mc unto him ;  and being no longer a flave, you mighc then widiont
fhamc accord me the honor, which now I refiffe.     This hope is too weak, faidthc
Princefs, to make me change the refolution I have taken: No, Juftiniano, to fp«^
to mc thus,  is not to lovc as you ffiould; this is to blind me withanartilicejto
doubt ofmy affeftion and courage, and to fay all, this is to offend me fenfibly.?^!

<p>ficians where already come, for being incountred by good hap inth: Caftleth-
had been advertifed ofthis accident by one ofthe Princeffes women. They beheld
her, feel her pulfe, ask her queftions, to come to the   knowledge of her difeafe
and not able to find out the caufe of it, they teftifie by their aftions,  and by their'
unquietnefs, that n^t knowing it perfeftly, they are troubled how to reiblve oa the
choice ofthe remedies that they would apply thereunto;   At length they ordain
her to be laid in her bed ,  that ftill they might gain time to think of that which
they had to doc. J«/?/w/?w out of refpeft retired all in difpair, and vvithoutbeins
able fo much as to reafon about his misfortune, his forrow became fo ftrong, as hj
felt it but confufedly. The Princefs was not long in her weaknefs , and Nature do¬
ing her uttermoft, gave her fpiritsthe liberty again which grief had arefted; But
thereupon, thci e was fo great and Itiddain a revolution ci all her humors, as (he
fell into a violent feaver, fo that the Phyficians knowing then the Princefs difeafe,
albeitthey were ignorant ofthe caufe ofit, they began to treat her according to
the precepts of tlicir Art.    Juftiniano was alfo defired by order from the Princefs
to repair unto her; hc obeyed, and came into her chamber, vvith a face wherein the
grief ofthe raind fo nearly refembled that of the body ,   as he feemed to bs ficker
than the Princefs. He approches, every one withdrawcs,  and when the Phyficians
told her, that after fuch an accident as this which had befallen her,   ic was (it (he
ffiould not fpeak much, ffie affured them that their converfation ffiould notbe long;
as indeed all that ffie faid to Jnfltniano was,   comfort your ielf for the love ofme,
if you will have mc live for the love of you ,   and be raindfuU not to fpeak ofour
misfortunes, no not to Doria hirafelf ifi he coraes hither. And whereas ffie faw that
J«/?i»;4«(? could not anfwer her   without difcovcring'his   grief,  fhewrunghim
gently by the hand, and calling e./£w;7/^ ,  ffie commanded her to haveacareof
Juflmiano, untill her ficknefs was abated.    This infortunate Lover, not daring to
fpeak, for fear of augmenting the Princeffes difteraper, and making too much (how
of his difpair, which ffie would not have him to do, retired away without faying
any raore, than, AhlMadara, ifyou will have rae comfort my felf^ you nraft then re¬
cover ofthis ficknefs, which I have been the caufe of.    After that, thePrincefs
grew extremely worfe and worfo ; the feaver held her ten daies with fo much vio¬
lence, and weaknefs together, as the Phyficians durft  not warrant her life: Butk
was nothing in comparifon ofthe eleventh day , for then Jufliniano, who fcarctlj
had abandoned her all that time,  abfolutely beleeved that fhe was adeadbody.
The feaver was very ranch increafed , her ftrength diminilhed, the remedies unpro¬
fitable; Nature fcemed to want power, and to be fo oppreffed, as it was impolfible
to hope that ffie Ihould cfcape.   But in the midft of all thofe raifcries,  and info
great an extreraity, the conffancy of the Princefs was admirable; who,   notwith¬
ftanding &lt;!y£miliaes teares, the cryes of her woraen,   and Juflinianoes difpair, who
was no longer in the tcrmes to fuffer himfelf tobe conftrained by reafon, cxpreiTed
fuch a tranquillity of mind, as it might well be judged, that life was not very dear
unto her: Yet could ffic not for all that indurc Juftmianoes lookes, nor fee his teares
trickle down his checkes without refentracnt, and befides that deplorable objeft)
flie was infcnfible to all things.   But whilft they were in thefe tcrmes at ylf«»'««')
there was nothing but rejoycing at Genoua, where it was not known that the Prin¬
cefs was fo fick as ffic was;   for from her firft time of being ill, (he hadgivcnin
charge that it (hould not be publhhed, to the end(hc niight recover vvithoutmo-
leftation, or at leaftwife dye quietly.   It was onely then knowen at Genona thatlK
was not well, but that kept them not, from meeting almoft every day ;  according
to the order which the Marquis had eftabliffied, either at the Couius, or atDorii&gt;[h
who after his return had taken an onely fifter, that he had , to govern his houlc;
and who was alfociated with this fair Troop ,   vvhich had no other thoughtbuto

wit^and beauty, fothat the Marquis being joyned to fo many excelknt perfons,
k niight have been faid, that this Afferably had been perfeft indeed, had Jufttnia-
nt and the Princefs of Monaco been there. The next day after that the Counf,D&lt;jrM,
and the Marquis were returned to Genoua, this illuftrious company failed not to
meet at the Counts Palace; and whereas it was forbidden to fpeak in thefe occa¬
fions either of war, or of generall affairs; and that Verfes, Painting, Mufick, Love,
Vertue, and all other things that depend ot an excellent wit, were thofe onely,
Wherew'ith one niight entertain hirafelf inthis encounter; the conftancy  of Ifa¬
belU die merit and love of Juftiniano, raade an overture to the converfation. The
beauty of the place alfo added fomething to the beauty of the Affembly ; for the
more magnificence, and making of the better and raore glorious ffioW of their
Jewells, thofe dayes wherein the woraen decked awd fet forth themfelves all the
wiiuk/vvs were ffiut up,and torches ferved to light the room, which this day Leonora
caufed to be fumptuonfly furni(hed,becaufc the company was to be more than ordi¬
nary. The hangings were of Carnation Velvet, imbroidered all over with tears and
fpangks of gold and filver ; the bed, chairs, and ftools were of the fame ; and in-
{fead\ fa Perfian Carpet, the floor was covered with agreat piece of Gold, Silver,
and Carnation Silk tinfelh This charaber was lighted with thirty Candlefticks,
whereof the one half wereof gilt Vei million fet with Stones, and the others of
ChrilT:all ingraven, and garniffied with gold.    Round about this Chamber huBg
at an equall diftance, great Plates of Gold-fraiths work all fet with precious ftoncs,
and upon a Cabinet of Nacre and Corall, a great vafe of Agate, and two baskets
of Gold ingraven full of artificiall Flowers. There were alfo between thefe Plates
greatniyrrors, with the Piftures of all the Ladies of thecorapany; and the fame
placed in kich fort, as oppofite t&lt;p every myrror hung the Pifture ofa Lady, drawn
in the habit of a Nymph, or a Goddefs.   The beauty and magnificence of^fo many
agreeableobjefts, did without doubt excite fome more than ordinary joy in all
the Affembly ; and in fo charming a place it had been very difficult for one not to
have been wounded with love, which prefents not it felf but in the raiddeft of plea¬

ny u itli whom he had not been already as much in love as was poffible for him to

<p>one to begin fome other difcourfe;   I would never have believed, faid he that be¬
ing at Genoua in the middeft of twenty of the faireft perfons of all /t&lt;i/if,Hhould
be conftrained to fend my raind to Monaco, there to encountei my Milfrefs.   It is
not, continued he, becaufe it is an effeft of ty£mtlia's chatms, or ofthe change of
my humor; but it is becaufe I feeing never a woman here, for whom I-bave not
already been in paffion, I am inforced to conferve that for her ftill. And certainly
if 1 had thought I ffiould have tarried fo long at Genoua, I ffiould have taken a bet¬
ter order for my affairs.    I would have loved Hjpolitaafull moneth, SothrontA
as long, and fo all the reft ; by which rule I ffiould have needed but twelve IVliftref'
fes every year : But in the manner that I have carried ray fclf I ara utterly ruined.
For ray part, faid Leonida with her joviall huraour, I will forget if you will, that
ever you were in love with rae, to the end, you may not give any occafion of fad¬
nefs to our Affembly: and I affure you that if you could refolve to make a new
declaration of love unto me, I ara deceived if you would not love me more the
fecond time than the firft. I have known fince, continued ffic, that I was to indul¬
gent to you ; Iconiracndcd the firft Verfes that you raade for rae; I took too
much care in learning a fong which you gavcrac ; I danced better with you thin
withall others, and I know not any teftimony of eftecra and good will which I
did not render you ; in the racan tirae you quitted rae cruelly, to lovc ffic feverc
Sophronia, whofe coldnefs could not keep you frora ferving her fix days longer than
nic; and Iconfefs that I ffiould not be forry to know for what reafon her rigors
have chaniied you raore, than ray complyanccs and favors; to the end, that if e-
ver we have fuch another adventure, I raay govern my felf therein with addrefs.
But I pray you, added ffie, do not content your felf with telling me, that the fame
thing arrives almoft to all the world, that difficulties and obftacles augment Love,
fince cuftom paffes not fora good reafon with rae, and that all which I can do, is
to follow it only in apparell. It is certain, beautifull If&lt;?w^(*, anfwered the Mar¬
quis, that this matter is a little too delicate to be difputed vrith. you ; but lincc
you have denounced war againft rae, it ffiall not be to offend you that 1 do anfwer
you; bear then, if not a fatisfaftion to your coraplaints, at leaftwife a refolution
to your doubts. I think, if I underftand well that which you marvell at, and that
whichyoucannotcomprchend, itisbut toknow by what reafon rigors and neg-
left do augment love, rather than careffes and favours : but if I deceive not my
felf, it will not be hard for me to demonftrate it unto you. No man is ignorant
but that beauty ingenders love, and fo love is no other thing but a defire to podels
beauty, in fuch fort, that if love bc a defire, it will be fo much the greater, by how
much the thing defired ffiall be difficult in acquiring ; fince being once pofleftjthc
caufe ofthe defire utterly ceafes : wherefore it isnot an improper aftion for Love,
but foiced and neceffary, to be more vive and earneff in rigors than favors, feeing
they excite and entertain it.    But to explain my felf raore cleaily, 1 fay, that de¬
fire cannot be at reft, becaufe at the farae inffantthat it arrives at its end, itcealei
to be defire : So that if love bc a defire, as I have already faid, what ftrong^
proof can one have to ffiow that it ceafes to be love, than to fee it arrived at its
end? But if (fair Leomda) you ffiould not agree that love is a defire,I think atleal''
wife that you will not deny but that it is a fire, fince fo many have told you, tM'
they burned for you, as you cannot be ignorant of this truth.    But it you conlp^
the effefts of it, you will fee that I ara not altogether out of reafon; fire is» ^
nature fo aftivc, as it confuraes allthat oppofes it ; if any thing refifts it, if^'
ftop its paflage, far from the end which we had propounded, that which fcem^
fhould have ferved for oppofition, ferves it for nouriffiment; for in conclufionjhf
is quick and ardent as long as it finds refiftance ; but as foon as it hath vanquilh' &gt;
andthat it hath nothing left to confonie, it confumes it felf^ndccafesablolutty
to befire, when it hath nothing more to vanquiffi.   If it be then true that love is
fire, it is true that it kindles by difficulties; that rigors fcrve to foment it) 2"
when it happens that it hath nothing left to furraouiit, it lofes its being ^r V
fire, and ceaits abfolutely to be love.   Let us not marvell then any longer, if it" '

Marquis, I found my felf fo ill with fuch another adventure at Afow^co, where I
recounted my follies ofGenoua to the Princefs,  as 1 am fully refolved never to fall
into the like again ;  and I ffiould rather chufe to talk to the beautifull fAmdm
whom I did lovc, and ftill doe love whether I will or no, than play the Aftrologer

phrottia of his growing paffion, thought there was po better way to make ffiegenj-
rail cpnverfation ceafe, and bring on a more particular one, than to propound the
Mufick, for the charming of the Marquis his bad humor.   To which effeft then he
told the Count,  that if harmony had at othertimes had the power to appde
the fury of fome J   it might eafily allay the melancholv ofa man that was not
accuftomed to have any, TheMarquis, who could notbe deceived with fuch like
things, prefently perceived Pisr/^f/defign; and to vex him a little hc told hini,tliJt
the remedy which hc propounded unto him could not work but upon the melanclic-

waggiffily caufed the converfation to endure a little longer,he was the firft thatprtft
Leonora to impofe filence on the company by a confort of lutes, which ffie hadmade
them hope for. The Count then arofe, and puffiing open the door ofa Cabinet, k
ordained the Muficians to begin. In the mean time the Marquis, who was willing
to oblige Deria, faid, that the Ladies were firft to be placed, where they mightbdi
hear; thereupon he made a dcmy-circlc of chaires fome four or five paces froniilif
Cabinet door, wherein he placed all the women, and behind every Lady, he feated
a man, playing the Mafter of the ceremonies fo dextroufly, as without any (hew of
affeftation in his choice, hc placed Herat 10 behind Hjpolita, and Doria clofmSt-
phronia, who failed not to muke ufe of fo favourable an occafion :  For after they
had barkened a long time to an excellent confort of Lutes,  with a filence wortbj
of fo charming an harmony, and that he faw how in the affembly each one in pat*
ticular began foftly to commend that which feemed to be the moft agreeable indie
Mufick, he took thcliberty to fay unto Sophronia with a low voice; 1 may not ven¬

attention that I have lent unto them , would not permit me to be an equall judgt
thereof. Doubtlefs the thought which hath diverted you from it,   replyed Soijh

<p>thefe laft words, and turning her felf to Leomda ,   who Luc next heron the righi
hand, for to demand ofher how ffie liked the Mufick ,  it fell out that in going to
avoid one dikourfe of love, ffie interrupted another; For Alphonfo , who began al¬
ready to be in a ftrong paffion for Leonida,  had laboured to fhevv it her with the
raoft addi el - that poflibly he could. But whereas (he was ofa wily huraor,and would
contrary to that of Sophronia, cunningly conceal things which were near her heart,
by feigning to difcover thera ;  in (fead of anfwering to Sophromaes queftion ,   ffie
, (aid unto her fmiling, and pointing to Alphonjo; this Cavalier hath talked (o much
to rae oflove, as I had no leifure to raind the Mufick.  Alphonfo was fomewhat a-
mazed at this difcourfe, but feeing that ffic did not bt hold him , either with cho¬
ler, or contempt, he faid unto her with addrefs ;   there appeared fo much ofit in
your eyes, a.s it would be as difficult for one not to be taken with it, as it would be
impoffiblc for you to bemoan the evills which you are the caufe of   Whilft thefe a-
miable perfons entertained themfelves in this (bit, Horatio v/as not fb happy,   for
whatfoever care he took about it, he could not obtain one favourable look from
Hypolita , whufe jealous humor had made her bekeve that hehad beheld Z/fd&gt;«/(i.^
with too much attention, whether it were that he had obferved Atphonfo,who fpake
foftly unto her, or had without defign caft his eyes that way; but in conclufion all
that (he anfwered to tvhatfoever he could fay unto her ,   was to pray him witha
quipping geer not to be Alphonjoes Rivall,vvho was her brothers fricnd,'for fear left
the (hare which ffie was to have in all his interefts, raight oblige her to break vvith
him. At the farae inftant die confort ceafed , and the Count defired the company
to renew their attention forthe hearing of a Dialogue, fung by two moft excel¬
lent voyces; after which the Marquis, who had fet himfelf down by Leonora, conti¬
nued the converfation ftill for fome time v/irh his ordinary addrefs;   and then all
this (air Troop departed away,   but with different dioughts. PorA« felt hirafelf fo
cafed, for having raadc his firft declaration of lovc to his^Miftrefs,   that he was as
much fatisfied therewith, as ifhe had received a great favour from her. But though
■Sophrorna efteemed very ranch of Dona, though he was ofan illuftrious race, though
he was beloved of her brother-law,   and that according to  apparent reafon fhe
could not make a fitter choife, yet was there a particular one, and that was hidden
to all the worid, but not unknown to her ,   which raade her fear the fequclof this
padioii. For (he was not ignorant that the Count,   albeit he efteemed of Dorta in
particular,  yet bore an   irreconcilable   hatred to the whok family in generall
though in his aftions and words he teftified the clean contrary. It was in this for?
that this beautifull and prudent maid reafoned with her fclf, not doubting but that
Doriaes dikourfe was unfeigned, becaufe ffie was fofficiently perfwaded that he
would not eafily venture to fay foch like things unto her, having alwaies made
piofdlion ofa vertue auftei^c enough.  On the oth?r fide,   Leomda was not  fory

are for the moft part all alike amongft worthy perfons. and whe rcas time prclfe!
me, I will onely give you an accompt of all that hath arrived to me fince, but 14
ffiall be in few words. I ferved her then vvith affiduitie enough, as you might well
obferve; and even to that point as ffie was no longer able to doubt ofit. I perceived
by her lookes, that my perfon did not difplcafe her; that my witandmyhumji.
contented hers, and then when i expefted fome teftimony of affeftiofiforarccom.
pence of my paines, guefs, my dear fifter, what it was that ffic gave me, and the
onely one that I received ? Horatio ftayed a while, in expeftation of Sophroniaet an¬
fwer, who prefently faid untohim laughing, I think, brother, that I cannot with-
out trefpafling againft good manners ffiewmy felf very fpirituall, in gucfling at the
favors which may be done to a Lover ; wherefore it were fitter that you (houldlet
.meknow what this favour was, thanto trouble me to tell it you.  Harkcntomc
more ferioufly, I conjure you, replyed Horatio,   and know that this teftimony cf
affeftion, which I have fo often received from Hypolita , was not the gi vine me oc¬
cafions to fee her, or to fpeak to her in particular; it was not an obliging letter;
it was not a bracelet of her hair; it was not a pifture; it was not affuring me with
her own mouth that ffie did not hate me; but it was telling me, that I did not love
her, and that I loved another. In fine ,  the firft proof which I had ofher affeftion,
was a mark of her choler; and to exprefs my felt more clearly, jealoufie alone hath
ffiewed her love tome.  You cannot receive a more undoubted proof thereof, faid
5tf^&lt;ww interrupting him: Nor a more grievous one too, replyed .Wor^r/o. For
you muft know (continued he) that after  I haddoneanhunclredincivilitiesto
fatisfie her, whereof you have many times demanded the caufe of me, though I ne¬
ver told it you; yet could I not cure her mind ofthis fancy; And ofall the women
of quality ofGenoua, 1 do not know one, that hath fair hair, which ffic hath notbe-
lievcd that I have been in love withall, Leonida onely rcmaines, who at this prefent
fficks in herftomack, and for whom ffic hath ill intreated me to day. Ifit be fo,
iaad Sophronia, you are to take comfort, and bc carefoll to juftifie your felf unio
her; for when her jealoufie ffiall want an objeft, ffie will queftionlefs be conftrayned
to give yoa another mark ofher affeftion. Ah, fifter, replyed Horatio, you anh.
little acquainted with this paffion ! it formes phancafmes, it deceives the fenfe, it
illudesrcafon, and without any ground, or fubjeft, it leaves not to work in thofe
whom it poffeffcth; it makes them to fee that which is not; makes them believe to*
poffible things; and utterly perverts the underftanding. At leaftwife, fofar as Ihavt
obferved it in others, for I have never tryed it otherwaies,  which certainly tiii

tase H7P5/;M heard hira witha great deal ofattention, but for allthat he could
not perfwade her, for with a piecipkous voycc ffic fad unto him; Suppofo that your
indcavours and fervices have been powerfull   enough to obtain my affeftion,   yet
have they not been powerfull enough to conferve it; and thereof I could bring you
a thoufand teftimonks; but whereas they are matters wherein your excufes might
give mc fatisfaftion, and not defiring to receive any from you , I will pot furniffi
you with meanes to doe it; but to convince you, I will onely fay one thing, which
admits no reply, and which all your cunning cannot deftroy.   Have you not feen
me, continued ffic,  receive the civilities of the youngcft ofthe Fregofes, ofthe el¬
deft of the Adornes, and of fome others, without regarding yours ? Have you not
been in fome affemblys where that laft hath alwaies taken me out to dance,  whilft
I have fcarce fo much as turned my look towards you ?   Have I omitted any occa¬
fion of teftifying unto him, when you paft with himbefore my window,   or in all
©ther places where I might have you for a witnefs,   that his love did not difplcafe
rae ? No, Horatio, I have omitted none, and the affeftion which I bore you,  made
me have recourfc to this artifice, hoping I ffiould know, by giving you fome caufe
of jealoufie, the force ofyour palfion; but I have not feen, though you have feen all
thcfc things, that you had any fenfe ofthcra ;  and albeit I knew that by this unto¬
ward experience I ffiould be in danger of lofing you, if you were fenfible, yet chofe
I lather to refolvc upon it, and to affure my felf of your love, thanto conferve you
with a luke-warm and indifferent affeftion. I have ever heard, that jealoufie is the
daughter of lovc, yet do I not fay that lovc cannot be without jealoufie. Queftion¬
lefs you will tell me, that by ray own reafons I am unjuft in complaining of you,
fince it is poffible, that you may have love without having jealoufie. But alas I this
difcourfe hath not fo much as an apparent reafon,  neither can I fuffer my felf to
be perfwaded to that which! defire fo paffionately. And to fficw you that 1 can¬
not  force  ray raind to deceive my felf, hear a thing,  which hath made me to
think upon this matter. I have been perfwaded then, that love alone cannot pro¬
duce jealoulie; and how it is neceffary that jealoufie ffiould have a mother which
may contribute to her birth; this mother, if I be not deceived, is occafion ;  and as
love without her cannot produce  jealoufie, fo ffie without love  canot beget
jcalouiie.   This reafoning feemes fo powerfull to me, as you cannot make any
objeftion which it deftroyes not; for in fine, you may well have lovewithouc
jcalouhe, when as you have no occafion for it; but I having given it you and
you not having taken it, is to fay abfolutely, that  you have had no love 'Ah I

<p>more have you eftabliffied my felicity.   You fay then, amiable Hjpolita (continued
Horatio^ that   there can   be  no   love   without jealoufie, and becaufe Ihave
not been jealous, 1 have had no love ; you ffiall pardon rae if you plcak, if with-
out lofing the refpeft which I ow }ou, I dare take the libertic to contradict: you"
in maintaining with reafon, that the perfcfteft and fincereft reafon is that which
admits of no jealoufie.    It is athing known of all reafonable and dif-intcrefsed
perfonsj that he who loves truly, loves only to love, and not to be beloved, or ro
expeft any recompence ; for that thought is  too bafe and abjeft forfo noble a paf.
fion.  Now if the loveof beauty, which is that whereof we fpeak , fprings from
an objeft that is pleafing to the fight,  it followes, that fb long as this ob¬
jeft  feems   amiable   unto   us ,  fo long will our love continue ;   and whe-
t'ler the  perfon beloved anfwers our affeftion ,   or anfwers it not, this love
fhall be ftill the fame  love.    Butthat I may make ufe of a comparifon as well
as  you, a man fees a fair Lady, and  love arifes in his heart, is it necefsary
for him to examine whether this Lady be ingaged to another in affeftion? it is
certain that it is not; and it is everyday feen that love doth fubjeft us to them
whofe love is ingaged othcrwherc:fo that one may wel judg from thenr:,thataman
ought to perfevere in his love, though fome caufe be given hira of jealoufie, (ince
when he was not beloved, andthathe was induced to love by the only fight of
beauty, he left not to be infinitely amorous.    And if I may be permitted to maie
ufe of Hiftory inthis encounter, what fyrapathy, or what affeftion could that
young Athenian expeft,who becarae fo defperately in lovc with a beautifull Statue,
and whofe paffion was fo extreme, as the like was never heard of? It is very cer¬
tain, that he loved only to love, feeing the objeft of his paffion was abfolutely in¬
capable of any correfpondence. Now then if it bc true, that a Lover is fatislied in
knowing that he loves, hc is raoft affured that jealoufie is not of power enough to
deftroy his lovc, and that this jealoufie is rather an effeft of a defeftive, than ofa
perfeft love.    And to fpeak freely unto you, tell rae, 1 pray you , who can be fo
hardy, after a worthy perfon hath had the goodnefs to receive our fervicesfavoura*
bly, andto teftifie forae affeftion unto us, as to fufpeft ffie (hould have the fame
thoughts for another? kh,fair Hjipolita, thegallantry and civility vvhich you
have ufed to the eldeft of the Adornes, could not oblige mc to draw fo bad a confe¬
quence againft you. And tocomprehendall the reft of ray reafons in one alone,!
am but to fay, that he who by his difcourfe gives fome marks ofhis  jealoulie to
his Miftrefs, names her inconftant, facile, and almoft infamous:  Judge now,fair
Hypolita, whether thefebe words agreeing with a Lady.    In the raean time kis
moft undoubted, that in what tcarms foever jealoufie is exprvffed, it cannot be ex¬
preffed but in this manner: whereas quite contrary,thisconnaence which wehavc
in the perfon beloved, which makes us to approve of all her aftions, is the true
mark of perfeft lovc,  and indeed merits the moft acknowledgement, if I maybe
permittecl tofay fo. 1 havenot fufpefted you then, beautifull Hypolita, of incon¬
ftancy, becaufe 1 have efteemed you very much;  and if I had had as good a place
in your heart, as you have had in mine, you would queftionlefs have done me jo-

And whereas Pflr/'i could not fatisfie himfelf, he came out of his Sifters Cabinet,

<p>I muft confefs, faid Dm&gt;, that I never faw a Love-Letter ofthe ftik of this
farae • and how preffing focvcr it be for you to fend it away to Monaco, I am refol¬
ved not to kt you have it again, till all our frknds have feen it.    The Marquis re¬
fifted it a while, but at length confented thereunto; and in regard the Affera.bly
met not very foon, the Marquis fent not away his Letter till juft the day before
they thought the Princefs would have died : So that when La Ra'che was arrived at
Monaco, and entred into the Caftle, he was much amazed to fee them all in tears.
And whereas in this occafion the Officers had no care of any thing, he went even
tothe Princeffes chamber without any impediment; where hc faw Juftiniano, hc
notfecing hira, for grief fo abfolutely poffeffed him, as he was incapable ofall
knowledge, but of that of his own raisfortune.    He could not incUire the fight of
the Princefs, neither could hc alfo keep frora her, fothat hc was in a continuall a-
gitation.    In the mean tirae the Phyficians defiring to do their uttermoft endea¬
vour, ftill carefully obferve the eftate ffie i$ in, they confult with their books, and
info defperate a difeafe they refolvc to have recourl'e unto extreme remedies; fa
that abandoning ordinary Phyfick, one amongft them, who was an excellent Empi-
rick, raade her take fo wonderfull an effence, that after it had caufed her to fleep
eight hours, it reftified the blood,' diminiffied her Fever, reftored her ftrength, and
put her quite out of danger.   The indifferency ffic had ffiewed at the approaches
of death, fcemed the fame,whcn as the Phyficians affured her that ffie ffiould not die
of thislkkncfa; and ffie gave them greater thanks for their affeftion to her, than
for their faving her life. Howbeit they were not without thank? for this refurre-
tT:ion; for J«y?/«&lt;&lt;«»o received fo great a fatisfaftion from it, as he could not give
thera thanks enough of his acknowledgement. His joy neverthelefs was mingled
vvith a great deal of bitternefs, and his foul was not in an eftate of rafting a quiet
plcaliiic.    This while L-&lt;i?(7c*f, whom the Marquis had fent, hearing that the
PiMiceis wasoutof danqer, went to J«/««m«»'s lodging, for to rcndcT him the ci¬
vilities of his friends, and to affure him that they knew nothi'.g of his aftliftion.
Jujliniano received hira with raore coldnefs, thanhisfriendfhip to them feemed to
</p>
<p>Ecmiit; but the difplcafure wherein he was, difpenccd vn ith him from being regu-
irinhi^complenients; he willed/4 ^of^^ for all that to render his bacl^ tmto all
them from whora h» had received any, and to pray them not to diink it ftrange if
hc returned not to Genoua before the Princefs were fully recovered. That donc&gt;'

<p>JEmilias Letter to the Marquis.
</p>
<p>IT vould be too much vanity in me to pretend unto the obtaining of that from m
which fo great a ttumber of fair perfons could not oblige you to render unto them, dl
not believe then that I regardyou as a conqueft, which I may never lofe, bnt ctntrxtd)
I am refolved to do in this occafion, as great Captains ufe to do, who, after they !uve tA-
ken a place which they thinks they cannot hold, fet tt on fire, and deflroy it themfelves, ts
get fome advantage fiill by this lofs. And whereas there was never place fo hard to k
kept, as your heart, I purpofe, in order to that you have written me, to bring new pmts
unto it, rather than to refolve to lofe you altogether: There will he (hort ly at Genoua 4
fair ktnfwoman of mine, whom I conjure you to love, when at you jhall no longer judfe mi
■worthy of that honor, to theend that in loftngy-fur love, I may at leaftwife comfort mj
felf with your fight, with your converfation, and with your frteidjhip.
</p>
<p>.Emilia.
</p>
<p>This Letter being fealed, ffie gave to la Roche, who prefently departed for to re¬
turn unto G(f«o»/f, without fpeaking to thePrincefs; for ever fince ffie was out
of danger, the Phyficians had abfolutely forbidden any one from talking to her,
no not fo much as Juftiniano, who /aw himfelf very foon kept from it by a ftronger
reafon. For whether he had been too long without eating or fleeping, or diat
grief alone had been the caufe of his indifpofition, hc found hirafelf within a
fhort time, in a ficknefs as defperate as that of the Princefs, who not feeing hira a-
bout her, was very inquifitivc to know where he was. The Phyficians and c/fwi-
lia, who feared ffie would afflift her felf too much if ffie knew the truth , told her,
that J«/?/«/Ww having feen her quite out of danger, and being preft by an impor¬
tant affair which had befallen him at Getoua, was gone thither with an intent to
have returned back again before ffie ffiould have taken notice of his departure,
But when they faw Juftiniano's ficknefs grow dangerous, and that the Princefs
was as much troubled with hearing no news of him, as ffie could have been if
ffic had known the condition wherein hc was, they conceived it was fit, fearing
the fad event of Juftiniano's malady, to acijuaint her with that which they had con¬
cealed from her,    fy£milia was ffie that charged her felf with this heavy Commif*
fion, ffie carried the matter fo dextroufly, as ffie ingaged the Princefs to fpeak of
Jufttniano, and to marvell at his unexpefted abfence, and fo unthought-of a filence.
It would not bc hard for me, anfwcrcd Emilia, with a fad countenance, totake
you out of this unquietnefs,   if I di(i not fear to give you another greater than
that.    Whereupon the Princefs, leaning with her right arm on the piflow, anj
with her left hand alfo drawing the curtain, fixed her look  on «Amilia,m
after ffie  had been a pretty while without fpeaking , as it were to divine
of that which fhe   ffiould  be acquainted   with, ffic faid unto her in fuch»
faffiion,  as ffiewed that ffie would bee obeyed ;   difguife  not the truth unto
me,  let  me know  my   niiferie as   great  as  it  is ,    and tell mc whether
Juflmiano be dead or unfaithfull;   for provided he be neither the one nor the
other, I ftiall receive all other misfortunes with a great deal of indiffcrencifc
The laft cannot be, anfwcrcd ^y£milia,  and heaven will not permit that the other
ffiould arrive unto you.   But not to difguife the truth unto you , Juftmano neve

<p>ting you with his, hath kept us from telling it to you; but finding it to continu^
longer than we thought it would,! held it ray dutv to advertife you ofit.  You ar^
a cruell creature, replyed the Princefs, to conceal a diing from me,   which con¬
cernes my life. And what will Juftiniano lay ofthe little care 1 had ofhim ? h is by
his order, anfwered i/fmilia,  that we have caried the bufinefs in this fort.    Ifyou
will have me pardon you this fault, faid the Princefs, fo order the matter, that
Juftiniano may not be furprifed when he ffiall fee mc.   t/^milta did what fhe could
then to keep her from getting out ofher bed, but neither her intreatics,   nor the
counfeU ofthe Phyficians, could alter her refolution. She calls her women, gets on
a night-gown, ancl caufing her felf to be held up by the armes, ffic goes to Juftini-
«of; lodging, whom ffie found fo changed, as he could hardly be known.   Affoon as
he faw her enter he indeavoured to falute her, but being unable to lift up his head,
he was conftrained tobe contented onely with turning his eys towards her,aHd fay¬
ing to her with a feeble andjlanguifting voice,vvhich could not be heard by any but
her lelf, for her women were a pretty way diftant from thcni; At length , Madara,
fortune ffiall not feparate us, and death is going to doe that, which I expefted from
the cruelty ofthe forraer: Neverthelefs 1 fhall die contentedly, fince I have ftill the
pleafure to fee you, provided you will proraife to live for the love of rae, and that
ray raeraory ffiall be dear unto you; For I find this advantage in death, that it keeps
me frora being unfaithfull to you;It finiffies the combat oflove &amp; honorwhich could
not be vanquifhed in ray foul; it raakcs nie fatisfie thera both; and to fay all, it fepa-
rates us, but I do not forfake you;and I doe nothing in this occafion,but what I can¬
not chufc b'lt doiThe Princefs having her chcekes all bedewed with tears, anfwered
him fighing,! am not yctfo ftr from the grave,butthat Imay enter into it with yoUfl
if death fhould carry you thither ;   but ifyou doe love me, you will ftrive to live.
Think not ofconferving your felf,fince you have no will to it,but ofconferving me,
and believe not that you can die without mc.    I shave kt you fee what grief
can do upon me; and I ffic uld have no need,     either of poifon,orpoignard,to
quit me of this life, for the lofs of you alone woidd fuffice for it.   Think not for
all thiii that I fpeak to you thus out ofthe fear to dk, it is an apprchenfion which
IS not my foul, and I doe not find death drcadfull but in the perfon beloved ; let me
not make tryall then offo ffiarp a grief;   live,  if k be poffible, and contribute at
Icaff what you can unto it.    I will indeed obey you , replyed &gt;/,&gt;;/W but take
heed you do not thereby deprive me ofa remedy which I ffiall not eafily meet
with again.     As he would havefrocceded, onecameand advertifed thePrincefs
that Pjn^ having underftood ()f his Friends fiknefs, was arived at the Caftle, and
defired to fee him The Phyficians then approched to Jufttnianoes bed fide, and told
the Princefs, that If foe loved his life, ftie was to let him reft fo quiet, and fuffer

ceffity of dying, and of the little laftingnefs of the moft affured pleafures.   Thev
could not mervail enough, that after fo long an abfence; after the efcaping fromfo
many misfortunes; after the drying up offo many teares; and when it feemcd that
nothing could oppofe J«/'«/&lt;?w(?fj and If.tbellaes content, they ffiould find them-
felves more unhappy than before: they knew not for all that how far their unhappj.
nefs extended, for their fecret misfortunes were without doubt the greateftand
moft fenfible. And when as Juflinianoes ficknefs wac no longer dangerous, andthat
he had recovered hisjftrcngth, then it was that he was the moft afflifted. For com-
ing to confider the little time he had remaining to  make good hij word whichhe
had given Soliman; and that he  was to quit Ifabella, his grief became fo great, as
had not his foul been already long accuftometi to melancholy, he could not with'
out dyirighavc fupported fo grievous an apprchenfion. But a little while after he
had begun to goe out ofhis chamber,for to repair to that ofthe Princefs, beingftill
very feeble and languiffiing, hc faid unto her withagrcat dcalofpain;Now, Ma.
dara,  is the time wherein you are to difpofe of me,and to let meknow, whedier
I am to be wanting, cither to my love, or to my honor; live with infamy, ordic
with glory; fatisfie Soltman, or oblige hira by the breaking ofmy word to ruine
ROt onely allthe Chriftians that are inhis Erapire, not onely all Europe, butyott
too, who is raore dear to niethan all the world bcfide. I think. Madam, Ihaveal-
ready told your exccllencic, what \ ought to doc in fuch a grievous cafe, ad-
vife thenwhatyou will have me to doe; But 1 befeech you,  make me no more
fuch   propofitions, as an excefs of gencrofitic would render unjuft; hearken to
nothing but reafon inthis incounter; do not follow that which your alFeftion
infpires you with; and remerabcr how I ought not to do any thing that is unwor¬
thy of the honor which I have to be beloved ofyou. Ihave told you already,re-
plyed the Princefs, what power I have over my fclf in this occafion; and my pro¬
pofition feemes fo juft unto me,  as I can find nothing that can deftroy it; Forio
fine, you will fatisfie Soliman, and you will fatisfie mc alfo; I will doc nothinga-
gainft ray honor, and I will fatisfie that which I ow to our affeftion: Refolvc tb
to raary nie and to part away,   and   never hope that I will change my deiign.
When you were at Cenftantinople, did you believe that I had fo little affeftion, las
I could eafily refolve to receive a vifit frora you, for to be deprived aftcrwardiof
your fight, it raay be for as long as live ? Ah / Madam, faid juftiniano interrupting
her, I had no other intent in parting from Confrantinople, than that of feeing you,
and of coming hither time enough to keep you from ffiuttingyourfelfupina
Cloifter. For underftanding the refolution you  had taken for it, upon the belief
you were in of my death, nothing could have been able to retain nic. What, faiJ
I, the incomparable IfabeUa ffiall make her felf an eternall prifoner for thee, andit
fortune ever reftores thee thy liberty, thou ffialt find her without hers! Ah! nOjnO)
rather doe any thing  to hinder it. It was in thisfort. Madam, that 1 reafoned
with my fclf; and that,togcther with the hope of feeing you, raade me, withouirt"
amining the raatter, take my refolution.  And I believe! have acconiplilhedtbit
which I propoundetl to my felf;  I have feen you,   Madam ,  and having let^*i
know that I am living, it is no longer in your power to difpofe of your felf, feeing
your word keepes you from it;   And for me, I proraife you if I cannot break my
chaines at Cenftantinople, the newes ofmy death fhall foon fet you at liberty:  fo^

<p>ftore hn- to her health; That whereas he was refolved to perform this pilgrimage
unknown,and that this voyage could not be but long, he conjured him to take care
ofthe Princefs and her affairs in his abfence;   That in the mean time he ffiould not
fpeak ofthis defign, till he was gone;   and that then he (hould deliver his com-
t.k'ments to all hisFriends.   He told hira moreover that he was obliged to fteal a-
way from the Princefs,   who would not have him make this voyage without her;
but beine loth (he ffiould be expofed to the incomraoditles offo painfull a pilgri¬
mage, he had concluded to part without faying any thing to her, but onely leaving
her a letter. Dona was ftrangely furprifed with this difcou rfe; but feeing that Jufti-
matio fpoke ferioufly, he offeied( how araorous foever hewas of Sophronia ) to ac¬
company hira in this voyage ;   and the conteftation which they had upon this fub-
iec^ had not ended fofoon, had not Juftiniano told hira thatthe neccffity ofhis af-
fai I cs required it to bcfo; and that to render him a proof of his affeftion it would
foffice he (hould fuinilh him with raeanes to get from Monaco fecretly.  That will
not be hard for you to do, anfwered Doria, for yefterday,when 1 arrived at the Port,
Iheard by chance ofa French barque, that is hound for Venice, which parts away
to morrow morning by the break of day, and no doubt will receive you, affoon as
you (hall prefent your (elf; fo that you ffiall have no raore to doe,   but to get abord
her, and i will ftay here to deliver your letter to the Princefs. You will be but un¬
welcome to her for it, replyed Juftiniano ,   who was not willing thac Dona ffiould
be prefent at Ifabellaes receiving of a newes , which would fo much afflift her,  for
fear left the conftraint (he would be in, ffiould raore augment her grief.  He prayed
him then not to fee her, till hehad her permilfion for it. And whereas he deman¬
ded ofhim, who ffiould wait on him in this voyage ? Juftiniano anfwered him, that
one ofthe conditions ofhis vow was, to goe alone and unknown.   Dona oppofed
this as much as pollibly he could ,  but vain was it for him to give any counfell to
his Friend; andj Hiliniano,taWm^ a part of the money which he had at Monaco, de¬

led that fervant, which he had ftayed to wait on him, and willed hira to deliver it
the Princefs three hours after his departure.    And when this man demanded of
him whether he would not go to bed, Juftiniano made a fign to him to be gone,
feigning as though hc had fomewhat els to write ; but it was indeed becaufe his
grief was fo great, as not being able to fleep, he thought that the agitation ofhis
body would eafe that of his mind.    He paft the reft of the  night in walking up

he refented.    Hc oftentimes opened the window to fee whether it were day; and
though his greateft raisfortune was to part from Monaco, yet one would havefaid,
that he was impatient to be gone from thence; fo much was his foul troubled,aiii
fo much was his reafon confounded.    In the raean ti:ne Doria, who had not (lept

He would yet have diffwaded him from this voyage, and once more defired him
to let him accompany hini,but Jufttniano would by no means accept of fo obliging
an offer; fo that Dorm feeing his friends refolution, was conftrained to followhis
pleafure.    And whereas theffiadows of the night were almoft quite difperfed by
the approach ofthe Sun, Doria went and treated with  the Mafter of the Frtuh
Barque for Juftiniano'^ paffage,who followed him to the Port, his face covered wiib
his cloak.   The Guards of the Town and Caftle, who faw him go forffifoearlj,
marvelled not at it, for during the little time wherein he had been well at Mmio,
he had ufed to walk out at fuch hours to entertain his thoughts at the Sea-fide. The
feparation of thefe two friends had been with more tcndernefs, if Jufttniano bad
been lefs afflifted; but love fo ftrongly poffeffed bis heart, as there was no more
room left there for friendffiip: fo that when he came to imbrace Doria, all that be
could fay tohim, was to conjure him to have a care of the Princefs.   He would
fain have difclofed the truth unto him, but/y^^f//4 having forbidden hiniluw
do, he durft not difobey her.   He got aboard then being fcarce able to fpeak, and
fuffering himfelfto bcclifpofed of by them that receiveil him, he abandoned him¬
felf not fo much to the Sea, as to his grief   The Pilot having order given him to
part, ftcered his courfc for r^wc-f, and Juftiniano ftanding up beheld Monaca,'^\^
his arms acrofe, and his eys full of tears, never marking Dorta, who ftill niadeligns

<p>fefs. Madam, when I knew that his voyage was abfolutely neceffary, feeing hc had
promifed it, and that he did not fteal away from you but to keep you from follow¬
ing him , I found that hc had reafon for it, and I ferved hira in his defign; Yet was
it not till I had firft offered to accorapany him, with allthe tcftimonies of affeftion
I could render him; and I hid added force to intrcaty, had hc not affured methat
he ffiould not acconipliffi his vow, if hc went not alone and unknown.    But is it
poffible that he is gone, faid the Princefs ? difguife not the truth unto nic, is he not
concealed in fome place, totake order for his affairs? No, Madam, anfwered D,;.
rta, for he hath given me the charge ofthcra. If that befo,   faid thePrincefs, who
wotdd fain have been at 1 iberty to ffied teares, I hold it fit that you ffiould goe and
publilhatCfTw^.i the true caufe ofhis abfenfe, for fear left fo unexpefted a depar¬

fore you go, tell me I pray you, whether Juftiniano were afflifted indeed to quit me?
whether he faid any thing to you to tell me ? and what were his laft words ? They
were all for you, replyed Dona; for after he had imbraced me, all that he could ob¬
tain ofhis grief was no other than force enough to injoyn rae to take care of you;
fo that Madam, you may difpofe of me as you pleafe , and believe that never any
cloignment begot fo great anaffliftion,as that which I faw in Juftiniano: And knew
1 not that he loves you more ardently,than ever perfon did love, I ffiould hardly be¬
lieve that abfence alone could caufe fo great a difplcafure in his foul.  The Princefs
felt her felf then fo preffed with grief, as it was impoffible for her to retain her
teare.s, and feeing that ffic could not hide them from Doria,ihe faid untohim wiping
her eyes; You may not think it ftrangc, that I am not more conftant than y»/?/w,«,
fince 1 am as unhappy as he; and that I yeeld not to hira in affeftion.This weaknefs
juftifics his, faid Doria, and I profefs he were unworthy of the honor which you do
him, ifhe did not refent, ashc doth,   an abfence that feparates him from the onely
perfon which can make hira happy .The princefs and Doria had forae more fuch like
difcourfes, but at laft ffic prayed hira once again to return with all fpeed to Cww;
and for that effeft ffie coramanded a Veffell ffiould be made ready to part away pre¬
fently after dinner. The thing was executed accordingly, Doria departed from her,
and by her direftion carried back with hira a part of Jufttniano''s train, the Princefs
retaining the other in her fervice till the return of their Mafter. The next day V'-
ria arrived at Genoua, where he delivered the departure of Juftintana to all his ac¬
quaintance. Every one received this luwes with mervail,but amongft others &gt; ibf
Count, jllphonfo, the Marquis, and all the reft ofhis Friends,   were not ct)ntciwd
with merveling, they were extremely afflifted at it.   And being all met togctherat

that fatisfied. They found fomthing that was ftrangc inthis voyage ; and condcm*

<p>Hat wc may not aggravate the grief of Juftiniano, fince it is not the laft
that hc is to endure, let us land him at Venice, without defcribing his
unquietncf!,his forrows, and his tranfports. As foon as hc was arrived
thcrc,he had no other defign but of thinking of his departure from
thence: And whereas there was a great commerce from Venice to all the
Hands of the Archi-pelago, &amp; to Cenftantinople it felf, it was not long before he met
with a ffiip that was ready to fet fayl for the Ifle of Chio, fo that it was not hard for
him to get paffage in her upon pretext of forae iraportant affairs, which hc faid
he had with certain Jew/JI? Merchants of Pera. He irabarqued hirafelf then with¬
out beinc' known, and too profperous in his Navigation, by reafon of his cloign¬
ment frora Ifabella, he arrived at this Hand; where he was not long before he
foundaVefiellthat was bound for jP^r^, and ffiipping hirafelf in her, he left the
He of Mtttlene on the right hand, and on the left that of Lemnos, now called Stali-
ntena.    From thence he entred into the Strcight of Cj^/Z/^o//, where ftand the two
Caftlcs of Seftos and Abydus, which the Turki name the Dardamlli, and fo came to
the Profantis , calkd Marmora, where he entred into the Bofphorus of Thrace, and
arrived at Pera, where he would not go on land till it was night, becaufe of the
habit which he wore. As foon then as he came thither, he went to the Chriftian
Religious men that lived there,who were infinitely glad to fee him again, for he
wasa mighty fupport unto thera. After their firft conipleraents, they told him
that his abfence had occafioned forae raifchiefi in the Ottoman Family; but though
he preffed thcni much to exprefs therafclvcs more clearly, they would not do it,
knowing hill well the extreme affeftion which Jufliniano had always born to Muf¬
tapha, and tht e^cntv ous danger. And then a^ain Juftiniano had his mind fo filled
with his own misfortunes, asheinfifted not much upon thofe of others.    From
thence he lent fecretly to an Italian Slave, whora he had left at horac , to bring
him a Turkifh Uahh: Which was done accordingly, and the next day in the even¬
ing hc entred into Conftant mople, but fo altered from that which he was wont to be,
ashc was hardly to be known.   As foon ashc was at his Palace, and that he had
received the complements ofall his Officers, of whora hc was exceedingly beloved,
hcwcnt tothe .9^r^^//o, although it was not the cuftom to enter there at foch
like hours: but Jufttniano, whom henceforward we call Ibrahim , reraembrcd his
old privileges ftill.   ThzCapigis, which kept the gate, repulfed him fomewhat
rudely,but as foon as they heard his voice, they craved pardon of him, and a Capi-

Baffa was not fo (oon come to his ear ,    as approching to this blcffed Meffcnp^'
which brought him fo pleafing a newes, he demanded of him, if it were u-
that hc was returned,   why he did not come in as he was wont to doc   with'
out   advertifing   him   ofit? This demand   was a commandment  to the C ^
pigibajft, who prefently caufed/^r^/j/'w to enter.    Affoon as he appeared Soltmi
charged everyone to withdraw, fo that feeing himfelf at liberty, he inibraccdhim
with fo much tendernefs, that though his mind was wholly taken up with love and
his miferies, yet found he himfelf fenfible offo great an amity. Is it poUiblc   fajj
Soliman untohim,  that I ffiould receive this confolation in my misfortune? but
am I not to blame, continued he, to doubt that thou couldft not be generous e-
nough to come back again ? This doubt would queftionlefs bc an injurie, replyed
Ibrahim, had it not proceeded from the impatience of ray return, rather than from
a diftrurt ofthe promife I had raade to thy Highnefs. It is not without reafon, fiid
Soliman  interrupting hini',  that thou thinkeft I have defired it, for affoon as thou
hadft abandoned rae, viftory, fortune, and vertu^abandoned rae to.   I became at
once, both the moft infortunate,   andthe raoft faulty of all raen; and by the malice
of another I loft all that thy friendffiip had acquired rae. I am no raore the Solimn,
whora thou thoughteft worthy of thy efteem, and to let thee know the deplorable
eftate wherein thou findeft me, I have no more to fay to thcc,but that thou (halt never
underftand from my mouth the milhaps that have befallen rat, or to fay better, tbe
crimes which I have comraitted. However! will impart unto thcc,   that all dijt
which my armes had conquered in Perfia, by thy valor andconduft, is revolted)
that Affyria and Mefopotamia are no longer under my power ;   that Ulama having
been wounded, his Troops have been defeated; that my whole army hath beenrou-
ted; that Tauris is loft; and that there is no more left rae of all thy conquefts, than
thebarercraerabranccofthv viftories. But, ah, how happy ffiould Ibc,  if Ihad
alfo loft the nioity of mine Empire, and hadnot made ray fclf unworthy of reign¬
ing over the other ! 5^Aw^» ftayed he re to fetch a great figh; and when as Imim
would have anfwered him, he would not fuffer it, but conjured hira nottofpeak
at all to hira, fave onely to proraife that he would never hate him ,   whatfocvcrfe
underftood ofhis violences. Ibrahim was fo furprifed to hear Soltman fpeak in diis
fort, as he fcarce knew what to anfwer him. For whereas he had not reflefted niudi
on that which the Religious men of Pera had told hira,  imagining it bi
been fome diffenfion-,   which the artifices of Roxelana had  fown in die Of-
toman family ,    and none of his Officers having dared  to acquaint himwitli
that which had paft,   hc could not conceive how Soliman ffiould bcfo huhf.
He  an( wercd him then, that he would give his own eyes the lye, even when they
ffiould report unto him that he had committed a crime; that he was too well alTu'
red ofhis juft ce and vertue to doubt of it;  that great Princes raight fometira«
appear culpable to the eyes of their fubjefts,   and yet be innocent in their own
foules; and that   in fine, hc gave him the fame word,which he had fo exaftly obfer¬
ved, that he would alwaies have the farae thoughts for hira, as hc had formerly bad.
He befought him withall not to conceal his   misfortunes frora hira; but ^&lt;'/'»*'
halfcorafortcd with the promife he madehim,   defired him not to prefs him W
it, and further obliged him by oath, not to fpeak of his crimes whenhedioP
come to know thein;  and fhould onely believe that Roxelana was the caufeoti"
his difafters. Ibrahim, feeing how fenfibly  Soliman was touched, and perceiving
V. cli by his teares that this ffiould be forae lamentable adventure, durft not fpeal^}^
hira more ofit; and though  he had refolved to caft himfelf at his feet, wbenu™
he came before him, to demand his libcrtie of hira, hoping he  had thenw^"

1 have told yol heretofore, I know this Hiftory very well. For befides the prin¬
cipall things, whichnoraanis ignorant of, I am privy to fome particularities,
that are not known to allthe World, and that by the informationof a Slave,
who wa^ Fa.x-elanaes favouriteduring that time, but was afterwards turned out ot
the Seraglio by her herfelf, in a phantafticall humour, which makes her that ttjc
never loves any one thing long , and hath ever fince lived with me. You ffiall
hear then that which you defire to know,aiid vvhich I have learned from this Slave,
and fome others who were well acquainted therewith : But in regard you have
time enough to fpare, I will intermix the Hiftory of her Father, which will not
beunufefull forthe intelligence of hers. Axiamira confenting to it caufed Fe¬
lixana to fit down by her, and Halima began to fpeak in thefe terms.
</p>
<p>Ihe Hiftory of Bajazet dnd Roxelana.
</p>
<p>THey which know the biith, breeding, and firft inclinations of Roxelana, cin^^
not marvail at the laft things which ffie hath done ;  but contrarily they
would have reafon to find it ftrange, if ffic had not undertaken any thing to fa¬
tisfie her ambition, which is the onely paffion that reigns in her foul, and for
which ffie fctsall thereft on work; never making ufe of lovc,hatred, envy,and
jcaloufie, but to fatisfie that.   Now to ffiew you that ffie hath drawn this inclina¬
tion from her Father, who brought, her up, and confirmed her in the opinion,
that greatnefs was the foveraign good of this life; and that to attain unto it,
vertue and honor were to be defpifed.    You arc to know, that In times paft Roxe-
i/»&gt;»4« Father was in reafonable good favour with the Emperor Selini, Father to
Soliman; and that after the death of Selim, Soliman alfo had agreat care of his
fortune: And certainly he had rendred hira oneof the inoft confiderable ofthis
Empire, had he had as much fidelity for his Mafter, as he had addrefs for to pleafe
him, cunning to conferve hirafelf^ and diffimulation tocoilccal his vices from a
Prince vvho never had any, and who was never carried to any violence, but by
that of lovc.    But withall it rauft be acknowledged, that this paffion hath often
pcrvcrtedall his inclinations;   or at leaftwife hath forced him to do things quite
contrary  to the fenfe of hisfoill, when as it is peaceable.    But to come again
to Bajazet (fo was the Father of Roxelana called) after he had by an hundred ar¬
tifices, which would bc too long to recite, arrived at that height about Soliman,
which 1 have told you;  and that there was not any charge whereunto he might
not have raifed his hopes: It hapned for his ill fortune, that Soliman fenthini
to cany his direftions to Scutary, y\here the Beglierbei of NatoUa, who was
there at that time, coramkted to his conduft the faireft Slare th*t ever was fccn,

receive her into his Seragli9.    Bajaz,et accepted of this iriiployrtlent with lo?
without any other defign at that time, than to do athing v?hi?h he'thought would
notbe difagrceable to Soliman, who was then in the prime flovfrct* of his age   and
one of the goodlieft Princes of the World.    But vyneri the day of his departure
was come, and that the Beglierbei- of Natolia^ had put the Slave into his hinds
who, afccording tb the cuftom of thofe which are to be prefented to the grand Sie-'
nior, was moft gorgeoufly fet forth, he was fo miglitily taken with the fparkling
ofher eys, as if the Beglierbei, who was named Amurath, had nottdliiscarriaet he
might wel have known that he vvas too fenfible ofthe attrafts of beauty,to be made
the conduftor of a flave,that was able to fubjeft the whole world; for a's 1 have heard
fay,ffie wras as fair as Roxelana,vihoml have foraerimes feen on the terrace ofthe 5f-

celebrated.But certes it niuft be acknowledged, that Soltman is excufabk forlovin?
hcr,maugre her artifices,for indeed ffie is the greateft beauty that imagination it felf
is able to conceive.    This Slave, of whom I fpeak, being then as fair asl defcribe
her to yoii, and being remitted unto the conduft of Baja-tet for fo long a journey
he became fo defperately in love with her, as notwithftanding the refpeft whidi
he owed to Soliman, and without fear of the chaftifements ofan offended Prince,
he refolved to poffefs her, and not to render her unto him; howbeit he refifted fo
dangerous a temptation for fome time; but hi s wit^ that was but too fertile in in¬
ventions, having forniffied himfelf with one, which he believed was good enough
to make his defign feicceed without danger, hc thought of nothing els but of ex¬
ecuting it;  and behold the way which hc took to bring hirafelf to it.   This Slave
deftined to the grand Signior, had been fold to Amurath, the Beglierbeiof Nidtk,
a little before 54i&lt;?x.ff's arrivall, by ccitain Pirats, who not fo much as knew of
whence ffie was, though by her pronunciation- it was gathered that ffie was! of
Perfia: but whereas her language was not underftood of any one, and that it ap¬
peared alfo how ffie underftood nothing that was faid to her, he judged that (lie
Knew not they were carrying her to the grand Signior. So that ufing her with a
great deal of kindnefs during all the voyage, andteftyfying much affeftion unto
her, ffie feemed to be comforted in her mifery, at leaftwife ffie ffiewed a more aiiid
countenance. He took exceeding care then, that ffie raight not underftand by (ignsj
that vvhich ffie could not undcri^and otherways;and whereas he had been fent u^it
a fecret exped'ition,he was but little accompanied, which ferved very much coolfcf
the furthering of his defign.    When as they approached to ConftantiuopUjhe took
his nieafores fo right, that arriving too late, he fectned to be conftrained to lie at
.in houfe that he had fome four or five miles from the City, where out of jealoulie
he ha:dcaufed a young woman to be kept, whom he had exceedingly loved; i«t
indeed his intent was, not to enter into Coftftantinople, for a fecret reafon wMetH
.ini g&lt;!)ing to acqi&gt;aint you with.    He arrived then at this Countrcy-houfe, where¬
in nohe lived but that woman, an old Eunuch that looked to her, and two fli'"
that waited on her, alibis retinue being at his houfe in CanftantiMple, whereaceor'

their fidelity to me in other countries;   and for thofe which are come with nic
from Mat olia, they cannot fo much as fufpeft that you arc not the Slave whom thev
have accompanied. For you are not ignorant, that affoon as one is deftined to the
grand Signior, ffie is treated with&gt;ahigh refpeft, and hath a veil caft over her face
which fhe never takes off but when ffic is alone 5 fo that according to this order'
they will not wonder to fee you goe out in the fame fort; and  whereas I purpofe
to have you wear the fame  habk   which &gt;^w»r/ir/» gave to that Slave,  they will
doubtlefs take you for her. And for language, you need not but feem as though you

thisSlavcs is.lt was in this faffiion thatBaiaz^t made an end of confirming ./^//«/4
in the hope of her good fortune. And to fay truth,   it muft be acknowledged that
thisdefignwas not ill imagined; for he was vcrv fure that vf//co/4 was not known
at all to the great men ofthe Port, fo that ifit fhould happen that ajiy oncofthem
ffiould be prefent with Soltman, when he ffiould prefent her unto him, that would
not difcover him: Neither was he ignorant,  that thofe which give Slaves to the
grand Signior, never fee them again after they arc once entred into the Seraglio,
fothat if Amurath ffiould chance to return unto Cenftantinople within eight daies
after, he could not find out the  truth;  fince the grand Signior thankinghim
for his fair Slave, would not defcribe her untohim. But hear the fuccefs of thii ad¬
venture; The refolution which I have told you of, being taken, 5/ij4-wfcallcshis
old Eunuch; recommends fidelity and filence unto him ;  and after he had charged
him  never to fpeak ofthe change which he was going to fee, he bids him prefent
Alicoles richeft habit to the fair Slave, with all her jcwells, thereby to oblige lier
to part with that which ffie had brought from Natalia,  giving her to undcrftard
by figncs,   that Ba]az,etwould pray her towear that which he then gave her die
next day. The matter was executed as hc defired ,   the Eunuch pcrformeshiscoDi-
million; and as foon as the day begins to break, Altcola attired herfelf with care
in the fair Slaves roab,  forgot nothing ofwhat ffic thought would be advantagi¬
ous to her;and covering her face with a very thick vaH,vvhich reached down toher
waft, ffie fjffred not her felf to bc fccn again, till ffie carae before the grand Sig¬
nior. In the mean time Bajaz,et, before he parted, goes to the fair Slaves chamber,
labours to make her undcrftand, that he will fee her again ffiortly,  and that inthe
mean fpace, ffie may command all things there:   He calls the Slaves whichfened
Alicola, charges them to have the farae care of the perfon whom he leaves in their
hands, as they had had of her whom he carries away,  and never to difcover thtf
which they had feen. He adds promifes of recompence to his command, and threat-
nings of puniffimcnt, if they were fo inconfiderate as to reveal the fecret whcrewiiii
they were truftcd. After this he caufcth Alicola to mount into his chariot, where
for the more refpeft hc leaves her alone, and followes her on horfeback, accomju*
nied by thofe which had made the voyage ofKatoUa with him, who never perceived
but that it was the Salve,  for as I have already declared,  feeing her ofthe fame

K indeavoursmuch to focounter his eyes; and whereas ffiehad an haughty and

Slave. But behold here, great Princefs, the caprichioufoefs of fortune,  ^ho mock-
ins at our prudence, raakcs it oftentiraes ferve for our ruine.    At ^f &gt; ™r^.*?.^7
liman hath alwaies been very civill,   efpccially with women,   he t&gt;cheld^/'r./^
with an attention that gave her hope ofthe viftory: and whereas ffie underffood all
that 5*//&gt;»4«faid, although ffie made ffiew that ffie tmderftood not the langiiage ,
ftie was raviffied to hear Soliman teftifie that he was much obliged to the Beg^erbet
of Natalia, for having tendred hira a prefent of that importance.     And when as
this Prince gave over fpeaking, to confider her the better,   ffie imagined that tfos
filence was already an effeft oflove.Sothat glorious ofthis conqueft, and notable
to retain all her joy in her heart, ffie could not forbear looking on Bajaz&gt;et,as it were
to tell him that her viftory was affured.    This hope proved forall that but ill
grounded, for though Alicola was fair, though ffie was very young,  and that Soli^
man was fo too, this Prince, which could never be vanquifficd, either in war, or in
fovc, but onely by gcntlenefs, felt not hirafelf fenfible of Alicolaes attrafts. He con¬
fiders her, demands out ofwhat country ffic carae into the hands of Amurath, com¬
mends her beauty, profeffeth that few defefts cotdd bc found in it, but at length for
conclufion, he tells Ba}az,et, that ftoutnefs did never pleafe hira but in war; and that
there was fomething in his heart which  did fo raightily refift ail the attrafts of
this Slave, as he could not be raoved with her. Alicola,  furprifed with this dif^
courfcjcould not choofc but ftrokcher hand over her eyes to affure her countenance.
Baiaz,et on the other fide, who had never thought that Soliman could have refufcd a
fair woman, and that feared nothing fo much as to fee his defign fail, was fo ama¬
zed, as he could hardly fpesk. Howbcithe had a fpirit, that left him not long in
unquietnefs; fo that ftriving with himfelf, after he had anfwered to all the
queftions which Soliman had asked hira, hc affured hira that the journey had made
this Slave lofe fomething of her beauty, and that if it pleafed his Highnefs to fee
her again a few days after, it may be he would be better fatisfied ofher.  Never a
whit, replyed Soliman, who thinking that Alicola underftood not what he faid, dif¬
guifed none of his thoughts.    But, continued Baiaz^et, raay I dare, without lofing
the refpeft which I ow to thy Highnefs, demand of thcc what I ffiall write to Amw
y&lt;rt^, to let him know what the defefts of her are whom he had chofen for thce^
Thou ffialt tell hira, anfwered Solimm fmiling, that ffie looks more like a fouldier,
than a woman ; that ffie would bc fitter to conduft Amaz,ones to the wars, than to
live in a Seraglio 5 that I ffiould fear her valour would equall mine; that when
I ffiould give her marks of my lovc, ffie would give me fome of her courage j that
I hold her more capable to raake prifoners of war, than prifoners oflove', and that
in conchffion, finding fomething redoubtable in her eys, ffie hath poffeffed mc
with more fear than defire.    1 leave you to imagine what anguiffi the arabitious
Alicola was in, it vvas fuch, as forgetting all things, ffic purpofed twice or thrice to
have fpoken; and had ffie not been retained by the thought,   that her undoing
would have been annexed to that of Baiaz,ets, if ffie difoovered the trick which
they played 5o/;w4», it is certain that ffie had given fome marks of her refent¬
ment. And to raake an end of enraging her,  aud Ba]az,et too, the grand Signior
told him,  that to doe an aft of jufticc in this incounter,    he would put him in

you may eafily conceive, but though this adventure grieved him extremely
was it nothing in comparifon of Alicolaes rage, who by the changing of her
colour ffiewed but too much, that ffie had underftood what the grand Signior had
fayd, if hehad marked it.    Ba]az.et having perceived her unquietnefs, beingdcx.
trous, caft himfelf at his feet to keep him from feeing her, under pretence of reni
dring hini thanks, and teftificd  a great deal of joy fora thing that troubled him
exceedingly. But fearing that inthe end ^//W^f/grief would break forthjhe with-
drew as foon as pofsibly he could.  Fcarcely vvas he outof the Sultans chamber

He fpeaks very gently to her, reprefents to her, that ffie would undo her fdf jj
well as hira, if by her imprudence ffic ffiould give any notice of their impofture.
She holds her peace, but not fo much to obey him, nor to conferve her felf, ashc-
caufe ffie was fo fuffocated with choler and rage, that ffie thought ffie ffiould have
burft with  it.    .P/»j^^&lt;?f re-mounts her into his Chariot, and without goin" to
his houfe at Conflantinople, he carries her back tothe fame place from whence
ffie came.    And whereas hc rightly judged that ffic would not much care to con¬
ceal her felf upon the way, he would take no body with him but he that drove
the Chariot.   As long as the  journey lafted ffie was conftrained to hold her
peace, becaufe Ba]az.et, who forefaw that ffic would fay ftrange things unto him,
rode thirty or forty paces behind her ; but when ffie was arrived at her chamber,
and that Ba]ax.et had followed her, with an intent to pacific her, what did (he
not fay againft him ! againft the fair Slave ! and againft 5&lt;7//&gt;w^«! I might well
thinkCfayd ffie beholding him with contempt} that a Prince unjuft enoughto
lovc thee, would be yet more not to love me; but I take heaven to witnefs, tnatl
will ceafe to be Alicola, or I will be revenged cither on him, or on thcc that is
fodear to him. Bajazjet feeing her in this fury, did what he could to appeafe her;
made as though he had an affeftion ftill toher, and would have perfwaded her,
feeing Heaven would not let her ambition be fatisficd, to live better with hira
for the future, than formerly ffie had done.    But ffie, that was not in an eftate to
be wrought upon, anfwered him with fomuch pride and infolcncc, as judging
it not fafe for him to leave her at liberty in his houfe, hc quitted her in choler,
and comraanded his old Eunuch  to ffiut her up, and not to let her go out ofher
charaber, what crying or violence focvcr ffic ffiould ufe.    This order given, he
went to fee the fair Slave, whom the Jewels which he had caufed to be prefented
unto her,   had rendred   more traftable.   The kind entertainment which Ihe
gave him was a comfort to him againft all Alicolaes fury j and comraing at M to
confider, that in the manner as the matter had fallen out, he might poffeffe this
flave without concealing her, as he had purpofed to have done ; and that AmnrAii
returning, he raight alfo fee her in hishands without offence, fince he could (ay,
that the grand Signior had beftowed her upon him, he was more contentedthan

<p>fhe was   with BajoAiP ,   he could not tell what to think of this adventure. At h«
iamc inftant Ba}az,et'.zppeared, and the fiibborned Slave re-cntred into the houf
o affure Alicola thac her note was received. Amurath, falutcs Ba]aut,awdt\\f{-'
Slave lifts up her vail, as her husband and ffie had before-hand agreed; for theyhad
been a good while advifing as they, came along whether it were fit ffiat Amuth
fhould fee her, or no. Bajaz^et, after fuch time as the fair Slavp had learned ^ur hn,
guage, had recounted unto her the artifice he hadufed to poffefs her, the better, to
teftifichis affeftion unto her. Accprding to the refolution they had taken,tlicn (he
pulled up her vail,and faid unto hini,that ffie reraembred well he had redeemed her
from the Piratcsjthat ffie owed all her felicity to hira;and that although ffie heldher
felf thehapicft creature  inthe world,  yet  was ffie grieved for his fake, that
her   defefts   had   kept   her  from   being agieeable  to   the   grand   Sianioc.
This woman fpoke thus with an apparent fincerity , lb well counterfeited, 45 it
h.ad been hard not to have been deceived with it.    And that which rendred her(o
dextrous vvas, for that ffie really loved Bajaz.et, vvho on his part made an hundred
complements to Amurath, affuring him that he vvas more   obliged to him, than
to Soltman, for the poffeffion of aperfon  vvhich vvas infinitely deartohim; iinK
if he had not had the goodnefs to confide in hira, by giving him the conduft ofthij
Slave, he had never been mafter ofthe happinefs which now he injoyed.   Amttrm
anfwered to all thefe civilities with more liberty of mind,  than he couldhavc
done, if hc had not feen the fair Slave : For finding her fomewhat altered, byw.
fon of her ficknefs and being with  child,  his renewing flames extinguillicd in a
moment, and tranquility re-cftabliffied it felf in his foul.   Howbeit he marvelkd
with himfelf,  that Soliman ffiould find this woman to have a proud and haughty
look; forthough ffiehada great deal of majefty, yet was jt quite contrary to tijit
of-^//«//i; having very much fweetnefs and modeftie in the air ofher face. Butajh?
knew 5  that one and the fame thing is diverfly judged of by the raoft part of tk
world, fo he made no great reflexion thereupon;  and the fole unquietnefs about
the note} which had been caft him, could then trouble him. And whereas he had no
more to do in that place,   feeing the fair Slave touched his heart no longer, he
fhortned his vifit, and after he had been two hourcs in the haU , talking of therca-
fons which had brought him back to the Port, he took leave of the fair Slave; for
as for Bajaz,etf whereas he had purpofed to return that day to the City, he thought
he ffiould bcuncivill in not going along mith Amurath,  who did his iittcrmoftto
keep hira from it; judging rightly that if they went together,  he ffiould qetreid
his note till he came to Cenftantinople; but at length hc was fain to give \vay toiit-
jaz.ets importunate civility.  As they were in the Court ready to depart, ^^t^W
ftept in a litlc to fay fomthing to the fair Slave ,   during the which Armrath ftood
looking on the window, from whence the note had beenthrowen hira. And vl«f''
as Alicola was not gone from it, ffic changed her firft refolution, lifted up thegnw,
and ffiewing her felf openly, ffie joyned the charmes of her beauty to her rcqucfts;
for ifyou have obferved it, all our houfes are fo low, that flic was not far d'ft^"'
from him. After ffie had let herfelf been fccn a while, (he falutcd Amurath nitinU
faffiion of the Country;   and with a fuppliant behaviour feemcd to demand fuc¬
cour ofhim in fome misfortune that was befallen her.    Amt:rath finding htntft
beautifull, made fign to her, that he would do what ffie would have him, notbeiog
able for all that to comprehend ought in this adventure.  But at laft Bai]az.tt caiBSj
and going away together, they arrived atConftantinople juft as it was night, fc-**
z,et waited on Amuraththome, where having left him,   he gave hira the libeityw
fatisfie  his impatience. He was no fooner alone then but he opened JlicoUes noiit
which in few woids recounted to him all Bajaz^ets impoAure ;  his lovc tothe
fair Slave; the fuppofition he had made to Soliman; his treachery to hira ; aiidnis
rigor towards her, becaufe(iaid ffie unto him)ffie had a raind too high and gene¬

advertifed, that hewas preparing of a chariot to return to his houfe.   l»elirlt
thought that came into his raind was, that Amurath was become inaraoured ot the
fair Slavc,and that he would take her away by force. He departed then m all polhble
haft, with an intent to remove the fair Slave from the houfe, and it raay beto rid
himfelt of Altcola, not knowing in fo crofs an adventure,iu what place to put her
for his own fecurity.Novv though he vvas more diligent than Amurath, and that by
a ncaier and a by-way he arrived there a little before hira , yet could he not exect'te
all that he thought to have done; for Amurath, who had not ftayed for his chariot,
was gone away with twelve armed raen, fothat he arrived at Ba]az,ets houfe, a lit¬
tle after he was entred into the fair Slaves charaber, whom he found ftill in her
bed: fo that prclfing her to make her felf ready with all fpeed,   and recounting un¬
to her in few words the occafion of his fear, hc thought of nothing but of geting
her from thence, and earring her to Conflantinople, where he believed Amurath durft
not enterprife fuch a like violence.   But he  was very much furprifed, when as
his Eunuch carae and told hira that Amurath, who knew not that 54i&lt;!j*fr was
there, required to enter in the behalf ofthe grand Signior; that hc   cfpyed
through a chink of the door that he was  accompanied with armed men;  and
that to have meanesto advertife hira ofit, hehad told him thathe went to fetch
the kcies to open him the gate.    Ba]at.et began then to  change his opinion ■,
for he was fure that Amurath durft not make ufe of the Sultans name, if hehad
not been authorifed for it.Bchold him then in the belief that he was difcovered;&amp;
the better to clear himfelf therein,  he would have entred into Alicolaes cham¬
ber, whom peradventure he would have killed , but he found that ffie had ffiut it.
For when fhe faw thefright the old Eunuch was in, and that fhe doubted not but
her note  would produce fome violence, ffic and her fuborned flave had barrica-
doed their door as much as poffibly they could; forefeeing Well that Bajaz,et would
turn all his fury upon her ; as indeed, he did what hc could to have broken up
the door; but feeing hc could not prevail, and fearing left Amurath (hould enter,
he took the fair Slave, who had made her fclf ready in haft, croft thorough the
Garden, to get out at a back Gate, without knowing as then which way to fly;

Never was there a greater diforder feen ; the fair Slave was all in tears, and fciring
(he ffiould not be able to go, by reafon of her .great belly and her mdifpofitio„
ffie befought Ba^a^^et to abandon her, and to think of nothing but faving himfelt'
But unwilling fo to do, he laboured to give her fome hope, and to go as faft
as ffie could, untill they might get up both on a horfe, which the Have that was
faithfull untohim, was bringing them.   In the mean time ^*«/^ cryed out that
they would murther her, tothe end that Amurath hearing her cryes, raightthc
quicklier enter into the houfe, and more eafily follow them that were fled.   But
at lafk Amurath being got in, and Altcola having opened him her chamber door
acquainted him, how from her window that opened upon the Garden, ffic had feen
Baiaz^t cfcape out of a back-gate; and that it were good  he ffiould bc purfued
with all fpeed. Amurath prefently enjoyns fome of his men to do fc^; and charts
them, if they met with him, not to kill him, howfoever he defended himfelf They
do asthey are commanded, but finding the gates ffiut, they were a long time be¬
fore they could break them open; fo that when they were without any obfhcle
they were not in cafe fo eafily to find that which they fought for. They feparated
themfelves, outof the hope to meet with him the fooner, and omitted nothing
of whatfoever they beleeved might be of ufefor this fearch. Two of them indeed
incountred the flave which had followed them, and that was refolved not to re
enter into her Mafters houfe ; howbeit ffie ferved but to turn them out ofthe way,
which undoubtedly had brought them to thofe fugitives. For not knowing that
ffie belonged to 'Baiaz.et, they asked of her ifffie had n^t feen a raan carrying; away
a woman t She nothing daunted told them, that they had paft by her a little be*
fore; that leaving the ordinary road they had taken on the right hand over the
fields.    This flave faid thus unto them in fuch an ingenuous manner, as theybt-
leevcdher ; fo that abandoning a way which would have made them incounter
what they fought for, they took another which led thera far frora it.   After fo
vain a labor, feeing the night approach, without having any hope to perform that
which had been commanded thera, they returned to Amurath, who in giving li¬
berty to the arabitious yl//W4, was conftrained to lofe his own, fuch power had
the charms of this woman over his foul.    For whereas ffie had rcmembrcdhow
difadvantageous her proud humour had been toher, at fuch time as ffie appeared
before Soliman, ffie conftrained her inclination, and adding artifice to her beauty,
ffie wasfo pleaf\n^to Amurath, as hc could not refift her.   She related to him at
length all that ffic had written to him in brief, and calling him her Deliverer, with
her eyes full of tears, ffie aggravated all the rigors which Sajaz,et had ufed towards
her, after that the fair Slave was in his hands.   She was careful! to let him know,
that Baiaz,et could never furmount her, either with fubmiffions or menaces; and
cafting her felf at Amuraths feet, to implore his proteftion to Soliman, left he
(hould puniffi herfor being an aftor in the fuppofition that was made him, Ihe
moved his heart to pitty; and he hinifelf beleeving that this was nothinf; but
compaffion, found it afterwards to be love.    But at laft Amurath feeing by the re¬
turn of his people that hehad no more to do in that place, and that his Chariot
was arrived a good while before, he placed jilicoU in it, together with the flave
that had been faithfull unto her ; and though it was exceeding late, yet they fet
forth on their way towards Conftatttinople. Amurath caufed alfo the old Eunch tobe
brought along, that hc might be made to confirm Alicolaes difcourfe.   When they
had marched a pretty while, the night furprifed them ,  which was fo obkurc and
dark (for neither Moon nor ftarrcs were to be feen ) as he that drove the chariot,
having never been at this place before, loft his way in fuch fort, as after he had tra¬
velled half the night in hope to find it again, he was conftrained to fend one to his

belorc he found the fair Slave at his feet, though he could not well difcern her in
1 cL-ard it was not yet light enough for it; Ba']az.et did what he could to refift them
vliat preft him to yeeld hirafelf: And whereas hc knew not certainly whether
ihefc were ^w*ir4f/»jnicnor no,hetold thera that they did not know hira, and
that affiiredly they were raiftaken.   But when he heard AmtvMh bid the fair Slave
notbe afraid, for that ffie ffiould have no harm, his defpair was then fo extreme,
as leaving thofe frora whora he defended himfelf, he made direftly towards Amu*
rath; but before he could arrive at him, hewas feized upon behind by thofe three
againft whora he had fought, who prefently took his Scymitarfrom him.   Behold
him then in the power of hisenemie, as well as the fair Slave : for thinking to
do the heft for their fafety, they hadhid therafclvcs moft part of the day in a wood,
with a refolution to travell all night; but their horfe chancing to ftumble, the fair
Slave fell, Ai I have declared, and by her crying out difcovered where Ihe was. A-^
murath (ccing how li:!cky the lofing of his way had proved unto him, and that itbc-
?an to be light enough to difcern where they were, found he was not fo ftir from
Conftant mop ti as he thought he had been, fo that confidering hoW he might beft con*
ycy his prifoners to the City, he defired Altcola that ffie would make the reft of the

compt of hir voyage.    As foon as the Sultan was advertifed ofthe ffate of thin'&gt;
he commanded thefe offendors to be brought before him, which immcdiatdvu'is'
executed.    You may immagine the feverall apprehenfions that ^11 of them "hail ■
Bajax^et was in a great deal of confufion to appear before his Mafier whom he had
betrayed; before a friend whom he had deceived ; before a woman vvhom hehad
Joved, and that was going to convince him of perfidioufnefs; but that vvhich unit
afflifted him was the grief of the fair Slave    Altcola  was exceedingly vexed
appear before a Prince that had defpifed her ; yet did ffiecomforther (llf with
the thought that ffie deprived hira of a man whora he loved,    ^wwr.rr/ihadhis
heart filled with his new flames, which made him to bc not without unqiiietnds,
for he feared that Soliman puniffiing Bajaz^et would alfo puniffi Alicola, (Ince fhe had
helped to deceive him.    As for the fair Slave, the fear alone of lolmg Ba\iii:t
made her ffied tears: But at length, they arrived all before Soltman.   And where¬
as none of them durft fomuch as lift up their eys, it was the Sultans pleafure they
ffiould fpeak feparately; and firft he commanded Eajax,et to render an account of
his doings. Whereupon falling down on his knees, he fpake much after this man¬
ner ; for I think that I have heard bim repeat it over above an hundred times. As
love only hath been the caufe of my crime, fo love only muft alfo be my defence;
for, my Lord(faid he unto hira) I know but too well, that reafon and juftice are ab¬
folutely againft me. I have contemned the counfell of the firft, and I have not been
afraid of the fecond j I have betrayed a Prince, who is not only ray lawfull Prince;
who is not only the greateft Prince of the World ; but who, for the greater ag¬
gravating of ray fault, is a Prince which hath alwaies loved me, and whofe good¬
nefs hath beenfo great towards me, as it hath fcarce fet any bounds to my hopes.
Now if after fogrcat a crime, it is requifite to confider thereft which I have com¬
mitted,   I have betrayed a man that confided in me; Ihave abandoned a woman
whom  I had loved long, and have made her pay very dearly for the teftimonics
ofmy affeftion, with unheard-of rigour ; aud to fay all, 1 have abufed the fim¬
plicity of a Slave which was deftined to thee, and depriving her by my auiEceJ
of the honour of being thine, I have wronged her raore than all the reft.   In fine,
my Lord, which way foever I turnme, I fee the  marks of my crime; butifnot?
withftanding it would pleafe thy Highnefs to confider by what violence my rea¬
fon hath been forced to carry me to (uch ftrange things, thou wouldft doubtlefs
have fome pitty of my misfortune. For if it bc true that we have fome conipaffi'
onof a man whofe imagination hath been troubled with melancholy, why Ml
we not have it of a man whom loVe hath bereaved of his underftanding? What
imports it whether the caufe of his folly be interior, or whether it proceeds from
without ^ fo it is, that 1 have not failed, till love had feduced my reafon; till! W
loft my judgement, till my will was no longer in mine own power; tillaUmy
defires perfwaded me to the crime which I have comraitted 5 till all ray fenfeiW*

he condufted rae to his houfe, and retained nie there without ever fuffering me to

that our mariage had made me unworthy of being able to repair his fault , by

that, my Lord, I am to be their defcndor alfo in this occafion , and doe moft hiim-

if thou be not fatisfied, in rendering us all four happy. For, ray Lord, ifthoiih'
veft the poffeffion ofthe fair Slave to Bajaz^et, he will certainly efteem himfelfhap-
py, as well as ffie. As for me, my Lord, if the purpofe which I had to tender !thee
a prefentjthati thought would be agreeable to thee, merits any recompence, asthy
highnefs hath bceiie pleafed to affure rae, I beg the pardon and poffeffion of Alicoht
who by whati have noted in her difcourfe, is raore fenfible of ambition than love;
fo that injoyingrby thy bounty, a rank confiderable enough about thee, (be will
have means to be fatisfied, and I too ; feeing I am conftrained to acknowkd-e^that
my opinion is not like unto thine, for the beauty of Altcola ; and that I have been
a whole day the moft amorous ofall men.    Salman feeing him about to proceed,
would not permit him, and reaching his hand to him fmiling, I am glad ( faidhe.
unto hira) that we are not ofthe farae opinion for beauty, fince thereby I am en¬
abled to fatisfie thee.    And for thee, faid he to Ba]az.et, I rerait the offence thou halt
comraitted againft nie; but know, that if Love combatted for thee in thy dif¬
courfe, the goodwill which I have alwaies born   thee hath far better dciended
thee in my heart.Then turning him to the fair Slave, hc commended her genero(ity,
and the affeftion which ffiee caxriedto Ba]ar..ct, alfuring her that he vvould never
trouble her reft.    As for Altcola, he told her, that to render the conqueft,which (he
had obtained,  raore wohhy ofher, and more capable of contenting her, he would
make Amurath sy:and vifier.    After this ihe faid to Baiaz,et, hee was forry thatfor
the prefervation ofhis authority, and for example fake, hee could not lethirallve
at Conftantinople; but in regard it was impoflible the matter ffiould not be divulged
by thofe who had accompanied Amurath, he muft needs refolve to abfent himlelf
from the Port, for  fear leaft this importunity ffiould give others the boldnefsto
commit the like, or greater faults than this.    That he did not condemn himto^o
out ofthe territories ofhis Dominion, but he would have him abide in one ofthe
Iflands ofthe Achipelago, and there lead   a private and particular life.    To rqw-
fent unto you the joy ofthefe four perfons, would be an impoffiblc thing, however
fo it was,that after they had rendered a thoufand thanks to Solman,andt\\at hehad

of mind that never   abandoned  hira ;  for the raore he fought how to re¬
eftabliffi hirafelf, the   kfs likelyhood he faw for  it.    In the  raean time the
littk Raxelana  grew   up ftifl,  and  ffiee raight bee about  four  yeares old,
when as Bajaz^et confidering her upon a day, in the raidft of a great afferably,
where every one admired her fpringing beauty, and took pleafure in beholding
her; he heard one ask her what ffic would raoft defire in the world? ffie ftraight an¬
fwcrcd without fticking at it, that it ffiould be to raake her father rich and power-
full.    This was no fooner fpoken by her, but Bajaz^et coraniing as It were out ofa
dead fleep, took a refolution, which I will relate unto you.    And confider I pray
you, how a weak beginning hath many times a long and dangerous confequence f
the little Roxelana was not more beautifull that day than at other tiraes, howbeit
her fathers anguiffi had been fo great, as one would have thought he had never
taken notice that ffie was the faireft and wittieft child that ever had been feen; for
as foon as he had opened his eyes, and ffiat the acclamations which were given to
Roxelana had raade him perceive ffie was aMafter-piece of Nature, his heavinefs
diniinifficd,and al his induftry and care was no onger,but to endeavour to make her
wit as dextrous as her beauty wascharming.    Andtruly it was not hard to bring
her to what he defired; for as ffie had all the beauty ofher raother, fohad ffic
all the inclinations of her father.   And whereas they are perfeftly difcerncd in
that innocent age, ffie that acquainted rae with all thefe things, and that lived
with her both at thattirae, and afterwards in the Seraglio, hathtoldme, that in
her  tcndreft infancy, ffie had an imperious fpirit, which could not endure to be
controlled by any body. Sae would alwaies be miftris of all the other little girles
that played with her; and her very play was dextrous ftill, andmalitious.    She
told rae furdicr, that ffic was never fccn to weep, nor ask for pardon, neither did
ever perfon tefl a lye with raore confidence.   She was curious to know all things,
and one of her greateft delights was to fee beafts fight together.    This cruefl hu¬
mour vvas for all thatfo well concealed, by the gcntlenefs of her look, as ffie
feeraed to be the raoft amiable child that ever was beheld.    I leave you to judge,

but onely to bc carefull to feem fo.    In her youngcft years he l^oured to fra"^^
her toagracefull behaviour, and to entertain her alwaies with great hopes-   ^
promife her that one day ffic ffiould be rich,and that ffie ffiould have ftately Pala'ce*^
to the end that he might infinuate into her betimes, that Greatnefs was thefev ^*
raign good : and that fo defiring it with paffion,ffie might be the more eafily carded*
afterwards  to do all things neceffary for the acquiring of it.    WScn ffiehad at
tained to the age of eleven or twelve years, and that ffie had a forward wit, able to
apprehend his maxims, he began to fpeak more plainly to her, and to tell her that
being born with no common beauty, ffie was to make herfelf an extraordinary
fortune.    But as it was the office of the eyes to obtain conquefts, fo it was the ofl
fice of the wit to conferve them. That all things which are gained by violence, arc
to be retained by  addrefs.   That it was time for her to learn to kno\^ her
fcif, and to know others; to the end that being accuftomed to apply her mind to the
divers humors ofthofe ffic convcrfed with, ffic raight one day be capable oV the.
roughly difguifing her though t8:that ffie was not to live fo out of abafe compliance
and with no other defign than to pleafe ; but only to attain to forae thing that was
great. With fuch like difcourfes as thefe did Bajaz^et inftruft Ro.xelana, whofe incli-
nations were but too much carried todiffimuIation.Neverthelefsitistrue,thatthefe
dangerous leffons, whichffie willingly learned, were combated by the wildom of
her mother, whora I have alwayes called the fair Slave, becaufe my nicmoiy could
not give you her name.    This woman was good and vertuous, and did all that
fhe could to make Roxelana referable her, as well in the qualities of the foul, as in
the features of the face : which Ba]az,et perceiving, and having in vain forbidden
her to reprehend her daughter for her bad conditions, befell into fuch a hatred of
her, as he could not indure her; and having looked upon her in former times
as the objeft of his love, heconfideredher no longer but as an obftacle of his am¬
bition. But to keep her from dcftroying that whichhe had eftabliftied in the young
heart of Roxelana, he thought it would be requifite to make her hate her.   And
to that end, he dextroufly perfwaded her, that her raother ftanding yet upon her
beauty, was jealous of feeing hers furpafs it; that her reproving her, was an clfeft
rather of hatred than affeftion, and that therefore ffie ffiould beware of hearkning
to her Remonftrances; there needed no more to ftifle all the motions of Nature in
fo depraved a fpirit, and to carry her to infolency.    Roxelana, to obey her father,
was to do no more than follow her own humour, but to content her mother, die
was to fight with all her inclinations.    The firft was the eafier, and made her hope
ihatit would produce great things;   andthe other being harder, and withouto-
ther recompence , than that which gives us the fatisfaftion to d-o what we ought;
flie had not much adoe to refolvc upon the defpifing of vertue, and inibracing of
vice.    Behold her then abandoned toheV own fenfe, and to the evill counfells of
Ba]az.et, and the fair Slave almoft reduced to be a Slave to her daughter, who with¬
in a while ufed her fo cruelly, that ffie fell fick with grief upon it.   Now to make
a tryall of what ffie could do in diffimulation, as long as there was any company
with her mother, ffie fecmed refpeftfull, affcftionate, and obedient; but as foonn
they were gone, fhe mock .d openly at her goodnefs, and with an hundred bittct
jeers, ftruck a dagger into the heart of her that had given her life.    This prudj"
woman was for all that fo good as not to publiffi the cruelty of her daughter, vwo
in the oi^inion of all them which faw her, was as vertuous as beautifull.   3,v0]
feeing fo fair a beginning in Roxelana, careffed her extraordinarily, and by this
criicH pr.xe.ding ftill advanced the death of her, whora he had loved fo niucB
before.    At laft, that deadly moment, wherein ffie was to leave this life, being ar¬
rived., this infortunate one called to her the Slave, who hath recounted all theie
thing? unto r.e, and that had wit and fome vertue, and fecretly commanded hff

ftiall reftore n^c into grace vvith Soliman.    And not to conceal my thoughts from
thee, I purpofe to prefent and give thee to the Grand Signior, leaving the reft to
fortune, and thy addrck.    Ik\iow that this Prince being advanced in age, is be¬

here, K&lt;7.vf/rf«&lt;«an[wered him according to his defire, and affured him, that ifffie
could be received into the Seraglio, flic would raake no doubt of the reft: and for
a conclufion, (hefo preft hira to part away, that in a little after having found out a
Veffell which was bound for Conftantinople, he irabarqued hirafelf in her with his
daughter, and the flave to whom her mother had rccoranicnded her ; who had fo
infinuated her felf into her affeftion, as ffie had often believed her in things which
Gontraried her inclinations. At length they arrived at Conftantinople, and went to
the houfe of one of ^rfj^^irr/antient friend?, where the day being come, in which
he purpofed to prelent Boxelana, her flave helped to drefs and fet her forth, being
glad to fee her going out ofthe hands of Ba]az,et, forthat ffie was perfwaded there
coald be no place in the world where (he would not be better than with him.    But

alfo an apron of cloath of gold, a little ffiorter than her petticoat, and which wa
tyed behind with two filvcr ftrings, whereat hung two taffclls of gold.   She had
upon her ffioulder?, as it were to faften on the fleeves ofher waftcoat, a ercac
many of ribbands of divers colours, and athwart her neck a fcarf of Tiffany hang¬
ing baudrikewife, and clofed together with Diamonds, in fuch fort as all her neck
was feen, aboutthe which ffie had a chain of Pearl, with a little jewell of Eme¬
raulds.    The attire of her head was of cloath of filver, plaited with a great dealof
addrefs, and inriched all over with Pearls and Diamonds; This head-tire was of
a round form, and ftanding up very high behind; and to hold it on the better,
ffie had according to the ufe of the Countrey a little gold fillet with which it was
made faft behind on her neck, where hung two taffclls of the fame in the midft of
a great number of knots of feverall colours, which fell carelefly updn her (houl-
ders. And on the cop of her forehead, defcending a little into a peak, ftie had a
dreffing of Cobweb Lawn ftreaked with gold,which alfo was faftned behind,leavine
her hair hanging down in curls on either fide of her cheeks.   In this manner was
Roxelana attired; but before hc led her to the Seraglio, Bojazjet would give her his
laft inftruftions; wherefore he took her afidc, and willing her to hearken attentive¬
ly unto him, he fpake to her much after this fort; for the flave, who hath toldmc
afl thcfc things, over-heard him without his perceiving it.   It is time, my daugh¬
ter, for me to difcover unto you the means whereby you may arrive at the point
which I defire.   I have indeed faid fomething unto you at feverall times, but now
I am refolved to hide no part of a Science firom you, on which I have a long while
meditated.    Before I ffiew you then the ways you are to hold, I rauft propound un¬
to you the term of your pretenfions, which ought not to be only to pleafe the
Grand Signior; to make him in love with you; to bc a Sultana , as many othersj
but indeed to become his wife.   For although none of the Of Aww/iw Emperors fince
5&lt;ijitaiff the firft hath been maryed, becaufe they would not ffiare their power; yet
ought not this obftacle fmother your defires, but contrarily it ought to inflame
them the more.    You perceive then, continued he, that in fo great a defign, diere
is need of a great deal of prudence to carry one well unto it.   The gencrall pre¬
cept which I will givreyou upon your entring into the Seraglio, is, never to do,
nor to fay any thing, which tends not to this defign, either direftly, or indircftljr,
and to remember, that all the ways which may conduft us whither we wouldgo,
are permitted us by true reafon.    Never amufe your felf then in confulting, whe¬
ther that which you do bc juft; but indeed whether it be advantagious for you.
Confider not, whether you hurt any, but whether that which you do may ferve
your turn.   For in fine, you go to a place where you will meet with cnvyers, and
enemies, and no fooner fhall Soliman be ftriken in love with your beauty, but you
will be hated of all the Sultanaes.    Prepare your felf then to know how to make
a right ufe of all thefe things; andfo do, that the hate which is born you may
deftroy them, who would deftroy you. Never undertake to be revenged, but when
you can abfolutely do it; yea, and if it be poffible, revenge your felf fo as you
may not bee  fufpefted for it.    Moreover, Alicolaes adventure makes nierf*
membdr, that Sobmau is pleafed with modefty, wherefore fo carry your iff)
as it may be very much feen in all your aftions; and beware of trufting a"?
body.  Regard every one as your enemy, carefs all your fellows, and love non«
of them ; make not their defefts known to Solimn, but in feeraing to cxcufe theni;
be carefull   to let him   underftand by   fome   other   the malice   which tti^
bear   you ;    bee liberall to  them that  are about the Grand Signior ; d«
very fubmiffive and pleafing to him, untill you know that you ^rc ab(o u
Miftris of his heart; for in fine, you muft ferve, that you may reign; but then,
you muft change yourfiile, and by fome artifice, whkh you may invent accorams

world, by reafon hehad received newsof a great Viftory which he had obtained
over the Chriftians.   Wherefore he prefently comraanded, that this flave, and he
■which brought her, ffiould enter. V^hen Ba]az,et firft appeared, SoUmanknewhxrrx.
not   whether k were for that tirae had altered hira, or that his eyes and heart

as Ba^a^et had caft himfeff at his feet, and that he had begun to fpeak, the tone of
his voyce made hira call himtomind: He did not interrupt him for all that, but
looking ftill on Roxelana, hchcarkncdto Bajaz^et,  without turning his head to¬
wards him.    Roxelana on her fide appcancd with fo modeft a Majefty, andfo
charming a fweetnefs, asit had been very hard to difcern the motions of her foul
in her eyes, and not to bc ftrucken in loVe with fuch powerfull attrafts.    But
whilft Soliman takes in fo fweet and fo deadly poyfon, ^^j^fcef fpake to him in thefe
terms; I know very wcll,ray Lord, faidhe untohim, thatit is a crime in rae to
prefent niy felf before thee, after I have been baniffied; and that if thou bceftnot
the moft indulgent Prince of the World, thou wilt not permit mcto give thee
reafons for it, which may cxcufe mc.    But fince thy filence feems to accord me
fo much, I ffiall let thee know, my Lord, that this young Slave whom thou feeft
here, and whom Iprefenttothy Highnefs as a thing chat appertains unto thee,
is the daughter of that fair Slave whom I prefumed to retain for my felf, though
ffie were deftined to thee. Rejeft her not, ray Lord, fince though fhe be the daugh¬
ter ofan offendor,yet is ffie fo too of a woraan that belonged'unto thee,and whofe
vertue hath paffed into her as well as her beauty.    In fine, it is a facrifice, which
I offer up unto thee, to expiate the crirae which heretofore I committed, and that
alfo which at this prefent I commit. Confider, I befeech thee, that having robbed
thee of one flave, it is but juft that I ffiould render thee another ; but with this

O happy was that theft of thine, fince it was the caufe of thy now rendring mc
an ineftimable treafure! For I profefs unto thee, that I never faw any thine fo
beautifull as thy prefent. Then turning him to Roxelana ; and for thee, fair maid
fayd he unto her, be affured that in lofing a father, thou findeft a lover; andthat
in confideration of thee alone, I will give Bajaz^et his liberty again, and reftore
him to all his former charges and honours.    Roxelana made no other anfwer
thereunto, than  with a profound refpeft ; but Bajaz^et was fb over-joyed with
fo happy a beginning, as hc thought he ffiould never have done rendring thanksto
Soliman.    At laft, after fome other fpeeches, the grand Signior caufed one of the
Governeffcsof the women of the Seraglio to come to hira, and remitted her into
her hands, with order to lodge her alone, and in one of the faireft lodgings in
the womens quarter.    And outof a particular grace, he commanded to be given
unto her the very fame day, great ftore of jewek, apparell, fumptuous houfhold-
ftuff, and mony, with fix flaves to ferve her.    And whereas ffie feemed to regret
one which ffie had, the Grand Signior caufed her to be inftantly brought in unto
her.   But I had forgot to tell you, that when ffic was feparated from her father,
ffie affefted to feem good and fenfible; the tears carae into her eyes, ffie lookedaf-
ter hira as far as ffie could fee him ; and with this feigned teftimony of naturall .if-
feftion, ffie touched the heart of Soliman yet more ; for whereas her tears were
withoHt bitternefs, they did but make her (hew the fairer.    But confider, I pray
you, how deceitfull and ill-affured humane prudence is, efpecially when it works
againft reafon and equity.   Bajaz,et had all his life-time been maftered by two
mighty paflions, love, and ambition ; the firft raade hira lofe his fortune, when as
he betrayed Soliman, and the other raade hira lofe his life ;   as if the divine Juftice
.would not let hira enjoy a good, which he had acquired by a crirae :  For he had
not been eight days rc-cftablifficd in his charges, and Roxelana in the Seraglio,
when as being gone to vifit the Bafla of the fea, vvho was then at Pera, where the
Arfenall and Magazine of ail Maritime things were, he arrived there juft as they
were ready to try fifty Caft-pieces, which were to be ufed in fome ffiipping that
was ffiortly to be fet forth.    And whereas the Baffa would bc prefent in perfon at
this tryall, it was in this employment that Ba]az.et found him.    After the fird
complcments,the Baffa told him, how that which he was going to do, vvas as niucli
to congratulate his happy return to the Port, as to acquithirafelf of the dutyof
his charge ; whereupon he commanded fire to be given : But to ffiew that the ju¬
ftice of heaven would puniffi Ba]az.et, the firft piece buifo afunder, and in the midK
of two thoufand perfons, and fome four paces from the Baffa of the fea, a (hiverof
that Cannon picked him out, and carried him away, with fuch violence, as he
was almoft reduced into powder, fo ftrangely were his limbs difperfed. Andthat
which  is yet remarkable alfo in what I deliver, is, that he was the fole man,l£lo
not fay of them that were killed, but of them that were hurt, and hovv that ff a'
the  onely piece that burft in funder.    Behold, generous ./^Ar/rfw/r^, in what man¬
ner Ba]az,et enjoyed his hopes, and the recompenfe which hc had for ali his crimKj
The news ofhis death was foon carried to the Seraglio ^Roxelana ffiewed a great deal
of forrow for it ;   and out of a fenfe of intereft ffie was really grieved thereat.
But in a few daies, the markes which the Grand Signior rendred her ofhis affeftioj
comforted her. For whereas ffic did not regret him ,   but becaufe ffie had htfm
him to be ufefuU for her greatnefs, when as ffie hoped that ffie might attain there¬
unto without hira, ffie quite forgot hini; Yeaand was glad that Oie was difcbar^t'i
ofthe care of his fortune, and to have nothing to think of but her own.   Roxom
had not been fifteen daies in the Seraglio, but fhe fo abfolutely poffeffid the Grand

that fhe never faw Solimait, without fpeaking fome good of one or other of the Sul¬

whereas ffie knew that the raother ofthe Sultan had a great power over bun, ffie

commended, having underftood that ffie had fent a little coffer foil of jcwells out
ofthe Seraglio, which is not perraitted in that place, ffie advertifed 5&lt;?//iw&lt;a» of it,
who fcarcely hearkning to what ffie faid,called her ingratefull and difacknowledg-

doing her hurt, and that placed her fuprcnieft felicity in doing hurt to others
abfolutely gained to her three Slaves, two Eunuchs , and fuborned alfo two of the'

that Muftapha would reign one day, and that according to the cuftom of the Em¬

iigns tended no longer but to be fpeedily the wife of a Prince, of whom ffie was the

a child, who knew not as yet that he was living ! howfoever, it was not out ofthe

fircjbutbyanartifice which I am going to relate unto you.    She knew that in
one of the books of our Religion the Soveraign is forbidden the poffefling ofa fret
woman ; and ffie knew alfo that in another, a Slave is not permitted to bufld cither
Mofqiie or Hofpitall, or to doany other thing that may be available for the other

She fent to the Muphti, who is the man that takes cognizance ofall matters of Re¬
ligion, to let him underftand that ffie had an extreme defire to build a Mofqucjand
an Hofpitall, where all poor Pilgrims might be lodged and fed; but before (he
would undertake it, ffie would fain know whether this would be pleafing to the
Prophet.   The Muphti anfwers according to her defire, and as ffie knew that he
would anfwer; that the thing would be pleafing to the Prophet, but abfolutely
unprofitable for the fecond life of her foul, becaufe ffie was the Grand Signiors
Slave, and that whatfoever ffie hadbein^ Solimans, and not hers, all that ffie(houlJ
do in this eftate would bc to the advantage of the Grand Signior, and not of her.
This anfwer received, ffie feigns to be exceeding melancholick, ffie deprives her
felf of all her ordinary delights; and when the Grand Signior vifits her, flie lets
herfelf be furprifed ftill in fome mufe, whereat ffie feeras afterwards to bc fome¬
what grieved, and to ftrive to break her felf from it.    At laft ffie playes her part
fo dextroufly, as the Grand Signior began to bc troubled upon his obferving this
change of her humour. At firft he was contented to ask ofher what it wasthat
made her fo fad ? but ffie anfwering that it was an effeft of her temperature, it put
him into further pain. He inquires of the flaves that ferve her, whether any one
hath given her caufe to complain ? they anfwer, that they know of none; but
how it is true, that their Miftrefs had been for a good while fo melancholick, as
they did not think ffie could live long in that fort.   For indeed when Roxilm
was alone with them, ffie always feemed exceeding fad, to the end that being the
firft deceived, they might the more ealily deceive others, fore-feeing rightly, that
Soliman would inquire of them that ferved her, what fhe ailed.  But becaufe (he
would not be always in conftraint, ffic ffiut herfelf up the moft part of the day in
her Cabinet ; and this unaccuftomcd retirement ferved yet very much to make it
be credited that ffie had fome hidden grief. Soliman being advertifed then of ill
thefe things, began to fall into extreme unquietnefs: he conjured Roxelana toac"
quaint him with the caufe of her fadnefs, and not to conceal the fecrcts of her
heart from a Prince, who had given his fo abfolutely to her; he told her, that if
anyone had wronged her, he would revenge her for it; and in conclufion, thi^
there was nothing which ffie might not obtain from him. Hereunto ffie anlVeredj
that the refpeft alone which ffie bore him, kept her from obeying him, and that(n^
had always rather die than difpleafe him.  So preffing a difcourfe failed not to
work the effeft which fhe attended from it; Soliman was mightily moved with'tj
and beholding her with eyes, which ffiaredwith her in her grief, he fvvore that he
would not part from her till he knew what it was that troubled his felicity.  ^^'
refifts yet a while, he preffes her the more, and fpeaks to her with fuch earncftnei^
as ffie thinks it was high time to difcover her fclf.   She fells then at his feet, be-
feechcs him to pardon her, and at Uft frames a difcourfe filled with artifice, where-

vvhich wifl not permit thee to difpofe ofme being free.    Give heed then, my

for a crime whereof I ffiould be the caufe : For rather than I wifl refolve to com¬

cannot live without Roxelana, and whatfoever comes of it we muft be infepa'rablc •
and without offending Heaven, I muft render her happy in contenting my felf. \[
my Subjefts murmure at it, I ffiall tell well enough how to bring them to their
duty again, and teach them to fubmit unto the pleafure of him, to whom they arc
but Slaves.   This refolution being taken, he imparted it to Roxelana, who, as you
may judge, rejoyced exceffively at it.    Howbeit ffie in appearance received this
news with a great deal of moderation, faying, that ffie thought herfelf unworthy
of fo great an honor.    But within a few days after Soliman mary id her publick-
ly with a folemn pomp.    She fent prefents to all the Sultanaes, but the Mother of
Muftapha, to decline the feeing of jber that day, feigned her fclf fick.   Now to do
her the more honour, and to declare her more abfolutely Queen,  and Miftris of
all the Sultanaes, he caufed agreat Hall to be moft fumptuoufly furniffied, where
at the one end he made a Throne of four fteps  to be erefted, covered all with
cloth of Gold,   and two Cuffiions of the fame ftuff,   upon vvhich fate hee
and Roxelana, who  had a Crown on her head, and her Gown fet all over
vvith Diamonds.    Upon the fecond degree of the Throne vvas the Mother of
Soliman, wholoyed Roxelana as her felf; and upon the two lowermoft, fate the
fifters and daughters of the grand Signior, for he had three by two of his flaves.
Things being in this eftate, all the Sultanaes came one after another richlyap-
paialled, to do obeyfance to Roxelana with an high refpeft; and fora mark of
their dependance, they all brought magnificent prefents,and placed thera fome four
paces from the Throne where Roxelana fate.    Divers of them brought Maunds of
Gold full  of Flowers; others, Vafes of Emeraulds rcpleniffied with Effences;
fome, little Coffers, garniffied with precious Stones, and filled with Perfumes; and
after they had left their prefents at the foot of the Throne, they went and placed
themfelves in order on both fides ofthe Hall upon their knees, as it were to doe
homage to the new Queen.    All thefe Sultanaes having remained fo awhile, an
hundred young children, which are brought up about the grand Signior, carae
out of a particular grace to the womens Seraglio, where this ceremony was per¬
formed ; and being arrived in the Hall, they beganto dance, and to fing fomewhat
to the glory of Roxelana ; and being retired, all the Sultanaes went to kifs her
Robe, and then her hand, which ffic held out unto them.   And for a mark oftheir
flavery, and her liberty, fhe gave to each of them a chain of Diamonds; and fo re¬
turned in the fame order as they came, carrying in their hearts as much envy and
jealoufie, as Roxelana had joy. Asfor the mother, the fifters,and daughters om*/'-
w&lt;i«,they condufted Roxelana tothe Grand Signiors lodging, where they Icfthcr
in the height of her felicities, and retired to the old Seraglio thorough a door that
opened near upon Solimans chamber.    Untill then fraud and artifice were tHe on¬
ly things which fhe had employed to arrive unto the point ffie had defired; but
alafs, how well did ffie in this eftate remember the bad leffons which herfather
had given her! when as he had told her, how that which was gotten by addreft,
ought to bc conferved by violence.   For ffie no fooner faw her felf the Wife of ^♦Z'"
man, but ffie would needs ffiare with him in his power, and be acquainted with all
the affairs of the Empire; ffie baniffied from the Port fuch as weienotplea%
to her; and for fear left the Muphti, whom ffie could not make greater than hc WJ,
fhould reveal to fome one, that her good fortune was not fo much an effeft ofher
devotion, according to her own faying, as of her artifice ; it was thought tli«
ffie fuborned one of his flaves, aivd caufed hira tobe poyfonedj for he dyed fud¬
dainly; and fome have conceived that he himfelf was aware of it, becaufe that ha¬
ving been fick   not above an hour after fupper, when as he could fcarce fpeak for
the violent pains that he felt, with much adoe yet htfayd,that Roxelanaes Oosi^
coft him his Mfe, whereupon he prefently dyed.   After ffie had fecured her fclf oti
that fide, ffie turned her eyes to Muftaplyi.    I think I have told you, that in tW

MotU linking it a crime to refufe her fonne, takes the fruit whichhe prefent,

fcvcW puniffied in his perfon, though he were never accufed for it: Having been
in this occafion, like thofe innocent offerings, upon whom in times paft amongtt

and that when Muflapha ffiould bc out of the Seraglio, and Soliman ffiould be told
thathe was fick, ffie raight make him bcleeve, that change of air had caufed this
malady.   But deftiny would not have the matter go fo ; for in fine, not to pro¬
long this difcourfe any further, yl/«/?/tp/j4 went out ofthe Seraglio in good health,
with no little grief to Roxelana, vvho had been advertifed that he had not eaten
of the impoifoned fruit. As for the mother, that never troubled her; forthough
ffie fefl fick the very fame day, and dyed a moneth after, no body beleeved there
was any thing extraordinary in her death ;   becaufe Roxelana had caufed it to be
bruited, how the forrow for ^/«/?/e;iA4(fj cloignment was the catffe ofit, and how
fince that day ffie had never been well ; as inciced ffie lyed not : fnd this was fo
generally beleeved, as the fick Sultana her felf fayd fo much to them that came to
vifit her, ffic never fufpefting any wickednefs.   Behold, Madam, Roxelanaes firli
pcrfccution of the Prince Muftapha: Indeed it is true, that he was not fenfible of
'it, for he never knew any thing of that which   I have told you.    l^ow you muft
not imagine, that this violent defire which ffie hath alwayes had to deftroy Mufta^
pha, whereby her children may reign, is a fenfe of affeftion for them ; ffie hath
not fo legitimate a defign, and the only thought which f^hath, is tip remain the
mother of an Emperor afoer the death of 5o//&gt;»4« ; becaufe ffie knows very well,
that this quality gives alwaies a great credit to thofe which poffefs it i and brings
them into veneration amongft us.   I ffiould never have done, if I would relate all
her wickedneffes unto you.    But at length M«y?&lt;f/&gt;/?4 in fpight of all her artifices

keep the Prince (7/Vz«^fr from having as much good wifl for him,as ffie had averfion.
But to ftrengthen her felf ftill the raore, as foon as her daughter had attained the
age of thirteen yeares, ffie got Soliman to raary her to the traitor Ruftan; who for all
that hath not forborn often betraying her felf, for he feekes his own greatnefs and

very certain, that ifhe had been here,   the rage which ffiehad long ffiut up in her
heart, had not broken out fo deadly as it hath done.   Alas !   faid Axiamira inter.
rupting her, how much hath he whom you fpeak of been wiffied for in vain ofthe
Vrince danger !   And how often hath he fpoken to me of him with a world of
praife! B ut mother,   continued ffie, you have recounted fo many things unto me
as Soliman me thinks ffiould be above an hundred yeares of age, and yet he feemed
not io old unto me on that unhappy day wherein I faw hira.   It is, anfwered HMi.
7na, becaufe I having enchained two Hiftories in one, and begun to fpeak of Solmm
at the age feaventcen yeares, your mind, by the length of my narration,  andthe
number of things which 1 recounted, hath thought that which you fay. But ifyou
pleafe, I will let you fee th:   contrary: Soliman was feaventcen yeares old, v^hen h-
jaz,et put the fuppofition of the Slave upon him; at the end of fixteen yeares, when
Roxelana was prefented unto him, he was thirty and three, ffic fifteen, and Mnflntk
fcaven: So that ifyou are ignorant of all thefe thing?, you will find, that'Roxelm
is not above fcaven and thirty yeares of age, Muftapha was nine and twenty, Gm-
ger eighteen, and Soliman is fifty and four, though he feem not to bc more than for¬
ty. And that which is ftrange in this Prince is, that hc is at this prefent of a more
amorous humor, than he was in his younger yeares. I ffiall not have much ado, an¬
fwered Felixana,who had not fpoken yet, to believe that which you fay; and 1 kjiow
but tco well by mine  own experience,   that there are men in whom age doth ra¬

But whereas the Governor of that place had not underftood of the grand
Vifiers return, there had been no order taken for his entrance; howbeit
his people had no fooner advertifed him of his being there, but he came to
let him in himfelf, and to crave pardon for making him ftay fo. Ibrahim,
having accepted his excufes, fent him to advertife Axiamira of his arrival, and to know of
her, whether he might have the permilfion to fee her. This man failed not to obey the com¬
mandment he had received, but this news fo furprized Axiamira, and the imagination, that
foe was ready to fee a man, whom Prince (j/&lt;««^fr had loved fomuch, troubled her in fuch

<p>Fhe Btforj of the Princefs Axiamira, Ulama, and Felixana.
</p>
<p>THat which you defire to know of mc, generous Ibrahim, hath coft me fo many tear?,
andfiehs, that if I did not ftrive to turn away my thought from the laft adventures ot
this Hiftory, it were impoffiblcfor me to relate the beginning, where you will finde nothing
but the hopes of an extream felicity for me.   But to take things from their firft fource, and
to render my difcourfe more intelligible, I am to tell you, that Scach Tachmas, whom we
call the Sophi, otherways Kingot the Perfians, remained a widower almoft as foon as his
wife (who, as I have heard fay, was an excellent Princefs) had brought him two fons, Ifmael^
and Mahamcd, whereof the laft is blinde j and two daughters, of which the one is the.
Princefs v^A-J-&lt;wiV^, or to fay better, the wonder of her age; andthe youngeft, named Pfr-
ca, is of an indifferent beauty, of a malicious humor, and of a minde uncapable of anykinde
of friendftiip. As for Ifmael, it might be faid, that as he hath no great virtues, fo he hath no
great defeds, and that he is in the rank of thofe perfons, who do almoft pafs away their lives
fo, as they can hardly be known to live, if their quality did not make it appear that they are
in the number of the living.   Now for Mahamed, the fame cannot be faid of him, but con¬
trarily ic feems, that Nature hath deprived him of thelight of theday, to make itfhinethe
more in his minde: For whether it be that this privation of fighc is the caufe of its better re-
colleding it felf, and operacing with the more adivity; or thac his memory, which is fo mar¬
velous in him, as ic miy be thought he hath never forgotten any thing, doth furnith him wich
that which renders him agreeable; fo it is that his converfation is fo charming, as one an ne¬
ver be weary of it.  But thac which is moft excellent in him is, that he is exceeding virtuous,
and thac his paffions, chough violent, have never furmounced his reafon.   Behold, my Lord,
what the royal Family was, whenl was brought to the Court, which was at thac time in
the City of Tauris. My Facher had always been confiderable enough in chis Monarchy,and the
Sophi, to teftifie che efteem he had of him, had made him Governor of Strabat and Maz.an.
dtron, two very fair Towns,which are fcituated on the bank of the Calfian Sea. But where¬
as my Father had marryed the fifter of the Governor of Tauris, it was by his means that I
was put to Axiamira, with a many other maids of a condition equal Co mine, which were
divided between thofe two Princeffes; and were wich ihem, as one might fay, rather to
help them co pafs away the time, then to do them any fervice.   Axiamira mighc be about
fourteen years of age, and I fifceen; and whereas fhe was younger then the Pnncs her Bro¬
thers, Mahamed, as I think, was not far from fixccen.   But to let you firff know all t he per¬
fons of whom I am to fpeak in chis Hiftory, I ftiall tell you, that there was at the fame time
m the Court, one named Deliment, whofe birth was not very noble; but who hsd, by raeans
of hishighfpirir, and excream riches, fowroughc himfelf into the Court, and good grace
ot t\^tSopht, as there was nonebut wasafraid tobe in iUterms wichhim: I fay afraid, be-
caulc It IS certain chat no man defired his friendfhip, but for fear leaft his hatred fhould be pre¬
judicial untohim; and truly it is not tobe marvelled if one could have no other opinion of
^™;. °V^'was ^^^olent, Moni, undertaking, beleevit^g there was fcarce any thing
rS    A   ea% offended, never pardoning, and that which rendred all his bad inch-

<p>VlamayN^^ oppofite to him in all things, for his birth is noble, as being the chief mannfr
ramaniai his courage is without brutifhnefs; and whereas you have not feen him bur f"
hc was infortunate, I conceive I may be permitted to tell youwhathe wasdurln^hisf?
ty. When I arrived at the Court nothing was fpoken of but the valor of Vkma •''for i «-
a httle after the War of the A^emites, where having done wonderS, and to fay ail beenT
caufe of the Sophies carrying away the vidory ; to recompence him for this greac aftion h
made him Satrap of Canamania ac two and twenty years of age, and gave him hisfider'^
marriage, whom Vlama efpoufed rather out of obedience, then out of indination • Ith?
ing certain that this Princefs, as the incomparable Axiamira bath oftentimes told me y"
nothing recoinmendable in her but her birth. And indeed, as if Heaven had found thislur
riage unjuft, a month after it was accompliflied flie dyed of a burning Feaver: And whticis
it is the cuftom of the Kings of Ter(ta to have all the royal Family lodged in one and thefame
Palace, Vlama, "as brother-in-law to the Sophi, was lodged there too; fochat thoughtlie
women hve very ftraitly kept all over Perfia, yet left we noc for all thac co have a great deal
of liberty, and to lead a life happy and pleafant enough; having in the fame Palace, thetwo
Princes and Vlama, whom we faw as much as they pleafed: for che Sopht had ordained that
the Princeffes lodgings fliould be open to them when they would, I and that all the Sitm
young fons mighc fee and fpeak to us when as they accompanyed the Princes.   Things bcJDg
in thefe terms at fuch time as Vlamaes wife dyed, tfie Princeffes went by the commandment
of the Sophi, a litde after the Funeral, togivcavific to Vlama, whom I had fcarcely ever
feen, becaufe I had noc been above a month ac the Court, and thac during the fame the Prin¬
cefs bis wife had ftill been very fick. I have already cold you, my Lord, thac VUmhi
not loved her, and I put you in minde of it, to the end you may not think ic ftrange if in tliis
occafion Love took his beginning in the time of a mourning, which had not drawn any tears.
iiyfxiamira and Perca made th\syifit with ceremony, the young Princes conduced them,
or to fay better, Ifmael held up Axiamira, andPerca led Mahamed, who, as I have told
you, was blindc from his birth,though he had the faireft eyes to fee to in the world; buthelct
himfelf be guided with fo much addrcfs,and went along with fo confidenc a pace,as therewJS
no body but would have been deceived in him. All the maids of honor followed after,as alfo
fix Ladies of quality, reafonably well ftept in years, which had been placed abouc the PrincelTs,
to have a care of their behavior, and ours.   And truly it muft be acknowledged, chat Feadiof
rejoycing do fcldom fhew any thing more goodly to behold, then the mournir^ whxiiiiin
this Court; for whereas black is not in ufe there but when one mourns, if any of it beftffl
about ones apparel, it fufficeth; nor is it exempted from magnificence.   We were sll then it-
tired much after one; and to excufe Vlama fo much che more, for letting himfdf be toocli-
ed wich thofe few charms which you fee in my face, I will defcribe Axiamiraes habit unto
you, thac you may know what mine was; for fhe had already taken fo great a liking toK,
as flie would have no other difference between her apparel and thac I wore, but great floreof
Diatnonds which fhe caufed tobe added thereunto whenfoever fhe pleafed; and wichall,ta
that fatal day did beget love in four fuch different hearts, it will not be amifs for roe co rtcooot
unto you all the particularicies of it. A.viamira chtn had on a pstticoac and waftcoat of cW
of filvcr very gliccering, and over that a gown of black Tiffany exceeding fine, vvherccjf tM
body was plaited, fo thac it fhewed the ftiape very perfcdly ; and the boctom of the skitii
which was cut in peaks, made way for the cloth of filvcr to be feen athwart ir. The (l«fti
were indifferenc wide, but to give more libcrcyto the arm, they were faftencd uponi'^
flioulder with clafps of Diamonds, leaving almoft to open view che cloth of filver fe)'^
that were under.   Her Girdle was of great Pearls cnchaced amongft Diamonds: Anil dc-
hinde at her back were moreover two hanging fleeves reaching to the ground, borderedwi'^^
large borders of filver Embroidery, as well as the lower pare of the Gown.  Her neck w
half hid wich moft delicate black cobwebdawn, which was tyed on her ftiouldfrwitni '
ver firing.   And whereas our drefling is very high, there hung from che top of h r head ■■
hinde a great vail, trailing to the very ground, of filver Tiffany, ftreaked with black, anaca
hfly plaited ; which certainly gave a great deal of grace to the beauty of Aximira,

abT  kemgchac every time civilicy would permit him, he fattened his eyes fo on my face, as I
was'conftrained co tu'n away mine; which made me obferve how Delment took more then
ordinary care co encercain Axiamirit; for this man of blood and fire had not till  hen looKed
upon any woman, bur to defpife her. And as if this chamber had had fome fatalnefs to en¬
chant the mindes o^ thofe that were in it, the Sophi himfelf came to y\fn Vlama, whilft
we were there, and for my ill fortune, hc beheld me fo favorably, as I paft wich him for the
fairelf ching chac ever he had feen. But whereas the time was not proper for gallantry, all
thefe fpringing paffions were no ocherwife made known then by looks, except in Deliment
who when che Princefs hapned Co go away, and that Tachmas was recired, advanced to lead
Axiamira, whil'ft Ifmael wss yet Calking wich Vlama.  She, that thought the Prince her
Brother would tarry behinde, received him with her ordinary civility, akhough flie was ex-
treamly avetfe to him. On the other fide, Ifmael having finiflied bis complement, gave his
hand Co Tcrc.i, who, without thinking howtheblinde Prince had not brought his ordinary
guide along with him, fuft'red him to lead her; and whereas Mahamed perceived it, and was
very dextrous, he made his difcourfe endure as long as he could out of hope thac fome cne ot
other would lend him their hand to condud him. I confefs that having marked the pain ha
was in,and moved with pity to fee fo goodly a Prince,fo handfom,fo fprightly,and fo amiable,
in che unquiecnefs wherein I faw him, J ftept to him, wichout demanding permiffion for it

mL% if yon will have che goodnefs to lead one that isblinde, whonorwichftandinghisblind-

to have fpoken a gallantry Co me chereupon; as indeed he hach fince affured me, thac civility
onely kept bim trom ic; buc in fine I led Mahamed to the Princeffes Lodging, for che which
he was fo obliged unto me, as thac which the eyes of Axiamira had wrought in the heart of
"Deliment, and mine in chac of the Sophi and Vlama, my courtefie effeded in Mahameds;
who from thence forward began to have an inclination for me, which mighc well be cermed
blinde, fince if I had had any thing thac was agreeable in my face, yec could he noc have been
touched with it, being not able to fee it; and as for wit, I was in an age, which ordinarily is
not capable of making greac conquefts.   Indeed it is true, that my complying with him mighc
render me pleafing to him; for whereas all my fellows were not of my humor, they, when
Mahamed was wich Axiamira, declined his converfation, or ac leaft« wife applyed not chem-
flvescoit, and this, ouc of the thought, thac being incapable of feeing their beaucy, they
beleeved him co be alfo incapable of love, and for this reafon, they would not lofe thac ?imc
wich hira, which they thought mighc be better employed in the entertaining of all thofe
young perfons of quality, which accompanyed the Princes Co Axiamira.   As t?jr me, who
cired noc as yec,either for loving,or for being loved, I gave my felf onely co things that pleafed
me; and whereas I was infinitely taken with che converfation of Prince Mahamed, and chac

that which engaged me yet farther to this compliance, was, chat the Princefs Axilmira

withftanding any greater mark of his affedion, then to behold and commend me more then

durft not, as I underftood afcerwards, fpeak plainly to me of his paflion, fearing Ifhoald'not

of me; and fo ftrorgly refolved to love me, as fearing he fliould be obliged to dinodgfroni
the Palace, becaufe the Princefs his wife being dead without children, he was fcarcely any
longer of rhe royal Family; he purpofed co endevor all he could to difcover his alfedion unto
me, for fear he fhould be deprived of the commodity of doing it fo eafily, if he were con¬
ftrained to be gone from thence.  As for mc, I confefs to you blufliing, thac in this vifit
which he gave CO the Princefs, I felt a defire arife in my heart that I mighc be pleafing unto
him; and wichout making any reflexion on this thought, I remember well, thac although it
had been a greac Courc thac day, I never thought of heeding my apparel; butasfoonas
Vlama was entred, I obferved my felf wich care, and withouc knowing any reafon fotir,
1 would have been glad chat I had been better dreft chen I was.    Buc in fine, my Lord, two
or three hours after, Fortune was fo favorable to'L'/^iw^'j defign, as having found me alone
in the Princeffes Chamber, who was fhut up in her Cabinet, he fpake to me of bis affeftion
wich fo much paffion, as I knew not what to anfwer him, having never met with fuch like
encounters.   And whereas his fpeech had ever fince remained in my memory, and that it
hath been the beginning and caufe of all my pleafure, and of all my mifery, I cannot forbr
repeating it unto you. He no fooner entred inco the chamber, but I advanced towards him,
to let him know thac I was very forry for chac he could not fee che Princefs as yet; and thit
having forbidden me incerrupting her, I durft noc adfercife her of his being there. Do iKf
afflid you felf, fair Felixana, faid he unto me, for a thing which is infinitely pleafing tonif;
and if you will render me perfedly happy, trouble not my good fortune in doubting of tiis
trucb.   Whar, faid I unto him exceedingly furprized, do you come to fee che Princefs, ml

</p>
<p>held by fome body; that Ifmael and "Ftrca are of his party; that they bate Vhmahitx^[^
he is of ours; that the J'o/)^/our Father is not fenfible of love to his children; and thatthe
paffions, which predominate in him, prevail with him over all things. Juft hereupon wefj^
Ifmael, 'T&gt;erca,vr\d all her women appear afar off, fo thac to flicw there was no myftery in out
talk fhe went to meet them, and going away prayed us, that wc would fever out felves far
from all others, to think of that flie had faid to us, and that in the Evening I ftionld tell her
the refolution we had taken.   I led Prince Mahamedt\\tn into another alley, where we wete
ftill for all thac in the fighc of the Princeffes; and there, after we had well confidered the mat¬
ter, we refolved, that ic was needful, before it fliould break forcb, to difcover, whetherthc
Sophi authorized the love of Deliment • whether Ifmael and Perca had any intelligence with
him, or any intereft in this love; thatfor this effedZ^/^jw^j was to be made ufe of lot fo
much as regarded tbe Sophi; and that I on my part fliould endevor to know the fecretsof
Perca, by the means of a maid whom (he had loved very much, and who did noc hate me-
and that when we knew the truth of the bufinefs, it would be far more eafie for us to remedy
the fame; for in fine, faid I, if the Sophi doth not proted Deliment, he will be loft asfoon
as be underftands of his infolence; and if Percahenot interefled in chis aftair, the difcourfe
which he hath ufed to the Princefs will quickly make her change party, wben fhe knowsit:
buc if th^ Sophi, asit is very likely,  hach given fome fecret hopes to Deliment; andthit
Tercaontheoihetfide hath any fhare in this adventure, it would be to no purpofe to com¬
plain precipitoufly Co them of the infolence of this man, feeing they are the caufe of it; and
other remedies are to be fought out.  But Prince Mahamed faid unto me, Is it poflibletht
the Sophi (who heretofore, as I have underftood, hach beenfo rigorous an obferver of the
Laws ofthis Empire, thac hc banifhed the Sacrap Arfalon, for marrying a maid that wasnot
noble) fhould fo fhamefully infringe them for him. In authorizing the love oi Deliment! This
is a thing, my Lord, faid I unto him, whereof we muft be cleared by the way which! be
fliewed.   This difcourfe being finifhed, and our refolution taken, I perceived that we were
a great way diftant from the Princeflles, fo that turning the Prince about, hc obferved that I
would recondud him to a place, where he would not have the liberty Co fpeak unlome;
wherefore ftanding ftill, and wringing me a lictle by the hand; go not fofaft, faid heunto
me, itniabk Felixana, and be pleafed, that as y^Arwwjri* hach to day judged you worthyof
communicacing all her fecrets unto you, fo I may acquaint you wich one of mine thac concfiK
my life; to theend thac our interefts being fo well joyned together, cur party miybetk
moreftronger, and our enemy the weaker.  And whenl had anfweredhim, cbat it waseafie
for him to judg by my paft adions of the defire I had to ferve him; you may well think, hid
he unto me, according to the difcourfe which my fifter ufed Co me, that I fhould lack reafon,
in making proteftations of love unto yco, were I not conftrained thereunto by the forceof
truchand my paffion.   Proteftations of love tome, my Lord, faid I? Yts, dearmaid,ic-
plyed he; and though I know very well, how it is an bard thing to beleeve, and hard to per¬
fwade, thac a blinde man, who cannot truly figure unco himfelf what Beauty is, fliould he
defpcracely in love with you; yet is it certain that none hath ever been fomuch as IJW |
hear all thofe that come neer you, talk to you of the attrads of your eyes, of the bcautjo
your complexion, of your ftature, and ofyour neck ; buc I hear none tell you, that youtfoul
is fair, that your fpirit is great and generous, that your goodnefs is excream, and that in o"-
clufion you are the mofi virtuous perfon that is in the world; yet is it with thefe beauties tto
my foul is touched; and chey are they which doubtlefs render my love more ftrong and wre
pure, then all thofe, which, as I have heard fay, are deftroyed by the lofs of tbac beautyi«
i^ unknown to me.   But that which I have for you ftiall certainly laft as long as my h'Ji '°J
the beauty, difcreet Felixana, which I adore in you, cannot be deftroyed by cime. I' f
be rigorous to me, continued he, Ifliallexcufeyourrigorby theknowledglbaveof my J-

Lreft you have therein, you may employ your felf with che more care   I received th., d.f-

this Prince pleafed me, as becaufe 1 knew he loved, and very much Sjctn^d Vlama and Axt-
timira-, but in fuch fore howfoever, as I engaged my fclf to nothing.   In the mean time
we came CO the Princeffes, and with them we iouni'Delment, whom Ifmael had fent for
bytheperfwafionof P^rc^. As (oon as he faw me neer to my fellows, he came to quarrel
with mefor having walked fo long with thePrince, and feparating mc fromhim   without
an.' incivility, becaufe tbe Gentleman, thac ufed to lead Mahamed, had lenc him his tiand a-
gain, I quickly difcerned by hisdifeourfe, chat chere was a greac intelligence between the
Sophi and bim: For as foon as be faw me alone, he bf gan to tell me, that I was the happieft
perfon of my fex, ifl knew well how to manage che affedion which the Sopht bore me j
that be gave me chis advice as ray fervanc; and thac if I pleafed, he would ferve me in it
with all his power.  I thanked bim coldly enough for chis offer, and told bim, howl knew
very well, that all my happinefs came from the Sophi, feeing the beautiful Axiamira made
up all my felicity; and faying fo, I returned Co my fellows, which already were going after
the Princes, and Princeffes, who recired with very diffcrenc choughts.   For Axiamira had het
minde filled wich choller and hace; Mahamed added Co all thofe things the love he bore to
me&gt; Perca thoughc to work foby ber artifices, as we underftood afterwards, that a man,
who was of no greac birch, fhould marry her fifter, Co che end fhe might make ufe of ic when
time Ihould fcrve: Deliment imagined how he might deceive all the world for the facisfying
of his love and his ambition; and Ifmael alone knew noc very well what he was thinking on.
As for me,I was fo furprized wich the infolency of Deliment towards the Princefs,of the arti¬
fice of Perca,of che love of Mahamed,^nd of chac of the Sephi,as I could fcarcely fpeak. But in
fine,my Lord,tbac I may noc amufe my fclf Coo long about peccy things, having fuch great ones
to tell you, you fhall underftand that we learned a little after, by the addrefs of Vlama, by the
intelligence which I goe ftora Perca's confident, and by the innocency &amp; fimplicity of Ifmael,
all che feyeral defigns ofthefe intereffed perfons. As for the Sophi, the greateft intereft that be
had in this affair,was only in ray perfon; for though he durft not fpeak to me of his paffion,for
the reafon I have alledgedj yet was ic fo ftrong,as he was conftrain'd to difcover it to Deliment,
who prorpifed bim co fpeak to rae of ie; and in cafe I fliould not be difcreet enough to con¬
ceal this fecrec from others, be would be fo confident as to difavow all that he had faid to me.
Vor Ddlimegt, he had a long time before won an old Satrap, in whom the Sophi very much
confided for tbe affairs of che Empire, and who had ofcentimes perfwaded him by Deliment's
diredion, thac tbe Law, which had caufed Arfalon to be baniftied, was very judicioufly
made for his fubjeds, but noc for him; perfwading him, that Kings, which did not marry
their daughters CO forraign Princes, were never Co admit the nobleft andthe greateft of their
fubjedsinco their alharce; becaufe ebac moft commonly was to take Tucors, in taking fons
in law of an high birth; and chac for the good of the Prince, of the State, and of the Prin¬
ceffes. It would be better to do ocherwife.  For, faid he unto him one day, comin-topar-

<p>of State, which wereadvantageous to DJ;»«f«f, for him to befo : and indeed far fiotnlv
ing difpleafed with it, he embraced, and told him, that bis hop«s might go fo hieh, as that il"
permitted him to lift up bis eyes, even to the Princefs Axiamira. For, faid be unto him li
Nature hath not given me children, which can govern chis Empire, I would be willing tb
love and fortune would give me fuch a one as Deliment, who may, if not be Sophi afia ni
at leaft-wife counfel him that fliall be.   Deliment, cunning and dextrous as he was, made as
though he did noc beleeve thac which che Sophi faid co him, and out of a feigned tefpeft not
feeming to acknowledg chac to be bis paffion, che Suphi faid unco him, to oblige bim thtteun-
to, thatit being noc fo Far from him to che ?r'mctfs Axiamira, as from me to tbe J'eoii of
Perfiia, he was not to fear thac he would thence forward oppo(e an unequal affedion, feeing
he had difcovered his unto him.   Buc when as Deliment continued faying, thac refp'eft wa
flronger in him chen all ocher things, the Sophi, thac he mighc know whether ic were Ax'n.
w/rrt indeed whom be was in love withall, cirryed him co her lodging ^ and ic was then that
tb*; rafli man was fo audacious, as to fpeak with fuch infolency Co che Princefs.  For where¬
as he had tryed thac love could noc move her, he beleeved that ambieion might; and that the
hope of reigning over Terfia would move her more, then the certainty wherein flie was oi
reigning over his heart.  As for the Princefs Perca, they bad a long time before created toge¬
ther, and he had perfwaded ber, thac che Crown of Perfia was co be fhared between her
and her fifter; and for that effed fb- was Co be kepc from marrying any man, whofegeneto.
fity (for fo ic was char he fpake) fhould carry him co let ftupid/y«»&lt;2f/, or blinde .^(jiMwd
reign.  And when he made a fhew of feeking ouc, who in che Coure mightbe Ax umiLis
husband, he play'd bis part fo well, thac he led her, as cunning as fhe was, to the point hede-
fired.  For after fhe had raufcd awhile, as well as h;, what need have we, faid ftie untohim,
Co feekfo far oft for chac, which we may finde in the perfon of Delment.? He, feeming to
have no other intereft in this affair then the good of the Princeffes,hcld off a good while,thsthfl
might be the more preft unco it. But ac length, being come to agreement abouc cheir conditi¬
ons, they judged, that albeit Ifmael was noc capabk of rendering a party much ftronger then if
he were not of it, yet ic would be advancageous for them to feize upon bis fpirie; and Tiru
took the care to do it.   As indeed, flie eafily perfwaded him, that ic was requifite Aximn
fhould be marryed to a man chat depended on him, and not on Mahamed, who after tlie
death of the Sbphi might trouble him, in demanding a greac porcion, as if he were not bliiiil;
fo that to weaken his party, ic would be good to marry Axiamira to Deliment, who would
tye himfelf wholly to his interefts.   Behold, my Lord, themocives and the caufes of M
ment's infolency to Axiamira; of the difcourfes which he mide to me touching the loveof
the Sophi; of the perfwafions of Perca and Ifmael; and of the unquiecnefs, which thisim-
pleafing entanglement gave us.   For being advercifed of pare of thefe things, which weDn-
derftood much better afrtrwards, ?mce AlahameJ, ylxiamira,^ Vlama, and I, whowo
alfo ofthe counfel, refolved, that thePrincefs fliould always treat JD&lt;r//»?f»rwithagre«
deal of coldnefs and indifferency; wichouc giving him for all chac any nocable caufe of coffl-
plaining: That the beft would be carefully co avoyd all occafions wherein the Sophi ffliglit
fpeak of this man; it being more expedient, that the miccer fhould noc break forth but upon
extremityjbecaufe it might arrive thac ic would noc have a ft quel fo grievous as we forefawit:
That in the mean time wc fliould labor to kiPerca know.chac Deliment did noc intend to uft
hixbmet, then Ifmael and Mahamed: Thac for me, I fliould receive the difcourfe, whij
he fliould make me concerning the Sopht's love, as a thing I did noc beleeve, and chad wo»
not have to be true; and tbac I fliould give him as little occafion as I could to fpeak torn
it. I offered the Princefs to retire to my facher under precexc of a fuppofed ficknefs, buiiitis
good-will which flie bore me oppofed ir, Vance Mahameds love hindred ic abfolutdf-"|

all, becaufe if the Sophi did love me, he would be fo incenfed thereby, as he mighc peradven¬

hehad fecrec apprehenfions which inceflancly cormenced him; the power of ''J.^'^^"".||j
him afraid, neither was hefo affured of my conftancy, buc that he feared ambition wo
move me more then his love. Buc whereas it was not long before I perceived his unqui«   '

St would not permic him co chink fo foon of a fecond marriage e'p cally wuh a perfon,
whofe birch, though noble and illufinous enough, came not nee. forall that to the former,
things being in thefe terms, we were a go.d wh.le without having any great occafion to  n-

fo ofcen as Dehmcnt fpake co me of rhe Sophi's love, 1 made as though I did not bthevc there
was any truth in his wotds; Tachma. being thereof advertifed.ind defiring to give me a proof
of the efteem he made of that they called beauty in may face, he did a thing, which bath fince
been the caufe of a greac deal of mifchief; for, generous Ibrahim, it happened tor our ill tor-
eunc, tbac there arrived abouc chat time at this Courc a Painter of £«re/»^ whom chance, or
the defire of cravelling had broughc thither, and thac drew pidures in lietle, fo admirable re¬
fembling che life, as che like had never been hear of.   And ae the fame time certain Merchants
came thither alfo, who, amongft other rarities, which they had, made fliew of a number of
the pidures of the faireft women of fuch feveral Nations, as they had pafied through.   Thefe
two chings joyned cogecher, caufed the Sophi, ouc of the defign he bad ro oblige rae, to give
command thac all the maidens of qualicy, which were at che Courc, fliould prefenc themfelves
ac his Palace on a cercain day, appoinced for it, cogether wich the Princefles and their maids,
fumpruoully apparelled.  This ceremony, whereof we knew noc thecau(e(for they made a
fecret ot it) fomewhat troubled us, butae lengch that day bei.^g arrived, and all this fair Af¬
fembly compleated, che Sophi followed by Ifmael, Mahamed, Vlama, Deliment, and the
Paincer, of whom I have fpoken to you, enrred into the room, where we were all fee in or¬
der, buc wichouc che Princeffes holding the rank, which they ought Co have had, for fo had
rhe Sophi ordained ic; and that which alfo redoubled the impatience we were in, to know
for what reafon chey had caufed us Co be accired fo richly, was, co fee the Sophi hold in his
righc hand ewo Crowns of gold fet with Diamonds, and caking the Paincer wich his left hand,
whom neither the Princeffes, nor any of their maidens knew as yet, to fay unro him, thac
he cftabliflied him che judg of che beaucy of all chofe which compofed this fair Afferably; as
knowing beceer, then thereft of the world, che juft proporcion of thffeacures of the face;
that which made up che delicacy, f reflinefs, and vivacicy of the complexion; and what the
difference wasbecween an animaced beauty, and another tbac hach no life nor grace in ir.
And chac to make bim give a more equicable fenccnce, hehad fo ordered it, as he could not
difcern the condition of the fair ones,ot whora he was che judg; buc howfoever that he never¬
thelefs referved co himfelf the righc of crowning chem, whom he fliould judg co be wor-

of chem, thatfo none mighc be difobliged, he finiffied his firft turn, none being able Co judg
thac he had given advantage to any; neverthelefs I perceived, when the Painrer made a ftand
before me, thac the Sophi, feeing me caft down my eyes, as pretending co no pare in this vido¬

Merchants, whohadfliew'd him fo many forraign beauties; but with an oath, thatthe
fliould never fell them to any but Princes, and thac they fhould always referve one of each J
them in their own keeping, to publifh ^Arww/r«'j beauty and mine overall the Countries
through which chey cravelled.   Thefe Merchants promifed all thac he required, and lor out

d^y Deliment perfecuted me more then ordinary, ic feeming unto him tbac IwasnoWei
to doubt of the Sopht's love, afcer thac which he had faid unco me.   And whereas I defirej
ta decline his encounter, ss much as I could, I ftood ofcentimes talking with Prince ylf^.
med; becaufe chough he concemned him, yec his qualicy'made him chac he durft not feparate
me from him, when we were in difcourfe rogetber.  And I remember thac one day, as this
poor Prince was entertaining me, and chac Deliment was come Co che Princeffes with IJmul
ouc of a defign Co fay fomething to me from che Sophi, chis infolenc man did fo tar lofe the
refped which he owed to Mahamed, as I hated him for ic more chen I did before. Ihavt
already told you bluftiing, generous Ibrahim, that this Prince was in lovewich me; and
though I had noching but good-will for him, and that Vlama abfolutely poffeffed my heart,
yec did I in fome fore comply wich MahameJ, for his difcourfe was fo virtuous, and fo ob¬
liging, though paflionace, as if Vlama hid heird ic, I verily think he could noc haveiattii
this illuftrious Rival.  I was alfo willing to conferve the good-will of the fon, out of thein-
tent I had to refufe thejove of the father.   It was then with his paflion that Mahmd en¬
tertained me that day, when as 'Deliment had fogrcat a defire to fpeak with me, and thit
finding himfelf hindred from it by the Princes prefence, bethought good to obferve both te
adions and mine. And whereas ic is hard for the motions of the face not to give forae mills
of thofe of the heart, efpecially when love poffeffcth it; Deliment perceived fomethiij
which was extraordinary in that of the Prince; for Mahamed, albeit he was blinde, yc:
came up clofe Co me, as if he could have feen me; and becaufe his eyes could noc adveiiifc
him when there was any one neer us that could hear him, and that ic would have but putra:
in remembrance of his defed if he fhould have faid any thing Co me of ic, he always uied to

<p>Tv'e  fee me more.   This laft jeer fo mightily incenfed Mahamed, as he would have goneto
hat pare where he heard the voycc of Delment; buc knowing chat his misfortune would not
oermiehis coming ae him co punifli his audacioufnefs, I recained him tbe beft Icodd; and
roc thinking of Perca's Confident being chere. Let this fenflefs fellow go, my Lord, laid 1
ante bim, and confider that your hand is too noble to punifli his arrogance; and that in Itead
of doing him an affront, you will do him an honor, whereof he is not worthy.   At this
noife the Princeffes opened che C'abinee, and Axiamira asking what thematter was, faw
Ptince^/^i'^'^wf^ exceedingly moved; Icis, anfwered he, an infolency of Df/jw*»f/, which
I may not tell you fo fuddenly; for,my dear fifter, chofe of his party are yec too ftrong here.
Ptrca fecming not Co underftand chat chis difcourfe was addreffed to her, I affure my felf, faid
this fubtle Princefs, chat chis was one of Deliment's merrimencs, which the Prince hath mif-
underftood ; hue left chis diforder, concinued flie,fliould oblige che Sophi to forbid the Princes
from bringini? any body Co our lodging, I will go and endevor to appeafe this tempeft. Spare
thac pain, replyed Mahamed; for cercainly, on my pare, ic fliall never be appeafed but with
the death of 'Deliment.  But Terca, without anfwering this difcourfe, took Ifmael by the
hand, and all amazed as he was, carryed him away whither flie pleafed. We were no fooner
ac liberty Co talk, but Mahamed recounccd to the Princefs Axiamira all Deliment's infolen¬
cy, and ehae withfo much choller, and marks of rcfencment, as made me much to pity this
poor Prince. Will you endure, dear fifter, faid he unto her, that the Enemy of Mahamed
fliall become che husband of Axiamira .? That a man, which hach made ufe of your cham¬
ber, as of a fanduary, co affrone me wich impunity, fliall be yet fo audacious as to pretend
to the poffeffion of your perfon ? Ah 1 no, you are too generous to have fuch bafe thoughts:
and I hope, though my eyes are not able to guide my hand foasicmay give this Infolent an
hundred ftabs, yec char yours will ac che leaft cake all che revenge of him you can, in fhew¬

perfecute him inccdantly, or to fay betcer, until fuch time as I havefound out a man generous
enough to guide my zxm, or to lend rae his.   Vlama enered into the chamber juft at that in¬
ftant, and having heard thofe laft words, wichout giving che Princefs leafure to anfwer, he
vtent to Mahomed, and affured bim, thac excepc it were againft the perfon of the Jop/j*, he
might difpofe of him in any thing, and employ him in fuch revenge as he pleafed.   Maha¬
med having quickly known Vlama by his voyce: Ah 1 generous Vlama, faid he unto him,

rage againft an infamous fellow, who cannot pretend to any other part of valor, but that
which thole cruel beafts may have, who are noc valianc, buc becaufe they are ftrong, and

hamed gxevj che more incenfed wich talking, made him enter into her Cabinet with Vlama,
and me; where we no fooner were, buc flie beginning co fpeak, affured Mahamed, that flic

them to employ ehe time in cor/idering, whethex Mahamed ftiould complain wik Soph^
or whether he fhould ftay, to fee in what manner Deliment would live with him for thcf'
ture, afcer he had forbidden him his preience.    This advice Iteming juft unto thtm, they be
gan to examine the matter. As fox Mahamed, he would neicher comphin, nor ftay, but
onely revenge himfelf.   Vlama, who forefaw cbat no good could come of this rcvenee ei¬
ther for the Prince, or for the Princefs, or for himfelf, ftay'd rill v^x/^w»/rrf had ddivered'hct
opinion, pretending chac he was noc to fpeak his, inregard, faidhe, thatit bdongcdondy
to him to execute chac which the Prmcefs and Mahamed fhould tcfolve upon.   So that Axl
amirabeing unwilling to fpeak alone by her felf, commanded me to fay what I thought wis
fit to be done in this affair.   I confefs co you, generous/^rrf/;/»?, chat notwithftandine the
hace which I bare CO Z)f/i»!Jt'«r, I advifed, chac things fliould be gently carryed; andthatif

ing him J buc upon condiclon neverchelefs, ehae he fliould appear as fcldom as he might in
places where Mahamed fliould be.   And chac which carryed rae hereunto, was the thought
that if Z/*/&lt;«»*,« enrerprized any thing againft Z'f///wi;«f, ehe leaft that could arrive unto me by
it would be, that Vlama would be conftrained to abfcne himfelf, and leave me in the power
of the Sophi.   Asfor che Princefs, fhe was of che opinion, thac a gendeman ftiould be lent
from Mahamed co complain co the Sophi of Deliments infolency; and chat withall great
care ftiould bf; caken to publifli ic, becaufe, faid fhe to Mahamed, it will be requifite to make
him be contemned and haced of every one,as much as poffibly we can,chae we make ufe of that

with his remericy and audacioufnefs; and whereas he is rich and liberal, he hach parcitans and
fervancs, who durft not declare chemfelves to be fo, if they knew chat you and I did lute
him.   Why, fifter, replyed Mahamed, would you have me publifh, thac I have receivedin
affrone wich impunity ? Yes, faid fhe, I would have icpublifhcd, ehae you may be revenged
of Deliment, feeing you may do ic withouc offence to your reputacion.   Confider, added
flic, chac if the generoficy of Vlama fhould carry him co fighc wich DAiment, your revenge
would bedoubcful, fince you cannoc be ignorane, chacchefuccefsof Arms is always fo, and
if peradvencurc ic fliould coft you the blood and fortuntof fo excellent a man, you would

confiderations; leeing my fortune, my blood, and my life, could rioc be employed more

which he had to Deliment, his virtues, his merit, the affedion he bare to the Princes and
Princeffes; and/»^»tf, continued he, the greateft mark that can be given me of the paffion
one is in for my fervice, is, to render the fame honors to Delment, as if he were my fon;
and as for you, faid he, leaning on yI^&lt;iiS'4&gt;»/r&lt;i'.r flioulder, I command you to love Deliment,
and to live well with him. It would be methinks more juft, replyed ihePdnce, that you
would ordain him not to affront me, fince he cannot do (o without qftending you.  I dp ex¬
cufe, anfwered the Sophi, the ill opinion you have of Z)*//w««», feeing it isnot occafioned
buc by the litde knowledg yoa have ofhis intentions.  But howfoever Iwill be obeyed;
and wichouc examining whecher my pleafure be unjuft or equitable, I command you to jre-
ceive his fubmiffions and his friendfhip.   Hereupon Deliment began to fpeak, and difguifing
the malice of his foul, he faid fo many obliging things to Mahamed, as if he had not perfeft¬
ly known bis wickednefs, he might have beleeved that he was cjpable of repenting.   So it
was, that Mahamed was conftrained to make fliew of no longer refenting the offence he had
received. This peace brought great joy to "Pfrr*?; but/^^Arwwira'i coldnefs made it appa-
rane enough thae chey were noc boch of one party.   The Sophi continued yet fome time in
talking of indifferent things, during the which he flill fixed his eyes on my face: And where¬
as out of a fenfe of compaffion, and to avoyd his looks, I turned my head all that while to¬
wards Mahamed, he began to chink that there might be fome verity in Deliments fqfpicion.
He was no fooner returned to his lodging, but thinking of the means to be cleared therein,
he conceived that the gentleman, who ferved to guide Mahamed, might peradventure be he
from whom he mighe learn fomething.  He had no fooner communicated this defign to Deli¬
ment, bue that having apprwed of it, he thought of nothing elfe then execucing it.   And to
that purpofe he waiced, chat he might give no fufpicion to ^&lt;*/)4Wtf«/, till he was retired in
the Evening, for at thae time che Prince not ufing to ftir forth any more, always left his guide
at liberty; Deliment, who had caufed him to be watched, was no fooner advertifed that he
was come out of the Princes chamber, but he made him be fecretly told, that the Sophi would
'peak with him.   This man, who had not been accuftomed to receive fuch like favor«, pre-
leneiyobeyed; and the Sophi, joyning che hope of agreat fortune, prefents, and entreaties,
to his commands, had quickly fuborned his fidelity. After then that he was well affured of

was not without unquietnefs; The fpight to be fo ill entreated by the Sophi, and fo unwcr

into no litde pain: And then again, when he came to think, that the next day he fhould en

or to be alone.  The Princefs underftood well enough what the Prince defired of her'
fo that as (oon as fhe had met wich occafion fit for ie, fhe went to fee Mahamed, carry'
ing none with her bat an old Governefs, one of ray fellows, and mc. Buc Terca, havirg
underftood chat Axiamira was gone to fee Prince Mahamed, who was noC well, perfwaded
Ifmael and Deliment to go thiehet too; fo that we were hardly arrived ac M^ihmeis

The Prirce was fo enraged ae it, as Axiamira, fearing he fliould be carryed to fome violence,
made hafte tobe gone, fo chat meeting rhem in the anei-chamber, where fhe ftay'dchen),Ihe
told them that the Prince being afleep, flie would not fuffr tiim tobe awaked, and thereby
obliged them to return.   In the me^n timt Mahamed, who could &gt;iul forbear giving me to
underftand, that he hved ftill forme, called to him his guide, nm)edAmariel, whoolten-
times ferved him alfo for a Secretary. He recommends fecrecy and difcretion to him, and
after he had made him fwear an hundred falfe oaths,he didaces a leccer unto him for me, whicd
he wrote very faichfully; And having caufed him to read ic over more chen once unto hiu,
he gives him order to go che next morning for to know how the Princefs does, and then to de¬
liver me that letter as fecretly as he could.   Amariel promifes to acquie himfelf thereof ashe
ought; and very glad of his adventure, he retires from the Prince, and goes wich all fpeed to
do an ad of fideliey to ehe Sophi, and of treachery to Mahamed. The Sophievit^t% himex-
traordinarily, and aking the leccer with very much impatience, he fees that it wasextreamlji

what counfel he ftiould take ? T&gt;eliment, as more cunning, and lefs preoccupaced, told hm,
how by this letter well confidered one might eafily fee, thit Mahamed was paffionately in
love wich me, bue that one could not judg, whether I anfwered his paffion or no; fothstto
be cleared therein, Amariel was Co deliver this letter to mc, and crave an anfwer of it. Tha:
for his part, he beleeved thac I did not hate him, becaufe oneof Perca's maids had heard m
fay fomewhat, as ftic went out of Axiamira's chamber, that made him chink fo. This refo¬

alitjiefufpicious, though out of difcretion hemakesaslicrle fliew of icas maybe, hearing
the noifc which the Letter made in turning ie from che one fide to tbe other, (f, r it was indif¬
ferent long) imagined that there was fome myftery in it which he did not comprehend • thai
peradventure the Sophi had during his ficknefs abfolutely gained me, and thac tbe pap^T

on of clearing himfelf of a doubt,wh!ch gave him fo much urq lietnefs; fo that at fuch tinn
as I never dream'd of it, and chac I was folding up Vlama s Leccer again, and deeply muling
on thac which I had read, Mahamed direding his hand by the noife which I made in doing
it up, chance led it fo juft where it fhould be, chac he fnatched ic from me fooner then I was

he did infinitely fear to difpleafe me, yet did he fear much more to be over-reached. And
then again, beleeving Amariel to be very faichlul, he thought he fhould hazard nothing, in
refolving to let him read it.   In this opinion the .more I importuned him, ehe more did hc
defend himfelf fromaccording chat which I required; and I verily beleeve chac in fogreati

O-owH ■ for ic was crue, chac Deliment entertained me dayly wich fuch like matcers. Ithmk,
mv Lord, anfwered Deliment, how that Vehtch renders Felixana inflexible ts. That the know,
ledg of your greatnefs permits her not to beleeve, that you Wil I forget it for her advantage ;
and the refttfals Vehichft^e makes, are nothing doubtlefs but that fhe maj be the more ftrong-
ly affured of that which fhe defires it may be more then you. No fuch matter, replyed Che
Sophi, and thti which I have here Veill certainly make you change your opinion; in faying
fo, he fliewed him Vlamp's Leccer, whereby chey knew but too well the good-will that was
becwixe us, and how much he was informed ot chac which the Sophi bore me. Ac fitft,
all r^c/!)W.M thoughts ran into violence; he would commie me Co prifon; he would deftroy
Vlama ; and his gentleft refolueions were ac leaft Co banifh him.
</p>
<p>^m Deliment, who always joyned cunning to wickednefs, told him, that che firft ching
he fhould do, was, eo banifh Felixana from ehe heare of Vlama, and Vlama from cbe heart
of Felixana; tbac Co begin by che eafieft, Vlama was to be dextroufly acquainced, that!
had a particular commerce wich Mahamed; and chac Co perfwade him the beceer thereunco,
he was to be fhewed fome of the letters which I had written Co ehe Prince,and which ehey had
recained; leting him know,in giving them to hirn,tbat they were che firft he had received from
me; ehae Co difquiet him further, his own Letter was eo be fliewed him, wich an affurance
ihat I had pue ie inco bis hands, tor to give him an undoubced mark of my affedion; and thac
ac the very fame cime, whtn as chis crick had exciced crouble in his foul, he was co be com¬
manded Co gee inftantly ouc of ehe Palace, and the next day from the Court, with order to
retire co the Province, whereof he was Governor; co the end he mighc noe have leafure co
clear himfelf Co me; and chac beleeving he was becrayed, he might have the lefs care to let me
hear from bim. Thac things being in chefc terms, ic would be the eafier to vanquifli me, be¬
caufe not knowing tbe occafion which Vlama had to be incenfed againft me, I would take it
ill chac he did neither write to me, nor fee me before his departure. That the moft important
pc)inc of chis sft'air was, to be fo well affured of all chofe which came neer me, as I mighc re¬
ceive no Leteers from Vlama; and thac m fine, the abfence of a Lover was a greac advantage
for a Rival.
</p>
<p>The Sophi found this advice to be very good, and thinking on nothing buc how to exe¬
cute ic, chey turned their eyes upon one of Mahamed's Officers, thac had before rimes ferved
VUma, who had rid himfelf of him by reafon of his bad inclinations. They caufed him
tobcfoughcouc, and having immediately found and fuborned him, he without furcber de¬
lay (afcer he had been inftrudcd by Delment whac to fay, and had Vlama's Letter, and ehree
ot thofe which I h^d mitten to Mahamed, pue into his hands) wencdiredly lo Vlama

<p>too much notice of his thoughts; and therefore to keep him from it, he made as thn^oi, J
were exceedingly bufied about the affairs of Caramania, vihexe the Sophi intended 3 l

to you, and you have brought to me.                                                       '            ^'

<p>This Agent of the Sephi'% found him then in fuch an eftate as they defired for the furprizjnp
of hirn; became to him, and finding him alone, makes him'a long difcourfe of the inclinitf
on which he had always had to his fervice; protefting untohim that he would never rdin-
quifli it; that he acknowledged him ftill for his Matter, and chat to render him a prod of
his affedion, he came, without confidering Prince i^*^(i»)f&lt;:f'/ interefts, to advertife him of
a Treafon which I committed againft him. Vlama upon chis occafion had a fecret fpfpi.
cion of this mans malice; and imagined thac he was fent unco him to difcover whethct there
were any intelligence beewixt us; fo that nothing moved with chis difcourfe, / than\ tkti
laid he untohim, for thy z^eal andafeClion; but k»ow, my friend, that Felixana W4;M
difoblige me, but cannot betray me, having had no commerce Vpith her, nor havino tvtr
trufied any thing to her difcretion. I perceive very ^ell, my Lord, anfwered this man
that you do not truft in mine ; but it may be this Letter,Vc'hich I prefent you Voith,willi)tttcr
perfwade my fidelity unto you. In faying fo, he gave him chat which he had written to me.
You may judg now whecher Vlama were aftoniflied when he came toknow it; Howbeit
this firft motion being over, he imagined further, that I peradventure mighc have loft it, and
fome one have found it. But che cunning of this man left him noc long in chis opinion; for fee¬
ing Vlama moved, and capable of being perfwaded, he told him. That Prince AUhmd had
loved me a great while, andthat I alfo loved him; Thatfo long ashc beleeved, that there
could no other harm arrive to him, chen to bc deceived by me, he durft noc betray Mik-
med; buc having feen by the Letter, which he had written to me, andwhich, hefaid, 1 bad
put inco the Princes hands, thac he fpake in fuch fort, as if it came to the Sophi'% knowledg,
his fortune would be utterly ruined ; he was refolved to make ufe of the Princes blindnefsto
draw it with addrefs from out of his hands j and, my Lord, continued he, tofhev ytittk
I fffeak, truth, I have taken alfo three of tbe Letters ^hich Felixana hath Written utk
Prince in the beginning of their afeSlion; ftr as for the refl, I durll not meddle ^ith thtm,
becaufe as they are more obliging, fo the 'Prince makes them to be read unto him almofiitp
ty by Amariel, '^ho is the Confident of this love.
</p>
<p>Vlama barkened to t.his difcourfe, looked on her Letters and his, knew the hands, mi
no longer doubting of myinfidelicy, he thanked chis wicked man, and asked him an hundred
queftions about the love that was between ehe Prince and me. But the other fearing thithe
would demand fo many things of him, as in the end he might coneradid himfdf in fome one
or other, he befought him he would be pleafed to let him depart, for fear left if any ot Prince
Mahamed's Officers fhould fee him go out of his lodging fo long afcer he was entred ino
it, ihey might fufped the truth. Vlama deceived by chis artifice, difmiffed him, promifed
to recompence him, and prays him to continue advertifing what fhould pafs betwixt PrWK
Mahamed and me.
</p>
<p>He was hardly out of Vlama's chamber, when, according to Deliment's advice, that ow
Satrap, whom as I have told you he had corrupted, came and commanded him from the
Sophi to go itiftantly out of the Palace, and che next day to depart to his Government, until
he received further order.   And whereas 'L'irtiw^ importuned hira to tell him, whyhewij
entreated after that manner ? The .J^i/rrf;? anfwered him, That the Soiphi onely k"'^''''"^
that he had charged him not to leave him tilh he "Hoas out of the Palace.   Seeing then»**"
thittgmore re fling forme, in(wered Vlama, but to give markj of my obedience, h0*i
given enough already of my fidelity and courage in other occafions, let us obey withont'^^'^-
muring. He had no fooner faid fo, but he prepared to be gone; howbeit fuddenly rerr.jj_
Bering, that he left all the Letters which I had written him in his Cabinet, JiewentDoi J
thither to take them away; and without knowing whether it were out of a fenfe ot en
or love, either to teeror preferve them, he took a lictle China coffer, wherein they w i
the old Satrap, who walked fairly and foftly before, never perceiving it.               , ,r ^

<p>But whil'ft thefe things paffed in fuch fort, Vx'mce Mahamed, who had layd hiroic ,
his bed by reafon of a weaknefs wherewith he had been taken, re-affumed new ^^^f-l^
calling for Amariel, hc was told that he was gone forth, bur for all that he arofe, ^^^^ i^^^

the cruth of everything, for I could not be ignorane thac fhe was well acquainced with l'-
lama's hand; So ehae falling on my knees before her, I perceive very well, Aladam, faid I
unto her, that all my faults are known to you, andthat coming with a purpofe to accnfent]
felf, there is nothing mere left for me to do, then to beg your pardon for them, after I l:d
tryed neverthelefs to render them more excufable then the incenfed Jpirit of Prince Mi-
med would make them appear to you.   ^omplain not of the Prince, anfwered Aximiu,
fince if he be culpable of any thing, it ts of being too little fenfible of ycur fault; wW
yet I ought not to condemn in him, fince notwithftanding the ii'.jury you have done m, I
have indulgence enough fttll to hear your reafons, or rather your excufes,   AfterlfisJ
thanked ehe Princefs for this grace, I began to recounc unco her all chac had pift betwixt "'-
lama and me; for whereas I beleeved chac I faw his Leccer lie by che Princefs, and that 1 was
fure flie knew his charadcr, I difguifed noching unco her: Buc for fo much as regarded thf
Prince, I could noc tell very well how to fpeak of it; for noc knowing whac he had faid to
Axiamira, I feared Co difpleafe him, if I fhould deliver things as chey bad paft. Howbeit
thePrincefs, having marked my unquiecnefs; Fear not, faid flie, to fpeak ofthedjft^"'^
Which my brother bears you, .feeing I am not ignorant of any one circumftance of it: h-
verthelefs, to juftifie the relation which he hath, andwhichyou have alfo made to me of it,
will know it from your mouth too.

<p>IF you had not betrayed me, I fhould have dyed with grief, rather then havedfentci

i^^t Felixana, till Felixana abandoned me. 1 cannot for all thatr^olveto part, Sfithmt
telling her once for all, that I part the moft infortunate of all men living • and that if k
end of my life may aft'ure her felicity, fhe Jhall foon be in the eflate that I defire k
to be irt.
</p>




<p>Theend of the reading hereof was to me the beginning of the fliar peft grief thatevctl
felc: And che alone choughc of being beleeved unfauhf^ul by a man, forwhom Irefufedthe
Crown of 'Perfta, was fo ftrange a corment Co me, as my reafon is noc ftrong enough tore-
tain ehe refencmene which I had of ic. Whac I Madam, faid I co che Princefs, can you live
in a place where fuch wickedneffes are commieeed? and againft perfons tbac apperninto
you? Was it not enough Co banifli'L'/^iw^, withouc perfwading him by fome impoOutf,
which is unknown Co me, thac I bad betrayed him? andiemsybc icis I which caufes him
to be banifhed. This arcifice doubtlefs hides fome greacerdefign,chen chef paratingof us;
and I greatly fear chat this violence will quickly be followed by anocher; and chac after thcj/
have taken from you che onely defender which you had here, you will know by your exp-T-
ence, that you have as much incereft, as Felixana, in cbe confervaeion of Vlama. For fure¬
ly Deliment thinks not fo much of concencing che Sephis paffion, as of facisfying that whiclj
he hath for you: And this Infolenc regards you withouc doubc, as a reward chac was deftinw
to him for the conqueft which he preeends to make of me; buc f am righc certain thatdeatlj
fliall deny me her fuccor,or he fliall never triumph in chis fore. The Princefs feeing a great de^

vet was ic ac che leaft morequiee, and his defpair was curned into a more moderace affiirtion.
Mahamed alfo Would gladly have been able himfelf to have fene fome marks of his friend¬
ftiip to Vlama, buc he was fain co affure him by the hand of the Princefs, thae he would al¬
ways be nis friend, wichouc ever being his Rival again. Thefe LeeceiS being wntctn, che
fear left they fliould be incercepced came inco ray minde; fo chat eo prcvene ic, che Prmcefs
fene for an old Slave, whom flie had proved to bevery faithful, and having given them to
him, ftie commanded him to attend thae of Vlama ac ehae gacc of the Ci;y where be was to
pafs- and there to deliver chem to him in fuch fore, ss no body might perceive ir. This pro¬
vidence was noe in vain, for this Slave of V lamas was no fooner come forth of tbe Princeffes
lodging.buc he wasarrefted by Deliment'soxdex,2x\d asked for ehe Leteers which he carryed to
Vlama; buc knowing very well chac he had none, he anfwered wichouc daunting, how he
was ready eo mike ic appear chat they were miftaken; and faid furcber, thae his Mafter having
had no cime to take his leave of the Princeffes, and none of his fervancs being wich him buc
he, he had fent hira wich a complemenc to them; and whereas he was hard by Perca's lodg¬
ing, he would have gone in there, to give the more colour to this officious lye; howbeit they
would not permit him cill they had throughly fearched him all oVer, to fee if he had fpoken
the cruth: And when chey found thac he had noe that which they thought he had had, they
let him go, and fo he finifhed his voyage, afterhehad taken our Letters from him to whom
we had committed them.
</p>
<p>As for us, feeing the matter in thefe terms, we refolved that the Princefs fhould affure her
fclf of them, whom the beleeved were faithful unto her, by new proteftations ofthe affedi¬
on they had promifed her. That I fhould write fecretly to my Facher, to the end chat if we
were enforced to have recourfc to excream remedies, and thae flighe was the onely one that
refted for us, Mazanderon might be in an eftate co receive us. Thae in ehe mean cime, to
prevent ehe Sophi, before hehad taken his laft refolueions, we fliould publifli the bufinefs,
complain to all the world of Deliment's infolency; and thac the nexe morning flie fliould go
and requeft ehe ^o/&gt;^&lt; to forbid him from ever feeing her again; becaufe it mighe be, thae he
durft n()e fo eafily then propound a thing to her, whereunto ftie fliewed her felf fo averfe, as
when difguifing her ehonghes in the maner flie had always done, he mighe feem eo be ignorant
that ftie had fo much repugnancy unco ic Thae to perplex him fo much the more, flie fliould
fend to encreae five or fix perfons, thae were well affedcd to her, to be prefent at the Sophi's
rifing rhe nexe day; and chat afterwards we fliould frame oar defigns according to the an¬
fwer he fliould make. That Mahamed fliould by his Governors means do whac he could to
caufe ^W4nf/to be caken; that for fo much as regarded me I fliould by no means bc abfent
from the Princefs, and that for fear of fome violence I fliould lie in her chamber in the place
ot her that always waiced upon her there. This refolution was execueed,as we had conceived

<p>though the banifttment of UUim had both furprized and affiiUed her, becaufe (he hde
him to be the moft affelied of all hii fu bjeCls to the good ofhis Empire, yet the refhell "ll
fhe bare him Would never permit her to murmur at it: And to tell you what hath br
me hither, continued flie, with both a modeft and an hardy countenance, it is not to aS
grace, but to complain of an outrage Which Ihave received, and for which I come to dm J
juftice of you, in the prefence of thofe that hear me ; for ftnce I hold the publifhing ofacrim
to be the beginning of punifhing it, I Would that all your fubje£is were Witneffes of the n-

proted het againft all that would wrong her, flie proceeded wich raore affurance chen before
I have ever beleeved,my Lord, faid fhe unto him, that having the honor to be your damkir
you would take my interefts for your own; and therefore I do not fear to tell you thiu n m^,'

Ipeak openly to me of love: And though I have forbidden him with all the feverity ■nhtrt'
of I am capable, yet when he faw that my re^feU to you k^pt me from complaining to yontf
a man whom you love, he hath continued With fo much infolency, that I was not abletofitf.
fer it any longer ; for, my Lord, having the honor to bey our daughter, I fhould be mmrtlij
to bear that glorious name, if I could endure, that a man, who Without your bomtymifkt
Without fhame be myftave, Jhould be fo audacious as to tell mt that he will be my hufjud.
Tar don me, my Lord, if 1 am carryed this Way in this occafion, fince this ralh man kjkii
infolency affronts you no lefs then me; and your intereft is no lefs confident'^ tomttki
mine own.   Howbeit I do not defire that you fliould deprive your felf of his prefence, if it
be agreeable unto you, but onely that you Will forbid Dehment from ever feeing or j|im((«|
to me more.   Behold welnigh after what manner the Princefs fpake; who, to keep the Sofk
from interrupting her, had ft) much addrefs, as not to nanje Deliment, but ac the end of het
difcourfe, which ftrangely furprized the Sophi.
</p>
<p>Now though he was very much in choller, and that he had refolved to make thismartlage,
yet durft he not before fo much company tell het openly what his minde was: Buc to difgi
the matter; I fee Well enough, Axiamira, faid he unto her, that Deliment's ^rfrf/;/ crim
is your beleeving him to bean enemy to Ulama; howfoever ftnce you have recourfc ti«j
juftice,I will neither condemn nor abfolve him,till I have heard his reafons. Which ptrdm-
ture Will not befo weak as you think: In the mean time be affured,that Delimenc &gt;?&gt;«//w'/j
any thing to you henceforward, but by order from me. The Princefs Would fain have rcplytd,
hue the Sophi made her a fign to withdraw, which flie did with a great deal of refpeft; k»-
ing the Sophi very much difpleafed, and all them thac had heard her raviflied wich hcrgenefo-
ficy, and excreamly wondering at D&lt;r//&gt;we«t'i infolency, andthehtcle refencmene which *
Sophi had flie wed. At our going from chence we met with 7/w4*/,followed by Deliment,viiB,
knowing noching of what the Princefs had done, would have obliged the Prince co conduct
her to her lodging : But Axiamira beholding him with contempt, faid unto him with an itj
cenfed voyce; / far bid thee from the Sophi to follow or to fpeak. to me ; and if thou w
know the caufe of it, repair to him, and thou ftialt learn that at laft my patience huth ^.w

I have already Cold you, illuftrious Baffa, how he who waited that day at the Sopht 9
Cabinet door, over-heard all that I have recounted unto you; for the paffion, wherewith
Deliment was carryed away, permitted him not to have fo much prudence as to fpeak low;
n-itherdid the .yo&gt;^t's love and choller leave him the fike providence. This man having heard
all thefe things, felc himfelf fo couched with the mifchiets they were preparing for us, ashe
refolved to advertife us of it.  Ic is crue indeed, that his generofity was in this occafion excited
by a particular hacred whichhe bare Deliment, who had many times oppofed the advance¬
ment of his fortune.   At length this man came in the Evening to advertife us of all thefe
things; after which we alfolearned that which had paft inthe trick that y^?»&lt;«m/had put
upon as.   For Prince Mahamed had caufed his anciene Governor fo to deal, as he had layd
hold on the Tray cor y^WfirtV/, who out of thefame weaknefs wherewich he had becrayed
his Mafter, recounced unto us how Deliment had corrupced him; and how he had carryed all
my leccers Co cbe Sophi, who had always caufed ochers to bc wriccen for Co bc fent to Maha¬
med ; from whom likewife they had retained all thofe which he had made to be written to
me, to give me counterfcic ones in ftead of them.   That afterwards he had carryed Vlama's
Leccer, which he had fnatched from me, to the Sophi; who by Deliment's counfel had cau¬
fed ic Co fall inco Vlama's hands, wich three ochers of thofe which I had effedively writeen
to the Prince.   We knew chen chac Evening all the hurt that they had done us, and all that
which they would do us; whereupon we promifed to pardon the Tray tor, and to recom¬
pence him thac was faichful unco us, difmifling chem both, with diredion to eieher ot them co
be vigilanc for ehe good of ehe Princefs.  Afcer thefe fad news our tears redoubled far more
then before.   The Princefs would dye, Iwas fully refoved to follow her, Mahamed wis
mad becaufe he could not affift us; and in fo great a trouble we lamented our misfortunes,
withouc knowing how Co avoyd chem.   "   '   ■       &lt;  •   - ■           •     ^

were certain dangerous moments, which if by prudence avoyded, our enemies can no lono^^'^
execute their bad defigns; that they were to give the Sophi leafure to refled on that whicS
was going to undertake; and to that end, when as he ftiould come to fpeak to the Princtf
flie fliould have recourfc to tears and to prayers, rather chen to reafon, which he would J,'

very likely they would not, flie fliould then requeft him co afford her fome time to refolve

Priacefs but to dye.   tAnd for my part, faid the Princefs, / k,now full well th^i Fehxsm
fiall not dye without me, and that 1 will never abandon her to the violences efmifatkr,
In conclufion, generous Ibrahim, without rchearfing this fad converfacion to you, it m
refolved, that if the King fliould accord Axiamira that which fhe was to demand of him
and yet would retain me, I fliould then defire him, with all che fhew of forrow and tendr-
nefs I could poffibly exprefs,to permit me to follow the Princefs; it being credillc that the.Jt.
phi would not refufe me the firft thing I fhould crave of him ; efpecially not mentioning ttai
my oppofing of his pleafure.   It was not becaufe the Princeffes great heart did not refift tk
following this counfel, but becaufe flie being unable to finde out any other,was forced tocon-
fent unto it.  The next day the Sophi came to the Princefs, where after he had amplified the
merit, the vercue, and the courage of Deliment, he told her that flic was not to take it ill, if
he had had the boldnefs to fpeak to her of love, feeing hc had not done it but by hisordet;
becaufe, having refolved to marry her to him, he would have been glad that he fhould have
got her good-will.   My Lord, anfwered the Princefs, with a feigned amazement, if 1 kl
known that the boldnefs, which Deliment hath ufed injpeakjng te me, had been an ejftHij
his obedience toy oh, I bad received him in another manner, I had not termed him aukc'm,
I had been contented With complaining, and not accufing of him, and had caft mjfftlf*t]i»r
feet to caufe you to change a defign, Whereunto I have fuch an averfion, as I canmt (imi
of it Without grief.   The Sophi feeing fome change, as it feemed to him, of the PrinceKfS
minde, was extream glad of it; and though he faw flie did not render her fclf, he betetved
neverthelefs, fince flie came to' entreaties, that with fome pacience he mighc vanquifh her.
This hope was that which induced him ehe more eafily to grane her rhe requeft flie madehim,
to give her time to refolve upon ir.   And truly he had been the cruelleft of all men, if ht™
not let himfelf be moved with the reafons, complaints, fupphcacions, and tears of therf
amiable Princefs chat ever was. But when he had permicced her to go co Mazanderon^ w^
(he had propounded untohim for the paffing away of the time of her exile, as insF
where ftie had been before times for her pleafure, he told her that ftie was to leave me bchrt
with the Princefs Perca, tothe end the Court might not bedefolated, and for fearalfow
my father having mc in his power, ftiould not reftore me nnto her when flie returned. I ^

vorably to certain queftions that he asked of me, and which concerned the defign he WT
on me, as atlength I found, that the tears of a beloved perfon are very powerful arms;   .
\ne,the Sophi granted me that which I demanded of him, though it were abfolutely K
his minde.   But that Deliment might not have leafure to get the permiffion which m
given us tobe revoked, wc parted away the next morning; yet was't "o^ without oir^

all fpeed; and thac by cbe counfel of Deliment, who as foon as he knew that wc were gone
to Mazanderon, perfwaded the Sophi to fend for my father, before we fliould be arrived
there; ini to ordain him to come another way, for fear of meeting us; to the end, faid he to
the Sophi, that ff//'«^«(?, knowing her father in your hands, may not carry che Princefs to

muft I betray Vlama, or abandon my father to the Sopht's violence ? Ah, no 1 I had rather

he beleeved that it was beft in this occafion to obey the Sophi's pleafure, feeing it would have

keepine the defign of ruining Vlama very fecret, caufed it to be bruited with addrefs abroad,
two days before he, who was to carry the commandment to Vlama, fet forth towards him:
So that when he came eot^/4»»4, he had already received advice fpom many not to come to

fo many circumftances, as made him fee his undoubced ruine, if he obeyed; in fo much as it
was impoffible for him Co fufped, that there was any artifice in all thefe things.   Some coun¬

whether De/iwf«f's wickednefs could have had a more favorable fuccefs? and whether all
thefe things were not capable of bringing to pafs the defign which he had, foto order the

effedively culpable in the eyes of all the world, who after this would not be fo forward in

he fliould behave himfelf as if he were guilty; and to fay all, that he fhould abandon you, and

beit he was kept fi^om parting fo foon, by a ficknefs wherewith fie was taken: but at length
finding himfdf betcer, he fee forth on his way, with a purpofe to oppofe Deliment's malice
as much as he could, and to forget nothing that might conduce thereunto. But fcarcely had
we made two days journey (for as you know. Madam, I have never abandoned him) when
as we encountred one of his deareft friends, who came in all hafte to acquaint him, that all
the Courc was filled wich the news of your lofs, 3ind Felixana's. That in the Royal Houfe
ic was faid, howgoingafifliing yon were caft away; but chac fuch, as looked farther into

kept fliuc up in fome pare. That it was an effed of the Sophi's paffion, and of Deliment's
violence; that in the faffiion as the matter was carryed, there was no remedy to be fought for
It; thac going to the Court, he fliould facrifice himfelfnnprofitably for you, and much to the

nitiHra which is within Soliman's dominion, and not above four days journey from Via-
tt.'. Government. As indeed. I was no fooner departed, but my Mafter, after,. had writ¬
ten to tbe taithiuUeft of his friends, to entertain fome intelligence with them, in cafe he Ihould
have need ot it, fet forch cowards Siri/iA; and committed himfelf into the hands of one,
named .S.r.f^^^. unto whom this Town appertained, as Vaffal of the 0//jow^« Empire. But
thouph^'/^?».»told him, that he came to feek the protedion of Solman, and that he
hid ^o thac effed difpatched one eo Ibrahim; yeC chis man, being of a cruel difpofiti¬
on and provoked by an indifcreec and bruicifti zeal, in ftead of barely affuring himfelt of his
perfon, by pucting a guard upon him, uncil he heard from Soliman, he caufed him co bc feiz¬
ed upon, Co be bo'und, and in chic deplorable eftate fent him to Conftantinople.
</p>
<p>In the mean tirae I had made my voyage very happily; and having delivered my Letter to
Ibrahim, I well perceived thathe was very joyful of ic; that the reputation of my Mafter
was come even unto hira ; and that he was not ignorant of his high birch; As truly a little
after, he obtained for Vlama all that he had demanded ; And as he was preparing to fend to
receive him with honor, and was talking with him in the Hipodrome, before his Palace gate,
about my return, I faw my Mafter arrive bound upon a horfe, his hands manacled, and his
face fo changed, as I hardly knew him: but being fure it was he, without thinking of the
refped I owed to the grand Vifier, Heft him, and approaching to'L'/^w**; My Lord, faid
I to Ibrahim, fuffer not him whom you mean to proted to be fo unworthily entreated; nor
let the valianc Vlama be chained like a Slave.   Vlama I cryed che grand Vifier: Yes, gener¬
ous Ibrahim, concinued I, you behold chac Vlama, whofe valor is incomparable ; whofe'
bitch is as noble as any in all Terfia; and who bach demanded protedion of none but you.
I had no fooner faid thus, but Ibrahim ran himfelf to unloofe my Mafter; and beholding
them which accompanyed him with fury, he willed me to help him, which I did witha
great deal of joy.  As for Vlama, he was in fuch a confufion to fee himfelf in that eftate, as
he could almoft have wifhed that I had not named him: but the thing being done, and hav¬
ing underftood that the ^rrf«s/ Fifter fpike the Perfian Tongue; Thefe chains, faid heunto
him, generous Ibrahim (for he had obferved that I had named him fo) are glorious unto me,
feeing they are taken fiom me by fo illuftrious an hand as yours: And owing my liberty to
you at our very firft encounter, judg whether all tbe reft of my life I fliall not abfolutely de¬
pend on you ? It is true, replyed Ibrahim embracing him, that thefe chains are not flaameful,
but for thole that have made you wear them; and by a fate clean contrary to that of all deli¬
verers, I muft, afcer the freeing you of them, crave pardon of you for the ill ufage you have
received; yet fofar happy at leaft-wife herein, as you cannot fufped ^o/&lt;w&lt;«» for it, who, if
I be not deceived, will make them feel tbe weight of your chains which have layd them on
you.   Vlama anfwered thereunto with a great deal of civility, and at length the grand
Vifur caufed him to enter into bis Palace, which was hard by, charging fome of his fervants
to fe;ze upon them thac accompanyed Vlama, for fear left any of chem fliould fteal away, to
go and advertife Serefbeg how his indifcrcet zeal was not well received.   When thefe two
illuftrious perfons were come in, Ibrahim fliewed Vlama the Letter he had written him
the order he bad taken for his reception; and after he had told him, that he might comand ill
his houfe, he went to give an account of his arrival to Soliman, who wasfo incenfed a
gainft Serejbeg, that his anger broke out terribly upon him, as you fliall underftand
hereatter.

<p>In the mean time the Baffa came back to fetch my Mafter to the Serraolio • and,, rh.
a fympathy between great men, which makes them from the very firft tfm of thet In   ''

w,Krher .t were inregard of thatwhich theGeorgiens had done; or of the Levies whih
Tachm.u had made; or of fome reafons which I could noc well learn: So tbac Ibr,ihimK
&lt;\^x^^nt^n-Vlama there with.and asking of him,whether he would willingly ferve in it hews,'
morejoytu! at .t then I am able co exprefs.  The 5-^/^ underftanding his inccncions'adve
tifed Sohman thereof, who thought fit, whirft the War was a preparing, to have o7. «,&lt;
return un o the frontier, the more eafily to entertain his intelligences.   But to make him re-
rurnthuli:r with glory, and execute that which bad been refolved, Ibrahim caufed W.
beg to be declared guilty of high Treafon; and Bitiltfa. which the other poffeffed, to^e"
tha With all the reft of his eftace, to be conferred on Vlama; as alfo a yearly Pcnfion ofin
fundred thonfmd Sultanins, and the Government of Carahemida, the frontire Townof
Diarbech, or A-Iejapotamia.  My Mafters generofity carryed him to refufe tbc fpoyls of his
Eieoiy, as much as poffibly he could ; but the Sultans pleafure was to be obeyed.
</p>
<p>This Declaration being made, i'tr^/^f^ was advertifed of it by fome friends that he had
at Conft-antinople; fo that, provoked wich anger, he ftole away; and pafling inco iheSofhi's
Territories, he went andoff'ered him his fervice.   In fo much as it feemed, that thefetwo
Princes had made an exchange, and given hoftages to each other: Though it is true, that the
matter was not equal for the perfons, Serefbeg having nothing recommendable in him, but
a brutifh valor, which carryed him into perils without knowing them.   But at laft Vlmt
repaired to BitiUfa, whereat his firft coming hefound fit matter to exercife his generofity
upon ; for Serefbeg's Wife and Children came and caft themfelves at his feet, and wholly dif¬
folved into tears, humbly befought him to grant them the grace of her Husband and their
Father.  "L'/^w** jRifwered them, that had he been in an eftate to receive it, hc would havc_
ufed bis uttermoft endevor to have obtained it of the Sultan: but as things were, it wasa
propofirion which he durft not make.   Then they rcquefled him, at leaft-wife not to entreat
them ill.   Vlama, who had no fuch intent, affured them, thae Bitilija exapted, which he
was bound to conferve for the grand Signior, he would not keep any part of their eftste
from th' m,though thty had very great riches; and told them moreovcr,that it they would con¬
tinue in BitiUfa, they ftiould be refpeded there as himfelf; or if they would go from thentf,
hc would obtain permiffion of Soliman to have them conduded whitherfoever they pleafed.
This aflfl:ded and generous woman, fee'mgV lamas courtefie, befought him fo to deal as
ftie might be fuffered to follow the fortune of ber Husband; ^Nh\ch Vlama promifed her,
and performed a httle after.   For having obtained of the Sultan that which he had defired of
him for her and her children, he caufed all their wealth to be loaden in Waggons; and having
affured them ofthe reftirution of BitiUfa, if peace were concluded, or if Serefbeg re-entred
into favor with the Grand Signior, he fent them with a convoy of four hundred fHrnurit'
into the Sophi's Territories; for fome Troups were already come unto him for his fafeguard,
Soliman having given command to all the Sangia's thereabouts to march whitherfoever f/«-
ma would lead them.

<p>In the mean time, whereas you and i='&lt;'/».s:&lt;i«« were the caufe of all that he did, hisontiy

ed vet he obrained of Soliman that he fliould be layd in the fepulchre of his fathers at Bitt-
Hfa wbi.h was accordingly performed with all the ceremony accuftomed in fuch like occafi¬
ons' As long as this War lafted, Vlama did what he could to encounter Delment; but not-
withftanding^sll his endevor for it, fortune would not let him fight wich him.
</p>
<p>Inline, Madam, Wincer approaching, Soliman put part of his Troops mco Garrifon, and
retired to Conftantinople with Ibrahim; leaving Vlama on the frontire, where he defired to
remain, not being able, as he oftentimes told me, to eloign himfelf from a Land, where he
beleeved you were ftill abiding. Not long after Vlama being advertifed that the Sophi was
gone from Sultania, whither he had retted, and feemed to have fome great defign in band,
he drew moft ot tbe forces out of the Garifons, and making up a body of an Army, he went
with it to oppofc the Enemy. But the Sophi, who did not defire to fight with Vlama, faw
him no fooner in the field, but he began to recoy l,contenting himfelf oriely with feizing on the
paffager, and cutting off his viduals, carefully forbearing from defcending into the plains, for
fear he fhe uld be forced to come to a battel. This artifice, which proceeded from ^Deliment,
would tor all that have availed him little, and my Mafters valor would have furmounted this
ftratagem, if the anger of Heaven had not been joyned to the anger of men, and fought for
tbe Perfians. For it happened that Vlama, having had bad intelligence, went and encamp¬
ed in that great plain, which is neer to Sultania, and as you know is invironed with four
mountains, whofe tops are always coveted withfnow, chiefly thofe of Caffi^ indNipha-
tes. Vlama beleeving then that the J'&lt;?/&gt;/;/was retired behinde thofe mountains,at thefoot
whereof are the goodlieft plains in the world, andthe moft proper to fight a battel in, was
there erxamped, as I have already declared; but the Sophi bad taken another way, and
was retired into the Country of the Coraxens, As Vlama then was in this place, there a-
rofe on the rop of thofe mountains fo terrible a tempeft, as thewindc carrying away thofe
huge heaps of fnow, wherewith they were covered, drove them in fuch abundance, and
with fuch raging force upon Vlama's Camp, as all the Tents were overthrown by them j
moft ofthe Camels ftifled; all the fick Soldiers overwhelmed; fome of the others burieda-
live wich them; and all the teft in confufion.
</p>
<p>And whereas rhe Snow had extinguiflied all the fires in the Army, the darknefs joyned
to the roaring of the winds, to the noife which tbe Snow made in overturning the Tents,
totbecdesot the Souldiers in anfwer tothe Commands ot their Leaders, and to the la¬
mentations of dying men, rendered chis night fo dreadful, as I do not think one can meet
with an occafion able to give more terror then that did: the conftancy of Vlama was noc for

the^Mountains.  But at laft upon the return of the day, the tempeft ended and the S"
us fee one of the pitifulleft objeds that ever was beheld.  This deadly fight, able to I!!'
courage of any but Vlama, augmented his; and he refolved to be revenged ofhis Enem.!
the lofs he had fuftained by the Tempeft.   Wherefore he made a fpeedy review of his 17
and finding that he had loft but two thoufand raen that nighr, he concluded to fet upon7'
Enemies.   He fent forth fome then to difcover, whil'ft they were labouring in fome fort t ^
repair the diforder of the Tents; and having gotten an advantageous place, be ftay'd ther
till he underftood that the Sophi came on furioufly towards him; for whereas reports increafe
at a diftance, he had been told that Vlama had loft above fifteen thoufand men.   My Maltet
glad of this occafion, albeit his Army was overtoyled and weary, couragioufly exhorted them
to fight.   But, Madam, without particularizing a Battel unto you, whereof the event was not
profperous to my dear Mafter, I will only tell you, that after he had almoft vanquifhed hisE-
nemies, fuffering himfdf to be carried away by his extream valor,he was hemmed in by shove
an hundred men, who knowing him to be the General of their Enemies Army, affailed him
with fuch fury, ashe was dangeroufly hurt by them in foUr feveral places; fo as all thathe
could do was to rid himfelf from his Enemies, ftill fighting till hc got to his own men, where
he was no fooner arrived but he fell down dead amongft them. This accident made the vido¬
ry change party, and range her fclf wholly on the Ter pans fide, who remained Mafters ofthe
freld : In the mean time Vlama's wounds proved great and dangerous; he was carried to the
neareft town, and frora thence to BitiUfa, where he hath always continued, whil'ft the So^ln
making profit of his misfortune and abfence, regained all that/^r^i!)fw and he bad conquered.
Howbeit Vlama was a long lime wichoat knowing any of thofe things: for his wounds re¬
duced him to fo bad an eftate, as no affair was communicated to hira. And whereas I was
always about him, fo ofcen as the violence of his ficknefs would permie him to fpeak, itwas
always of grieving to dye, before he had revenged you; but when an Arabian Pbylician,
which looked unto him, had affured us that he was out of danger, the firft thing hewas ac¬
quainted with, was the defeat ofhis Army, the lofs of Tauris, your imprifonmcnt, and Ptk-
ana's.   But he underftood this laft by fuch confufed reports, as he could not comprehend by
what adventure you were here.   His firft thought in this occafion leaned to joy, and he wk
very glad to hear that you were living, that you were not in the power ofthe Sophi, andthat
at length he might hope to fee you again.   But this firft motion being over, he entered into
another quite contrary.   What, faid be, do I fight againft my lawful Prince,to endeavor the
delivery of the Princefs Axiamira and Felixana, or to revenge them ? and whil'ft I hazard my
life with this intention, it falls out that I flied my blood for the fervice of a Prince, who keeps
them prifoners; and Fortnne,that is become ingenuous to perfecute me,makes me fight againft
thofe which oppofe him who oppreffeth and ill-intreateth them I Pardon me, continued he,
great Ptincefs,the crime which I have done; pardon me,dear Felixana,the error which I have
committed ;-and knoW,that though I am covered all over with wounds which I have received
in ferving thy Enemy, yet have I heart enough ftill left me to undertake the deliverance of thee.
I ftiould never have done, Madam, if I would recount unto you all that hc faid upon this oc¬
cafion.                                                                                                           ,,,
But at laft, after he had ufed his uttermoft endeavor to be carried into a Chariot, againlttK
advice of his Phyfician, he was conftrained to ftay two days journey from BitiUfa; foth«
knowing itwas impoffible for him to proceed further on his way as yet, heffentmetotw
grand Vifier, with diredion, if hc were not returned from a fecret expedition, upon which
It was faid he was gone, to attend for him, and to endeavor by his means to fee you, jnJ ^o

<p>My imagination, reprefenting to me all at once whatfoever I am to recount unto you,filleth

then to tell you in what manner we fuffered Shipwrack; only 1 will fay to you, that wben
we judged by the cries of the Mariners we were in danger of perifhing, I approached tothe
Princefs, whofe great heart was not fhaken inthis occafion, but contrarily feared the Port
more then Shipwrack, and cafting my felf at her feet, I demanded of her with tears the
grace that I might dye by her. This generous Princefs imbraced me, and taking me by the hand
flie never quitted it, till the Veffel, driven by the wind and the waves with an incredible im-
pecuoficy againft cbe point of a Rock, broke all to pieces, and feparated us,butii'. what raanner
it was done I am not able to tell you; for I was fo troubled, and the horrors of dtath feized
on me in fuch fort at that dreadful inftant, as I knew not what became of me. Yet was not
tbe Sea altogether unpitiful unto us, for by an extream good fortune in the midft ofour ill for¬
tune, it carried us to the flioar, which was not far off; and not only prefcfved our lives, but
made me be found within thirty paces of the place, where the waves had aft up the divine
Axiamira in a fwoon as well as I.

<p>The fame day wherein we fuffered Shipwrack, Prirxe danger (who as yeu know remain d
by Solimans Order very near to the place where we were caft on flioar) walking that way
came by chance where I lay extended on the fands as a dead perfon. This accident fuipnzid
him; my fex, my age, my habit, which was rich and extraordinary; and more then allthat
the pity whereof this vertuous Prince was capable, caufed him to approach unto me, and not
judg me unworthy of his affiftancc. And then again, though theeftate wherein! was had
infinitely changed me, he conceived that I was not altogether unknown to Iwm, and thatfe
had feen fomething that refembled me. But he had no fooner made the fand, which deavtd
to my face, to be taken away, but his memory brought back into his imaginatitn my pidure
whichhe had bought of that Merchant, andwhich he believed to be Axi^mir/i. And
whereas by chance he had it about him that fame day, he opened tbe cafe wherein it was, arid
obferving there all the features of my face, though the ayr ot it was fomewhat charged, he no
longer doubted but that I was the Princefs of Pfr/i&lt;», confitminghimftlf further inthiscpi-
nion by my apparel, which he faw to be altogether like to that which 1 wore in my p flute.
Vox the Sophi having found, that the habit of an Amazon, which the Painter badgivenus,
was more advantageous then ours, would needs have the Princefs and I wear it ever after. In
this belief. Prince Cw^^^r redoubled his care; and feeing me fetch a figh, which made him
know that I was ftill alive, he caufed me tobe carried to the next houfe to the place where I
was; and commanded fome of his people to go along by the Sea flioar, to fee if thty could
find any other perfon that had need of fuccour, imagining rightly, that I had not fuffcied Ship¬
wrack alone. But fcarcely had he given this Order, wKen one of his fervants came and tdJ
him,that fome thirty paces from thence there lay a woman attired in the fame manner, and
in the fame eftate that I was,who without doubt was not dead,becaufe he bad difcerned ftnic
motion of breathing in her.
</p>
<p>The Prince, having left me to the care of his people, went to fee that which this man told
him of; but he did no Iconer caft his eyes on the Vx'mcefs Axiamira ( for it was flie whora
this man had found) but he felt himfelf preft with an extraordinary defire to be able to five
her; and the compaffion which he had on her added fo many charms to ber beauty, as k
fwore unto me afterwards he had never feen her more beautiful then fhe was in that dtplonblc
eftate. He himfelf helped to carry her to the place where they had already layd me; and
though he was perfwaded that I was the Princefs of Terfia, and that Axiamira was oneof
my maids of honor, he took at the leaft as much care of her as of me, and it might be faid ihat
he did not ferve me but out of refped and intereft, and that he affifted her already out ot incli¬
nation.  At length, my Lord, meeting wich fome women in the hcufe whither we had been
carried, they took fuch a courfe with us, as they brought us out ofour fwoon.  I was thefitlt
that opened my eyes, and to whom reafon began to give a fenfe of our mif-fottunes, by the
aftonifliment wherewith I was feized, in feeing my felf in the bands of fo many unknownp^t-
fons.   Buc if their faces,their habits,and their language furprized me, their officious endeavors
gave me fome hope. This aftonifliment being over, my firft thought was for AxiAimru. A as •

<p>her, and that flie had ftudicd a while, flie demanded of him with much ado, and in a language
</p>
<p>that was not very inceliigible,the name ofhim that commanded them. This man apprehended

<p>noe ac firft whac flie would fay to him, but at length joyning figns to her fpeech, flie made her
</p>
<p>felf be underftood.   He anfwered her then in his language, that it was the Prince Gianger.
</p>
<p>This name of^/4«^tfr touched the Princefs fenfibly, and raaking a fign to this man, that flie
</p>
<p>had no more to fay to him; I knew full well, faid flie to me, that Fortune did not fave me,
</p>
<p>but to undo me; and that fhe kept me not from perifliing, but to expofe me to new miferies;
</p>
<p>for, faid flic, he in whofe power we are is the fon of Soliman.   It is not beciufe Fame doth
</p>
<p>not fpeak advantageoufly of him; but ftill, hc is the fon of a man, which hath caufed me to
</p>
<p>bc forcibly carried away.
</p>
<p>Axiamira's difcourfe feemed fo full of reafon to me, as Icould not make any Reply to it;
but in the end canried by the paflion which I had to ferve her, I told her, that to avoyd the
mifchief fhe feared. Prince Gianger was not to be difabufed of the opinion hc was in, that I
was the Princefs of Perfta; that in the mean time we ftiould labour to know, wherefore he
took me for that which I was not; and that in trying to difcover his defigns, we fhould frame
ours according to thac weChould leam of him. The Princefs was fo afflided, as without ex¬
amining whether that which I told her was reafonable or no, (he confented unto it at the fame
inftant, when as the Prince, who out of refped had always marched before, came clofe to the
Chtret. This while we arrived at 6'j«i»g^r.f Palace, who kd me to a ftately lodging, and
who would alfo have given another to Axiamira; becaufe, faidhe, (be was not in cafe to
ferve me: But having requefted him to leave her with me, he quitted us, and wentout of the

<p>chamber, as foon as that old Jewifti Phyfician came in; who, after he had miniftred unto us
that which he thought was neceffary for our recovery, left us at liberty to talk of the eftir^
of our fortune.
</p>
<p>I will not declare unto you, my Lord, the cares, the civilities, and the duties, which c,-
anger rendred me ftom that very firft evening in the quality of Axiamira, fince it would be
to fpend time unprofitably. But you ftiall underftand, that coming to fee me tbe next day I
demanded two things of him; the one was, to tell me how he knew that I was the Prinafs
of Perfia ? and the other, not to publifla that I was in his hands, till I had time and flrencth
to entertain him with my misfortunes. To the fitft he anfwered me, in letting me fee ?he
Cafe wherein my pidure was, which as foon as I had beheld I knew it ftraight. But, my
Lord, faid I unto him, who told you that this was Axiamiraes pidure ? The Merchant
faid he, that fold it to me; and who long before had alfo fold another to the Emperor my fa!
ther, which he faid was a maids, named Felixana, whom the Sophi very much efteemed •
whom you exceedingly loved; and who withcut doubt ought to have very much merit and
beauty, fince, as this Merchant told me, flie was crowned as well as you, as the faireft of all
Perfia. This Felixana, anfwered I coldly, had queftionlefs a beauty extraordinary enoutjh
to oblige Jo//&gt;»&lt;j« to buy her pidure. Now, my Lord, it is certain that this difcourfe fur.
prized me; for then I knew, that the Merchant, to whom our pidures had been given, was
deceived, and had not underftood the Sophi well; the likenefs of clothes hiving no doubt
contf ibuted much to the making of this error. So it was, that I plainly perceived how Wi-
man had effedively loved Axiamira by means of her pidure, but under the name of Felixn-
na, which had occafioned her forcible carrying away; and how the faw error, and thefame
change of pidures, was the caufe that Prince danger took me for her, as the Emperor had
before taken her for me.
</p>
<p>Touching the fecond thing, which I had demanded ofthe Prince, he eafily granted itme;
for whereas he was become defperately in love with the Vx\x\ce{s Axiamira, bis deiire was
not to be obliged to carry us fo foon to Soliman, as maxims of State required: It being un.
likely, that the daughter ol a great King fhould be inhis hands, and he not remit het into
the Emperor his fathers, as foon as it was known. So to content me, and to fatisfie himfeli,
he forbid thofe, which had had any notice of the quality he gave me, to be known of it: And
ftill, to gain time, I made my indifpofition laft as long as poffibly I could. In tbe mean fpace
thePrince, who at firft fight had been mightily taken with the beauty of Axiamira, id\
not forbear giving her fome marks of it, but with fo much refped, as if flie had appeared
to be that which truly fhe was, fhe could not have been offended at it. This generous Prince
told us fince, that he tryed to withftand this fpringing paffion as much as he was able; and
that againft the cuftom of his Nation, which confiders not the nobility of blood, he was fo
troubled to think that ftie whom he loved was not of Royal birth, as he could not htm
inhis minde. He had yet fome intervals, wherein his imagination fliewed him the truth,
and wherein it perfwaded him that Axiamira, whom I called Ifmaida as long as our plot
lafted, was fomething more then ftie feemcd to be; and in this thought he engaged him¬
felf fo deeply in loving her, as he could not forbear giving her teftiraonies thereof in my pre¬
fence, though he rendred me neverthelefs all the refped, which was due to a Prmcefs, ot
whom I borrowed the name.                                                                        u o ■ «

<p>We lived fome time in this fort, with content enough, that is to fay, as long as the Princes
vifits kept us from thinking ferioufly of our misfortunes.  For when we were alone, the re¬
membrance of what was paft, and the fear of thatwhich was to come, gave us but w»c
reft.   The prefence of the Prince was oftentimes alfo fomewhat grievous to me, e'peciJjJ
fuch time as he preffed me by his entreaties to tell him by what adventure I had fuffered in p-
wrack upon that Coaft; having much ado to finde excufes to difpenfe mc horn it, being nor

wben we flial mark him out the time that he came to Mazanderon,he wil remember wlieth
he were at the Port then or no- or if he be ignorant thereof, he may dextroufly enquire in
what place he was at that fame time: Moreover, if he perifficd when we fuffered fliipwrac
his death will juftifie my difcourfe; and if he efcaped, it is impoffible but that the brnit of
this accident fliould be fpread abroad amongft fome; and that at leaft it ftiould be heard

occafion, or in what voyage.   But, Madam, without fearching for fomany proofs, to con¬
firm that which I purpofe tofay, I am confident, how I ftiall no fooner tell GiWrr that
you are the Princefs of Perfia, but he will finde in your eyes the jnftification of my difcourfe •
he will wonder thac he did not know you; and repenting him of his error, he will crave
pardon of you for it.   For, Madam, there is fomething fo majeftical in your face, as I doubt
not but you have had more ado to conceal your felf, then you will have to make your felf be
known.   And then again, the greateft misfortune that can arrive to us by it, is not to be be-
leeved, and that being fo, we are in the fame eftate, as now we are: and inthefamelibeity
to have recourfe unto death.

<p>ThePrincefs, perceiving fome reafon in that which I faid, permitted me tofpeak toCi.
anger, provided that fhe might be in het Cabinet during our converfation. I fent then pre¬
fently to defire the Prince that I might fpeak with him, whereupon he came forthwith to my
chamber; and when as he would have ufed the fame refpeds to me, as he had accuftomed;
It is no longer time, faid I unto him, my Lord, to abufe your goodnefs; It was requifite at
firft, when as yet we knew you not, that we fhould be unknown to you, for reafons that
you fliall hear; but now that we know your wifdom, your vertue, and your generofity, it
is juft chat you alfo flbould know us; and that the freedom which we ufe in acquainting you
with our misfortunes, and in confiding abfolutely in you, fhould obtain us that pardon
which we crave for having deceived you. The Prince remained very much furprized with
my difcourfe, and whereas I perceived ic; I fee, my Lord, faid I unto him, the impatience
you are in, to underftand that which I am to fay to you, doth difquiet you; and therefore,
to fatisfie you in few words,know, that I am not Axiamira. You are not Axiamira, faid the
Prince unto me exceedingly amazed 1 0,Madam, labor not Co perfwade me the contrary,rince
it would be in vain. No, my Lord, continued I, I am not the Princefs of Perfia, and yon fee
before your eyes onely that Felixana,of whom you have heard fpeak too advantageoufly :yet
think not that I will take the Princefs Axiamira out of your power; flie is in it,my Lord,and
fhe is in it in an eftate,that hath need of your protedion : It is you alone on whom her goodot
bad fortune doth depend; or to fay better, it is yoo on whom her life or death doth depend.
And to draw you quite out of the pain wherein I fee you, know, my Lord, that the fame in¬
comparable perfon, whom you have fo efteemed of under the name of Ifmaida, is trdy
Axiamira, and the moft excellent Princefs that is in the world. This laft amazement of the
Prince was as great as the other; but with this difference, that amidft the trouble of his (oul
I faw fome joy in his look. He beleeved me not for all that at firft, but I perceived that it
was a matter, whereof he would have gladly been perfwaded. Is it poffible, m^
unto me, that you ftiould fpeak the truth ? and will you not take it ill if I fliould not be¬
leeve you? or if not being able to rely on your words, I requeft you to tell me fome circum¬
ftances, that may clear rae in a thing that is fo doubtful.

<p>Icis juft, faid I untohim, that you fliould not beleeve me upon the bare report ot my
words, but'that your reafon fliould perfwade you. And then I recounted unto him, notonj-
ly Ruftans arrival at Mazanderon; the flcights which he had ufed to get a fight of me; t

<p>But why (faid he unto me after fome filence) do not I fee this Princefs, of whom I am

to leave you the liberty to doubt of my words, is retired into her Cabiner, whither if you
pkafe we will go unto her.   Saying fo, flic opened the Cabinet door, and Axiamira advan¬

Madam, faid he unto her, howfaulty foever I appear in your eyes, my heart is innocent;
it being moft certain, that it hath advertifed me more then once what you were: I have bad
refpeds and thoughts of veneration for you, which I durft not make fhew of, m the error

Civility permits me to abide; or that I may dye at your feet,   danger was fo raviftied with
the vertue and wifdom of Axiamira. as turning himfelf to me, Ic muft be acknowledeed
faid he eo m?, that the Princefs is incomparable; that Ifaave been blind indeed not to know
her, and to refift the fecret motions which advertifed rae of my duty.   After this hc flood \

with grief; but if I be able to offer you the company of a Princefs, whofe vertue is without
ftain, whom you may abfolutely command, and who is wife to Prince Muftapha my Brother
I think you will have caufe to be fatisfied.   Axiamira was exceeding glad of this propofition,
having oftentimes before heard fpeak of the vertue d Muftapha's wife, who fhe bad been
told was defcended of the ancient Kings of Cappadocia.   So that addreffing her fdf toitie
Prince with a great deal of fatisfadion, may I hope, my Lord, faid flie unto hira, diatPrinoj
Muftapha, and his excellent wife, will permit me to live unknown in their Palace, until that
Fortune, weary of perlccuting me, (ball no longer keep me fi;om returnkig into my Country f
Your vertue alone will oblige theirs to fuccor you, butif that were not, t*e ftrift friendlh/p
wbidi is bet wixt us will oblige them fufficiently unto it.  All Mnftapha's interefts are mine,
even as my Fortune is his.   And truly we are far from thofe apprehenfions of State, which for
fo long a time have made the children ot the Othoman family to tear one another in pieceslilie
enraged Tygers; and I am well affured that \f Muftapha, my eldeft Brother, comes tmto
the Empire, he will let me enjoy the felicity of his Raign, and will not fend me either xsmw
flaves to ftrangle me.   I tell you all thefe things. Madam, to the end you may not doubt but
that the fanduary which I have propounded unto yon, will be inviolable.  Moreover, where¬
as Muftapha is Governor o( Amafia, and that Oty is the Capital of Cappadocia, whidi wc
call Amafia, you may wtll conceive that you will bc far enough from Conftantinople, and not
fo far from Perfia, but that you may eafily hear from thofe which are affeded to you
there.
</p>
<p>All thefe particulars having feemed very reafonable unto me,I the more confirmed the Pnn-
cefs in the deiign fhe had to accept of them, both for her intereft and mine own; it being moll
certain, that I no lefs feared the Sophi's love, then ftie did Deliments.   This refolution nktn,
nothing was thought on but executing it: G»/w«^fr difpatched a man, who was faitbwlto

werl affeded to her in F.r&gt;., without ever receiving any anfwer. And whereas tLe faw no
Tnd 0 her mi eries, ftie ciuld not be without unquietnefs; which at length brought her to a
ficknefs  which it ias thoughc would prove mortal co her. Her Fever was not very violent,
but i warwithouc intcrraiffion; and Ibougb flie felc no greac pain, yet was flie fo weak, and
fo low broughc, as wc durft noc hope flie could furmounc che difeafe wherewith flie was
aE dSgJhewhich ^....^.and I never abandoned her; and the two Pnncesfawher
asoften, as cheneceflity of cheir affairs, andcivilicy would permic them.   N^w though .^«-
Ijapka had nothing but friendfliip for Axiamira, yet feemed he to be as much afflided as G«-
dnger ■ fuch a fympathy was there in all things between thefe two excellent Princes.   We
continued three Months in this fort, without knowing what we were to exped concerning
the Princeffes life: for albeit ac lengch the Fever left her fomecimes, yet was it for fo little
while, as it did not permit us to hope the recovery of her health.    But whil'ft I was fliedding
tears for her, the Princes and Saraida took great care to conceal from the Princefs,and me too,
that Soliman had made War in Perfia; which was the caufe I knew not that Vlama bad
betaken himfelfto his party.   And that which kept Muftapha from faying any thing to us of
it, was not only the fear of afffiding Axiamira, but the doubt G«&lt;«»^er was in, that if flie
came once to know ic, flie would be averted from a Prince, whofe father went about to defo-
late her Country.   We lived then above two Months in this ignorance after the Princefs was
out ot danger: for whereas we faw no body but MuHapha,Saraida,%nd danger that under¬
ftood our language, it was eafie for them to keep us fromknowingany thing but what they
pleafed.   But one day as the Princefs and I were alone, Jpeaking of the affedion that danger
bore her, and amplifying his vertues, which I oppofed tothevicesof Z)tf/iwf»f, I in fome
fort preffed her to acquaint me with the thoughts which flie had for him.   Why I will tell
you now, Felixana, faid flic unto me, I efteem of Gianger as much as his vertue doth merit;
I do acknowledg his good Offices as much as one can; and I bear as much good-will to him
in my heart, as I do to Prince Mahamed my brother: but for that paffion, which diforders
the mind, which deftroys Reafon, and which troubles the reft of them whom it poffeffcth, I
am not capable of it; and I could wifti ihnGiangercixxied a more quiet affedion to rae.-
That weaknefs is a blemiffi, which I do not defire fhould be in great Souls: nor is it any thing
but the fubtilty of men which hath perfwaded us, thac^his paflion is not vicious, fince all o-
thers ate, and that every one believes them to be fo, though they do not produce fuch deadly
cffeds.   And to know how much more dangerous it is then the reft, we are but to confider
how it commonly ftirs up all of them; Hatred, Anger, Envy, and Ambition it fclf, are many
times the followers of it; yet do not think, that I will be ingrateful to Prince Cww^rr; for
know, how averfe foever I am from marriage, I would notwithftanding refolve tobehis
wife, rather then render him unhappy, if the Sophi and Soliman could confent thereunto.
For, continued fhe, I may indeed oppofe the Sophia pleafure, but I can never be drawn to dif¬
pofe of my felf without his order.  Asl was going to tdke danger's part, he entered into
the Princeffes chamber, and approaching to her with all the obfervance which he was accu¬
ftomed CO yield her, he began to talk to her of his affedion; and he reprefented unto het the
refped wherewith be had ferved her, thegreamefs of his love, the little teftimony ftie had
given him of accepting it, the deplorabie eftate of his Fortune, the fmall likeUhood there was,
thac aftet fo many Letters vainly written into Terfta, that the friends which flie had left
were ftill generous enough to fcrve her.  That he knew how the Sophi was more affeded to
Delment then eycx, andthathe alone governed the Empire: So that flie could never hope
ether to alter Z)^/t/wm, or to make the .f^/&gt;/;j change his refolucion, but by the neceflity of
refolving on that which they could no longer avoyd.

<p>I perceive wdl,my Lord,anfwered ftie lighing, that my misfortune is fo ftrange, as the moft
ingenuous fpirii could not forefee any other end of it, then fuch as muft be fatal to me • for if

faid the Prince interrupting her, fuffer me firft to tell you, thatit yoi^ deprive me of the hooe'
which my extream love hath made me conceive, nothing will be able to preferve my life, m
Lord, replyed Axiamira, have patience, and do not condemn me withouc bearing me." And
to begin wich the Obligations wherein I am engaged to you; I know that I owe yon niy hfe.
that the refped which you have fliewed to me, in a time when you knew me not for that
which I was, hach fenfibly obliged me; and that the generofity which you have demonflta-
ted in providing me a fanduary, and preferring my interefts beioxe SoUmans and the Em'
pires, merits an eternal acknowledgment.   I have alfo obferved againft my cuftom, that yoii
bear an affedion to me, and I am fo powerfully perfwaded cf it, as you cannot deiire 1

the efteem I make of fo many rare qualities, as are in you, joyned to che obligacions wherein
I am engaged eo you, could never for all chat beget an affedion in my heart like unto youts.
Yet do not think I am ingrateful, or infenfible; but contrarily, I love you fomuch the more
perfedly, asl can fpeak it without bluffiing ; I, my Lord, I love you with a friendftiip, fo
folidly eftabliffied, as neither fenfe nor fortune hath any part in it.   I can pubffli it without
fhame, and conferve it wichouc blame, and loving you as if yeu were my brother, 1 donot
fee that you have reafon to complain.   I know wdl neverthelefs that you are not fatisfied;
buc whac would yon have me do, it love be a paffion, whereof I am not capable i" and if
marriage hath always paft with me for a captivity, which is to be avoyded as much aspoffibly
may be ? I proteft unto you by the holy Prophet, whom we worfbip, that it I could be touch¬
ed wich this paffion, it fliould be doubtlefs for you ; never having bad thac indination for
anyoneas I haveforyou.   But let not this impoffibility, I pray yon, of my being in love,
difquiet you, fince the friendfliip, which I promife you, is incomparably more excellent, and
moreperfed. And to teftifie unto you, that I do all that I can, if you have not power enough
to contain your felf from defiring to marry me, I do permit you to ufe the beft means you can
to get the Sophi and Soliman to confent unto it; which being obtained, I do here engage my
word to you no longer to oppofe your defires.   Behold, my Lord, allthat I bad to lay to
you; and never hope for any more from me; for Axiamira s vertue can have no further in¬
dulgence for your paffion.
</p>
<p>Moft vertuous Princefs, replyed Gianger cafting himfelf at her feet. What occafions do
you give me all at once, both of grief, and of fatisfadion 1 with one hand you draw meoiit
of danger, and with the other you put me to death.  You cannot anfwer my paffion, and yet
you love me more then all the wodd bcfide; who ever faw an adventure equal to minei' my
Miftrefs refufes me her love, but in fuch a manner, as I am not permitred to have the comfort
to term her cruel and unpitiful; but conuanly, I muft give her thanks for the vvrong Ihe docs
me, and muft admire in her the vertue which oppofes my love, danger, in faying thus, look¬
ed on Axiamira with fo much grief, as made mc pity him. And whereas the Princefl"es good¬
nefs hath always allowed me a great deal of freedom with her, I took fomuch upon me as
to intermeddlein their difcourfe; fothat addrefling my felf tothe Prince, The permiflion,
my Lord, faid I untohim, which hath been given you, fliould infpire you, me-thinks, with
other thoughts, then thofe which I perceive you have.  Ah I my Princefs, faid he unto mt)
( for he had always called me fo, ever after we had put that trick upon him,) that which the
goodnefs of ^.v&lt;^w»V4 grants, Fortune refufes me; interpofing fuch obftacles as are not ealie
to be vanquiflied : And in the ftate wherein things are, there needs a fupernatural power lo
change my evil deftiny, unlefs you will help me to perfwade Axiamira, that ftie will peroii
me to marry her; for being then no longer in a condition to be Deliment's wife, or a«/"»J*^
Miftrefs, tbe knowledg thereof would peradventure make their weapons fall out ot the
hands.   How ! faid Axiamira mightily furprized, have the Sophi and Soliman any mterei
to be decided between them ? Is it known thac I am in your hands ? and may I be fo untiip-

faid fomuch before he was aware; but feeing the matter paft remedy, and that likewae

that he would be glad to return into his Country, if he met with an occafion for it; heima-
Pined that the Princeffe, who had often fpoken to him of Vlama s zeal and fidelity, would
quickly give him intelligence of her being there, and then that Vlama to fee his Native Soil
again, and to be well received there, would perfwade the Princefs to return thither. And it
rnay be alfo, as all Lovers are fufpicious, chat he had furmized by Axiamira's difcourfe, which
he had interpreted amiffe, how t;/^w^ was in love with her; at leaftwife IcouldnoC con¬

War ftiould have an unjuft beginning, buc that I muft too be found on the enemies Party,
and in fuch a manner, as I am not fo much as Co defire Co get from it. And my misforcune is
fuch, as I cannot make vowes for the Sophi, but I muft make them likewife for Deliment,
who fights for him, though I have fuch caufe Co hate him; nor make vowes againft So liman ^
without offending Muftapha and gianger. In fine, my Lord, faid flie, turning her felf to the
Prince, fince I am in fuch a condition, as I am not able to make wifl^es wichouc injuftice , I

think, confirmed danger the more in tbe opinion, that I have told you, I believed hehad. For
after he bad confidered me, and then the Princefs, he told me, chac chis War having much
afflided bim, he knew not very well what had paffed in ic. But to abridge my difcourfe ,
Muftapha and Sarraida were called in, as well to comfort the Princefs, as to advife on that

fed all together, after they had well examined things, how they might beft effed their defim

of all things. But by ill fortune, you were gone away before, upon a fecret expedition
wherein Soliman had imployed you, although ic was buc four or five daies afcer tbeTriuaiph'

things on all fides, they believed it would not be amiffe for Axiamira to write once more to

did make known fhe was living; and thac did likewife affure, how che letter, which he
would write, was of a perfon confiderable and powerfull enough, co creat of an Affair ot

and that all their malice could finde out none,chac could fully fatisfie cheir cruel hatred, the zeal
and fidelity of one of the ancient Officers of this deplorable Prince, furniflied them within

and was he to whom Soliman, during che youth of his fon, had given in charge to rendft
him an accounc of his adions: But whereas the Prince had never done any, but fuch as wcit
worthy, he could not advertife ought, that was not to the advantage of his Mafter.
</p>
<p>Now after chat Muftapha's age had difpenfed him from the obedience, which he had yeelded
to this man, he had ftill retained him at Amafta; converfing a little lefs familiarly with Wm,

h S/ii«was anU'urper; which the other unable to endure and being become more

'er mounted then he, quickly d-Cded the combate with three blows chat he gave bira, which
Lade h.m fall dead at h.s teet. Th.s being done wichouc witneffes, the T.r/?.« continued bis
way and almoft a minute after he was out of fight, Mufiapha s faid ancient Governor ar¬
rived at the place where the combate was fought, and prefently knowing that man, becaufe
h-bad belonged to tbe Prince, he approached tohim, marks whether hc gives any tign ot
hfe and laying his hand upon the region of his heart, he meets chere with cbe pacquet chac
wasdireded Co Mufiapha, which that man bad pue inco a httle bag that he had hung about
his neck. The fight hereof poffeft the Governor with fome curiofiey, fo that feemg no mark
of life in that wretched man, but contrarily obferving all the figns of death in him, whffh
are wont to be feen in them whofe end hath been violent, he fpeedily withdrew bom tbac
fame place, carrying tbe lictle bag along with him; and being got far enough out of the
way, heopened'it, and was much abaflied, when he perceived the i'op/)fs feal.
</p>
<p>I leave you to judg, my Lord, whether that exad fidelity, which he had always obferved
to Sol-fn.'ji, did permit bim to deliberatelong upon that fubjed: he never ftuckatit rhen;
and to ctftifie his refped Co the Grand Signior, as well as his fidelity, he refolves to fend him
thofe Lrtters withouc opening them. And feeing by the fuperfcription of that which was
direded to Axiamira, that fhe muft needs be in Amafia, be rtfleded on che being of tvvo
women conceded in Muftapha's Palace ; and calling to minde an hundred petty circumftan¬
ces, which when they arrived had made no impreffion in his minde, he certainly beleeved,
that the Vi'mcds of Perfia was m Muflapha's hands: So that perfwaded of this truth, he
re-entrtd into the Town through another gate then that which be went out at -, and withcut
making fliew of what had befallen him, he the next day difpatches a man away to Conftan¬
tinople, enjoyns bim to addrefs himfelf to fome of the Baffa's for to prefent him to the Grand
Signior, and commands him above all things Co ufe great fpeed.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the Perfian being arrived at Amafta, and not fearing Co be accufed for
tbe death of him whom be bad killed, fince their combate had been without witneffes, he
comes boldly to the Palace, demands to fpeak with Muftapha, and after he had made hi.ii-
felf known to him to be a Perfian, and had given him affured marks that hc came from
Vi'mo^ Mahamed, hedcfires tobe admitted tothe Princefs; which was granted him. And
when he had acquitted bim of bis Commiffion, Axiamira remained very much furprized;
for 111. knew by hisdifeourfe, that be whom theyhad fent to .y^/raw/^ was too long in re¬
turning, (ince this man, who fet forth a day afcer bim, was already come. She hoped never¬
thelefs, as well as the Princes, that this unquietnefs would foon ceafe; and beleeved that fomg
inconvenience having kept this man from coming fo faft as the other, be would arrive at laft,
and f. give an end to their fear. But the day following, tbe body of him, whom the Perfian
had flain, having been found by fome that paffed by, he was brought into theTown, and
known to be one belonging to the Prince, who was prefently advertifed thereof. And where¬
as it was a matter of importance, he wenc in perfon to caufe the Letters to be fearched for,
vvivch we beleeved hehad hidden fomewhere in his clothes; but having found none abouc

che falfe Lecter, that was direded to Muftapha, unto Soliman, cells him (as indeed it was

<p>Soliman hearing all thefe things, knowing the fidelity of him that fent him this Letter, fee¬
ing T^^c^nw^e^ feal to it; and coming toconfider, ihn Muflapha hzd with addrefs declined
theWiX of Perfta, he no longer doubted but thac hewas guilty; albeit Axiamira's ^■
wrack perplexed him, and kept him from comprehending chis pretended marriage. His tcn¬
dernefs of chis Prince made him neverthelefs feek in his heart, how he might favorably inter¬
pret the accufations, which were brought againft his innocence. But the conjedures were
fo ftrong, and RaxeUna's perfwafions fo powerful, as fatherly affedion gave place to reafon
of State. He would fain have put this affair into the deliberation ofhis privy Councel, but
in regard you were not at the Port, he knew not whom to rely on. He propounded Achmi
to Rexelana, but flie, being in fear of this mans vertue, reprefented unto bim, that he was
too much affeded to che Prince to hope for any faithful counfel from bim in this encounter.
In the end ftie knew how Co fway che Sultan's minde with fo much addrefs and malice, as
he himfelf commanded Ruflan to be fenc for, who was the onely man that Roxelana did not
except againft. H- was no fooner arrived, but the Grand Signior asked his advice concerning
the mater in queftion. He anfwered atfirft, with a feigned fubmifljon, that it was onely
for him to execute his Highnefs refolutions, and not to give him counfel. But after he hsd
caufed himfelf to be commanded mo^e then once todeliver his opinion, he aggravated the
matter with fo much art, and made fbewof fuch dangerous confequences in this affair ifit
were negleded, as Soliman, being abfolutely refolved to look to his confervation, coromnd-
ed him co make himfelf ready Co fet forth with fix thoufand men, which fliould march away

oppofe fomany Enemies; and in conclufion, that his prefence was abfolutely neceffary for
the calming of this ftorm. Now that which made Ruflan advereife Solman ok 2\\ thefe
things was becaufe he certainly knew, that the vertue of Muflapha was fo generally beloved
in all that Province, as if he undertook to go with open force againft him, he would be in

<p>This confideration of his fucceeded but too well; iot Soliman no fooner underftood fo

him to do whac if«/?&lt;«« defired, was che incelligence he gave him, how by a fecond Letter
from Muftapha's Governor he was informed, that the Princefs of Terfia was in his hands.
So that Soltman, filled with choller and jealoufie, and thinking that as Ruflan had efcaped

all chings to think of his own fecurity. Vertuous Achmat told us fince, that Soliman had a
ftrange combate within himfelf, and chac Nacure and Reafon a long cime oppofed the wick¬
ednefs of chis woman. Buc ac length flie made him fee the peril fo great, and fo neer unto
him, as in parting from her, flie got bim to promife her two chings; the one, chat he fliould
not fee Muftapha, and the other, that he fliould facrifice him to his own proper fafety.
With this deadly refolucion he went and joyned with Ruflan,- chefe things neverthelefs were
not fodofely carryed, but the Baffa Achmat was adverdfcd, how this tempeft was going
to fall upon the head of Muflapha; fo that at the very fame time, when as Solman, being
encamped neer to Aleppo, had fent the Prince a Command to come unto him, to render him
an account of the Princefs of Perfta, Achmat difpatched away a Poll, Co advertife him chac
fome great defign was plotting againft him, and that he was accufed of fomeehing, wherein
the Princefs of Perfia was mentioned: but noC able Co Cell him precifely whac ic was, all chat

<p>his Rival, he could by no means refolve on it, but fell again into his defpair. Axiamira I
her part found no way to efcape this peril; flie would fain have faved thefe two Princes and
faved herfelf too: bur noc able co go into ?^r/»^, neither to fee .yo/;w^«, nor reft fafe in,
place, where flie was no longer unknown, flie found that death alone could draw her out ot
fo many miferies. As for Mufiapha, his greateft forrow was to fee che afflidion of his bro¬
ther, and the fear he was in, thac his Palace would not be an inviolable fanduary to the Prln-
cefs Axiamira.- for Couching che reft, faid he unro her, I am noc much troubled. If Sohmm
deals rigoroufly wich me, ic will always be with injuftice, knowing as I do, that I havenevtr
had a thought againft the fervice which I owe to him, and afcer this fatisfadion, I fear
not death. But chac which afllids me, continued he, is the doubt, that if I go and prefent my
felf to Soliman, chey will come and do you fome wrong in my abfence, and thac is it lot
which I do not fee how we can finde a remedy.
</p>
<p>Sarraida.hemng her husband fpeak in this fort,caft her felf ac his feec Co diffwade him from
this defign, and Co pray him co remember ( faid flie, after flie had craved pardon of Gianger)
how exceedingly Roxelana had fought for a pretext to undo him; that having met with one
he might be affured flie would make ufe of it to his ruine: and that it was better for him to
ftay in Amafia, and there to defend himfelf, or fly away, then to expofe hirafelf to fo evi¬
dent a danger. But Muftapha's generofity not permitting him Co refolve either for theone
or the other; it becomes your affedion, anfwered he, to counfel me in this manner, but it
becomes not the courage of Mufiapha to be perfwaded by you: and fince I am innocent, I
will never fly like a guilty man. For in fine, though I feem to have failed, according to rigot*
ous and cxad policy, in not advertifing Soliman that the daughter of his Enemy was in my
power, yet I chink chac I fwerve noc much from foveraign Reafon in ferving fo excellent a
Princefs and my brother; and in contributing nothing to the Sultans unjuft lovc, fo that
after rhis incerior facisfadion, I will remic my innocence Co the condud of Heaven, which
is always che procedor of ic. gianger feeing his refolution, defired Axiamira, not to take
it ill if he wenc Co dye with his brother; buc Muftapha,vjithout giving the Princefs leafute to
anfwer, told him, that he would noc fuffer ic, but he would leave him to guard the Princefs
Axiamira, and his dear Sarraida.
</p>
<p>I fhould never have done, if I would reporc unto you all that, which love, fear, genero¬
fity, and defpair, made thefe illuftrious perfons fay in chis fad converfacion. As for me, I
heard all cheir difcourfe wichouc fpeaking: when as on a fudden, ehe defire which 1 had to
ferve them infpired me with a mean, whereby I beleeved I could fzve Muflapha, kwt
Axiamira, dxy \xp Sarraida's ie^xs, render danger moxe excufable, fignalize the affedion
which I bare che Princefs, and deftroy all che wicked defigns of Muftapha's Enemies. Veri-
ly this choughc poffeft me with fo extraordinary a joy, as ic quickly appeared in myeytsa-
midft che tears which I flied: but whereas I feared that the Princeffes generofity would be
an obftacJe to my defign, I fell ac her feec, and befoughc her to give rae her word, that Ihe
would noc refufe a mean, which I Choughc I had found to draw them all one of the pain
and danger wherein I faw them. Ah, my dear maid, faid flie unto me, doft thou think that
a perfon which would receive death with joy, if it were prefented unto her, can refufe thy
affiftancc ? but I greatly fear, continued ftie, that thy affedion does but abufe thee, and that
the extream defire thou haft to ferve me makes thee beleeve that tobe eafie, which I hoiJ
impoflible. No, no, Madam, anfwered I; and provided you will promife me not to oppoie
this defign, I affure you that you your felf will finde a great deal of probability in it.
</p>
<p>Sarraida, feeing that ^at/^w/V^ made not much hafte to anfwer me, preft her fofar,"
flie gave me her word to do all thac I would have her. She had no fooner faid fo, bnc render¬
ing her chanks for the pcrmifllion flie gave me to fcrve her, I imparted unto her in what mi¬
ner I hoped to fecure her. And to make her comprehend it che better, I caufed her to remeni-
ber, how the fame Merchant who fold her ^iAmeio Soliman. as being mine, hfdalloio^

Madam, faid I interrupting her; and I cannoVtbink that a great Princefs will ever break her

Soliman cannot accufe me but for a little while receiving the honors, which were rendered to
me as to the Princefs of Perfia, though I were not flie; but thereunto I am to fay, that to be
in the more fafety, out of the refped which was beleeved to be due to my condition. I had
not difabufed the Prince, ftaying to make my felf known for thac which I was, till I was ac
his Highnefs feet, to beg his pardon, and to befecch him to grant me my liberty.
</p>
<p>Sarraida,ftemg a great deal of likelyhood in that which I faid,earneflly intreated Axiamira
no longer to refift this defign. danger called me his Deliverer, and faid fuch obliging thirgs
unto me, as I fhall never forget the remembrance of them. For Muflapha, though he faw
fome probability of that which I propounded, yet his great heare could noc refolve to difguife
the truth; and had he not certainly known, that it was the only Way which could permit
him to hope, that he might put the Princefs Axiamira in fafety, he had never confented unto
it. But that confideration, joyned to the extream affedion which he carried to his brother,
made him refolve at length for all that was defired of him. We prepared our felves then to
depart the next day; I will not relate unto you whac the feparation was between the Princef?
and me, between Gianger and Muftapha, between Muflapha and Sarraida, fince ic would
buc renew our forrows for a matter that is not abfolutely neceffary you fliould know. Buc I
will only tell you, thatthe feparation of the Soul and body is never made with fuch violent
grief as ours was, at the fad moment of that deadly and laft farewelL I was put into a Charet,
with two women which Sarraida gave me to wait upon me, and Muftapha accompanied
with a fmall train, to fliew the more confidence, marched on horfeback fome fifty paces
before us. Wc arrived at rhe Emperors Camp a day later then we thought we fhould,
becaufe the Charet,wherein I was, being broken, took up fo much time to re-accommodate it*.
And you will know, my Lord, by the fequel of my difcourfe, how it is not without Caufe that
I have noted this unto you. We were no fooner lighted at a Tent, which had been prepared
tor us, buc Prince Muflapha,who thoughc he ftiould have conduded me to J6//iw^»,received
an Order to attend his Commandments there, and to remit me into the hands ofa Baffa who
was to prefent me to his Highnefs. I confefs that this proceeding amazed me and that I be¬
gan to be in fear for the Pnnce. At the very fame inftant he received fondry advices, that his
ranne was refolved and certain, if he did noc repel force with force: che Chieftains of the Ar¬

<p>At my firft appearance Soliman feemed to be very much furprized; and beholding me
with an angry look, he demanded ofthe Bajfa that brought me, where the Princefs of L i,
was ? My Lord, faid he unCo him, Prince Muftapha delivered no other then this ptrfonDn'to
me, whom I faw him creac as if flie were che Princefs of Terfia. I no fooner heard this an-
fwer ffor I had already learned a litde of your language ) but I caft my (elf at ik Sultm
feet, and humbly befought him to hear me. I will hear no lying, anfwered he. My Lord
replyed I, it is not to keep thy Highnefs from puniftiing it, that I beg the favor of thee tobe
heard, but to keep thee from confounding the innocent with the guilty; for in fine, my Lotd
I am faulty, and Muflapha is abfolutely innocent. I would I had given thee, anfwered the
grand Signior thereupon, che half ofmy Empire, chac Muftapha were not guilty. My Lord
replyed I with more confidence chen before, Idoaavebuc cwo chings ot thee to give thee
thac fatisfadion; che one is, chac thou wilt hear me without interrupting me; andtheothet,
thac thou wilt permit the Prince to juftifie himfelf in perfon. This laft, anfwered he, isim-
pofllible, buc for the other I do grant it thee; and promife thee moreover, that if thou doft
juftifie Muftapha (which I do not believe thou canft do ) there is nothing which thcu Qiih
not obtain ofme. I did not yield at the very firft; I befoughc him ehae he would fee tht
Prince; I labored to vanquifli him with my reafons; but at laft feeing I nothing prevailed, I
declared the matter unto him, as we had refolved it; and thac wich fo much ingenuity, asl
well perceived he beleeved me. I repeaced chis Hiftory from Ruftans arrival at Mazmicm,
and coming Co fpeak of our fliipwrack, I lamented che lofs of the Princefs, I fpakeof heras
beleeving herco bc dead; and recounced alfo, hovf Sarraida had received roc from thofe,
who hadfoundmeoncheSea-flioar; and confequently, how a litde before Prince Gw»^&lt;r,
having feen me with Sarraida, where I had been for che moft part fick, had beleeved that I
was the Princefs of Terfia, by reafon of a pidure which hehad ofme, and which a Met-
chant, who had deceived him, had fold him for Axiamira's: I told him moreover, that as
foon as A/«/?&lt;&lt;p^^ was perfwaded, chac I was theVtincefs of Perfia, he had prcpatecl him¬
felf for che conduding of rae to his Highnefs. Thac for me, I had noc difabufed him, as
well Co be the more fecured, as for chac I hoped I fliould che more eafily obtain my hberty,
when as I fhould requeft it of him by che memory of che infortunate Axiamira.
</p>
<p>Soliman, moved wich my words, fetched a greac figh, and ceftlfied both by his carriage
and his difcourfe, chac he was afflided for che lofs of che Princefs; and yec that he had fome
joy, in regard he could hope th%t Muflapha vi^snoifohwhy ^sheh^^d beleeved bira tobe,
and chac in the end he mighc juftifie himfelf.  In chis choughc, the Sultan fpake very gently

dw^^r into fury, who, without confidering that his refiftance would render him culpable, lefc
not, quite unarmed as he was, to do ftrange things in oppofition of Axiamira's carrying a-
way by force. He would have fnatched Ruftans fcimitar from him, to have ufed it againft

and after he had exceedingly reviled bim, he on a fudden conjured him with tears in his eyes,
that he would have fome pity on him in the perfon of the Princefs Axiamira; that ha
would remember he was the fon of Roxelana, whofe daughcer he had marryed, being affu¬
red if che Suit ana his Mocber knew his defigns, fhe would approve of chem; that ha

<p>To all thefe chings, iJ«/?&lt;j» anfwered wich an infolent coldnefs, how he reraembred very

<p>Now, my Lord, I have already told you, I think, thac Ruflan arrived ac Amafta the next

Si^nioy's Tent,to go to that whither they were conduding us,we encountred danger,whom
the Ckp«&gt;« had not fuffered to enter at fuch time as we were carried in. This Prince, feeing
us all in ctars, approached eo Axiamira; Well chen. Madam, faid he unto her, what, ;m I to
refolve ofmy life, have you been ill-intreated, and yT/»/?^;^^ «s he convided of my crimes?

deftiny, and chac ofmy dear broeher, Co cbe end I raay regulace mine by yours, and chat there¬
upon I'may form my defigns, and take my refolutions. ^ Ruftan, who wonld not fuffer this
converfation, neither would incenfe the fpirit ofthis young Prince, before his intentions were
accompliflied, for fear he fliould be carried to fome violence, anfwered him, tha.t Soliman's
anger would be appeafed, that patience would overcome him; and left he fliould be offended
if he came to know it, that it was fit he fliould forbear fpeaking to Axiamira, becaufe he had
exprefly forbidden it, and thac without exception. I am undone, replyed Gianger, love or
choller hath been the caufe of this Command, and howfoever ic be,'I am equally unhappy.
Comfort your felf,faid the Princefs to him, and be fure that Axiamira will never do any thing
unworthy of her birch, of her courage, and of the efteem which you have of her: Buc inthe
mean time ifit be poflible endeavor to affift Prince Muflapha.
</p>
<p>Ruftan, feeing this converfation continue ftill, committed the Princeffes and me to the cu-
ftody of them that accompanied him; but Sarraida increated him, that ber fon might at leaft
be reftored to her; for he would not let Soliman fee him for fear he fhould have been moved
with it: this cruel raan granted ber this grace, out ofthe doubt he was in, V ft her cries and
lamentations fliould have caufed fome tumult amongft the Soldiers if they had heard them. As
for him, hc ftay'd with gianger, to whom he faid fo many things, to pacific him, and to
make him believc,that the more patient he was, the more fubmiffion he fliewed, and the more
confidence be put in the goodnefs of Soliman, the raore would he make it appear in this occa¬
fion, as any other then danger would have been deceived therewith. But he, who knew the
cunning of chis Tray tor,had noC followed his counfel$,if the vertuous and pxndtnX. Ac hm at,^f]ho
came to them at that very time, had not counfclled him the fame thing, though it was with a
very different intention. He promifed him to go to Soliman, for to endeavor the appeafing
of his fury; and intreated him that in the mean time he would repair to his Tent, wichout
permiecing any body co fee hira; as well becaufe he was come Co the Camp without tbe Em¬
perors order, as for fear left fome violent fpirie ftiould make him alter his refolution, affuring
him that after he had been wich the Sultan, he would come and give him an accompt ofwhat
he had done. Giangtr would fain have fpoken with his vertuous friend in private, to have dif¬
covered unto him his love, and his brothers innocence, but itwas impoflible for him. Not

<p>the Sultan commanded him to ftay, and fell a walking, fometimes very taft, fomet.tnes more
kafurely • one while he ftood looking on Achmat, without faying any thing untohim; by
and by he lifted up his eyes to Heaven,then foddenly turned them down to the ground ; ac laff,
after fo violent an agitation both of body and mind, he ka^ned on Achmat, and b holding
him with more marks of grief chen of anger. Mutt I, faid he unco him, afcer f have hved uncil
now, exempted from ill ehe crimes ofmy Predeccffurs, be conftrained by Muflapha to lay a
ftain upon my life ? and muft ie be faid of me, that I have dipt ray hands in the blood of my
fon ? Achmat, furprized with this difcourfe, and willing to make ufe of fo good a motion,
caft himfelf at his feet, and faid fo much unto him, that ( neither his Reafons, nor the good
nature of this Prince, being any longer combated by the malice of i?»/«i«; he told him with
tears in bis eyes, that he feared he had been but two well obeyed, and that his re pcntance came
but too late. And then aftet he had confeffed unto him the Order he had given Ruflan,he com¬
manded him to go with all fpeed to revoke it. But, my Lord, there was no more time for ir,
becaufe as foon as Ruftan had gotten permiflion to exercife his cruelty, the wicked man had
taken four Mutes along with him, having each of them a Bow-ftring in his hand, for in that
manner it is, as you know, that the children of the Royal Family are here put to death, and
carried them to the Tent of Muftaphajxom whom at che firft they had required his Scymitar,
which he had given them without refiftance. This Tyger ftaying without the Tenc with
them ehae had accompanied him, as well Co keep any body from entring, as to hear whac this
miferable Prince would fay in breaching out his laft, his Execucioners began Co aceempt che ac-
complifliing of cheir charge.
</p>
<p>When Muftapha firft faw chefe four Mutes enter, he made no doubt but hc was loft; yet
being ftrong and courageous, he could not refolve to fuffer himfelf to be ftrangled wichouc
fome defence. The firft that would have put che ftring abouc his neck, he layd ae his feet j
the like be did to the fecond ; and having put himfelf in a pofture that he could not be feized
upon behind, he not a little troubled his Executioners. He had already taken three of their
firings from them, and it may be he raight have defended himfelf fo long, till Achmat might
have arrived foon enough, had not the Traytor Ruftan put his fecad into the Tent, and by figns
threatened the Mutts Co do their duty. Muftapha, hearing thisvoyce, and knowing it, lefc
his Executioners to go Co Ruftan; which was the caufe chat thofe four men falling all upon
him, overthrew him the more eafily to the ground, and put the ftring about his neck. This
deplorable Prince had the leafure yet to fay in ftrugling with them (as fome of them who ac¬
companied Ruftan have reported) Do fo much at leaftwife, thou cruel man, that I may be the
only facrifice to appeafe die rage of Roxelana; and that my death may obtain the hves of
Gianger, Sarraida and Axiamira of Soliman. With thefe laft words, which interceded for
anothers life, Muftapha loft his own ; and in his perfon dyed one of the greateft and moft ex¬
cellent Princes ofthe World. The people have brutcd abroad, how by a communication that
was there, from Soliman's Tent to Muftapha's, that Prince had the cruelty to excite the
Mutes to ftrangle his fon; but very tar from thac, Achmat arrived wichin a moment after
Muslapha cxptxed, who, as I have told you, came to change the fatal Order, yNhich Ruftan
had but two mW execuced. This Prince was no fooner dead, buc Ruftan, as if fome ebrv
would have redounded to him by fo barbarous an ad, wenc Co render Soliman an accompt df

<p>any thing to him of a matter, which could then ferve to no purpofe.
</p>
<p>This firft motion of forrow being over, the vertuous Achmat believed that he owed tli
confex^nixonofdangertoihememoxy of Muftapha; he wenc then with fpeed to him fr
tear left being acquainted with this lamentable news by another, he ftiould take fome f^nm
refolution.  In che mean cime the report of this death being fpread over tbe Camp, all the fi
nizariesame fiocVm^io Muflapha'sTent, where finding him dead, they rendered him all
the eeftimonies of grief, which affedionace Soldiers could render to their General.   Allthe
Commanders did che like; there were nothing but cries and lamentations; fome threw
themfelves upon his body, and embracing him wet him with their tears; others faid aloud
that they muft revenge his death, teer out Ruflan's heare, remove Salman from bis Throne'
go and burn Roxelana in her Serraglio, and declare Muftapha's fon Emperor, though he was
but a child.   Some again,lefs violenc and feditious, chrevf down their arms, made a vow never
to bear any, and having thereof framed as it were a Trophy, which they ereded to the vertue
of this Prince, they layd his body upon it, and abode round about it weeping the lofs they had
fuftained. Never was there a more general confternation feen; all che Soldiers continued four
and twenty hours without eating: and if the prudence of Achmat had not fhewed it felf in this
occafion, Soliman's Throne had been overturned, and his perfon in danger.   As for us, we
heard indeed a great noife, but it was impoflible for us to comprehend what it might be; and
they whom i?«/?4» had lefc Co guard us were fo faichful untohim, as they would not clear it
unto us.   We imagined with our felves, that peradventure Prince danger, having made one
part ofthe Soldiers to rife, endeavored to deliver Muflapha, to the end be might come after¬
wards and deliver us alfo; and in this eftate we were between fear and hope.    In the mean
while Ruftan was gone back to Soltman, who feeing him enter alone, demanded of him what
Muftapha faid ofhis clemency.   My Lord, anfwered he mightily furprifed, Muftapha is no
longer in a condition ever to fay any thing to thy Highnefs that may difpleafe thee.  Ah! in¬
fortunate that I am,and moft bafe as thou art,continued Soli7nan,how readily haft thou obey-
ed me in a wicked adion ? He asked him then whether he had not feen Achmat; and having
underftood thac he arrived noc cill afcer the death of the Prince, he fhewed fuch exceflive grict,
as the like was never feen.   Ruftan amazed at fo fudden a change, would have reprefented
unto him, how much this death affured che quiec of his Empire; buc the Sultan, exceedingly
moved wich choller, chafed him from his prefence, and forbad him for ever appearing belore
him again.
</p>
<p>In che mean time Soliman not knowing whom to make his moan Co about his crime and
his misfortune, commanded Achmat co be fent for again to him. He was lought for, and
found with Prince danger, much bufied in moderating the violence of his grief, tor he hadic-
quainced him with che death of his brother. Thefe two Princes had always loved fo dciily
together, as never was there a moreperfed and dif-interefled amity then theirs; fothatits
eafie to imagine the defpair Gianger was in, when he knew not only chat his brother wasdeid
ofa violent de'ath; but thac which touched his heart more nearly, that he dyed for his fake,
withouc being culpable of any thing, but of coo much loving him. Ah 1 my Lord, that Icould
repeat vnco you all that this afflided Prince faid in fo lamentable an adventure I butyouw"!

Sultan was advertifed, how the Soldiers, who knew not that .S^r-r^/'^^ was in Rufims
Tent thruft on Iw the fury that maftered them, were going to fel it on fire. So that to hin¬
der this mircbief, Solmanievxt Achmat to let the Soldiers underftand, how ^^rr^t^u was
in that Tent, and that in feeking to revenge Muflapha, they were upon the point of burning
his wife and his fon. But to take from them an objed, which might exafperate their grief,
Achmat held it convenient, not to leave Axiamira, Sarraida, or Muftapha's fon any longer
in the Camp; fo that having drawn J"&lt;i//»w« to like of it, and kepc the Soldiers ftom offer¬
ing any violence to the place where we were, he came to Axiamira to affure her from Soli¬
man, that flie ftould be entreated by him with the refped which was due to her condition j
and that in attending till they might advife what was fit to be done therein, he defired her flie
would be pleafed to fuffer her felf to be conduded to (Conftantinople. As for Sarraida, he
told her with tears in his eyes, that theGrand Signior pexmitted het to chufe a retreat, in
whatphice of his Empire flie would; affuring her, that he would have as much care of pro-
ledingher, as he had had violence in the perfon of Muftapha. Sarraida no longer doubt¬
ing of the death of her dear husband after this difcourfe, and Axiamira being but coo well
atUired of ic as well as flie,they both of them faid things,chac were ftronger then che conftan¬
cy of ^f/'»»^^ He wept with chefe cwo great Princeffes, and recouncing to them the mattet
as ic had paft, excufing Soliman as much as he could, he made them comprehend that Ruflan
was the caufe of all this mifchief.
</p>
<p>In the mean tixne Axiamira, in the midft of her afflidion, demanded news of Gianger;
and after ftie had been affured that he lived, mdthzt the Grand Signior had none buc good
thoughts for him, flie aaved pardon of che infortunace Sarraida tor having been the caufe
of her miferies; and made this difcourfe With fo much tendernefs and grief, as Sarraida
her felf was moved with her rrfentment. Muftapha's fon yet furcber augmenced che Prin¬
ceffes difplcafure; for albeic this childe had noC attained Co the cenlh year of his age, he feem¬
cd to be fo afflided for tbe lofs of his father, and faid fuch generous and reafonable things,
as it might bc faid, that he would have as much refembled him in the qualities of the minde,
as in the features of the face, if Fortune had permitted him to live. He affured Sarraida,
that he would one day revenge the death of his father; he grieved that hehad not fomuch
ftrength as courage, and that he could give her nothing but tears in this occafion.

way tor him to pafs through tkm; and redoubling their cries and lamentations,fome ot them
offered him to revenge this death, and all of them together protefted that they would have the
fame affedron for him they had had for his brother.   Buc he, without barkening to their com-
plaints, their offers, or their prayers, chrows himltlt upon his brochcrs body, wets him
with his rears, chen looking round about him, as it were to feek for fomething, he efpyed a
dagger amidft that greac number of arms, which he layd hold on; and then lifting up his
voyce, wich a more quif-t countenance chen before, Let fome of you, O Soldiers (faid he) i
the memory of Muftapha be dfar unto you, declare unto iioUman, chat in giving my brother
his death, he hath pm this fteel into my hand ; and lee the Princefs of Perfta know alfo, that I
did not dye cill I had loft the hope of poffefling her: faying this, he ftab'd the dagger into
his heart, no body being able Co prevenc him, and fell down dead upon the body of his bro¬
ther.   Alafs 1 my Lord, I know this cruth but coo well; for by ill fortune, the charet where¬
in we were paffed foneer CO chac place, asl fivj danger when as he ftab'd himfelf. This
fighc, and chis adion chen made me give a greac skriek.   Is chere (faid the Princefs unto me,
who did noc look chat way) fome more new misfortune befallen us ? Ah 1 Madam, faid 1
unto her, the greateft chat can happen to you in the eftate wherein you are.  Wc heard a
redoubling then of the wailings, lamentations, and cries of the Soldiers, who making the nime
of danger to xefound all about, faid fo much of his death, asthey had acquainted her but
too well whac this misfortune was, without putting me to the trouble of telling it her. She
commanded the charet, wherein we were, to ftand ftill; but the confufion was fo great, and
the noife fo dreadful, as her Order could not be heard; befides, they that conduded us, took
fuch care to gee us fpeedily ouc of the Camp, asl beleeve if they had heard what Ihe faid,
they would not have obeyed her; fo that we wenc away in this manner, without more par¬
ticularly knowing the death ofthis miferable Prince: having not learnt all that I have recount¬
ed unto you, and all chac I fliall cell you hereafcer, cill we came hither, where the genetoiu
Achmat imparted it unto us.
</p>
<p>Icis eafie, my Lord, Co comprehend, whac the gxief oi Axiamira ^n^s; That great and
generous Soul, which never fainted under her own misfortunes, found it felf then too weak,
to fupport thofe of another. For chough love had no place in her heart, amity, compallion,
and the obligations wherein fhe flood engaged toVxinee danger, produced the fame efreos
in her upon this occafion. Whac faid flie noc Co teftifie her afflidion I or to lay better, what
did fhe not that fhe might not furvive this laft mifliip 1 flie abfolutely declined the care of h"
prefervation, flie refufed co eat, and I dare fay, fhe would never have refolved to live,«
with my tears and prayers I had not conjured her not to leave rae in the hands of a Princf,
which might entreat me as one culpable. It was not becaufe I was poffeft with that tear;
but feeing this Ptincefs no way fenfible of her own confervation, I beleeved, that the fame
generofity, which made her defpife her life, to lament anothers misfortune, would induce her
to preferve it for the eafingof mine. As Indeed, after that flie fuffered metotake acaieo
her, and without abandoning her grief, fhe refolved to attend death, and not to feek it.

caufed it to be publiffied over all tbe Camp, chac he deprived Ruflan ofall his Commands,

who would have carryed fire even to che Emperors Tenc, cxyed,Iong live the Sultan, a quar¬
ter of an hour afcer,%'hen as in perfon he made a curn abouc the Camp. He commanded cbe bo¬
dies ofthe two Princes to be put into one Coffin,and the farae being placed in a Charet covered
with black velvet,he ordained them to be carried Co Conflantinople,tnd laid in the fame tomb,
which he had prepared for himfelf neer to the Mofque he had built.He willed alfo that the faid
Charet fliould be attended upon by half of his Army, and that this funeral pomp fliould be cele¬
brated with the fame magnificence, as if ic had been of an Emperor thac had dyed in che Wars.
As for himfelf, he had a purpofe co have gone to Meccjua Co expiate his fault,and Co pray un¬
to God and tbe holy Prophet for the Souls ofthe Princes: buc the affairs of Perfta prefling hira,
he contented himfelf wich going toIerufalem,v!hexe he gave fo many teftimonies ofhis repent¬
ance and grief, as it was eafie to know,that this Prince had noc aded by his own inclinariorls.
Bur, my Lord, whil'ft Soliman gives marks of the forrow he is in for his vioknce,RoxeLnu
repents her not of her wickednefs, and far from having fo good a motion, flie thinks of new
cruelties. I have told you,if my meraory fail not,bow kuflan was chafed from Solimans Tent,
but I have not told yon what became ofhim afterwards: You rauft underftand then,how ha-
ving executed that which Roxelana had fo ardently defired, he thought it was not fit tor him
to expofe himfelf inconfideratly,and chac having noching more to do there for the fervice ofthe
Sultana, he might go and render her an account ofhis doings. He parted immediacely then as
fecretly as poflibly he could; but he ftayd neverthelefs at che firft Town he came eo,where one
of his fervants, whom he had given in charge abouc ie, came and acquainted him with all thac
had been done in the Camp; 1 mean,the revolt ofthe Soldicrs,the death of gianger,So Umans
extream repentance,the retreat which Sarraida had chofen, and briefly all that had psft there.
This cruel man fully mformed of all things, went with all fpeed toRoxeUna,md as he related ic

<p>to the parts ^bo\xt Prufa, and from thence fent to Sarraida one of the minifters of his f
who was his Slave, and who made ftiew that he was come to this excellent Princefs tromT
Grand Signior, to affure her of the continuance ol his good-will and protedion He jf^
broughc prefents to her fon, as being gages of the Sultan's affedion. He cold her hxtk
that his Highnefs would make Muflapha revive in che perfon of chis young Prince • and th't
he commanded her to have a great care of his health and education. This infortuna'te mother
who knew by the publique voycc how much Soliman feemed to repent him of his violence'
fuffered her felf co be perfwaded chac all which chis wicked man faid was true. In the mean
time he chinks of execucing his defign any way whatfoever; and feeing it was hard for him
to remove chis young Prince frcm Sarraida, either Co finde means to poyfon him, or to do
any violence in a Town, where the memory of Muftapha was in fo much veneration, he be¬
thought him to perfwade Sarraida that fhe would accuftom her felf to take the ayr, for feat
kft keeping always in thac fort within doors, her melancholly ftiould pafs unto her fon, and fo
prove prejudicial co his healch. After he had gotten this Princefs to yeeld unto that which he de¬
fired, he propounded to her a thing, which, very much agreeing with her fad and heavy hu-
mor, feemed to be a very fie and pleafing encercainmenc for her; which was to go and fee the
Grand Signior's Tombs, that were four or five miles diftant from this Town, and whofe
ftately Mofques are co this day very carefully maintained. Now, my Lord, that which in-
duced this Ttaycor to give Sarraida chis counfel, was, thac having fuborned him, who wasto
drive her Charec, he had broken che axlecree of ic, not quice through, buc in fuch a manner,
as he forefaw how upon their arrival ac a very difftculc paffage, which was juft in the midll
of che way, chac which he expeded would affuredly come Co pafs, as indeed the matter fuc¬
ceeded accordingly. In helping che Princefs into her Charec, he perfwaded the young Prince
to go wich him on horfeback, who, according co che cuftom of children, was ravilhedwith
this propofition. Sarraida, out of a thought of tendernefs, or ic may be out of an inftinfl
that advertifed her of her misfortune, oppofed ic as much as fhe could; buc feeing her fon
afflided at it, and chat this man promifed her to hold him in his arms, and co have a great care
of him, fhe confenced co ic. She was no fooner out of the Town, but this Traytor who car¬
ryed the young Prince, beganto gee before, and by lictle and little going farther from the
Charet, as if he had not done ic of purpofe, Sarraida loft the fighc of him.
</p>
<p>This infortunate Princefs feeing her fon no longer, began co fear without knowing where¬
fore, whereupon ftie commanded her Charet-raanco drive as faft as he could, but whereas
he was fuborned, he obeyed noC ac firft, howbeie flic threatened him in fuch anger, as hewas
conftrained to do whac (he would have him; but chis fpeed was chac which retarded her de¬
fign che more; for che axlecree (as I have told you) being half broken, and tbe Charet going
violently on, it btokc fooner then otherwife ic wonld have done. Sarraida,behM^,f^
overcurned,and no longer feeing her fon,never confulced on chac which flie was eo do; fo that
abandoning her Charec, and walking on fooc, followed by two women that accompanied ber,
ftie continued in che way which flie had caken, with a crembling of her heart, and anextreiffl
grief. And whereas ftie was carryed by affedion, flic wenc fo faft, as buc one of her women
could follow her. She arrived then neer tothe Grand Signior's Tombs, but alafs 1 What
was the objed which flie encountred there ? ftie beheld her fon ftrangled, ftill warm, pant¬
ing, and almoft in the laft pangs of death. This deadly fpedacle touched her in fo Itrsngea
manner, as ftie fell down as it were dead upon the body of her fon.                              ,

<p>In the mean time hc chac had driven Sarraida's Charec, being remrned to the Town, J"

were both carried back to Prufa, where this accident caufed fo general a mourning,and touch¬
ed every one fo fenfibly, as there was not any teftimony of affedion, or mark of honor, which
they ofthis Town did noc render CO che Corps of ^^^-m^^i and her fon, which ot their own
authority they layd in the Sepulchres of the ancient Emperors, a thing without example. The
chiefeft amongft them went in all hafte to purfue the Murtherer of this young Prince, but he
was already gotten far enough oft" with Ruftan, who no fooner underftood that his Command¬
ment was executed, buc away he pofted to carry Roxelana che news of it, who received it
wich unfpeakable joy.
</p>
<p>Now whereas the Sultan was to arrive within two days, fhe counfclled him to conceal
himfelf, until fhe had appeafed his difplcafure. In the mean time (he willed bim fo to order
the matter, as it might be believed, that the death of Muftapha's fon came by the Command¬
ment of ^o/j?w^.», for fear left hc being fufpeded for it, fliould draw the peoples hatred upon
him, who would eafily be perfwaded of that which they were willing fliould be. As indeed,
the moft part were ot that opinion, though it were otherwife; for that Slave ot Ruflan's not
long fince confeffed it on his death bed. Soliman at his return underftanding the death of
Muftaphas fon,teftifieda great deal of forrow and anger for it; but Roxelana accuftomed to
prevail over the fpirit of this Prince, with her wiles and rears. Cold him, chac chis adion ic may
be was noe eoo much difadvaneageous Co ehe quiec ofhis Empire, for flie had been informed,
thit Sarraida, fince her being ac Trw/i, bad concinually infpired her fon wich choughcs of

buc wifh him a longer life chen his facher, Co ehe end he mighe revenge his dcach, and mount
up CO a Throne which appercained unto hira; that without doubt fome roan zealous for his
Highnefs hid undertaken this bold adion; and therefore according to her fence the Author of
it was not to be much looked after. This difcourfe, which fbould have begot a fufpicion in
the mind of Solman, perfwaded him, and was fo prevalent with him, as there was no further
enquiry made ofthis crime, which confirmed tbc people in the opinion, that it had been com¬
mieeed by his Order. Afcer this, Roxelana did her uttermoft endeavor to obtain Ruftan's
grace, but flie could not poffibly do it. In the mean time the vertuous Achm,it, having un¬
derftood more particularly the extream affedion, which Prince Muflapha and Prince Gianger
had born to Axiamira, to fliew how dear their memory was unto him, had obtained the per¬
miffion to fee her, which be bath done as often as his occafions would fuffer him. And it is by
him alfo chit we have underftood, how Soliman would not fincc his return IcC any body fpeak

<p>THe next day Ibrahim went to the Grand Signior, and with a dextrous difcourfe he gave
him to undcrftand, that he had learned what he durft not tell him. But in imparting thii
to him, he lee him fee alfo, that he lamented him wichout accufing him; and carrying him
infenfibly CO (pea.^ oi Axiamira, he befoughc him to grant him one grace which he would
demand of him in favor of her and Felixana. Soliman gave not the Ba(fa leafure to explain
his defire, but affured him chac he mighc do whac he pleafed iot Axiamira; the repentaqce
of his faulc, and che remembrance of his misfortune, having fo abfolutely extinguilhcd the
love which he had born her, thac if he would even fend her back into Perfta, although Ihe
was the daughter ofhis Enemy, and thac fli: might ferve for the good of his affairs, yet would
he not refufe Co confenc unco ic. My Lord, anfwered Ibrahim, 1 precend Co no other grace
for Axiamira, then to make her change her prifon, in obtaining of thy Highnefs, chat Ihe
may be fent Co Bitiftfa, and that fhe may be encreated as a perfon of her birth. And then to
oblige him the more to that which he requefted of him, Ibrahim acquainced him with the
intereft which Vlama had in Felixana: Hc made it appear unto him alfo, that his in this
occafion was annexed to thac of Axiamira; that it was requifice he fliould by his good uf&gt;g«
of her juftifie himfelf Co her, for the violence which/?»/?&lt;*» had offered her, in carrying her
forcibly away againft his Highnefs will: that fhe would be in his power as well at BitHif*, ^
at (Conflantinople; but that being ncerer to ber Country,fhe woiild receive tbe mote comfort
by ic, and might be even the means of an advantageous peace for. his Highnefs.

<p>After all chde reafons, Soliman anfwered him, thac they were necdlefs, fince his entreaty
alone fufficed co ihake him confenc to all thac he could defire; there being but cne onely ttog
which he could never obtain of him. The gran^ Vifier, not daring to be curious in thisen-
councer, for fear of receiving fome diftafteby it, contented himfelf wich giving Solmif^
thanks, and omitting no time, he went and^e oVder to have a ftacely equipage provided
for Axiamira. And whereas he was exad in all chings, he ufed fuch diligence, as theday
after all was in the ftate which hc defired it to be. 'He went the next morning to theultK
of the feven Towers, where in few words he propounded to the Princefs her going to Biti¬

complain of Forcune, wichouc raurmuring againft Soliman; and albeic I am refolved to weep
allmyhfe-timeforthelofsof thofe two illuftrious children of his, yet will I not accufe any
for ic buc che crutl Roxelana, and the perfidious Ruflan. This converfation lafted yet a good
while longer, and was fpent in civility on either part. Felixana in her particular gave Ibra¬
him a world of thanks, and affured him fhe would render Vlama an exad account of that
which hc had done for her, to the end he raight help to acknowledg ic in pubUftiing ie, fince
they could never acquire themfelves of it ocher-ways. Prefendy chereupon, che Grand Vifier
took his leave of che Princefs, and cold her, chac flie mighc deparc the nexe morning, if her
healch would permic her: As indeed all her equipage was ready accordingly, buc with fuch
magnificence, as if flie had been in ferfia. This excellent Princefs had made her fclf to be fo
beloved of chem that guarded her, as they could not fee her part wichouc abundance of
tears, though they very much rejoyced for all that toknow, thac her prifon ftiould noC be
thence forward fo ftrait. But amongft the reft, Halima was fo afflided at it, as fbe was not
to be comforted; fhe gave her two Slaves, who had always waited upon her during her im¬
prifonmcnt; tnd Axiamira, in recompence thereof, gave her a chain of Diamonds, which
flie had ftill kept in all her misfortunes.

<p>In tbe mean time Ibrahim had fent away Vlama's Slave, whora he had broughc away
from the Caftle of the feven Towers the day before, to advertife his Mafter to repair co Biti-
Ufa, ifhis ftrength would permic him, chere co receive the Princefs. But in cafe he fliould
notbe able foto do, he difpatched away another man, with a command frora the Grand
Sigmor to all the Governors of thofe Towns, which were upon the road, whereby flie was
to pafs, to render her as much honor, as if flie had been the Sultana Queen. And the Grand
Vtfier, to otnit nothing that might be for the Princefs of Perfia's fafety, had alfo coramand¬
ed hve ehoufand 7^«.;tm.. to be her convoy, whom flie found ready attending for her a

<p>But whil'ft Ibrahim affwages other folks forrows, his love renders him evervdavrnl
unhappy The more he fees Salman, the lefs appearance he fees of obtaining his liberty whi
he had refolved to demand of him ac his departure from Monaco. This Prince ceafed nt
dayly telling him, that he had been d:ad if he had not rccurned; that he was the foul of his
Empire; that he could not fubfift wichouc him; chat fix monchs abfence of bis had been the
caufe of more misforcune to hira, chen be had had in all his life befides; and chat z«/i; foot
being able to live without him, he muft refolve to dye with him. To all thefe particulars the
illuftrious Ba^a made no other anfwer then with low fubmiffions, buc by his fighs and filerce
he teftified fufficiently to the Sultm, chac he expreffed not all his choughc; and chac thelight
of his Miftrefs had racher augmented his lovc, chen diminiffied his unquietnefs. Neverthe¬
lefs, whereas che Grand Signior was defirous to avoyd all occafions chac mighc conftrain hira
to refufe Ibrahim, he made as chough he did not perceive his fadnefs, buc endevored co gain
him abfolutely, and divert bim from his raelancholy, by all the honors, by all the liberalities,
and all the careffes, that a greac Prince can confer on a great Minifter. But the more die Btjfn
faw himfelf obliged, the raore afflidion he had: He received the Sultan's prefents, as foma¬
ny new chains, which tyed him unto him; his favors were torments unto him; and though
in his heart he loved this Prince dearly, yec would he not have been loved of bim, fo certain
it is that love is ftronger then amity.
</p>
<p>Inthis deplorable eftace hved Ibrahim Wiih^n extream conftraint; he dele no longer in
affairs as he was wont; he declined che wodd as rauch as he could; yea the very fight of St.
liman became infupportable to him; and not daring to defire of hira the power to return in¬
to Italy, out of the opinion he had that he fliould be denyed, he fought no longer for any
thing but onely folicude.  Ie was noc becaufe his grief was che lefs fenfible to him by it, but
it was becaufe he knew, that the liberty to bewail ones fdf is fome kinde of confolation to
an afflided perfon.   At length, after he had well confulted with himfelf, he refolved to fpeak
plainly to the Grand Signior, with an intent it he were refufed (as he almoft made no doubt
but he fhould) to abandon hirafelf in fuch fore Co grief, as death would bcconlirained to
fuccor him; but he knew not, when he cook this refolution, chac hecould not execute it:
for as often as he went Co che Serraglio for thaC purpofe, Soliman with fo much addreli a-
voyded all manner of difcourfe thac might carry che Baffa co fpeak Co him of IfabelU, d
always cook fuch care to lee him know ehe neceflity he had of his prefence, as the Gmi
Fifter, no longer doubting, but chac J'o//7»/«« would deny hira if he dcraanded his liberty of
him, undertook not to augraent his difplcafure yet further, by the certainty of an evil, wher^
of he was already but too well affured.   He reraained then without fpeaking, and tbutting
up his thoughts in his heart, he grew to be the mclancholickeft man in the wodd.  He aban¬
doned the care of affairs, and making to hirafelf a prifon of his Palace, he went no more a-
broad, but now and chen to go to the Serraglio, and that too very feldom.   His prefence,
which was wont to charm all Soliman's unquietneffes, now begot nothing but grief in him;
forbe faw him fo altered, his eyes fo funk into his head, his face fo pile, his huraot fofad,
and his fpirit fo croubled, as he could noc behold him without extream difplcafure, but a dif¬
plcafure which he held to bc fo rauch the more juft, as he knew it to be the caufe of that of
our illuftrious Baffa. He foughc neverthelefs to deceive himfelf, by laboring to be perfwaded,
that peradventure ehe aleeraeion which he faw in his dear Ibrahim, was a raalady of the bo¬
dy, as well as of ehe minde; wherefore he confulced wich a Jewifli PhyHcian, and an Ar*-
bian, abouchim, who, having fome cime obferved the i?4/&lt;« without his being a ware of it,
judged the alteration, which was feen in him, Co proceed hom fome ftrange caufe, diCwnj-

peared in him, was not an effed of his ceraper, buc of forae afflidion chac croubled his aimj.
and which queftionlefs was derived frora fome violenc paffion.   Afcer fo righc and fo wel •
grounded a debate, chey cold che Grand Signior freely, chac chey could not warrant Ibrahm

ffich had fo often blinded him, yec had flie ftill that Empire over him, as he could never
refofe her any thing, but the grace of Ruflan; fo that in this occalion he almoft fuffered him¬
felf to be vanquiftied by her.  He confeffed not the whole truth unto her, but he told her,
rhat/^M/»»Vs melancholy was che caufe of all his fadnefs; and withouc impa-'-iw roher,
that he was a Chriftian under the habic of a Turk., ox ofwhat Country he was, he coiu het
further  that being fallen paflionately in love with a Chriftian Princefs, whom hehad feen,
durin^'the voyage which he had made by his order; che grief of being deprived of her pre¬
fence and of the hope of poffefling her, had brought him even to deaths door    Afterwards,
he declared unto her the forrow he was in for it, and how he would give half his Empufi

which I will demand of thee, I will oblige my felf to reftore thy favorice eo his wonted joy,

ftill concealed in ConflantinapU, Co corae ae the beginning of che nighc to one of the gates of
the Serraglio, where he ftiould finde two ofher black flaves attending for him, and not to fear
repairing thither, becaufe the Capigibaffi, chat kept che gate, was abfolutely hers.   Ruflan
failed not to be prefent ac this aflignation,no more chen che Slaves eo receive him,and to bring
him in.   When he was in her chamber, flie told him, chat whatfoever flie could do, it was
impoffible for her to obeain his grace; and chac flie thought he would never obtain it, but by
fome very extraordinary way; thac there was one did chen prefenc it felf, which fhe would
propofe unto him, to the end ehae if he faw any likelyhood in ic, fhe would finifh chac which
flie had begun; and chen fhe recounted unto hira what Soliman had faid co her, and what
(he had anfwered.  But it appeared that Ruflan was beceer informed of Ibrahim's fortune,
then Qie imagined; for chis man, who choughc of nothing but his re-eftablifbment, had
fuborned one ot the Grand fifiers fervants, to endevor Co finde out, whether chis illuftrious
Bafa were che caufe chac he was not reftored. This fervanc, fuborned by Ruftan, wenc ofcen
to him to give him account of chac which he learned: and the very fame day that Roxelana
had fent for him, he had acquainted hira, that Ibrahim was in love with a Princefs of Italj,
to whom appertained a Town called Monaco; that che grief for being abfent from her had
madehim fick, and would caufe his death, if the Grand Signior gave him not liberty to re¬
turn thither to fee her • that he had heard all this chrough Ibrahim's chzmbex door, who talk¬
ed thereof in private to an Italian Slave, whom he very much loved, and whom he had com-
minded, if he dyed for forrow, ashe fecmed not to doubt, to obtain permiffion of the
Grand Signior to go and exccute hij laft Will, in carrying a Letter to the Princefs whom hc
loved.  Ruftan having acquainted Roxelana with whac he knew concerning Ibrahim, Cold
her afterwards, thac if Soliman vjould bc pleafed to lee him fpeak with him, he did not

defign fucceed,wherewith Roxelana had already acquainted hira. My Lord,anfwered he, 1 do

into thy favor, Ibrahim (hall quickly be the happieft man on the Earch; for wanting nothing
to make him fo, buc ehe poffeffion of this Princefs, I will bring her to him ere it be long, no¬
thing fave death alone being able to keep me from performing it.  Soliman had at the begin-
ing fome averfion to this violence, but coraing to confider, chac ie was the onely way to
retain Ibrahim wich him, hc forgoc all other confiderations.   So that before he difmillcd
Ruftan, he was abfolutely refolved Co accempc che raacecr, and therefore he affured him that
he fliould depart within two days: but in che raean cime he charged him Co enereat the Ptin¬
cefs of Monaco, who was flie chaC he was to bring away, with the fame refped as heww
obliged to have for the Sultana Queen.   ,

<p>Things being in chefe cerms, the Grand Signior caufed all Ruftan's equipage to bc made
ready, with all the diligence that poffibly could be; he furnifhed him likewife with gteat
ftore of mony and jewels, in cafe he fliould have need of it; hehad alfo his difpatch, as if
indeed he had been fenc co the King of France, in the quality ofa Chaoux.- and lacking no¬
thing elfe for his voyage, he fet fail in as favorable a feafon as might be. This happy begiti-
ing of Navigation gave no falfe hopes to the Pilot, who made fuch ufe of the advantage of k

Chaoux, as foon as he had ftiewed his difpatch, but as one fent from a Prince, to whom the

</p>
<p>As for the ambitious Terca, the onely defire that flie had to reign raade her Co move; and
that foe miqht rife to that fopream greatnefs, flie thought there was buc two things wanting
to her • the^death of Delment, and the peoples hatred to Axiamira. For touching IJmaa
^nd Mahamed, flie did noc beleeve that theftupidity of theone, andthe bhndnelsot the
other would p.rmit them to oppofe her. So that to execute her intention, flie perfwaded
Deliment, that he was at this time to hazard all things; that it wasnot forhis honor, to
know Axiamira was fo neer the ftontire, and not do his uttermoft to draw her out ot Y^-^-
ma's hands: And for Tachmas, flie made hira do that which by her counfel he had refolved
upon. He faid before all his Court, that he Cook it very ill, foch joy fliould be teftified upon
notice had that his daughter was in the power of his Eneray; thac the belief of her death had
touched him lefs, then tbe news he had received that flie lived in that raanner; and then he
publiquely declared her guilty of high Treafon, aggravating all that P&lt;fr&lt;:&lt;e had faid tohim.
But though this Manifeft bad fome appearance of truth, yet found it no credic, eieher wich
the Grandees, orthe people. The violences of Deliment, the wickednefs of T^rrf^, and
tbe vertue of AxLtrntra, were too well known to have the matter fucceed, as Tachmas hoped
it would. Aad the people, on che contrary, feeing fo great marks ot aniraofity in a father a-
gainft his daughrcr, in a fifter againft her fifter, were ready to rebel, and be carryed Co fome
ftrange rtfolunon.
</p>
<p>In the m-jan time Deliment thinks of levying of Troops, and making up fo mighty an Ar¬
my, as, va; qiifotr or vanquiflied, it fliould abfolutely decide the fortune of this war; being
refolved to dye, or to return with Axiamira.   Tachmas on his fide, following his refolution,
difpatches an Eoibaffidor to the Grand Signior, toderaand his daughter, znd Felixanaoi
him; offering tvvo millions for their ranfom, though by law he beleeved not hirafelf obliged
to give any thing for two perfons, that were not prifoners of war.   He fent away divers fpies
at the fame inlf ant to BitiUfa, to learn what paft there; but all of thera reported, chat che
Princefs and Fdixana feemed to be abfolutely at liberty; that Vlama rendred chem all iraa-
ginable civilities; and what care foever they took therein, they could not difcover for what
reafon the Princcis had been conduded to BitiUfa; the people faying no other ching, but
that it was bcf eved fhe was corae neer unto Perjia to make propofitions of Peace.  A few
days after, a Meffenger fent by Axiamira came and broughc hira a Leccer frora this Princefs,
who not doubting buc chat the Sophi had heard where flie was, choughc ic was fie for her to
write unco him, to the end flie mighc noe be wancing in that duty which fhe owed him, as
being her father.  When he received this Letter, Perca and Deliment were there prefent,
who would have obliged him not to have read it, for fear left he fliould have been moved
therewith, but they could not prevail with hira; for this Prince, provoked more by curiofi¬
ty, or the thought that he fliould finde fomething in ic which regarded Felixana, chen by any
kindnefs, opened ic, and reading it aloud, he faw thac was thus.

<p>The reading ofthis Letter touched the Sophi va a diverfe manner; hc felc tendernefs, con*
fufion,and anger; and itmay be if he had been alone, Nature and Reafon had prevailed fo
powerfully for i/ixiamira, as fhe had carried away the vidory from her enemies; but tlie
counfelsofP^rfrf, and the fpeeches of Deliment, wrought a clean contrary effed in him.
ferca, told hira, thac ic was coo daring a pare in her to be fo bold, as co write fuch thingsto
him of a man whom he loved; chac wichouc doubc Axiamira fpake noc chus, but becaufe Ihe
was well affured, chac whatfoever ranfom was offered, flie fliould never be remitted into his
power; chat he was co eeftifie a greac deal of refencmene for chis infolenc proceeding, andto
inereac him ill whom che Princefs had fent, who queftionlefs was come to Prince Mahml
ot as a Spy, racher then co bring him this Lecter, which could not ferve Axiamira for ought,
whecher flbe remained in the (jr4»^ .yi^«*or'j Dominions, or whether flie returned into his
Erapire. Deliment feeing the Sophi fufficiently incenfed, took a different way from that
which Perca had held, which yet produced che fame effed. He befoughc the Sophi, with"
falfe generofity, to permit hira to withdraw himfelf from affairs, and from about him, tor the
contenting of Axiamira. But che Sophi, as Deliment had rightly forecaft it, forbad him the
further profecuting of this difcourfe, bis anger redoubling fo rauch the raore by this artificf'
And fora conclufion, he called che parcy before him, who had broughc hira che Letter troin
Axiamira, charged him never to come within his Dominions again, and told him, thatitne
had not purpofed to have him carry back his Commands, he would have had him feverely pu-
niflied.Then he willed hira to fay unco her thac had fenc him(for he would not call her the VtiJ-
cefs, his Daughter, ot Axiamira) chac hc had no other anfwer to make her, but that it t-
ranfotn, which he had fent to offer for her, did noc bring her back into Perfia, he wouWg"
and fetch her in the head ofan hundred thoufand men; and chac in che view of lo mignty
Army, he would deal with her,as Soliman had done wich Muflapha.                          .

<p>nrfiudice him if!; were met withall, yet had ftie not fofficiently concealed the extream affec-
Son which wasbetween them, and the incelligence tey had he d together, when flie was at
Z^a.   So that as foon as it was read, it was refo ved, for fear^^.^.«..^ fliould nMive
Xis by fome more fecret way, eo have cwo things done. The firft, to change all his Houfe.
'othe end that having none thac he could cruft abouc hira, he might not receive any news from
Axiamira.   And d e fecond, to fecure his perfon, left fome abroad fliould attempt chac which
was doubted trom them.  This deiign being refolved, was quickly cxexuted.  IhUment   ac¬
cording co his wonctd infolency, went himfelf to command the blind Prince from the .y.;,^*
noc CO irtr cue ot his lodging, and Co charge boch his Governor and all his fervanrs to be gone
from him: Thac done, he placed a Guard abouc hira, and left chis Prince in an affl.dion, the
like whereof he had never felt before. Ali thae carae near him were his Enemies Agents, arid
whether he would or no he was enforced Co let ehera wait upon hira.  This detention made
a great noife in the Sopht\ Court, even the people themitlves were divers tiraes about to rife;
but aoiorgft the reft the Princes domeftick fervants could not endure this violence.   And in-
d£ed,A&lt;lahamea's Governor, having affembled the chiefeft ot them together, propounded unto
them' the enterprifing ot carrying away the Prince their Mafter to BitiUfa.   He told them,
that it wasbetter to put him into the hands ofa courteous enemy, as Soltman was to Axia¬
mira, then to leave him in the power ofa cruel and incenfed fadier; that as tor them, if they
continued at Sultania,they would not bc in fafety,but upon theleafl fufpicion that one fliould
have ofthcra they would be feverely puniffied; fo that as well for the confervation of che
Prince, as tor cheir own, ehey were Co undercake che delivery of him.    They all anfwered
him wich agreat deal of zeal and affedion, that they were ready to expofe their lives for the
Prince their Mafter; but that they did not think they could coramodioufly do it for him.
Whereupon this wife Governor told them, how hc knew certainly that thofe which guar dtd
him, relying on his blindnefs, were not very exad in keeping hira; that it being fo, the mattet
would not be very difficult, becaufe the Prince lay in a low chamber, that jetted upon tbe Pa¬
lace garden, whereofthe walls were not very high; thac che only difficulty was to advertife
him not to make any noife,at fuch time as he fliould hear his chamber window opened; which
indeed would not bc very eafie to do,by reafon the Prince could neither read that which flhould
be written to him, nor fee the figns thac mighc be made him, fo chac hc concluded fomething
was to be lefc eo chance; chat for fo much as concerned cheir geccing ouc of the City, the
Governor thereof was refolved to follow the fortune of ^Ar/&lt;iw;r&lt;a, and to abandon a Go-
vernmcnr, which he knew well would be taken frora hira in a fliorc cime, by reafon of che
qreat affedion he had teftified to this Princefs, and chac fo ie would be eafie for chem co efcape.
This Propoficion being approved of by all, chey thought of noching elfe but of executing ir.
And whereas the nights were very dark, in regard the Moon did not fliine, chey deferred it
no further.
</p>
<p>The Governor of Sultania, whom Mahahted had formerly gained, chofe amongft his Sol¬
diers thofe whom he believed were moft faithful to hira, and without any notice taken of ic,
he placed them at one of the gates of the City, through which he meant to pafs. Nighc being
CQxneAMahamedt delivcrets mec cogecher ac a Randezvouz appoinced by chem;chey brought
ladders eo encer into ehe garden, whereof ehe walls were bue low, as I have already obferved.
For whereas Suhania wa^noc che refidence of ehe Sophi, they had noc fince the lofs of Tauris,
as yet ereded any magnificent buildings there. This generous Troop,pafling between two Sen-
nnels.got into the garden without any obftacle, went diredly to Mahamed'sXodg^ng, opened
oneot the windows ofit, without awakening him, or any of hisguard who lay inhis anti-
chamber; and then he whofe voyce they chought he beft knew, entered into his chamber
with his drawn Scymitar in his hand, approached to his bed after he had fought for it a while,
and though he wakened him very foftly, yet could he not fo fpeak to hira, but thae he gave a
a great skreek and dcraanded with raucltrefolution, whether Z)f/i&gt;»f«f had fent to kill hira.
Mahamed [p^Vefo loud, that fome of his guard awaked, and made a noife amongft them-

<p>In the mean time Mahamtdh^sin^ underftood in few words, in what manner they woi
deliver him, fuffered himfelfto be conduded by him that fpake to him.   All thisTroZ
ceived him with exceeding joy; bur fearing left theyftiouldbe troubled with fome crofsen"
counter, as foon as they had put clothes upon him, which they had brought purpofdy abp

dred paces from che gace they found horfes, which che Governor of Sultania had caufed tobe
there ready provided, and getting upon chem, they rode away with all che fpeed that polfibly
they could make.   But whereas che Prince could noc guide his horfe, but was conftrained to
let him be lead by anocher, chey could noC go fo faft, buc chac the fecond day ot their joutney
they efpyed a Troop of Horfe pofting after them, which, being far raore in number then they
made chem beleeve, not only thac chey were pnrfued,buc chac they were all loft; neverthelefs

intention not co fuffer himfelf Co be taken alive.   Buc whaefoever he could do, his people
placed hira in che midft of chem, much againft his will, being refolved Co dye or epfave him.
In che mean time che Troop, which chey beleeved Co be cheir eneraies, came ftill oti, and evay

buc when he called chem, had waiced cill noon without going in; chac ehe macter being dif¬
covered, Tachmas ac che firft fhewed a greaC deal of fury; chac Perca had done nothing but

much as ifhe had been her broeher, durft noc teftifie fo much unto him; but Vlama, being as
dextroufly to difcover her thoughes,as he had been in difcerning thofe ofthe Prince, approach¬
ed to her, and told her laughing, that he had made certain conditions with Mahamed, which
he conjured her flie fliould obferve. Two fuch fage perfons, anfwered flie, could not refolve
on any thing which is noC juft, wherefore I think that I fhall not engage ray felt inconfiderace¬

had paft beeween the Prince and him, K\dFeUxanapxoxn\fed Co do thac he defired; where¬
upon he lefc her co go and give order for che commodious lodging of all chis Troop. The
Princefs would needs fee all them that came along with the Prince; and with her fweet car¬
riage and addrefs fo abfolutely gained them, as they would have enterprized any ching for her
fervice. Whil'ft flie was coraplementing, and Vlama giving diredion in the Town, Felixa-
na carae to Mahamed, and fuch was their confervation Cogecher, as ic knic their friendfliip faft

and would forget the misfortunes which his love had been the caufe of to her; hc thanked her
for the fervices ftie had rendered ioihe^tincefs Axiamira; promifed always to honor her
more then any perfon in che world; and without fpeaking to her of love, he gave her to nn-
derfland,that if reafon had not prevailed over his inclination, he had ftill been V lama's Rival;
but ic was of chat power in his Soul, as he never fpake a word to Felixana, contrary to the
proraife he had raade her, Do love her no otherwife then as his fifter.

<p>Axiamira; undertaking to bring him his head, if this Prince, or any of them that folio j^

the aff^iirs of his Empire; and the Grand Vifiers melancholy was the onely thirg that took m
his minde. The Perfian Embaffador was come Co ConflantinapU, and had ot'entimes d
manded audience, buc could noc obcain ie, Ihe Sultan fpene the moftot bis tmeiilbu
Ws Palace; and though this illuftrious i?4j5Qi was extreara weak, yet walked he fometimes
with theGrand Sigmor in his garden. It happened then thac one raorning Solman came to
vifit him earlier chen he had ufed to do, and having raade him pafs infenfibly into his ereat
chamber, leaning on a Cane garniflied with gold, which he raoft commonly went with when
he was in health, he would needs have him walk down, to the end, faid be unto him he
might fortifie himfelf the becter by caking ehe ayr. /^r^if'/w, who fought not the prefervati¬
on of his health, did noc obey che J«/f«««, for che reafon alledged by him, to perfwade him
Co walk down; but contrarily he did it, out of the belief he was in, that his weaknefs being
exceeding great, the more he fhould put himfelf into agitation, the more would his forces
diminifli, and the neerer he fliould be to his grave. With fuch different defigns did the Sul¬
tan and the .ff&lt;»/&lt;« defcend into the Court; and theGrand Signior, feeming as though he
would not have the Baffa make Coo long a walk ac a eirae, caufed him to lean on the ba¬
luftrade, that divided the Court-yard of his Palace, chere co reft hirafelf with hira. Scarcely
had ehey been there a quarter of an hour, when as ehey faw an hundred Janizaries enter, at-
ciredall in cloth of gold, who ranked chemfelves in order on boch fides. TheGrand lifter
furprized with chis porap, demanded of Soliman whac ie mighe be ? buc he told him fmiling,
thac he muft behold che end of this ceremony, before he could be cleared therein. The B«j[i
then faw the Aga of the Janizaries enter, who raarchcd alone gorgeoufly apparel¬
ed; He was followed by the high Treafurer, whora the T^r/^/call Teftardtir,KCo{i]^mi

ornaments that the women of the Levant do ufe. In fome of them were little bats, fet all
over wich precious ftonef; chopines garniflied with Turkeyfes and Rubies; fmoeks embroi¬
dered with gold and pearl; moft furaptuous gowns, which being layd confufedly together,
made a pleafing mixture, of curled cloth of gold, of cloth of filver, and of velvet, whole
ground was gold. The laft maund was not open on the fides hkethe reft, and appeared tobe
full of all forts of jewels, of fo exceffive a value, as ehere were three or four hundred thou¬
fand crowns worth of pearls amongft them.They which carried thefe precious prefents ranked
themfelves all along the baluftrade, where the SuUan and Ibrahim were leaning. After this
tntnd rwtlvecharetsfullof young virgin Slaves, richly clothed, eachof thera drawn by fix
white horfiS, and driven by two Eunuches. Then followed thirty ocher virgins, apparelled
in doch of gold, accompanyed with fo many black Slaves, having all of them chains and col-
lars of maffive gold : Thefe Slaves being placed on their knees where the Aga of the fm-
^:«r;Vx appointed them, chere entred next cwo hundred Mules laden with hangings of cloth
ot gold, of fattin, ot velvet, ehe ground filver; wich cufliions embroidered all over, which
are the feats of thac Country; and with a great deal of other moft fumptuous furniture lot
a hou%. All this being fet in a moft marvelous order, four and twenty raen advanced, beat¬
ing two and two twelve coffers of China, garniflied with gold and precious ftones, wjoot-
ing placed as the reft, made way for twelve Slaves to be feen carrying Torches in their hands,
which were covered half way with places of gold, and fliined more with the precious Itoncs

<p>that were on them, chen with the flame which confumed them.  Until then the Gr&lt;iM f

oflove, and outof a fenfe of Religion, before he would confent unto it.   But he was
ftrangely forprized, when as the Grand Signior had raade a fign to tbe Aga of the fant^a-

his incomparable//*j^&lt;?//a   Ah ray Lord 1 cryed he out in Italian, Isnot this an illufion ?

the Princefs off from her horfe, andto clear hirafelf througlily ot the doubt whereinto this
furprize had put him; but hecould not execute his defign, for the Aga oi the famzaries
bad rendered him that fervice already, and had conduded her to tbe half pace of the ba¬
luftrade, where the Bajfa received her.   This Princefs had not feen hira yet, becaufe at fuch
ume as the curtains, which concealed her, were drawn, the fight of fo greac an afferably had
not perraitted her to mark hira, though fhe had carefully fought about with her eyes to finde
him our.  But when as Ibrahim advancing towards her, did by the found of his voyce force
her to look that way, flie had no lefs joy then he, though not fo rauch araszeraent; for fhe
knew well enough thac he was at Conftantinople, and flie beleeved too that fhe had be n for¬
cibly brought away by his order, for Ruflan would never tell her any thing.   And though
this violent defign was not pleafing to her, yet felc ftie nothing but joy for al! chac ac chis firft

any whit afHid her; being very glad to fee the marks of his love, in thole of his grief.   Is

again unto Ibrahim, who told the Princefs that fhe faw the greateft Monarch of the woild,
for fear flie fliiould not render unto Soliman the honor chat was due to hira.   Ifabella would
inftantly have caft her felf at his feet, when as chis Prince raifing her up, againft tbe cuftom of
the Grand Signiors, and beholding her with a great deal of adrairation, I do noc marvel, faid
hc unco/^rrf^/iw, that love hath been ftronger in thee then friendfhip; andthat the fight of

many perfons ftiould be fpedaeors of ehy felicicy; and it will be enough, if thou fuffer me
to be partaker of it with thee. Saying fo, he commanded the Aga of the Janizaries to caufe

away but onely thofe which were to ferve the Princefs.

<p>Hitherco che Princefs had not anfwered to Soliman's difcourfes, fave with obeyfancesand

fome other way, then by thac of her beaucy.  She cold hira, chac ifhe had not ftronger chains
then thac, he would be blame-worthy for preferring her before his Highnefs; but without
confidering, either her merit, or her beauty, he was co chink, that the affedion which he car¬
ryed to her, was one of the inevicable effeds of fympaehy or face. Thae ftie requefted hira
to bcleeve, hovJ Ibrahim had done nothing, buc whac he could noc chufe buc do j thathe
knew withouc doubc as well as flie, chac che glory to ferve fo greac a Prince, was co' be pre¬

of this Princefs, defired her to pardon him for her forcible bringing away, and to remember
that he had not undertaken ic, buc Co fave Ibrahim's life. So fair a caufe, anfwered the Ptin-
cefs, could noc produce a bad effed, and whaefoever can five Ibrahim, can never wrong
Ifabella.  With fuch like difcourfes, the Sultan and thefe two illuftrious Lovers entertained
themfelves very pleafingly; but dinner time approaching, theGrand Signior to\d tk Buln,

<p>In the mean time they who faw Ibrahim,conld not doubc buc that Soliman had found out
the right remedy, which could throughly chafe away his melancholy. Hiseye was quicker,
his countenance raore lively, his fpeech ftronger, his gate morcfteddy, and this change was
fo great and fudden, that every one fpake of it as of a prodigy. In fine, ehe prefence of Ifa¬
beUa did thae in a few days, which ehe arc of che Phyficians could noc do in a very long cime;
and the Grand Vifier found hirafelf in fo perfed an health,as he bad never been in a be:ctT. Buc
whil'ft be was happy, Soliman did noc enjoy fo greac a eranquillicy : The fighc of Ifabella
through an inevicable fate had cxciced Crouble in his foul. For whereas he had erainently mee
in che perfon of chis Princefs with all chebeaueies of Roxelana md Axiamira, and agrear
deal of refemblance of both of them, efpecially of thelaft, hecould not chufe bue be in all
ehe paflion for her alone, which he had been in for ehe other two. This greac Prince render¬
ed noc himfelf for all chac withouc fighcing; and it raay be he had noc been vanquilhed, if at
the beginning hehad known che forces of his Enemy. Buc whac Crouble foever the fitft
f\^toi Ifabella broughc Co his heart, he choughc nocwichftanding thae Reafon, and his
friendfliip Co Ibrahim, would be ftronger then his inclination. It was not becaufe he had noC
tryed the weaknefs of the forraer; buc for che fecond, he beleeved chat noching could over¬
come ic. In chis confidence, che firft days of Ifabella's beingit Conltaminople, and chat
Ibrahim was noe as yec in an eftace Co go Co che Serraglio, he concinued vificing him as he
was wone co do: Buc Che more he faw Ifabella, the more charming he found her; he always
obferved fome new grace in her; and her wic raaking her ftill Co be more known, his paffion
ftill augmented the more: Howbeit he perceived noc the violence and power of it, till fu'ch
time as civility would no longer permic hira co fee her. For che Grand Vifier having reco¬
vered ftrength enough eo go co che Serraglio, Soliman having no more precexc Co vific
him, faw himfelt deprived of che fighc of Ifabella, and by this privation he felt in his heare
rhat this perfon alone could raake up all his felicity, or all his raifery. This Prince no fooner
knew the forceof this Enemy, by which he had foffered his foul to be forprized but
he would have oppofed ic. Whacl faid he Co himfelf, unjuft and cruel chat I am

<p>fo great unto him, but that he hoped to overcome it, if he could abfent the GranciViL
as the affairs of Perfia feemed co require. Whereupon he fraraed ehe defign of it, after he

Sophi had fenc to demand Axiamira and Felixana of him; feeming to have no other thoueht
then that of the affairs of Perfia, nor other ob/ed, but the good of his Empire. He alfo let
VlamaVnovi, that what he had demanded fox Mahamed \NiS granted him; and the care
of his State feemed to cake him up in fuch fort, as albeit he became very raelancholique, and
that his countenance was alcered, Ibrahim fufpeded no ocher thing, but that the incer¬
tainty wherein he was, whether he fliould make ufe of the perfons of Axiamira, Muhmd,
and Felixana, whom he had in his hands, for the making of fome propofitions of peace,
becaufe he was preffed by the affairs of Hmgary, or that he fliould continue the War of

So as not knowing what to do, or what to refolve on, theGrand ny?fr propounded unto
her, confidering the eftate wherein things were, that flie would permit him toraikeone
warlike voyage more againft che Perfians; to the end,that having repaired ehe difordetj which
his abfence had caufed in chac Kingdom, he mighc ac his recurn come and caft himfelf at the

his Country; wich the refolucion, that if he did not granC chac which he defired of him, not
to be more generous chen he, and Co obcain that by flighe which he had refufed him, fince,as
it feemed to hira, he mighc do it wichouc injuftice. Ae firft chis propoficion furprized IftM-

<p>I know well enough, anfwered the Princefs, that I ara of a fex which ought not to fee war
fsve in pidure; but what will you have me do ? I fee too well, continued flie, that we are
in a deplorable eftate, andthat we cannoc feek for a reraedy, whereof che evenc is not very
doubtful. After the obligations wherein you ftand engaged to Soliman, there is no talk of
flight; yea and I feel in ray heare fomeehing that refifts it. On the other fide, I know full
well that in the eftate wherein the affairs of his Empire now ftand, and his frit ndfliip to you

that nothing but generofity alone can conftrain hira not to refufe us. Upon the vidory over
the Terfiansowx freedom depends, if it befo that we may ever obtran it; bud fear too,
that this remedy is not very well affured. For if you prove not fortunate in this war, how
dare you demand your liberty? and if you be vidorious, it is to be feared rhat in fighting

<p>Ibrahim faw chac all che Princeffes Objedions were fo powerful, as hecould chink of no¬
thing able Co deftroy chem. Buc ae lengch, afcer well examining the macter, chey found how
it was true, that it mighc happen the voyage of f^r/j* would ferve them to no purpofe; but
they found withall, that it was Che onely ching chac could be beneficial to them; knowing
well enough, thac if Soliman covAd be vanquiflied, ic would be onely by generofity. Ibra¬
him affured the Princefs as much as poffibly he could, thac no misfortune ftiould arrive to het
in his abfencc, relying in fuch fort on Soliman's friendftiip Co him, as he could not doubc but
thac he would be very careful in proceding her. And chough he knew thac ehe Saltan was
very fufcepcible of love, and chac he had feared before ac Monaco, left he would have been
eoo fenfibly couched with//.i^//«i's beauty, if flie obftinacely perfifted in her decermination
to follow him to Confiantinople, yet had he no fear of it in this encounter. Thae which
gave him chis eranquillicy of fpirie, was becaufe he knew, thac chis Prince had never been ta¬
ken, bue with the firft fighc of the perfons whom he had loved; that love never entred into
his heart but by furprizing him; and thac whomfoever he had once feen wichout paffion, was
not able afterwards to touch him with any. And whereas Soliman, contrary to his cuftom,
had taken greac care Co conceal his choughcs, hehad noc perceived hishstto Ifabella; but
contrarily, thinking that he had feen her without loving her, he beleeved chac hewasfafoon
that fide. In this Opinion he che more eafily refolved for che War of Perfia • and whereas
he knew chac affairs were prefling, and chat the Sopht's Embaffador having had' audience, tbe
Z),t;^«. would be held the nexe day, wherein peace or war for the incereft of che Empite
would be concluded, he conjured che Princefs to take her laft refolucion. Emilia, who was

as ic IS very difficulc to re jed thac which raay facisfie us, it was Impoffible for the Sidtan to

after he had an hundred times changed his opinion, to refolve noc Co propound this voyage

out communicating unto them the mattet he had in hand; to the end that havitig acquainted
them with the importance of it, they taight give him faithfol and dif fntfcreffed coUnfel.
Afc r that, he reprefented unto them iM vidories which he had obtained over the Perfians
through the valor of Ibrahim; and theo, the mifadventures. Which his abfence ind Vlama's
hurt had caufed in that Country. He told them that nothing refted of all bis conquefts, but
the remembrance that they hid been made: and whereas he had an ititention to carry them
to a war, he aggravated with a gfcae deal of vchemertCy, howfliameful it would be tothe
Empire to make peace after they had been laft beaten. He told them withall notwithftand¬
ing, that having the Princefs Axiamira the daughter of the Sdphii and Prince Mahamed
his fon, in bis hands, he was in an eftate, if they thought fir, to tender propofitions of peace
mtoTachmof; butthat they fhould well eximine before-hand, whether that would not be
difhonorable; and that they fbould remember, how in publique interefts particular interefts
were noe always to be confidered, andthat the glory of the Erapire was tobe preferred a-
bove all things.
</p>
<p>After he had fpoken thus unto them, he commanded chem to delivrr t^eir Opinion?, which
proved not to be alike, for they were all carryed by different thoughts. Some, won by/f^jff-
lana tnd Ruftan, oppofed the Voyage of Perfia; others, for the fole inr^reft of cie people,
were of the fame o|5ifiion • fome again, to pleafe the J'«//4»,counfelled fhe war; and others,
for their particular intefeft likewife, oppofed peace. Yet did they not for all chat deliver theit
Opinions tumultuoufly, not withouc giving reafons for them; but contrarily keeping a mar¬
velous decorum In this Cotincel, they fpake all feverally, and without precipitation.   Buc

faid he unto him, I ara affured if the noble Ibrahim propounds his Opinion firft, that it will
be impoflible for me CO deliver mine, if ie happen co be contrary co his; noc becaufe I can¬
noc take che libercy to contradid him if I could, for I know his generofity too well for that •
but becaufe his Reafon renders it felf fo abfolute a Miftrefs of anothers, asit is not poffible

were poffible Co make ufe of the perfons of Vxxnce Mahamed^ndtheVxintefs Aximirnh
the obtain-ng thereof, ic was Co be done: and fo much che rather, becaufe in continuing this
war, che crcafures of che State would be unproficably exhaufted ; the power of rhe Sultm
would be impaired by the lofs of the Janizaries yN\f\ch^No\x\d perifli in it; yea and the ho¬
nor of che Arms of the Empire would be once again hazarded: and all this without attend¬
ing any recompence from ir, ic being abfolutely impoffible to maintain tbe conquefts that
were made in Perfia, whereof Hiftory gave fufficient proof; and therefore if war were to
be made, thac ic was beceer eo fall upon ehe Chriftians wieh an Army of five hundred thon¬
fand men, which would ftrike fear into all Europe, amplifie the limits of the Empire, and
eternize the narae of Soliman, rather then to lofe thera to no purpofe: How it vfould bea
fharae to fee one day in Hiftory, chac Soliman had warred a long cirae againft tbe Sophi; that
at feveral times he had led raillions of men into Terfia, and afcer all, chac there ftiould not be
remaining under the dominion of his fucceffors, fomuch as one fooc of ground of thecon-
quefts he had made there. Finally he concluded, that not chis war, but the other, was to be
thoughc on.
</p>
<p>Ifuf, Cadilefcher of Greece, maintained this Opinion, though out of a different meaning;
fortheformer was carryed by the perfwafions of i2oA:f/«e»&lt;j, and he by the fole confideration
of che publique good. Bue he added Co che others Reafons, chac if che war of Perfta conti.
nued longer, whole Provinces mighe revolt, by reafon of the povercy whereuneo the intei-
ruption of comraerce would reduce thera; in fo much chac chis forraign war might aufe a civil,
more dangerous and more deadly then the other; chat if chis mifchief ftiould arrive, as the
murmuring of che people feemed co chreacen, chey ftiould then be conftrained to propound J
fliameful peace Co Tachmas, who ic may be, Co raake ufe of chis advantage, would not ac¬
cept of it; chat fo they fliould have Enemies both without and within, whil'ft the Chrifti¬
ans, which were buc Tribuearies of che Empire, mighc poffibly undercake co fluke off the

faid a fecond time to maintain his firft opinion, that it would bc a ftiamc Co be expofed to che
lofs of che advantage which they had over ehe Chriftians. Achmat anfwered, ehae ie would
beagreacer to demand peace after ehey were bcacen. The Bafa Tiali added, chac extream
refolutions were diogerous Co Monarchies; and chac in ehe end Pdnces, which loved chcir
Subjeds, and whofe Empire was greac enough, oughc noe Co raake War, buc for the procuring
of peace. IJuf, to fortifie this opinion, faid further, chac che people were noc eo befo lietle
confiderable with the Emperor, fince from thera came his riches, his force, his power, and his
greatnefs; that the people had in forae parts of the wodd been happy without Kings, but no
Kings could be fo without Subjeds: Hefaid likewife, that prudence neve'r did anything
precipitoufly, and ftill would have the Prince fpare the blood of his people. But the Baffa
of the Sea replyed, that it was ofcentimes juft and neceffary co lofe one pare of his Subjeds tor

whereof all things might be done, withouc confidering particular incerefts. Scander added,
thac a greac Prince was never Co make peace bue wich ehe fword in his hand, and ehae che way

<p>This Baff^a having given over fpeaking, Ibrahim repeaced in order all che opinions chat

your affedion: And fince in preferving mine own life, I ftiall preferve yours, there is no Ene
my which can be redoubted of me, and which I ftiall not eafily formount.   Remember vet
Madara, that on Vidory our happinefs depends; that to obtain it I muft expofe my felftd
peril; that in all other things Fortune gives the good that flie docs, but in War Crowns muft
be violently pluck'd out of the hands of Vidory, ifone may be perraitted to fpeak fo. One
muft fight to remain Mafter ofthe field; one muft give an example for the Soldiers to follow
and put ones felf in jeopardy of being vanquiflied for to be vidorious.   I tell you all thefe
things. Madam, to the end you raay noc take ic ill, if I dare affure you, ehae I will not re¬
member you, buc co fighc with the raore courage. You are a captive for tbe loveof me, itis
for me then to deliver you, and therefore do not enjoyn rae co raanage my life with fo mach

thofe, which we feel through the apprchenfion ofthofe which peradventure will never arrive
unto us, tell rae, I befeech you, whecher you can forgive rae all the evils which 1 hive been

all your cruelleft adverfaries, purpofing eo hurt you, could have done.   Do not charge your felf

ftinguifli the guilty from che innocent, and never to reraeraber the evilswhich I have fuW,
without remerabring thofe withall, which you have endured for rae.   I am as faulty towariis
Juftiniano, as Jufliniano is towards Ifabella ; or to fay better, we are equally innocent; and
our innoccncy it maybe caufes our perfecution, fince it is ordinary with Fortune tofallfoiil
upon none but vertuous perfons.   I hope neverthelefs, added fhe, that Heaven will ere long
give an end to our ciptivity, or to our lives. If we were, concinued Ifabella, in ehe hands of

for in murmuring againft the Tyrant thac perfecuees us ehere is forae eo be found: But this
Prince, who keeps us capcives, does ic not bue becaufe he loves you; and ehe rigor of my d^
ftiny is fo greac, as I muft commend ehae in hira, which is the caufe of all my mifery.

And after a converfation as fad, as their Souls were afflided, flie readied him her hand, which

Go and break our chains, carry a ftronger heart then I, and that you raay not augraent ray

Charec was no fooner entred, but he mounted on horfeback, and without fpeaking a word
more to any body, he went out of Confiantineple with his Train, to overtake the Troops,
which were inarching towards T"***/^, carrying in his heart the moft fenfible afflidion, thac
ever he had tryed. He had this advantage neverthelefs over the Princefs, that he could enter¬

been conduded ro a ftately lodging, which was prepared for her, che grand Signiors Mother,
although flie hated Ibrahim, came to vifit her followed by all the Sultanaes, thereby to pleafe
Solman, who had increaeed her unto it. The Sultana Afteria, as the favorite of the Empe¬
ror her father, had been permitted to learn the Italian Tongue, after the goodwill fbe had
born to Ibrahim had made her to defire ir; fo as it was flie that held up the converfacion in
this vifit, and that expreffed the compliraents ofthe othex Sultanaes to Ijabella, who re¬
ceived them with a great deal of civility, although the excreara grief flie was in raight have
difpenced her from le. Buc whereas Afieria had addrefs and wic, and knew that Ifabella

they were all gone buc this laft, yec was noc Ifabella ac libercy Co think of her'misfortunes;

<p>This converfation, having lafted an indifferent longtime, combined the Sultana Afteria
and tbe Princes info ftrait a league of friendfoip, as they were almoft infeparable, to long as
Jfabella continued in the old Serraglio. The day after flie was come thither, ScLman vilir-
ed ber, and by this laft fight made the chains which captived him ftronger then before. The
incertainty he was'in, wholly ceafed; and the corabat which be had in his heart, between his
friendftiip to the grand Vifier, and the paffion he was in fox Ijabella, was at an end; and
love remaining ablolutely vidorious, fJs mind bad fome more peaceable raoments, fo that he
had no other thought, then ofthe Conqueft of//»&lt;^&lt;?//^. But whereas he knew, that to make
himfelf be beloved, he muft firft pleafe, he complyed fo far with her, as not Co fpeak of any
thing bcjt Ibrahim in this firft vifit. He craved pardon of the Princefs for being the caufe ot
hjs aWence from her; he defired her not to reraeraber it was he that caufed her to be brought
away by force; and to think that flie was in a place, where flie might abfolutely command 3
where flie fliould fee no body but thac would obey arid ferve her with joy. Ifabella anfwer¬
ed to fo obliging a difcourfe with all the civility and acknowledgment flie was capable of:
but whereas flie was fad, though fhe conftrained her felf co feem otherwiie, he Intreated her
to be as merry as fhf. could, for tear left melancholy dirainifhing her beauty, jt might be layd
to his charge, ehae he had buc ill preferved fo rare a ching.
</p>
<p>The Princefs having proraifed him all chac he defired, he wene away very rauch facisfied,
and very araorous, and lefc her wich as great an eftecra of hira, as Ibrahim could not have
more. And whf.reas Afieria feldom abandoned her, fhe talked to her the reft of the day of
nothing but of t'iie admiration fhe v}2.s in of Soliman, ofthe vertues ot this Prince, ofthe
greatnefs of his Tpirit, of that exceeding and generous friendfliip, which he teftified to our illu¬
ftrious Bafa.
</p>
<p>After chis firft vifit there were nothing but raagnificences in the old Serraglio. Soliman
fenc every day new prefencs Co IfabeUa; and in confideracion ofher Co the SuUanaes, which
lived in the fame place, for fear left envying her they ftiould corae to hate her, and fo lofe the
care of pleafing her. And whereas there paffed not a day, wherein this Prince did not vific
Ifabella, Roxelana, who knew him to the very bottom of his heart, quickly perceived the
true realon that caufed thefe yifus. Yet did not jealoufie feize upon her Soul for all that; and
the only defign ofraaking ufe of this occafion to de^xoy Ibrahim, and to labor the re-efta-
bliflimept of Ruftan, was that which raade her work in the raanner, as fliall be feen in the fe¬
quel ofthis difcourfe. But for as much as the grand Signiors Mother hated Ibrahim, becaufe
foe loved Roxelana, fhe communicated her fulpicions unto her, and they both concluded, that
in all likelyhood Soliman's afliduity was an effed oflove; and that it it were fo, it would be
almoft an infallible mean to deftroy tbe grand Vifter, who it was faid was defperately in love
with this perfon. For coming to know this paflion, he would queftionlefs do things, which
would make him bc banifhed, if he did not voluntarily banifli hirafelf.
</p>
<p>Having held this fecrec counfel, Roxelana, far frora txoubling Soliman's defigns, thought
of nothing elfe but raaking hira raore in love with the Princefs; being not jealous but of her
authority, and fearing Ibrahim's power, rauch raore then Ijabella's beauty. And for this
tff^, whereas there is fcarce any faith in Turkey of proof againft prefents, flie fuborned one
ot the Slaves, who went dayly to offer her forae new liberality from the Sultan,to the end that
according to the occafions flie raight invent forae obliging compliraent to him frora 7^^^^//^
who Ignorant of a I thefe things, lived with as much content and reft, as the abfencc of the
grand VtfHrwoxxldpexmxt her. ^/.m hadfo great a care of her, and ^.//«...« rendred her
to many devoirs, as foe had foarcely any leafore to think of her misfortunes. In tbe mean
time the Sultan was not a littk perplexed, out of the fear he was in to difcover his love to the
Princefs; for albeit he knew foe efteemed him, yet he beleeved that it was as much forthe
affedion which he cemed to bear Co the Baf,, as for his own merit. So that not darL as
yet to decUre himfelf openly, he contented hirafelf with praifing her beauty, her wit and all
he excellent qualities which were in her, in talking to her of Ibrlhim; an7 his narae' whih
hadbeenfo confiderable with him, was employed againft him that owed it.   Forfooft^a.

<p>he commanded Ifabella, hc would exagerate how happy Ibrahim was tobe beloved off
marvelous a perfon; what judgment fbrahim had ftiewed in the choyce he had made ot htr'
and out ofa malicious galhntry he told her many times, chac Ibrahim was to blame tor aban'
domng her at .'Monaco, to come and keep his word with him; chac ie was a great fault in hini
to go to the Perfian War, and not to dye with grief, rather then to quit her; thai for him if
he had been in his place, he would never have done fo, chinking ic a great deal fweeter to d'ye
then to be abfent trom her.   So arcificial a difcourfe, was noC for all chac interpreted by lU
bella as Soliman defired, and without feeking for any hidden fenfe in it, flie beleeved thatit
was a pure tffed ofthe Sultan's corapliance, who thinking to pleafe her, would talk to her of
Ibrahim in any manner whatfoever.   In this ignorance,flie always anfwered him very civilly
and with a great deal of refped; fo chac ineerpreeing in chis fore all that .yc//OT4» faid unto
htrr, flie put him into an extream pain.   For withouc celling her precifely, that he was in be
with herbeauty, he would fain have had her perceive it; being fo afraid eo offend her, that
this fear peradventure raight have wrought chac in him,which Reafon could not do, had it not
been tor the meffages,wh(ch the Slave whom Roxelana had fuborned, at feveral times brought
him.                                                                                                                            ,

<p>But whil'ft IfabeUa talked of Soliman's generofity, all the SuUanaes had no other difcoutfe
bnc ofthe love which he bore her. Afteria, perceiving it as well as the reft, and knowing to
what violences this paflion carried the Grand Signior, was much afflided at it, for IfahtlUi
intereft, whom flie exceedingly loved. This raelancholy was quickly raarked by the Princefs,
and whereas her cares and her mcrie had given her an high place in her affedion, flie one day
conjured her eo acquainc her with ehe caule of ic. Afteria judging wieh reafon, that if Ihc
fliould tell her the truth, it would very rauch grieve her, excufed her felf from it atfirft as well
as fhe could; but coming Co confider, that it raight be che ignorance wherein Ifal&gt;elU\mi,
mighe fureher augment her unhappinefs, flie refolved to confide in her, and to impart unto her
the fufpicions (he had. Thac which made Afteria be intereffed fo ftrongly for all that con¬
cerned Ibrahim, as to forget che SuUan's incerefts, was becaufe flie had underftood how
mighcily he had protedcd Muftapha and Gianger her brothers, whom foe had infinitely
loved; and how he had always oppofed the y/idencts of Roxelana, to whom foe bore a fe¬
crec hatred, whofe chieffoundation was in ber proper vertue. Afliria, following her refo¬
lution, after flie had prepared 7/«^f//-«'s raind by a long difcourfe, to make good ufe of the
adv'ce fhe was goingto give her, and after//&lt;i^(//&lt;« bad on her fide promifed her all manner
offtdelity, told her, that knowing ihe Sultan her father, as flie did, foe feared left het
beauty had poff.ft him with more love for her, then he had friendftiip for/^r&lt;jWw; and
that at lift his reafon would be found weaker then his paffion: Thac ftie defired to difcovet
her fufpicions unto her, Co ehe end fhe mighc through her prudence examine the matter, k"
being altogether ignorant of it, fhe might increafe the CJrand JtgwiVs unjuft defigns by

<p>At firft this difcourfe furprized her, flie changed colour ever and anon, and out otthe

any reafonable caufe for this fidion. The Sultanaes ingenuity notwithftanding deftroyed tM

<p>howbeit Emilia confirraed her in the opinion, that Soliman's refpeds to her proceeded only
fromfriendfo'p, in raaking her confider, thac Afttna's conjedurc was queftionlefs grounded
on the belief of allthe othex Stiltanais, who fuppofed thac the Grand Siguior could not
have any affedion for a woman, but ftraight it muft be love; and who out of jealoufie for
the prefents that he fent her, and the civihties that he ufed to her, had imagined it could not be
otherwife. This reafoning carrying fome likelyhood with it, comforted the Princefs a little,
and after ftie bad run over in her memory all that Soliman had faid, foe found, being willing
to deceive her felf, that all his difcourfes and all his adions, might be interpreted to his ad¬

they thought of nothing but of augmenting Solimans love to ifabella, by the obliging raef-
fages, which that fuborned Slave delivered to bira dayly.   It was at the farae tirae, when as
chere were three raarvelous beautiful Slaves prefented to the SuUan, who without being ever
a whit touched with their charras, had refufed thera, if he had not by chance dcraanded of
thera whence they were; but having underftood that they wereof/r&lt;«/^, he retained them
with a purpofe Co beftow ehera on//rf^f//^, feeking afcer noching wich raore care, rhen to
pleafe her.   Hc went then to vifit her, after he had commanded that thofe three .Slaves Ihould
be carryed inco the old Serraglio: And whereas Afteria's difcourfe to her had rendred her
more melancholique then foe ufed to be, he marvelled at it, and by his much preffing her to
let him know the caufe thereof, he raade the Princefs apprehend, thac the SuUands fufpici¬
ons were juftly grounded; yet deftroyed foe her felf, this her own opinion; and having an¬
fwered the GrW Signior, that her raelancholy was derived frora the remerabrance of her
paft misfortunes, rjther then ftora any other reafon, he defired her to forget thera, and noc
to render her felf unhappy with things, which would never arrive to her again. He told her
afterwards,that to corafort and delight her,he had chofen her out three Slaves, which it raay be
would not be difagrceable unto her; and would underftand her orders betcer then the others
which had been given her, becaufe they were of her own Country. IfabelU anfwered there¬

<p>The Grand Signior, defiring to oblige the Princefs in all things, went away for to leave h' r
at liberty to entertain her dear friends, and to take order for the delivery of thofe Slaves
whom fhe had recommended unto hira. When he was gone, embraces and civilities beein
afrefh between IfabeUa and thefe three fair maids: EmiUa likewife teftificd the fatisfaftion.
which fhe had to fee them; but in the midft of their firft apprehenfions ot joy, the rtmera-
brance of thc^ir pleafures paft,raade thera focd tears of forrow. They demanded ot oneano-
ther, by what adventure they were raet together in the fame place; and being fcarce able to
beleeve what they faw was true, their amazement redoubbd every moment. The defire of
demanding one thing was loft by tbe curiofity of knowing another, and going both at cnce
CO ask the Princefs queftions, and to anfwer thofe which fhe asked of them, neither of them
anfwered precifely to each other. Howbeit the Princefs underftood that thofe Friends, which
were Slaves, as well as Dorta, were Horatio, the French Marquis, and Alphonfo. She de¬
fired to hear fome news of the Count of Lavagna, and of Leonora his wife, but Sophronii
told her fighing, that fhe fliould know their adventures too (oon; and Hipolita added, thit
in a day wherein Fortune had done them fo great a grace, ic was not fit to remember fo many

as in her difcourfe fhe many tiraes naraed Ibrahim without chinking of ic, and fpake of him,
as ofa man, inconfideration of whom the i'«/?&lt;i» favored her, Jo/iAyoxw demanded of her,
who this Ibrahim was ? This queftion raade the Princefs blufli, but ac length foe informed
them that this Ibrahim W2iS Juftiniano; it feeraing unto her, that in the eltate wherein theit
fortune ftood, it was not requifite to make a fecret of his adventures to them. This novdty
t(\U3\hf fuxpxized Hipolita, Leonida, znd Sophronia; not being able to imagine, butthat
all which they were told was any other then a fidion: Their own experience forced thera
notwithftanding Co bdeeve, chat whic had been imparced to thera was true, there being no
more difficulty in giving credit to that which was arrived to thera, then to that which bid
happened to IfabeUa.

<p>IT was no fooner day, but Ifabella fent to defire permiffion of tbe Grand Signior, that fhe
raight go and vifit her dear friends, which he durft not deny, fo rauch was he afraid to
difpleafe her; He repented hira neverthelefs for having raadc////&gt;*/»&gt;&lt;«, Sophronia, ind Leo¬

flie had demanded, went to Ibrahim's Palace with as rauch raagnificence, as if foe had been

with exceeding fatisfadion, yet was it lefs for all that then Doria's, who having underftood

they could pay her for theliberty which foe had given thera. As for Sophronia, flie confented
not without regret to this fad and pitiful relation, well forefeeing that folaraentsble a dif¬
courfe would coft her raany a tear: howbeit foe defired at leaft, thac Doria raighc be he who
raight recount their misfortunes, it being irapoflible for her to do it. Doria, not ufing to re-

<p>Statue at Geneva.    They that intermeddle with the knowledg of things, and that iud^
of intentions by appearances and events, will not have the defigns of Andrea Dona toSeal-
waysfodif-incercflcd, as chey have appeared unto us; but««^«f, this is not a place, where
I am Co cell you whac the Count bekeved concerning him: As for me, that ever fpeaks fin-
cerely of things, I hold that his intentions were as fair as his enterpriz''.
</p>
<p>Bue CO come CO chac which I am co impart coyou, andtokeepyou from being too micli
furprtzcd by the Counts laft adion, I am to tell you, that although in appearance hewjsthe
fweeccft, checivilcft, ehe gallanteft, andofthefrecftandmoft peaceable difpofition that ever
had been feen, and that he gave himfelf coall the exercifesof a man of his quility, wherein
he had profited admirably, yet had he an iraperious fpirit, and was always poffeft with fome
great defign.   Ambition, and the defire of glory, were bis predominant paffions, and the on¬
ly things for which he did all others.His education did not contribute ought to thefe thou'^hts-
for whereas he remained yet young enough under the government of his Mather, who'was
the moft ambitious woman that ever was, fhe gave hira a part of her inclinations.   He had
had for his Governor one named Penfa, by Simbaldo his fathers appointment, whofe man¬
ners were wholly noble, and thac had inftruded him in all the faireft knowledges, which a
perfon of his condition raight have.   But chis raan being too moderate for the bringing up of
the Count according co his mochers defigns, fhe placed another abouc him, buc yet without
removing che former, to tbe end thac if ehe one taught him the Sciences, the other Ihould
teach him noc to make ufe of them, but to arrive at the height of foveraign greatnefs.  Thefe
two men being oppofite in all things, gave him alfo quice contrary counfels.   The firft made
him in ehe Roman Hiftory obferve the noble adions of chofe, who had expofed chemfdvei
for che fafeey of ehe Comraonwealeh; and che other raade him ofcencimcs read che Confpiracy
of Catiline, ehe lives of Tiberius ind Nero; Neverthelefs whereas the Counts indinationj
were coo vercuous to love crimes, he followed noC che advice of this fame; bue his Soul be¬
ing wichill coo ambicious co be confined wichin the diredions of Penfa, he took a third way,
and loved nothing fo much as the reading of the lives of Alexander and Cafar, efpecially ot
this laft; and he was wont co fay, chac chey which had called him Tyrant were to blame;
fince he can never be fo, chie afpires noc co che foveraign power, bue for ehe ufing of ic well;
and chey which found chemfelves capable of governing people, were refponable ro Heaven For
noc imploying a Talent, which mighc be advancagious eo all the world.
</p>
<p>Thefe difcourfes were not ac chac cime confidered buc by his Mocher, who cook incredible
delighc cherein: buc ac lengch, che Coune, being arrived ac fevenceen years of age, faw lio-
nora, che fxfket of Julio ind Horatio Cibo, in an affembly, vihexe Jannetin Doria, the Ne¬
phew and Favorice of tAndrea Doria, was prefenc as well as he.   You have without doubt
obferved, tha Leonora, chough gencle and civil, had for all ehae a raajeftick refervcdnefs,
which ftiewed in her behavior ehae foe had fomething ot greac in her Soul..  1 tell you this,
Madam, co lee you know wiehall, ehae ie was wieh ehis charra, racher rhen wieh her beauty,
thae ftie began to pleafe ehe Coune.   He regarded and obferved her wich care; and feeirg
noching in all her adions, thac was noe boch excream civil, and a little iraperious, he beganto
love her, and fo much the more ardently, becaufe he knew that this alliance vvould not be dn-
advantageous to him; if he fought after either nobility of race, or coraraodicy ot riches, lot
thac being born ofa firft wifo of her farhers, ftie was her only heir. Buc if Leonora was agre¬
able to the eyes of the Count, it raay be faid, thathefeemedcharmingtoX#«;»flr&lt;»'s: sj^J-
rily I muft acknowledg, that I never faw him fo araiable, as inthis afferably; and it i^
fpeak the truth, I do not beleeve rhat there can fcarce be found in one only perfon grf*^^^^
lity then he had.   And for agreeable chings, ic raay bc well affured, that never man was mo
proper CO make himfdf be beloved.   His beauty, his good afped, his converfation, hsj

may judg atccr this, whether Leonora, who had noc her heare engaged o^he J"^^

<p>Counts defigns: for, faid he unto hira raifing up bis voyce, it is fit for us to obferve rhis yourg
Lion. He is undertaking, and hardy, and if we fuffer hira to gather new forces, by allying
with the houfe of O'^o, and Z,fo»(7r&lt;»'s riches, he will be capable of encerprizing any ching.
^4»»*rj« barkened Co this difcourfe as one that was intereffed therein, and obeying Andre(i'&amp;
ordir, he obferved the Count and Leonora, and confirmed himfelt in the opinion he had had,
both by his own knowledg, and the talk of the Town. Being in no longer doubt then but
that the Count was in love with Leonora, he advertifed his Uncle ofit, who without further
delay coraraanded him to be tbe Counts Rival in this fuit. Ic would not be enough, faid he to
Jannetin, if we foould bat break off tbe Counts marriage; but we muft raake profit of his
daraage, and pluck the weapons out of his bands, to deftroy hira therewith when we are Ma¬
fters of thera. ^oxxmu&amp;mvcxy Leonora, foe is fair and araiable; but were fhe only noble
and rich, it would be enough to oblige you to marry her. Think of it then, Jannetin; you
are young as well as the Count, you have fpirit and courage, and though it may be you have
not fo good a grace as he, yet you are Nephew to Andrea Doria, and that is to fay every
thing. Think then of winning-^fo^ora's heart, before icbc engaged; buc above all, come
to no violence; for ic imporesmuch, chac che adopcive fon of hira,who hach reffored Genoua
to her liberty, foould not engage hira to proted bira in fuch hke things. Jannetin, who
held all his fortune frora Andrea Daria, and who reverenced him more then if he had been
his father, proraifed hira to forgec nothing of all that fliould lie in his power to fatisfie him;
as indeed, all that care and raagnificence could contribute to gallantry, appeared in Genoua
at that eirae; and had not your raelancholy retained you then ac Monaco, you would have
acknowledged as well as we, that the like had never been feen.

<p>But whereas tbc Count could not give place to any body, be no fooner underftood Jan-
netin's defign, but hc overtopped him in all things. There was nothing but running at the
Ring, Turneys, Serenades, Balls, and Feafts; and in all things if the Count was noc raore
magnificent, yet was he more gentile. His apparel was braver, his horfes were gallanter
his matches better made, hisferenades better contorted; infne, he hud the advantage in all
things. And wher&lt;;as he loved Leonora really, all the teftimonies he gave her of it wrouehc
another effed in her heart, then the feigned proteftations of Jannetin, who prevailed not
with her at all. Things contmued a while in this manner, during the which thefe cwo Rivals
lived civilly enough together, as well by reafon of the order which Jannetin had received for

<p>Buc to ccm^zp\n to Jannetin, be had been no fooner inftruded by his Uncle, but he
went home to the Count, who attended with a great deal of impitiencc the anfwer which
Horatio \N^s to miVehim, for it was hc who had m charge to give it him, he quitted this
mufing humor to receive Jannetm's vific wich his ordinary civility ; and according to Anka
Doria's diredion, three of fannetin's friends arrived a. the fame tirae to be witnelTcs ofthefe
two Rivals converfation. After the firft corapleraents, Jannetin told the Count, thathe
came not only to render hira a vifit, but alfo to render bim up his arms, and co demand the
grace of him, that he might b- one ot the captives of his Triumph. I know not, anfwered
the Count, what Triumph you mean. It is a Triumph, replyed Jannetin, wherein for a
Trophy of Arms you fliall have all the chains ofthe Lovers ofthe incomparable Leonora; who
knowing that you alone merit her, wilt follow you without regret or envy; at leattwifelam
come hither to affure you, that that is ray'ntention: and if I had known that you had bom
an affedion to her, I would have been your Confident, rather then your Rival; yet ami
not forry, that I have had the comraodity to teftifie unto you, that nothing in the world is
fo dear to me as your friendfhip.
</p>
<p>The Count underftood prefently Jannetin s cunning, yet would raake no foew of it, but
contrarily anfwered hira with a great rteal of civility and gallantry. I choughc, faid heunto
him, that I had nothing to vanquifh but tbe rigors ofmy Miftrefs, and if I had bdeeved that
I had had fo redoubtable a Rival as you, I hadnot it raay be undertaken to ferve her: But
fince you are fo obliging, as to content your felf with meriting her, wichoi,t pretending to her
poffeffion, I ara raviflied to know that you have judged her worthy of your efteem; and to
underftand tbac 1 fliall have noching more then her cruelty ro furmounc, fince if you had con¬
tinued ferving her, and that fhe had been juft, ! ftiould in your triumph have held the place,
which you demand in mine; and which I do not grant you, feeing he that yeilds up a vidory
cannot be faid to have been overcome. Jannetin, hearing the Coune fpeak in this fort, be¬
leeved, that his cunning had fucceeded, and took that for a teftimony of friendfoip and free¬
dom, which was but an addrefs ofhis wit; and that not having been able to vanqailh htm in
love, he had at leaft furmounted him in fubtleey, and was arrived ac ehe end he had propound¬
ed CO himfelf. Bue che Coune was coo clear fighted Co be deceived fo eafily ; and whereas the
moft dexerous guile is chac which perfwades our enemies ebac chey have beguiled us, chougti
indeed we are noc; che Coune faid fo many obliging chings eo Jannetin, as he made no doubt

<p>The Counts Mother was ravifoed with her fons marriage; LtonorayNZS infinitely con¬
tented; Julie ieemed fatisfied; //tr^f/o efteemed himfdf very happy in it; znd Sophronia
was fo much the raore pleafed with ic, for thac being ofan age wherein dcfghts, Mufick, and
company make up the happinefs of a life, foe found all thefe things in the Counts Pahce,where
foe lived with her fifter after her marriage; for it might be faid, that this houfe was the retreat
of all worthy perfons, and of all pleafures, which made the Count to be loved of every one.
In the raean tirae the profperous fuccefs ofhis love, had not fraothered his arabition, but con¬
trarily his efkeem of Leonora feemed to have augm.ncedit; ind Sophronia hath affured us,
how foe hath often heard him fay, that his Fortune was noc worthy of her. This generous
Soul had noe ic raay be for all that been ever capable of the refolution which he took, chough
he beleeved it to be juft, if the counftls of three raen, who did but flatter his ambition to fa¬
tisfie their own, had not confirraed hira in that defign. And truly it rauft be acknowledgedj
that one hath never heard fpeak ofan enterprize fo daring info young an age, of a prudence
fo extraordinary for the condud offo dangerous a thing, and ofa fuccefs, equal to his, if For«
tune had not abandoned hira.
</p>
<p>But, Madam, to raake you acknowl dg that which I fay, you are to underftand, that about
two years ago the Count finding himfelf ill for certain days together, wtnt as he ufed ofcen¬
times Co do inco his Cabinec, whicher his ambicious mocher came to bim, for Co acquainc hiraj
thae Andrea Dona, who hxd adopted Jannetin for his fon and fucceffor a good while before,
had chen raade him his Lievttnant to the charge he held of Generaliffimo .- And all this, con¬
tinued foe, whileftyou are denyed the penfions which the RepublJquegave Simbaldo yom fa¬
ther ; for it was true, that as long as he lived the Senate had affigned hira 3 pcnfion for a mark
of honor, which bad not been concinued Co the Court, becaufe he had been fufpeded by An¬
drea Doria, an eneray of the French, to be affeded to that Nation.
</p>
<p>In the mean tirae to return unto my fubjed, the Count had no fooner heard what his Vo-
thcr faid unto hira, but would have anfwered, when as foe ftaying hira told him roundly,
think before thou fpeakeft of faying nothing to me unworthy of thy fclf,or of m^ thac brought
thee into the world, and know chad willl difavow thee for ray fon, ifthoube fobafe, as to
be contented with thy formne, and to endure, thatthey, who do not outgo thee either in
birth or merit, foould mount into the Throne, and leave thee amongft tne people.   1 his dif¬
courfe netted the great heart of tbe Count, who was but too fenfible on that part, yet con¬
cealed he his refentment within himfelf, and faid no more to his Mocher, buc chat all he could
promife her was, how he would abfolutely lofe himfelf, or lofe them that oppreffed him •
and that the fequd or end of hii h^e foould not permit her to complain ofhim.    After this fhe

him, and addreffing his fpeech to Verrin, what bad news have you to impart to me ? My
Lord, anfwered he, it is badder for the Republique, then for you; for in ^ne, to acquaint
yon thit Jannetin hath flill new honors conferred on him, is totell youthat the power o[
Andrea Doria will pafs into his hands; that h:s Tyranny will be perpetuated in the perfon
ofhis Nephew; and that we fliall never have tbe happinefs to fee vertue where it ought
CO be.
</p>
<p>Ie is cercain, added Raphaello Sacca, ehae chis is the fence of all good raen; and in the mi.
fery of ehe age, ie feeraj, faid he, addrefiiing himfelf co ehe Count, ehae all the woild turn
their eyes upon you. Your illuftrious and great birth, accompanyed with fo many rare qua¬
licies as are in your perfon, makes all chem chac love ehe pubbque gbod defire, that your for¬
tune were as greac as your heare: And for my particular, I would gladly fee your vertueona
Theater higher then chac whereon you are, eo the end you might be feen of every one: But
you are born in fo unhappy an age, as it feems you cannot afpire to the power of doing good
to your Citizens; fo crue ic is, that Andrea and Jannetin Doria, under the name of the pub¬
lique liberty, have folidly cftabliflied their Power, or to fay better, their Tyranny. And in
this fort, one may well affure, that the people do fufficiently chaftife themfelves for the blinde
refolution, which carries them to foske off che yoke of a greac and excellenc Prince, to fufftt
to be impofed upon them thac of cwo Tyrants, who will be fo much the raore crud, by how
much they are lefs accuftmed eo raign. Their weaknefs, being fupporeed byehepowerof
Cafar,ind rendred infolent by the great number of warlike Vcffds.which we fee in the Port,
will never fuffer a couragious and refolute fpirit. They will beleeve the high vertue of a man
of condition too dangerousfor their rifing fortune to endure. They will raake ufe ot the am¬
bitious Tides, of Fachersof cheir Councry, and Reftorers of ehe libercy, which havebeen
%\sento AndreaDoria, for ehe oppreffion of ehe raoft raagnaniraous, wich the pretext ot

of offences, then of life: and if unto this day we have not feen fuch like things, it isbecaule
thepo'wexof AndreaDoria, hath not yet attained to its fopreme greatnels; and that his
moderation hach in fome fore recained ehe imperious humor of Jannetin. You know h^w
infolenc he is, how proud, and how infupporeable; chink then, if when he foall fee himlcit
in an eftate of being able to do whaefoever he will, and followed by young people, who re¬

(hding you: buc if ray good fortune can make y®ur prudence give fome ro^mtofeS

and fidelity which I carry CO your fervice, by the liberty ot my difcourfe, asyoukavtS
tryal ot my diligence, in che encounters where it hath been neceffary unto you. Until nZ
yon have lived m fo conftant a felicity, as it may be faid, you have never feen Fortune difpb
fed; and that is the caufe why your imagination prefents noie buc agreeable objeds tint
you; thac is it which makes you, according to the cuftom of the hsppy, think of nothiiw
but Vidories, Scepters, and Crowns: But I ara much afraid lelf thefe deceiving hopes be not
one day deftroyed by fome fatal event, wh.ch wil be fo much the raore infupportable unto
you, by how much you have lefs forefeen ic. To go abouc Co alter any thing in the Govern¬
ment of the Republiqae, in a time wherein we are, is an enterprize attended with fomany
dfficukics, and expofed to evident a peril, as I cannot forccmy minde to figure it unto iffi
cercain and facile, as one would perfwade you. Yotinfine, you will precend either to make
ufe of ftrangers, or to hold intelligence with our Citizens; ofthe forraer I fee no likely¬
hood for it: but fuppofe it weie poffible, at leaft-wife the raatter could not be carryed witt
fuch fpeed and fo fecretly, but the City, Doria, or the Emperor, would have notice of it.
Ital-j, for your ill fortune, is at this prefent in To great a trouble, as every ones eyes areopeii
upon his neighbors affairs: And Genoua it felf, by reafon of its fcituation on the brink of the
fea, is guarded as the key of that State, fht Djtchyof Milan, which hath beenalon»
time, both a prey and place ot battel to the fortune of the Imperial and French Armies"
makes C&lt;^fAr regard Genoua, as the onely defence, and fole rampart, which covers his powet
in Italy. Doria alfo ferves the Emperor with twenty Gallies, but a great deal more with
the good-will ofthe Citizens, who believe they are obliged unto hira: Befides this.alltheCoJft
of the River of Genoua, efpecially towards the Levant, is abfolutely at his devotion, The
City, that is ftill much troubled with the Tyranny of the Duke of Milan, and Government
of che French, detefts the very name of forraign dominion. You may indeed with fraall fot¬
ces difcover your inceneion, bue noc arrive ac your end. It is fo rauch the raore grievous, that
encerprizes of chis nature are not favorably judged of, but by their happy fuccefs, and that is
ic which I do noc fee you can obcain. For from what part hope you for great Troops i* The
King of France, on whofe protedion you rely, hath not fo little to do, inregardof hispre-
teneions Co che Kingdom of Naples, and Dutchy of y^;/i«», butif he had even a minde to
make fome new ftir in Italy,th^t he could come and fuccor you wich all his forces, which are
employed for the fafeey of his froneircs. Buc fay chac he, or any other Prince, foould under-
take \f, could you believe that the Emperor, who for his own incereft takes that of Gmu
upon him, would not oppofc them with forces, if not greater, at leaft-wife equal to thofe
which you fhould draw to your affiftancc? And that being fo, you would fee your defigns
bit ill affured, fince chey would ftill depend on ehe lofs or gain of abaeeel, whofe event is al¬
ways doubcful: buc on which fide foever che vidory doth fall, you are ftill to follow the plei-
fure of che conqueror, nothing being left you that is certain, but the foame of having depri¬
ved your Country of her Libercy, for to fubmit it Co a ftranger. Buc if you turn your eyes to
a neerer fuccor, by thinking to finde it in this City; either I know not the humor, and indi-
nations of the Genouefes, or your hopes are but weakly grounded. Tell me, I pray you, trom
which fort of our Citizens do you look for affiftancc? Will ic be frora ehe Nobles? into

from meriting the good-will of the people? But it may be you will fay, that youwiU re-
eftablifo the firft form of Government, changed by Doria, where the popular authority did
all things; and that by the declaration thereof tbe multitude will rife for your advantage:
For ray part, I ara not of a contrary opinion, buc believe, as well as you, that chofe which
are ill fatisfied will wich joy erabrace an occafion of renewing their anciene Tragedies; and
fomuch che raore ardently, for chat they foall reap all the profic of ic, nothing remaining for

rejoyce to fee the Noble-rain put in chains,by the hand ofa Noble-man; the bowels cf their
Country torn out by you; the comraon reft troubled by your fury; their Tyranny eftablifo-
ed by y^ur fault: but a tirae will come when wholly dif charging themfelves ot thefedition
which you have caufed, the people will give them the recorapence of your travels, the glory
of your enterprize, and the triumph of your combats.   In what terms will you finde your
Iclt then ? Which way will you turn your fclf for foirae ? Detefted of the Nobles, whom
you foall have betrayed; defpifed of the people, who will deride the raeans which have
caufed their utility and your ruine; abominable to your Country, as having ravifoed her of
her liberty; in Enemy to ^a far, the Protedor of the Republique; fufpeded of the King

quiets be not foretellers of your bad fortune; which it may be hach already refolved the lofS

with an eye of envy, and you your felf have ofrenciraes complained to rae of the treacheries
he intended againft you; why then will youfiirnifo hira with Arras to deftroy you? With
what avidity and joy would he embrace the occafion to be revenged of you, and to content

In the School of the Vulgar, who know not the politick of Conquerors. With fuch like terms
the adions of private perfons are fpoken of, but not thofe of the Great: And if your Rule
were true, ic might be faid that all Empires were Robberies, becaufe there is none of chem
which was noC eftablifoed by that natural right, which the ftrong irapofe on the weak.
</p>
<p>Nature brought raen into the world with an equality of all things, and yet left unto Vertue
the power of raifing chera, which poffefs it, to the glory of raigning over others: From
whence it coraes, that the moft part of thofe, who are Princes or Mafters of the Earth, carry
not that title, but becaufe their Predeceffors, by the addrefs and by force of Arms, ufurped
the Empire over their equals. I do not deny but ehae ehere are forae perfons, who as well as
jrj««»f'o will blarae your refolution, before it be conduded to its end, in regard all hardy
and dangerous adions are never coraraended till chey are executed; but as foon as the happy
fuccefs ofehe event foall have juftified and authorized the greatnefs ofyour enterprize, the
blame will be turned into adrairation; and that which was calfd teraerityand iraprudence,
will be terraed valor and greatnefs of courage. As long as the firft of the Cafars was in Arms
againft Pow/&gt;«7, and that the ifow^« Empire was the caufe of their conflids, he had not only
T'ow/'f; for an adverfary, but even all the Nobihty were his raoft cruel foes. In the mean
time as foon as hc had defeated his Eneraies raighty Array in the plains of Pharfalia, and that
this vidory had put hira in full poffeffion of the Roman Empire, all the hatred which was
born him ceafed j and he was fo dearly and ardently beloved of the Romans, as this affedion
could not finifo with his life, but ehey punifoed his deach wich a memorable revenge. Re¬
folve chen Co fuffer che Genouefes for a eirae Co call you Tyranc, and do nor cake chis narae as
a grievous injury, feeing ie foall be che laft infolency of their dying liberty. They will accuftom
themfelves afterwards to acknowledg you for their lawful Prince, and as fuch reverence you.
Behold how rauch I rely on your fortune, in fpeaking to you cf the felicities of your Empire,
before you have refolved to fight for the acquiring of ir. But things are difpofed in fuch fort,
as you may fooner be wanting to your felt, then the Erapire to your vertue. For if the diffi¬
culties be greac, according to r»»««rfVs opinion, your courage is yet greater. Letusgranc
him, that the enterprize is dangerous and difficult; in what Hiftory, ancient or modern, hath
it been found, that the way which condudcth to glory is covered with flowers ? and that an
illuftrious adion hath been executed without pain? All great defigns have always been fol¬
lowed by great perils; and all high places are ever near to precipices: A generous man will
not for allthat let the fear of an uncertain evil, make him a prey[to an inevicable fervitude.
Amongft private perfons it is an effed of prudence tobe contained within mediocrity; but in
affairs of ^'/^/^« all refolutions are Co be extream, the reft being dangerous, efpecially in enter-
prizes, which begin not co break forth but by their execution. For it being then no longer
m our power to retain the thing, wc muft of neccfllity arrive at the end we have propofed Co
our felves, or fall in the raidft ot che courfe, and be utterly loff. Yec lee us noc make fo un¬
happy a prefage ofour defigns, but let us forecaft the misfortunes which may arrive to us, not
to eorraenc our felves in che expedacion of chera, but by prudence Co take from them che
power of hurting us. We are to be guided with precaution, but yec noC fo far, as chat ex¬
tream wifdora may thereby render us raore ciraorous and virefolute. You rauft, generous
Count, give foraething to the condud of Fortune, who having chofen you for the Deliverer
ofGenoua, and Reftorer of the ancient/r4//^« valor, will know well enough how to find
out the raeans to plain all difficulties before you. It is foe that calls you to glory; ic is flie

any pare in che fway thereof. And then again, he had brought his affairs into fo ftrangc a
diforder, by the debts which he had run inco, as judging that he could hardly conceal his mi¬
fery longer, if the cranquilicy of the Republiqiie fliould hft any tirae, he was defirous to Heal
it from the eyes ofthe world by a univerfal con'^ufion. He confidered alfo, that if the inier-

</p>
<p>This fpeech ended, they all refolved with one accord, cbaC fincfi the Governraenc could
noe be changed withouc ehe deach ot Andrea and Jannetin Doria, chey were chiefly co think
of giving foch order eo che raaecer, as ehe end of cheir lives foould be ehe beginning ot the ex¬
ecution thereof. This Confptracy being raade, rhe Count went ouc of his Cabinec, wieh a
marvelous cranquillity of fpirit, and wc were all the evening with him, talkingof Mufick and
Painting, as if he had had nothing elfe of iraportance in his thought. As for his Counftllors,
they told her who had eraployed them, chac foe was eo attend greac matcers from her fon,
withouc particularizing anything unto her, for fear left foe foould difcover thera. Inthe
mean tirae, the Count, having certain days after taken great care for the Galliej, which ht
had bought not long before, ufed to go oftentiraes to the places belonging tohim; where
with an admirable Providence he furnifoed his Subjeds with Arms, and made them to exer¬
cife thera, upon pretext ofbeing in forae fear of che Duke of T/*c«»/»&lt;«, whofe neighbor he
was; but indeed, it was to render thera capable of ferving him in his defign.
</p>
<p>The end of Autumn being come, he xetuxntd to Genoua, and applyed a'l his Cite to gain
the good-will 'fall the young racn,of thofe families newly ennobf d, which are called Popular.
He introduced himfelf into their converfadon with a marvelous compliance. He fent prefents
to fome, he ferved others according to occafions, and offered himfelfto all, with an extraor¬
dinary courtefie. And whereas he had a quick and pleafing wit, and a fupple and charming
humor, he won their affedion in fo high a manner, ashe was their Mafter, rather then their
friend. When as he knew that he mighc begin co confide in chem, and chat their wills de¬
pended abfolutely on his, he fdl to jeering, as occafion ferved, at the Government ofGenoua,
which hc termed the Tyranny ofthe Nobles. Sometimes he teftified with interrupted fpeeches
that he fuffered in the miferies of the popular families; fcmetiraes he fecmed to tell them that
the raatter was not paft remedy, and that chey might abafe the pride of the Nobles, if their
hearts d|,d not fail them; fometimes alfo with a bitter feoff he exhorted thera to fervicude;
yec ftill leaving chera a fting behind in cheir minds by his doubtful and uncereain words. And
above all chings, he aggravaced che injuftice of the Government, when by chance any acci¬
dent fefl our, that difpleafed the popular families. But if he were agreeable to ehera, lie had
rendred himlelf no lefs pleafing to ehe coramon people, by fuch raeans as he had carefully
ufed for ic. He moft readily falutcd fome, he fiuiled upon ochers as he race chera, he was
magnificent in his apparel, gencle and courteous co every one; and thac which advanced his
defign raore was, as you know as well as I, that he was wonderful handfora, and of an ex¬
ceeding jovial humor; that the air of his face was fweet and agreeable; and his carriage fo
noble, fo tree, and fo fair, as one was forced eo love him ae che very firft fight. He exer¬
cifed himfelf alfo in fencing, and riding of ehe greac horfe, and chac wieh fo gallant a grace,
and fo great an addrefs, as they that faw him could not chufe but love a man, who gave chem
fomuch delight.
</p>
<p>But whereas liberality is the ftrongeft chain, wherewith the people may be captivated, he
met with no occafion of deraonftracing his unco chera, buc he ceftified ic wich a magnificence
paft compare. Yec would noe our prudene Confpiracor caft himfelf fo abfolutely inco che
hands of ehe people, as Co minifter any jealoufie ehereby eo che Nobles; buc he ufed fo juft a

ot the one did not make him lofe the friendfoip of the others. And to that effed, choush

</p>
<p>_ In the mean time, he had treated fecretly with the Duke of Placentia, who had promifed
him two thoufand Foot, to joyn with two thoufand othcr.^ which he had pick'd forthont
of all his fubjeds, for the fervice of his enterprze when time foould ferve. He had alfo
caufed one of his Gallies to corae to Genoua under pretext that be meant to fend her forth to
fcour the Seas all along the Coaft of Barbary. Howbeit during all this we obferved as a moft
extraordinary ching in him, chac he was as merry as he ufed cobe, delighted as much in our
company, and feemed Co have no other greater thought, then of being agreeable to his
friends.
</p>
<p>Now Baptifla, cunning and undertaking as he was, remained not idle; for in a very fliott
time he had gained a great number of perfons, who proraifed to follow and ferve him faith.
fully in a fecret defign which he faid he had. With thefe preparations, they believed that they
had layd foundations folid enough for the execution ot their intentions; and being affembled
together to take their laft refolucion, the advice of Baptifta Verrin was, that wheieas there
was a ceremony to be celebrated for the perforraance whereof every one would rtfortunto
the Church, he would have them begin the executing o^" the bufinefs in that pbce, fftliing to
give Jannetin the firft ftab.   Buc the (fount's piety being unable co confenc eo chis propoiiti-
on, he made a ftep or cwo back, crying ouc, He would never endure that the beginning of
his enterprize fliould be a profanation and a facnledg.   Raphaello Sacca added thereunto,
that the matter likewife would even be as uncertain, as icwjs ex crable; hcvakdnirt*
Z)m4 mighe excufe hirafelf upon che incomraodity of his age, and fonot come, but fend
Thilippo Doria his Kinfman in his ftead. To chis Verrin anfwered again, thac if th:y thought
it fit he would go, whil'ft chey were executing the bufinefs, to Andrea's Palace, and under
colour of vifiting him as he was wont to do, he would ftrike hira to the heart with his Poig-
nard.   But the Count being very angry with hira for it, he gave this over, and propounded
another expedient worthy of his wit: He told the Count, that Jannetin's fifter beinglhort-
ly afcer Co marry wieh/«/&lt;o Cj^o, Leonar a's bxoihex, he would have hira defire chem to fup
ac his houfe; and Co render the feaft ehe raore rasgnificene, he fliould alfo invice Auhtt Do¬
ria ind Jannetin, together with a great nuraber ot Ladies, and all fuch araongft the Nobles,
whom they might judg were moft eo be feared for the execucion oftheir defign; That things
being thus, it would be eafie for chera whom they had hid for that purpofe to kill them; that
prefently thereupon the C^j^wr, followed byhistriends, foould go through all the ftreets o(
Genoua, founding out the fweet name of Liberty, and acquaineing che people that theit
chains were broken; That in this Tumult the Palace was to be feized upon and lecurtd; that
in the mean tiuae he would poffefs the people with the Count's generous defigns, concealing
from them wich addrefs that which he had of abfolutely raigning; and letting chem know
the necefsity of reforming the Government, or to fay better, the cruel Tyranny of theNobks,
for fo it was thac he fpake; Thatforthis effed he would crown him Duke of the Repub¬
lique, and caufe them whom he had gained to take the oath of allegiance unto him; That it
any one, either in woord or deed, fhould contradid them, he foould be killed upon the
place.
</p>
<p>The Count found this plot indifferently well contrived, buc yet he felt an extream repug¬
nancy in refolving to vfolate the law of hofpitality, in killing men in h s houfe, whom he )i
intreated thither; but being pe»rfwaded that he fliould not meet with a better nr an to at
to his end, he refolved for it: And to that purpofe, he commanded, t^at the Soldiers, wn
be had choft-n frora amongft his Subjeds, fliould corae one by one into Genoua ^ And on
other fide he folhcited the Duke of Placentia to fend him the fuccor which he had pro
him. All thefe difpatches could not befo fecretly made, efpecially having to do witn    j

</p>
<p>'Andrea received this advice,'wiir-ouc grounding any thing thereupon; for he was fo
ftrongly perfwaded of th.^ Count's affedion to him,and fo powcrfullv affured, by the tranquil¬
lity which he always faw in his face, that he had no bad defign in hand, as this difcourfe made
no kind of impreffion in his uiind ; and to confirm him in his incredulity, the Count entred ac¬
cidently into Andr.ai, chamber, when as the Embaffador and he were fpeakinp ot this affiir;
but he appeared wuh fo clear a countenance, and talked to thera with fo much judgment, and
hberty of fpirit, thit Andrea Doria, charmed with Ws converfacion, and periwaded of
his innocency, approached to the Embaffador, and faid to him foftly in his ear, as we have
Icarn'd fince, Judg you your fdf, whether this Prncely look^, this both mo'iefi and confident
carriage, this nobU and cjuiet foul and this liberty of Jpirit, can be capable of fo horrible
a conRiracj ? The Embalfador not able to gainfay Andrea's Opinion, raadc a fign to him
that he was of his raind'. And albeit that two days after Doria had a fecond advertifemenr,
yet the Count's addrefs was fo great, as his fight alqne deftroyed whatfoever was faid againft
him. And fo wonderful was his condud, rhat Andrea Dsria, above fourfcorc years of
age, and held for cne of the greateft politicians of his time, was beguiled byarasnot cwo
and twenty.
</p>
<p>The generous Panja, who had been of none of the Count's counftls, was withouc com¬
parifon more advifed. For whereas he joyned affedion to prudence, ic was the more eafi.."
for him ro fufped forajthing of the truth. He had exadly obferved all the (fount's adions,
ever fince hehad bought the Gallies of the Dxike of Placentia; and carefully exaraining all
that he had feen or heard in divers occafions, he found that he had caufe to fear left the (fount
had forae dangerousdefign a foot. He faw how he, who was accuftoraed to communicate
the raoft important affairs of his houfe to hira, calked no longer with him but of indifferent
things; that he was often in a retired and private converfation with 5^pn/?.i Verrin, ani
having followed hiraforaetiraes whenas be withdrew hirafelf into his Cabinet, he had per-
cived hm to be mufing and melancholique: For though the Count feeraed to be raerry,
when ashe might be feen of anybody, and by that artifice admirably covered ehe dcfigns
which he had in his hearr, yec was be no fooner retired in privace, bue he becarae quice an¬
ocher chen whac hehad been feen abroad, which F.w/^ alone had marked, for he had con¬
cealed hirafelf from Leonora, as wdl as from ochers. Thac which kepc ehe (fount from com¬
municating hs defign to Pan fa, was his knowledg of the affedion and exceeding prudence
of the man, fo that he was affured hewould have oppofed his defign, or at leaft-wife have
counfclled hini not to have undertaken it fo precipitoufly : and would have had him feek for
more fecurity in an enterprize, where none had ever been.
</p>
<p>At length, one day when as the Count returned to his Palace more raelancholique then hc
ufed to be, carrying in his face fome raarks ofan extraordinary unquietnefs, and with fuch a
palenefs, as amazement many tiraes paints on the forehead of thofe, which are upon the point
of executing fome great defign, whofe event is but ill-affured; the generous T^w//fol¬
lowed him to his Cabinet, and refolved to tell hira his fufpcions, for fear left if he ftiould
longer defer to do ir, there would be no cirae left for the remedying ofthe evil whereof he was
afraid. After he had font the door then, he addreffed his fpeech to the Count, who leaning
on a Table, heard hira with a great deal of unquietnefs. I know very well, ray Lord faid he

the Countcaufed certain Soldiers of the Gari'on to come tohisPa'ace, whereof fome were

from thence the French Marquefs and I met him; but it had been hard for us to forefee whac
the Count had in his thought, for he talked to us of nothing but of matches ot fport and de¬

walls ofthe City alraoft on every fide ; The Sea was inthe face of che building, and back¬
wards It had for profped the pleafant Valley of Btfagno.   I put you in raind of thefe things,
chat you may comprehend, how this Palace, being as it were an Ifland, was very coramodi¬
oufly fciruared for the Counts enterprize; having no nearer a neighbor then Baptifta, who
being ofthe Confpiracy was not to be feared.   In fine, being recurned home, he drew chither
about the beginning ofthe night, a great raany of arraed raen, of thofe which he had caufed
to enter fecretly into the City, and of thofe which he had fuborned even in Genoua it felt.
He placed them for the Guard of the Gates of his Palace, whom he held to be the moft cou¬
rageous and faithful; with order to leave the entrance cbercinto free to every one, but colec

<p>In the raean time one ofthe Captains ofthe Garifon, going to fee Sentinels, perceived thac

whereupon fome oftheir fellows anfwering that they were gone to Carignan wich che Coune

thereof to the Senators that were at the Palace, and to Andrea Doria; and then it was chac

he found three and twenty young Gentleman of the- Popular order, whom the coiiningof
Baptifta Verrin had drawn thither.   The Count careffed them exceedingly, and talkinc with

<p>my difcourfe, and the beginning ofyour vidory.   Let us go out of this Palace, and defcend
into the Oty, where we are attended by a great number of our friends, forth end nt
</p>
<p>me, the Gallies upon a Signal given will fall into the hands of a Troop of men, as hX to ren
der thernfelve^s Mafters ot them, as prudent Co confeive chera.   We have fntheCit'vfihcen
hundred inhabicants, which are arraed for us; and even now that I am fpeaking to you there
are m che Suburbs cwo ehoufand of my Subjeds, and as many of the Duke of pLemi.'s
whxh arc come to fuccor us.
</p>
<p>Lee us go chen, my companions, and caliche people again co liberty; let us return to the
dweetnefs ofour anccnt Government; let us exterminate the Nobles and /rf^wrt/VsTyrannv
and in one only night, more fliining then the faireft days of our lives have been, let us re-
eltabhfli the glory of the popular families in their firft fplendor j let us for ever deface out of
th J memories of men our paft fiinc-hearrednefs.But if any ofyou as I cannot believejbe foau-
dacious &amp; fo cowardly borh together, as to oppofe a defign fo glorious for us,and advantageous
for our Cou itry, let him behold round about him chis dreadful company of Arms and SolJi-
ci s, and let him imagine that he fees at the very fame inftant the points of all our'fwords level-
ed ac his heare. Yea, my Companions, I do proteft it openly, we rauft of nectffity either
fighc or dye. And thit blood which fliall be ingratttully denyed to ihe fuccor ofour Lcuntry,
fo neer to ruine, (hallb | bed, in ehis very place, eo wjfo away che ftain of fuch perfidiouf¬
nefs. Yea, I fay ic once again, ehe firft facrifice, which foall be confecrated for che publique
fafeey, fhall even here have his chroac cue wich my hand, it any one undercaktj to tppofe
my will.
</p>
<p>Thefe dreadful menaces amazed chofe Co whom they were addrtft; they beheld cne ano¬
ther, and chen that great nuraber of Soldier| which environed them; and after they had been
a while without fpeaking, they cryed all with one voyce, cwo excepted, that they would
follow che Coune even co ehe death; that they would be the companions of his triumph, or
of his fall; and in conclufion, thac they would never abandon him, but would obey him in
all things. The Count embraced chem chen with a great deal of joy, and teftimony ot fatif-
fadion; and being turned towards chofe two, which as yet had faid nothing, they befought
him to have pity of cheir weaknefs, wich words wherein tear appeared fo vilible.as the Count
could noc forbear fmiling. They reprefenred unto him, rhat the requeft which thty made
him, was advantageous tohim, as well as to thtm; bt caufe being fo uncapable ot fighting,
they fliould hurt him more then they could help him; that their fear might beget the fame in
others,and their flight give an ill example to his Soldiers: Britfly,chey gave hira (o many marks
of their affright and terror, as changing his determination, hc only contented himfelf with re¬
proaching them for their cowardife in a bitter jear, and for the fecurity ot his enterprize he
caufed them to be fliut up in a chamber, where he left thtm under a Guard, which fhould
keep them from coming forth. After this he comraanded raeat to be brought in, but in fuch
a faftiion, as this meal might be rather named a collation, then a fupper; tearing left they
fliould be too much taken up wich good cheat. Whil'ft chen thae forae did eae ftanding, jnd
others were arming themfelves with the Arms which ehe Coune had caufed eo be prefented
unco chem, hc wene co Leonora's chamber, who was talking with Sophronia hex fiifer about

he approached co her, and taking her by che hand, he cold her in few words the defign he had;
defiring her Co pardon him for noc having fpoken to her of it till then.
</p>
<p>The great heart of i^foword found not it felf firm enough to remain conftant in this occa¬
fion ; and confidering the extream peril whereinto che Count was going to expofe hiinfdt,
affedion and fear troubled her iff fuch fort, as falling at the Counts teet, and her face all be¬
dewed wich cears. My Lord, faid flie unto him, imbracing his knees, to what danger arc
you going co expofe your felt ? I conjure you by che thing that is deareft to you m the world,
by che love which I bear co you, by chac which you b arcome, by che cears which im a,
and by your own glory, Co preferve ray life in preferving ye.urs. The incereft of our Coon y
is dear come, bnc yours is yec far more come. I had racher have ^4««^n^ raign '"'o'J" y-
then to feeyouperifli for the faving of ochers. And I ftiill refolve with joy to wear ctn^^j
rather then to fee my felf expofed to the hazard of wearing raouming for your deacn.

atrerwards through S. Andrews ftreet to S. Donat, and paffing by rhe place of the SMv^-^c,
writh his cnmpan:ons he arrived at the posnt of Catana.   Baptifla Verrn went aboard'the

inregard hewasoneo /^w^nVs Officers, and had the word, the Guards fuft:red him to
enter; but perceiving fo great a number of armed m;n, wherewith hc was lollowed, they
rudely r. pulftd him: Neverth- lefs ft:e;ng ic was neceffary, tha? fome one fo uld enter to open
the gate unro the Count, it was refolved that Scipio, oneof his fubjeds, and a Cap ain of
greac courage, fliould caft himftlf with forne Soldiers into hede Boats, kepc thereof pur¬
pofe, in ca eof neccfllity, and by thac means encer by che S;a into che Pore, where the Gal¬
lies hy, and fo facilitate che entrance of the reft of the Confpirators thereinto.   Thisdtlign
was as happily executed, as itwas well thought of; for albeit they found fome rtliftance
there, yet in regard the Conrpiiators were more in number,and incomparably more valorous,it
was ealie for them to prevail.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the Count was come by Land to that Gate, where with much impatience
he attended the fignal that was Co be given him, which ftayd longer then it ought, hy reafon
the Gaily with her motion and agitarion had ftruck her fdf a ground, and it was above half
an hour before they could fee her afloat again. All thefe things, which could not be due
without noife, began to raife a great deal; but at length the lignal having been given, the
Count, devarcingall his companions, leapt with txcccdirg courage intoT^n./s Gillies.
This unexp ded violence, and the noife o''Arms and Soldiers, having awaked all the Miri-
nersanj Slaves, a drtadfol and confufed din of chains and vojccs was fuddenly heard. All
the Sailors cryed to Arms, ail theG^lly-Shvts refoundcd rhenameof Liberty, and labored
as much as they could to break off cheir Lons: But che Count, who knew not what to do
with the Gallies if he hsd not m n, confidering what a prejudice the flight of the Slaves
would bring unto him, he caft himfelf afoore again, and wenc with all fpeed to the Admiral,
which with the fudden and un: uly motion of them wherewith foe was filled, floated leafure-
ly, and feemed as though fhe would eb''gn her felt from the Land.

<p>Whil'ft rhings paft thus in the Port, Girahmo and Ottobuono failed not in that which haJ
been coramanded them; for as foon as rh^y heard the Cannon difcharged, which was the

S. Thomas gate, not on; ly to render themfelves Miftcis of it, buc co pafs along unro Dirn^'i
Palace, which was hard by, for tokW Andrea ind jannetin. This enterprze was not fo
facile unto the Confpirators, as the former; the Soldiers that guarded chis gate defended them¬
felves wel enough; and SebafiianoLtrcata with his Biother,whereof theone was the Captain,
and the other the Enfign, coming in, made all the refiftance that valiant men could A^y- ||^i'

<p>Gallies. Andrea, more forefeeing then he, and fearing forae unlooked for accident, would
not have had hira gone forth, but well accompanyed; H.s Wife caft herfelf at his feet Co
keep hira from ic: hue he, carryed on by his dcfony, contemned ehe counfel of ehe one, and
the prayers of che ocher, and wene oue alone wieh one Groom ot his Chamber, and a Page,
thae carryed a Torch before hira, wichouc any ocher Arras, chen his fingle fword. When hc
arrived ae Saine Thoma4 gace, which he choughc was guarded ftill by his own followers, ac¬
cording CO his infolenc humor, whereuneo che choller he was in chac Cirae being joyned, he
fiercely coraraanded chem eo open unCo hira. Jannetin's voyce being ftraigheway known of
the Confpiraeors, ehey opened ehe gacc, and fuffered hiraeo encer wichouc refiftance; buc
fcarcely was he enered, when as a foowre of Muskee fooc fell on him, and layd hra inftanely
dead on ehe ground. This adventure raade Giralomo and Ottobuono change che order which
the Count had given ehera, for going diredly Co Doria's Palace. For feeing Jannetm dead,
who was ehe onely raan of ehe Co«»fV Eneraies, ehae could facisfie wich his perfon; and be¬
leeving ehae ehe Count had rendred hirafelf Mafter of ehe Gallies, ehey did noe think that
Andrea, fourfcorc years of age, and fick ot the gout, could bring any great obftacle to their
defign. Moreover they feared, that if they foould go to Dorius Palace, the riches of the
booty would withdraw the raoft part of the Soldiers from the adion, and make them quit
their Arms, to lade therafelves with che plunder of fuch rich raovables, as it was full of.
</p>
<p>In the raean time, the noifc and diforder ftili increafing, Andrea was much troubled for
Jannetin, not being able Co imagine whac foould be che caufe of fo rauch ftir. Buc ac lengch
having fene one of his fervancs, cercainly Co know che occafion of chis Tumulr, he broughc
him word, chac ehe Count of Lavagna had raade hirafelf Mafter of Genoua; ehae the Re¬
publique was in extreara peril; that his Gallies were full of his Eneraies; thae che people re-
founded all about the word of ia^urfj, and the narae of Giovanni Lodovico; chac furious
men ran up and down with Arras in their hands; thac there was nothing feen but blood and
flaughter; and that every where was talkingof outrages againft rhe Nobles, and menaces a-
gainft his life. So dreadful a relation perfwading Andrea that the matter was paft remedy,
he refolved to accend ehe violence of his Enemies in his Palace, and eo yield Co chem whom he
could not refift. But his wife, and his fervants, with their tears, intreatics and reafons, raade
bim at laft refolve to let himfelf be carryed down into his Palace-yard, where chey fee him
on an horfe wich much ado; in ehis eftace ehey conduded him eo Mazona, which is a Caftle
belonging to a Kinfman of mine, and from thence to another place, where they underftood
the death of Jannetin, with which he was fenfibly touched.
</p>
<p>In the raean time the Confpirators ftill advanced their defign; and whereas this noife and
Tumult had awaked every one, all the Count's particuUr friends having heard the people cry,
Long live the Count of Lavagna, went forth with Arms in their hands to fee what the mat¬
ter was, and co joyn chemfelves wieh him j and araongft the reff Doria, the French Marquis,
and I, who by chance lay together that night, going alfo forth to feek the Co««f, met fome
thirty paces from my lodging, Giralomo with all his Troop, who fought for hira as well as
we. All the people, that took his pare, required to fee cheir Dehverer; but though chere
was crying every where, Long live the Count of Lavagna, and that every one enquired af¬
ter him, yet no body anfwered thereunto. This filence raade us fear forae difaflrous fuccefs,
yet did It not raake thera give over the defign of purfuing a vidory, which feemed fo cer¬
tain. Giralomo left a fufficient Guard at the gates, and fenc Ottobuono to cake a care of che
Gallies, in cafe bis Broeher was noc ehere. The i^r*«c)b Marquis followed him, and I ftay'd
with Giralomo, who being accompanyed onely with two hundred Soldiers, went, as he
had refolved, through all the fixeetsoi Genoua, to caufe tbe people, both wich his fpeeches,
and che hcjpe of Libercy, eo rife. And though the Count appeared not, yec each one decla¬
red himfelf for him with earneftly demanding where he was. The City in che mean fpace
was in a general conf ufion and confternation; every one ran up and down in the ftreees,wich¬
out knowing whither they went; every one asked ot one another what was ehe caufe of chis

<p>In the mean cime ic was noc known where the Count vvas; they that were withG/^/^wo

was in the City; in fine, everyone thought anything fave the truth. But amongft all the

ing after him. He faw the bufinefs fo well carried, and the Vidory fo certain, as he was mad
for that he could not fee che Coune; the Gates of che Gey were cheirs; ehey were Mafters
ofehe Pore; the people favored thera ; the Nobles feemed to.make no oppofition; the Senate
had no Duke; ^Andrea was fled, and had left the field to his Eneraies; and Jannetin was
dead ; in fine, there wanted nothing but thae ehe Coune foould foewhimidt tothepeople
for receiving the Oath of Allegeance frora them. ButsllTfmw's care was invain, fothat
hearing no news of him, and feeing the enterprize ruined if he did not appear, he retired in

which was a matter ot extream imponance; and if the enterprize were ruined by his si'ftncc,
that he might have the means to fly to Marfe ill es.- This refolution was the caufe of very
much mifchkf to (firalomo; becaufe the Confpirators, neither feeing the Count, w'^o \v«
their Head, nor "Baptifla Verrin, who had been always the principal Agent in the Confpi¬

as I have cold you, ^^MhOttobuom, and asking of every one where the Coun was, ewo Ma-
riners of he Admiral, who had feen him fall, and heard his voyce which they knew very well,
as having ferved tiimbefore-tiraes, affured hira that he was dead; which having underftood
with exfreara grief, he thought it fie to corae unto us, and acquaint Gir^/^'w^e^ with it; tor as
for Ottobuonohe had loft him in the prefs. He came prefently away then, to acquaint us with
this doleful news, but having encountred, as he told us, with a great number of armed men
which iffued out ofyour Palace, whereof the Gate was broken up, he ftayed to learn what
che macter raight be; and thinking that he knew the voyce of EmiUa, whora they were
carry ing forcibly away, he purfued thera fighting even to the Port.                 r  n u u r a

<p>Ifabella hereupon remcrabred her carrying away, and interrupting Alphonfo, Behold, I^aid
fhe to Emilia, that which we could not comprehend, andthe true caufe of thstdreadlul

had been forcibly carried away, and after foe had teftified her gratitude tothe Frf«c^ Mar¬
quefs tor the luccor hc would have given her, and craved pardon of the company for her inter¬
rupting Alphonfo's relation, he continued his difcourfe in chis fort.
</p>
<p>The frfMciE; Marquefs having been a good while purfuing thofe which cmied you away,
it was the caufe that we knew not the deplorable death of the Count.till there wanted noching
but his prefence, to make an end of obtaining the Vidory : And judg,Madam, whecher there
can beany doubt ofthis verity, fince the Count being dead alraoft at the beginning of the exe¬
cution, it raay be faid that his narae alone vanquifoed all his Enemies: And certainly if be had
lived, the bufinefs had had a quite contrary event. For my part I profefs unto you, that I ftiall
never bc comforted for chis deach. Had the enterprize fucceeded ill; had any ofehe Con¬
fpiraeors becrayed him; had ehe people abandoned hira; bad the Nobles refifted him; had
Jannetin vanquifoed him; I foould fay ehae ehefe are ordinary chings, ehae ehefe are acci¬
dents, whereof there are are examples found: But Co fee a mmof twoandcwcncyyearsof
age, che goodlieft, the handfomeft, the moft courageous, the moft dextrous, the fulleftof
fpirit, and the moft generous that ever was feen, to fee hira, I fay, afcer he had contrived a
great defign; after he hadfo admirably conduded it; afterhehad deceived Andrea Doria;
abufed the whole Republique; vvas come not only to the execution, but alfo had executed
the bufinefs; Jannetm being dead,and Andrea himfelt fled away; after all thefe things. I fay,
to imagine, that this excellenc man foould tall from off a plank, and be drowned not above
three or four fteps from the Land in five food of mud, is fo un upporable to rae, Madara, as I
cannot endure the thought of if.
</p>
<p>But to teftifie unto you, that the Count alone held the Vidory in his hands, I ara but Co
to tell you the end of this enterprize. The French Marquefs had no fooner acquainted Gira-
lomo with the death of his brother, but the Deputies frora the Senate appeared. At firft,fome
would have fet upon thera, neverthelefs this tumult being appeafed, one of the Deputies ad¬
vanced, and demanded of Giralomo where the Count was, to acquainc hira wich whac he
had in charge frora che Senace; Giralomo furprized wich ehisderaand, anfwered rudely and
inconfideracely, chat he foould feek for no ocher Coune of Zrfz/&lt;i^»^ buc hirafelf, for he was
now che Coune, and ehae Co him only ehey were Co render up ehe Palace, which he ordained
ehera to do, and ehae wich fpeed. The Deputies underftanding &gt;y this iraprudent anfwer
that the Count was dead, returned back to advereife the Senate ofthe change of things by the
death of the Count. This news put thera in heart again, fo thac chey inftantly commanded
twelve otthe chiefeft of them, chac were come to the Palace, to go and arm as many of rhe
people as they could, and joyning them with the ordinary guard,to ufe cheir uttermoft endea¬
vor to chafe the Confpirators out of the City, or utterly to defeat them: But chere was no
need of fighting to put them to flight, for they were vanquiflied inthedeachot ehe Coune-
which being publifoedover all, puc one and che farae refolucion inco ehe rainds of all thofa
who had taken up arms for him. And whereas the day began to break, chey defired it flnuld
no befaid, that they had been in arms againft their Citizens; wherefore they began to retie
one after another to their homes: They which had taken arms in the Counts Palace left them
in ehe ftreees, for fear left If cheir houfes foould come co be fearched, they S have bee^

in confideration of him all the Confpirators, provided they continued ftill m ehe City. l\nfn
was chofen Co mike chis propoficion, which was scctpced, and cxecueed inftantly. So that
che break of day arriving, one would have faid, ehae ehe blood which was feen fpilt on the
ground; che bodies of chofe that had been flain; the houfes thae had been broken up; and
fo many ocher diforders, whereof che marks were evidcnc; had been the work ot an mvifible
hand. No Enemy appeared, all che Tradcfmtn were in their fliops, every man was in hij
houfe, and Genoua was never in a greater tranquillity,at leaftwife as we were told afterwards:
For as for us, as foon as we underftood of the Counts death, we went diredly to his Palace
to fave his dear Zfo»(?r&lt;!»; Doria's in:exe^ in Soprromamide hira go thither with incredible
fpeed ; and though he was Jannetin's kinfraan, yet having never affeded him, and been hard¬
ly ufed by Andrea, his love met with no very mighty obftacle to overcorae. fhefrench
Marquefs was carried rhither by his own generofity, and f by the defire I had to ferve the
Coune in the perfon of Leonora Ac fuch time as we lefr Giralomo, he had ftill fome Soldiers
about him, fo chac beleeving him Co bt in fafety enough we went eo ehe Counts Palace, fear¬

was ntit fit for her to know. She prefently difcerned by our looks the raisfortune that was
arrived unto us; but ic being no cime co lamenr, we arrefted our cears and ber fighs, and de¬
claring unco her the eftate of chings, we repre;enced unco her, thac we were not to fuffer the
Count to be outraged in the perfon of Leonora ; that her lofs was undoubted if foe ftayed
longer in this Pahce; that the people peradventure would come and fet it on fire; or it may
be the Senate would caufe it to be razed co the ground; and thit in fine it was reqmliteby

<p>Behold, Madam, what the deplorable fortune of the Co«»^ hath been; as forthe reft of
us, after wc had taken another Veffel ac y^/^f«^«4, and being puc again to Sea would five
direded our courfe for Marfeilles, our nivigstion was not nore prolpious this fecond time
then formerly it had been; for we were not tar from the Port, when as the tempeft began
again with fuch fury, as during fix days and fix nighrs vj^ were continually in expedacion ot
being caft away. Ac length a calm having fucceeded the ftorm, we came to difcover Land ;
but we were mightily furprized, when as our Pilot affured us, thac that which we faw was
the City of Marocco. Our Veffel was fo bruifed, as we refolved to land there ; and this de¬
fign being executed, the King of Marocco received os with a great deal of courtefie. Now
for that which arrived unto us there, and for that which brought us to (fon ftantinople, I
think it will be requifite to refer the relation thereof to another time: And whereas the beau¬
tiful Hipolita and Sophronia have a greater foare in it then I, you foall, if you pleafe^ learn the
fequclof our fortune from their raouths.
</p>
<p>It is without doubt very deplorable, faid Ifabella, and I can affure you, thac I have not
felt chac raotion in ray hearr, whichtheyfay isfo ordinary with every one, and caufes us in
fome fort to be comforted for our miferies, when we fee others infortunate as well as our

<p>I Sabella was no fooner awake ehe nexe day, bue che Slave, which Roxellana
' had fuborned, came and Cold her frora ehe Grand Signior, chac ae lengch his
care had nor been in vain; that after a very exad fearch, the Slave, whofe
liberty foe had defired, had been found out, and fent iramediately to/^r4-
him's Palace unto his other friends; and that the Sultan intreated flie would
be pleafed he might corae and vifit her. Ifabella not daring co refufe a fa¬
vor unco a Prince, who accorded her fo raany, anfwered, thae the Sultan
did her Coo much honor, and how foe was very glad ehae incoming Co vifie her he gave her
the opporcunicy to thank hira for the new obligation wherein foe ftood engaged unto him.
This Slave then left the Princefs, and went unto Soliman, to whora, according to the diredi¬
ons foe had for it,foe amplified//^^f//&lt;»'$ civilities, and with thatwhich foe delivered, per¬
fwaded him, that the Prmcefs might be acquainted, without any great offence, with the paf¬
fion he was in for her. In this opinion he went to the old Serraglio, with a determination to
ufe fome artifice to keep her from going fo often to vifit her friends. In che mean cirae Ifa-
bella had ufed fuch diligence in raaking her felf ready, as ftie had leafore Co go, before Soliman
repaired to her lodging, and intreac the Sultana Afteria, ehae foe would be wich her when
as the GrandSignior foould corae to fee her, as he had fent her word he would, imagining that
her prefence might ftop him from faying any thing to her that would offend her, if ic were fo
that he had a mind chereunto. Afteria, who loved Ifabella, would by no means deny her,
fo that when the SnU.m arrived thete, he found them both together; yet durft he not eeftifie

<p>SoUman bluflit at this requeft, and after he had ftood a precty while filent, he affured h.r
that ftie might^ abfolucely do whatfoever flie pUafe 1: Neverchelefs if foe would p^Trn t h
to fpeak freely mthis occafion, he would cont,;[s unco her, thac he foould be PladftiL would
not go forch every day, becaufe the people might at lengch find fomething to fay. upon feeinn

ed her to have fome regard Co the waywardntfs of the people, who peradveivuiemi-llciil!
into forae fedition,wherein her ftiends might be involved; that he did not defire fli. for.tild not
go thither any more,but only that flie fhould not goevery particular day; howfoever he allured
her that flie might do as ftie pleafed, cl .^firg rather to expofe his Empire to all thipp,c, then to
expofe himfelf to the hazard of her di plea'.ure by conftraining her in any thing. ijabelLi an¬
fwered as flie oughc to fo obliging a difcourfe, howbeit flie requefted theSulutn t) permit
her Co vific them for two or three days more together, becaufe flie had an extream defire to un¬
derftand all their adventures.and after that flie promifed his Highnefs foe would not fee them fo
often. The Sultan, who was willing to win the heart ot Ifabilta, and Co vanqufo h. r rather
wich courcefie chen wich violence, confenced eo her requeft, and the more co comply with her
alfo, he wenc away from her fooner chen he had decermined, to give her the longer time lor the
vifiting of her friends; unto whom likewife,for a greater demonftration ofhis fsvor unto her,
he fent moft magnificent prefents, as foon as he was returned to his Serraglio.

<p>In the mean time Ifabella, after foe had given thanks to the SuUana y^i?frw for her ailift¬
ance, and had increaeed her Co concinue ie eo her, enrred inco a Charec wich Emilia, and wnt
unco Ibrahim's Pal ce, where flie found a greac deal of joy for che recurn of che French Mar¬
quefs, who in his parcicular was not a little glad to learn from his friends the happy cncoanter
they had made of Ifabella, which had caufed both their liberty and his. He no fooner knew
then chac flic was arrived, but he defcended in all hafte to go and receive her: And whereas
the change of places, misfortune, and flavery, had broughc none Co his humor, he fcarcely
faw her appear before he advanced co kifs her robe; I do noc know, Madam, faid he unto her,
whecher I oughc racher co give you chanks for breaking my chains here in Co-Afi.irair.ofk, or
to complain of you for ehae you are going to give me others in making mc fee Emllm again.

knowledg to you now, that I would willingly be almoft of your humor, for in fine, be k ver¬

from it, wbeteofhc was noc forry, eo che end he might make acompleratnt in particular to
Emilia, who wichouc doubt was fomewhat joyful to fee tbe Marquefs; for although flie had
no greac affedion for him, becaufe flie was not capable of it, yet did foe infinitely efteem ot
him, and bore a gteat deal ofgood-will CO his perfon.                                                  ,

<p>T Will not renew Sophronia's forrow in particularizing unto you the lofs of Leonora fince it
1 will foffice rae eo cell you, chac her end had no other caufe but her affl.dion; and ehae heC
deftiny was fuch, as dying on che raain Sea, we were conftrained to give her the fame Tomb,
Which the injuftice of Forcune had given her illuftrious husband: Buc cogee away fpeedily
frora fo laraentable an advencure, you foall undeiftand, ehae we were no fooner arrived at
Marocco, buc we loft all chac che Terapeft had lefc us, ehae is to fay, che wrack ofehe Veffel
and our libercy. For whereas ehey knew us ae che firft fighc co be Chriftians, hardly had we
caft anchor when as chey raade us Slaves. Indeed ic is true, thae in the beginning our fervitude
waseafie enough; for as our good Fortune would have ic, theVthceis Manama, met to
King Abdalla, who raigns ac Marocco, paffed accidencally along by che Pore when as we
were raaking into it; and chis Princefs feeing our foip without fails, without rudder, the
tackle torn, the fail-yards broken, and every part of it almoft battered in pieces, flie caufed
the Charet, wherein foe was, to ftay, that foe might fee us land, and know of what Nation
we were: for the Tempeft had lefc our Veffel no raarks, whereby ie raighc be known. When
as we carae near ehe Porr, whicher ehe wind, racher chen ehe skill of ehe Piloe, conduded us,
there was noe one in the Ship which goe noC up on che deck Co behold ehis Land, where we
hoped, if we did noe find a refuge, ae leaft wife we fliould efcape cafting away: So ehae the
Prmcefs Mariama, having obferved women amongft us, redoubled her curiofity and compaf¬
fion rauch the raore. As foon as ever we touched Land,then foe coramanded us to be broughc
unco her, that foe her felf raight know who we were, and what our fortune had been. This
order having been obferved, chey led us before ehis Princefs; and verily chis firft encounter
was an happy prefage for us, and an extreara confolation for the beaueiful Sophronia,Leonida,
and Hipolita', for ehis Princefs hach fo rauch raajefty and fweecnefs, as fhe caufed in us boch
a greac deal of refped, and a greac deal of hope. And whereas foe had noced by our apparel
thae we were of i^/;, and noe underftanding chac Tongue, foe would not ftand Co fend for
an Incerpreeer, buc choughc that forae ofus peradvencurc could fpeak i'j?^»iy^, which flie un¬
derftood perfedly, and is comraon enough chroughouc all ehe Kingdoms of Fez., Tunis, and
Marocco, by reafon ot ehe neighborhood of Spain wich ehis pare ot Africa, and of che Wars
and Commerce, which in forraer eimes they have had one with anocher, efpecially before
the Kings ot Granado, who were originally Moots, were fubdued by Ferdinando and Ifabella,
And cruly foe was noc deceived in her conjedure, ibr chere was noc any of us hue fpake ie well,
or ae leaftwife could make our felves be underftood in ic.
</p>
<p>When as rhis Princefs faw ehae her defign had fucceeded, foe ceftified as much joy for ie as
we did ; and having demanded of us whicher we were going, of whence we were, and in
whae place we had been caken with ehe Tempeft ? we colfl her all chings as ehey had paft,
wichouc acquaineing her neverchelefs wich ehe occafion chac had caufed us Co pare from Ge^
noua, and wichout celling her our names, and falling ae her feec we befoughc her Co proced
us; fot by ehe refped which was rendred Co her,and by her crain, we believed foe was Queen
of Marocco. This excellent Princefs raade us rife up wieh a greac deal of courcefie; and be¬
ing couched wich che charms of chofe whom we conduded, flie cook an affedion Co us, and
refolved eo ferve us as ranch as foe could. Bue whereas flie was willing to obferve in all
things the refped which foe owed to the King her brother, foe took up Sophronia, Leonida,
and my fifter, into the Charet to her, and comraanding us to follow her, flie willed fome of
che Guard that attended upon her, to lend us their horfes. We went in this manner to Ab-
dalla's Pihce, whom we found alone with his Favorite, aWed AU-Ben Ducar, a man ofa
great fpirit, but cruel and ambicious. As foon as Mariama appeared, and that the King
faw her followed by fo many unknown perfons, and chiefly of three fair women (if my fifter
can fuffer me to put her in that number) he was fo furprized therewith, thac advancing pre¬
fendy towards her, he faid to her in her language, (as Mariama recounted unto us after¬
wards,) What adventure is befallen you? from what War are you come? what Conqueft
have you made? and by what good hap have you met with fofair a Troop? The Princefs

to concenc you and chem co, I permit you eo cake care of chem, and to proted them • and I do
withall conjure you to retain them in your fervice. You know thac all eheChriftiiisareour

Slaves: Buc whereas their beauty deferves a gentler ufage then others, give them no other
faid he fmilmg, but cords of filk to reeain ehera. My Lord, anfwered Mariama, the greateft
of all good things is Liberty, and by confequence the greateft of all evils is fervitude; thera
ar? no chains thac are not heavy, and ehe lefs chey be, the raore do chey ftraicen him that wc»«
them; In fine, my Lord, cither chey do load him, or chey do wring hira, and both the one and
the other is always grievous.

<p>It was in chis fore. Madam, that the Princefs Mariama fpake to obtain our liberty j and
that which cirried her yec more Co oblige us, was, beanfe Aly, whom flie extreamly hated,
had ac firft oppofed our deliverance wich fpeeches of gallantry. Bnc ac lengch, feeing her pet"
fift too much in her demand, he by an artificial difcourfe ccdoured the maecer with the pub¬
lique good, and gave the King a pretext to follow his inclination, by obliging ^4n&lt;«W(i to
reeain thefe three fair Slaves in her fervice. It being fo refolved chen, che Kii^ ufed them

thac howfoever if he would nocwichftanding have a ranfom of us, we defired he would be

inftantly we were conduded Co alodgng, which wis in the oucward Courc of the Palace,

on condition that they fhould fpend ehree or four hours of ehe day ae her lodging, praying them

two Xeriffes, though chey were brocbers, could noc concenc chemfelves wieh the partition

<p>their Enemies, but becaufe we were Chriftians, therefore w- fliculd be treated very gently, yea
and hope -iven us that in time we might obtain our liberty'. This refolucion taken, all ou
Soldiers and Mariners were thenextday committed to fafecuftody without any ofher ill
ufage offered unto them; and forus, they contented themfelves with leaving us under the
guard they had formerly afligned us, with this difference neverthelefs, thac we were feparated
ftom Sophronia, Leonida,ind Hipolita; for il ms Abdalla's abfolute pleafure, that they
foould abide in the fervice of the Pfincefs Mariama, and that they foould lie in her lodgings;
but with this grace forus, that wc foould be permitted Co go fomeciraes and fee eheni, or
they CO come and vifie us. This extraordinary favor having been granted to us, againft the
cuftora of the Country, by the goodnefs of Manama, whora thefe new Slaves always found
ready to render them all kinde of good offices. It is certain that this feparation was grievous
unto us, and feeing ihe terras wherein we ftood,we were almoft forry that we had not fuffted
foipwrack, at leaft-wife me-thought I obferved fuch like apprehenfions in the raindes of Ho-
ratioi^d Alphonjo: But as for the Marquis, it is to be fpoken for his glory, that never man
was fo foon coraforted as he, and I was not a little furprized, co hear him fay laughing, a quar¬
ter of an hour after we were returned from conduding theperfons, who were fo deer unto
us, tothe Viincefs Mariama's lodgings, chac the ^fnV^wi Love could cell how to ufe his
bow beceer, thenheof Europe; it being very true, laid he, that hehad never beenfo fud¬
denly ftrucken to the heart, as hehad lately been by the charms of a fifter of thePrincefs
Mariama, who Was called Lela Mahabit, onely with feeing her at a window.
</p>
<p>For me, faid the Marquis interrupting him, who had neither Sifter nor Miftrefs to grieve
for nor was afflided but out of a fenfe of friendfoip, I am not to be blamed, if, to render
my felf raore like unto thofe with whom I convetfed, I fuffered my felf to be furprized with
the paflion which poffeffcd their Souls, if I be always interrupted inthis manner,-faid Z)ff-
ria, it will be hard for me to relate this day that which you defire to know of me. Ifabella,
finding that Dijrw had Reafon, raade all the company pafs their word that they wonld not
fpeak any more until he had ended their Hiftory; fo that every one keeping filence, and Ifa¬
bella having renewed her attention, Doria profecuted his difcourfe in chis fore.
</p>
<p>Thefe new Slaves were no fooner come Co ehe Princefs Mariama's lodgings, buC Abdalla,
who vificcd chem very often, repaired chicher, accompanyed wich Aly. And whereas he
found her wich them, and that therefore they would out of refped have withdrawn, he would
nor permie it, telling them thac che name of Slave, which he had impofed upon them, was
racher an artifice to retain them about the Princefs his fifter, then a defign to keep them in fer¬
vitude. This complement was feconded by another which Aly ufed Co chem, and with a fin¬
cere proteftation made to thera by Mariama for the treating ofthcra as her fifters, rather then
as her Slaves. This fecond view yet raore augmented the love, which the King of Marocco
and Aly already bore to Hipolita; and whereas Aly was cunning and dexerous, and had out
of a fenfe of ambition for a long eirae before caken greac care co obferve all Abdalla's raoti-
ons, he quickly perceived that thebeiuty of Hipolita had Couched his hearC, and chat his
Mafter was his Rival. And whereas he knew very well chac Love, no raore chen Royalty, en¬
dures not any corapanion, herefolved to conceal frora theKing the defign which hehad in
his head. It was not long, before his fufpicions were fully cleared; for Abdalla being become
paffionately in love, and fearing left if he foould ia\k too often with Hipolita, his fifter, to
whora he carryed a great refped, would corae to know his intentions, he opened his heare
wholly to J/j, difcovered his patlion unCo hira, conjured him eo finde ouc the means to ac¬
quaint her with it, who had caufed it. Aly, as wc underftood afterwards teftified a great
deal of joy unto him, for that he being fallen in love, as he faid,"^wi'ch one cf thofe Slaves, he
had been fo happy as no: to prove his Rival. The King demanded of him chen, whecher it
were fo chac he loved any of chem ? and ehe other anfwered him wich a falfe confidence, chac
iW^ had couched his heare. Thac which obliged him eo ehis lye, was his belief, ehae by
chis mean the King would never be jealous of him, nor would fear his falling in love with hI
p^ita, beiniT perfwaded that his affedion was engaged otherwhere; and indeed thematcer
Ml oue as he imagined. TheKing gave him the condud of his Love, as well as chat of his

<p>/«A«f, the greateft of our unquietneffes was, that we could not forefee the end of our
prelent felicities, nor divine wherefore they treated us fo favorably, and yet would not d liver
us.   Howbeit we were no: long w'    Jut difcovcring it, for the King's and Ah's love ftill
augmenting, whereas gallantry feems to be natural to all the Moors, they were wilhne to re
ftore Hipolita to her former joy,bcfore they would fpeak to her of their paGion. For notwith-
ftsnding all the careffes which thefe fair maids received from the Princefs Mariama, and the
aft.dion which they carryed to her, yet melancholy appeared ftill in all their difcourfes, and
in all their adions: So that to delight them, there were nothing bu: publique tcalfs, turneys
balls, and rejoycings.   But in all thefe encounters Aly fo carryed the matter, as all th: parties'
whereof he was the Head, were, both braver, and more magnificent, then that of others'
wichout the Kings ever fufpeding any thing of his true intent, becaufe his rainde was pre¬
poffeft wich the opinion, that it was Leonida he was in love withall, and not Hipolita. And
lurely he fliould have been very melancholique, that could not have taken pleafure in thefe af.
femblies, it being certain, that nothing is feen which is more agreeable even in Surope, efpe¬
cially for dancing.   For whereas, fince the defolation of Granada, many perfons ot quality
retired to Fez., Tunis, and Marocco, though the remembrance of their misfortunes ought
to have made cliem renounce all manner of delights, yet their defire to pleafe AbdalU w/io
proteded chem, caufed them to be prefent ac all thefe feafts.   And truly I do not marvel, if
the Spaniards in conquering cheir Kingdom, though they be conquerors fevcre enough, have
noc forborn raking fome of cheir gallantries, chiefly that dance, called Sarabanda: But it
muft be acknowledged that they are but bad imitators ot chem, no raore chen we, who have
taken ic from theSpanyards; it being moft certain that they dance it in a manner wherein there
is fo much arc and grace, as we come nothing neer it.   And whereas out ofa panicubr favor
we were prefent at all thefe feafts, I reraeraber one amongft th:ireft, wherein the Maiquis
made an end of lofing his liberty by a Sarabanda, which the Princefs Lela MahaVit danced.
For whereas all the features ot tier fac^ were exctll-nr, her eyes fparkling and pafsionate, her
fliape advantagi¬ous and comely, her carriage free and ma)cffical, although the colour other
skin was not very agreeable, yet her whole perfon togenher appeared infinitely pleafing in this
Affembly, where flie danced a J'^scd/'^^^/^ with a negligcnc fo full of charms, with fo grace¬
ful a difpofition, and fo gallant and amorous an ayr, asthcMirquis wasinaminde fokmnly
to renounce his ordinary humor, and become conftant tor this Princefs.
</p>
<p>And Co eeftifie unto you, how greac an imprefilion flie raade in his heare, I only can tell yoii,
chac in four days the Marquefs, who was defirous to transtorra himfelf into the perfon beloved
as much a&lt;: poffibly he could, learned this dance fo miraculoufly, that having demanded per-
niifiiion of Aly to intermingle himfelf araongft a Troop ofGranadins, who were to dance dif¬
guifed in one ofthefe Affemblies, he charmed all the company in fuch fort, as che Prmcefs Ld*
Mahabid, who was an equitable Judg of fuch like things, would needs knowwhohev;as:
But fhe was much amazed, when as fti? perceived that he was not a Granadin, but one of the
favorite Slaves, for fo we were called ; Sophronia, Lcoivli, and/:///&gt;o//V.e were no Ic's then
fhe, to fee chac they had admired him without knowing hiro, never dreaming it fliould be n-^,
though chey difcerned him not amongft us.   In the mean time this adventure wasnotdif-
pleafing to her, for afcer thac, there pift not an Aflembly (and there was one almollevery
day) wherein he fpake not to her, wherein he danced noc befoiehrr, and wherein with his
adrefs, and accuftomed confidence, he gave her noc f kw mark of his affedion, vet without
pafi^ng chofe bounds of refped which he owed to her.   Buc whenas all chefe Feafts were
made upon defign, the King folicited Aly to fpeak to HipoUta ofhis lovc, which he did loon

<p>Inhne, after a pieparation long enough, and when as he believed that he had given futh¬

he unto her with a feeming fincerity, whereas you can never bc but his Slave, Heaven fhield

commiflion which he gave rae ; in the raean time affure your fclf that there is not any chrng
which I will not undertake for your fervice*
</p>
<p>Hipolita was ftrangely furprized with this difcourfe, for coming to confider all Abdalla's
liberahtics, and rhe manner wherein he had lived with her for a good while before, foe made
no queftion but that Aly's difcoutfe was true. Neverthelefs, whereas flie is natu;ally fufpi¬
cious and miftruftlul, foe doubted of v^/j^'s fincerity in fom^ things; howbeie foe anfwered
civilly enough coche offers he had made her; bnc forfo rauch as regarded ehe Kings love, flie
fpake CO him wich fo much firmnefs, as hc feemed co be very blank at it. It was not becaufe
he defired foe foould accepc of Abdalla's love, bue feeing in whac raanner foe refu'e^d ehe
Kings affedion, he feared left when he foould come Co difcover his own, he fliould be worfe
increaeed. And whereas H&lt;/&gt;o/fM perceived his unquietnefs; for whae reafon, faid foe unto
him.arc you afflided eo fee me refolved eo oppofe ray felf wieh all ray power againft, an affedi¬
on which you feera noe co approve of? Ic is, anfwered Aly, wich as rauch cunmng as malice,
becaufe knowing by your difcourfe, how much chac which I have ufed eo you hach croubled
your mind, I cannoc chufe buc grieve for thac the King hath pick'd out Co perfecute you, tha
only man in ehe world chac honors you raoft: Bue believe, fixx Hipolita, concinued he, chat
this unjuft love couches rae as rauch as you, and chac ehere is noC any ching which I will not
do Co deliver you trom ic. After this Aly quicced her, and lefc her in fuch an unquiecnefs, as
tbe like was fcarcely ever heard of. Noc only the Kings affedion afflided her; not only tbe
fadnefsjwhich foe had obferved in tAlfs face, troubled her; not only the incertainty wherein
foe was,whether foe foould difcover Abdalla's love to the Princefs Mariama, difquieted her;
buc ao odd and aicogecher extraordinary jealoufie pue her mind upon the rack. She did not
complain of Horatio's looking on any odier perfon ; foe did noc accufe him of infidelity, but
foe was jealous becaufe he was noc jealous: For when as Aly calked co her, foe had marked
how Horatio's eyes were ftill fixed on her, and albeic he had feen chac man encertain her along
time, yec had he not appeared the raore unquiet for it. And as it is the cuftora ot paflionate
perfons to aggravate things, according to the apprehenfions which they have, fo Hipolita had
the injuftice CO believe, chat her Lover muft needs perceive the Kings love, which flie her felf
had not known. Ifhe loved me ardently, faid foe (for foe declared it unto us afterwards) the
fear of lofing me would have raadc him fear all things; he would have taken notice of the
Kings civihcics; his liberalities would have been fufpeded unro him; I foould have feen fome
unquietnefs in his eyes, when as Alj talked fo earneftly to me: tnfine, concluded ftie in htr
heart, either he loves me not, or he loves rae but a httle; and if he loves rae but a lictle, he
loves rae not at all, fince lovc never endures any raediocrity.
</p>
<p>Whil'ft foe reafoned in this manner, Alj, who defired to perfwade the King chat he wai
inlovewithZ,f.W^ took great care that notice mightbe tiken how flie was pleafing to
him. And whexe^s Alphonfo hath not by nature fo quiet a mind as Horatio, he feemcd to us

\mso\ Leonida, buthe was vext to think that ^/; was amorous of her. Hedid notfearthat
foe would be unfaithful to him, buc hc was angry that anocher was paflionate for her; ic

<p>which ^/jr feemed co bear her; ^//,/,.«/. netted with having a Rival, though h w^n "
^tT^a^ ;t to us; the Marquefs exceedingly contented with h'avinga M l^ ^
Mahabtdwe\^ fatisfied with the Marquefs his gallantry; Horatio with a mind ind.C
enough for all that had paft; and I fofficiently contented in our misfortune, and em
with a fecrec fenfe of loy, co fee chat che beauty of Sophronia was fo perfed, as foe made her
felt be adored of all Nations.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, ehe Princefs y^^r/^w*, who hath a quick and piercing wit perceived
all che divers interefts of this Affembly: and though foecould noc difcover them perfedly
yet knew flic thac che King was in fome paflion; chat zAly was not exempted from it • that
Abdelcader her broiher did not hue Sophronia; and thn Lela Mahabid was too civl to¬
wards a Slave. This wife Princefs refolved for all rhsr,noc to n ake any foew ofall chefe things
Till flie was more cercain of chem; bue it was not long before flie was cleared therein. For
my fifter being retired with her companions, and having acquainted them with Alfs dif¬
courfe, they refolved Co advertife the Princefs/J/&lt;«r;.(OT^ of ir, and abfolutely to confide in
her vertue.   Sophronia was notwithftanding of the opinion,to ask counfel of us firft ; to thst
the next morning, according to the permiflion chey had for it, thty fenc for us.   And wfien
as Sophronia had propounded che maccer unco us, and chac I began already Co give my advice.
Let Horatio fpeak firft, faid /^«/»o/«&gt;&lt;« unto me,with precipitation enough; for if to give good
counfel one hath need of a quiet mind, it may well be faid that he is^in fuch an eftate ashe
oughc CO be, to counfel us as we fliould be.   Were it true, replyed Horatio mightily furpri¬
zed, thac I had a quiec mind, che manner wherewiehall you have fpoken is enough to trouble
it in fuch fort, as to render me incapable of counfelling others.   Since your refl is fo dear un¬
to you, anfwered fhe, as you even feek a pretext not to afsift afflided perfons with your ad¬
vice, leave us at leaftwife to think of whae we have to do.   Horatio feeing her to bitter,
■would no: anfwer her out of prudence and refped, for fear left her fantaftical humor Ihoald
appear too vifibly unco us.   As for me, who co.mprehended noching in chis difcoud', i faid
unco my fifter half laughing, chac I believed che King of Marocco^s love had pofltH d her
wieh pride, racher chen wich melancholy, if (he concinued fpeaking in chac fafoion.  But in
theend we refolved, thae thefe four Slaves fliould abfolucely confide in che Princ.fs yl/«''w-
ma, for fear left ifthey fliould noc advereife her ofthe truth of thematter, foe might hive
caufe to chink, fliould fhe difcover ic fome other way, that it was noc difpleafin:^ to chem,
fincc chey made a myftery of ic.   We conceived chic from her alone ehey were eo hif f'c
their protedion, and their liberty, and confequently that itwas requifite they foould make
all their vertue known to this Princefs; who out of fympathy and conformity, would without
doubt be always carried Co fcrve ehera.
</p>
<p>Afcer we had a long cime reafoned of all thefe chings; after thac Sophronia had acquainted
us with her new Conqueft, and Leonida with that which foe thoughc foe had made; alter, I
fay, we had fpoken of all ehis in general, Horatio, who defired to know what he was ac¬
cufed of, feparated Hipolita dextroufly from us, and having led her to a window, where (be
leaned, he conjured her to tell him what had obliged her ro fpeak wich fo much bicterntfj
untohim, ( at leaftwife he related it fo unto us,) I know full well, faid he unto her, thatl
am not faulty; but I do not know ofwhat crime I im accufed : Be fo good unto me then as
to acquaint me with ie, that I may juftifie my felt; but ifyou will have me fpeak like anot-
fendor, although I be none, let mc know what faulcl have committed, to the end Imay le-
pcnt me of ic, and amend it. You may peradventure do the former, anfwered fo", but it is

which Love infpires, you know none wichouc doubc, bue chofe chac lead Co joy.  You m-
Cirprec all chings, as you fay, eo ehe advancage of ehe perfon beloved; bue Co fpeak ™ore rea¬

now for your pare, you hope all chings, and fear noching.   Ic is cercain. faid Horatio unto

unco hope to comfort me.   For in fine, whereas the greateft of misfortunes is Co fee you m

you believed thathe entertained me with che Governraenc ofcheKing of yWrfrocco's State;
thac policy was ehe objed of our converfacion, whil'ft you could in ehe mean cime look
wichouc unquiecnefs upon the Princefs Lela Mahabid, becaufis foe danced with a good grace.
Are thefe, rigorous Hipolita, faid Horatio unto her, all the criraes which I have committed ?
Have I done nothing buc fee you talking with y^/y, wichouc divining what he faid unco you,
and wichouc afffiding my felf ae ie? No, anfwered foe, you have done noching elfe; buc

why will you have me render my felf faulty, in fufpeding you araifs ? Why will you have me

delity, and without rendring rae infortunate, fuffer rae to be in feme reft ? Would you kno Wj
faid Hipolita unto hira, why I will not have it fo, it is becaufe I do not feek in you for a Wife-
man, anda Philofopher, but for a Lover.   Love hath a Reafon, which is Wholly parcicular
unto it; reafonable perfons, who are couched wieh ehis pafsion, never abandon Vercue foe
ic, buc wiehall ehey do noe follow ehae fevere Reafon, which will have one receive wich an

<p>caufe I know how to love well, and chac I refped you. Refped, replyed Hipolita can L
bue a m.rk of efteem, and noc a mark oflove: And cell me, I pray you, by whac way ore
tend you to eeftifie yours unco me. In proccfting to you, anfwered Horatio, that you are
all my felicity ; m abfolutely remitting unto you ehe condud of my fortune; and in aflurine
you thac I would lofe my life with joy for your fervice. One may do all thefe things out of
eft em, and out of generofity, replyed ftie, bue one can never be jealous wichouc love- all
other pafsions may receive interpretaeions, bue chis fame leaves no room co doubt of the
csufe of it; and jeafoufie is cbe only affured mark of this pafsion. If I could ceafe from
cl&gt;f em:ng of you, replyed Horatio, I foould be jealous, I foould be unquiet. Say, anfwered
flie lilting up h r voycc, and quitting him, that if you could ceafe frora being infenfible, you
ftiould be a Lover. She fpake this fo loud, as Sophronia, Leonida, the Marquefs, Alfhmfo,'
and I, heard h^r, and we judged thac chere was forae lietle diforder beeween them, elpecially
when I fa w a Carnation colour on my fifters cheeks,which ufed rot to be there, and a certain
conftrained and artificial fmile, which anger always produceth in her face. Sophronia will¬
ing CO pi iy ; he good fifter in this occafion would needs know their difpute; and when ai He-
ratio had r counted it unto her, notwithftanding H»)&gt;o/&lt;f &lt;i's refiftance to che contrary, we
made their peace, after they had on either part faid all chac their wit and pafsitm could ftirnih

</p>
<p>thereupon we retired to our lodging, andthefe three fair Slaves to che Princefs y^^ori*-
ma's; where afcer che firft civiheies they befoughc her to give thera a particuUr audience.
Mariama, having granted them their dmsnd, comminded her woraen to leave her ate;
which was no fooner done, bxxi the fiix Sofhr on! a, who had in charge to fpeak in the nattie
ofall the three, requefted her to remember the promife flie had raade to proted them; and
then fiiie related unto her the difcourfe which ..^Z;'had ufed to Hipolita ind Leomda-Mt
noc able to obtain fo much confidence from her modefty, as to tell her wiehall, that Abdelca.
der hid teftified a great deal of affedion eo her, my fifter acquainced ehe Princefs with the
conqueft char Sophronia had raade.   Mariama being very much facisfied with cheir fi'eedom
and cheir vertue, redoubled ehe care and good-will which foe had for chem; and to (hew
thac fhe puc as much confidence in eh.ir difcrecion, as ehey done in hers.- and colec them fee
alfo, how much intereft fhe had to oppofe all the bad defigns of Aly, flie recounted all his
adventures unco chem, namely, all ehae I imparced coyou at the beginning of this Hiftory;
And thereupon affured them, that whatfoever came frora a fpirit fo arcificial as Alfi, was
ever to be fufpeded.   She cold chera moreover, chac whereas he did always work with tun¬
ing, he wis always Co be dele wieh in the fame manner: that to that effed, greac care was to
betaken toke^ bim from difcovcring, that they had acquainted her either with the Kings
love, or his; thac ic was likewife requifite, that Hipolita foould feem to place fome confi¬
dence inchae falfe generoficy, whichhe had feigned eohave in fpeaking to her of ehe Kmgs
love.   ^ox,fkid Mariama mto them, I Sanow Aly, he wonld never have dele in chat fort
wich Hipolita, had noC fome paflion, more powerful chen his raslice, carryed him thereunto.
Hitherto he hath never contraried the King in any tl ing; hitherco he hath affeded a blind obe¬
dience to all his will, and an exterior fidelity, which hath not permitted me as yet to revenge
the miff hiefs he hath done rae.   Neverthelefs I fee foraething in his hearr, fince the time that I
have obtained of my k\f to fpeak wieh him oftner chen I uled to do, which puts me in hope
that I ftiall finde ch^ means for ic.   In fine, brlie ve ic, faid foe co HipoUta, chac Aly hach not
declared ehe Kingslove unco you, and promifed eo proted you againft him, wichout fome le¬
crec reafon chac induces him chereunto, and wichout fome particular intereft.  But tor difco¬
vcry, we muft diffemble as well as he, and not fpeak fo feverely of the love which he laitu
the King bears you, thac wc may fee whae he wiU be ac.   Leomda, for her pare, mult enae-
vor to difcover his defigns; and Sophronia, carrying her felf according eo her humc-r ana n

that the Princefs Lela A/ahabid was her fifter; becaufe foe believed, char eieher he knew not

<p>I profefs, faid the Princefs Mariama, chac this is the fineft way of commending ones fclf
that ever was heard of. Buc, faid flie to the Marquis, how comes it to pafs, that in fo little
time as you have been here, you have fo perfedly aceained co chat, which the Granadm who
are our mafters in gallantry, are fo long a learning } for, as you fay your felf, there are things
which you underftand but fuperficially, becaufe your love to thofe that affeded them was
noc long enough. Ic is, Madam, anfwered he, becaufe I have ac this picfenc a greater defire
to pleafe, then ever I had in all my life.
</p>
<p>She thae hach given you ehis defire, faid ehe Princefs Lela Mahabid unco him, foould have
a greac deal of merie, or fliould be very much obliged to you. She hath fomany excellenc
qualicies, replyed the Marquis, as I may fay, chac in ehis illuftrious perfon I love all thofe
whoinl have loved in all my life-eime: it being moft certain, that I have never admired any
thing in all the others, whom I have ferved, which I do noc finde yec more eminently in het
whom now I adore. She is wonderfully fair; flie hach a fpirie as full of brightnefs, as het
eyes are of light; and chere is feen in her whole perfon, a charm fo powerful and fo extraor¬
dinary, chac ie is impoflible Co conferve fo much reafon, as to remeraber chac one ought not
to have any other chen veneracion for her; one rauft of necefllicy give place Co love; foecm-
noc infpire ocher choughcs; and noc working like ordinary beiucits, which makes one pjfs
from admiraeion to efteem, and from efteem co love, foe renders her ftlf ac the firft inftane
abfolute Miftrefs of all cheir fouls chac behold her. One cannoc have indifferenc thoughts for
ber; one muft, eieher noc fee her, or adore her: and from ehe very firft moraene that I behtld
her, I had all ac once both adrairation, efteem, and love. I was no longer mine own, I was
abfolutely hers; and chough I know full well chac I ara unworehy of chis honor, yec can I
noc imagine chac I amfaulcy. Ic feems Co me alfo (ac leaft-wife I flaccer ray fclf wich thisopi-
nion) chac by a parcicular priviledg, and Co render her conquefts the raore illufirious, (he pu¬
rifies all the hearts which flie enflames; thac flie dartsforttia bearaof that divinity which I

much you would make your Miftreffes modefty Co fuffer, if foe were here, fined could not
chufe but change colour ac chis exceffive praife, chough I have no part in ie. I fear. Madam,
replyed he, thac in chis occafion you cake one vertue for another; and that this change, which
hath appeared in your face, bc noc racher an effed of your greac heart, then of your modefty,
feeing ic may be you cake ic noc well, ehae a Slave fliould lofe ehe refped which he ows you,

Princefs Mariama incerrupting him, chae if my fifter will be perfwaded by me, foe foall al¬
ways be your Confident. I am not inconfidcraee enough for ehae, anfwered che Marquis; and
the thoughts of refped and adoration which I have for her, will not permit me to commit

<p>In the ra an tirae you are Co know, chac Aly had noc failed in rendering an account to the
King of the comraiffion which hc had given hira: but whereas he wa? a Lover and cunning,
he had difguifed the truth of thae which he had faid to Hipolita, and of ehae which Hipolita
had anfwered him. For though my fifter had ceftified fufficiently unco him, that Abdalla's
affedion could never pleafe her, yec he feared chat if the King fhould undertake co fpeak eo
her himfelf, foe mighc at lengch bc perfwaded; fo chae co keep him from ie, he cold him,ehac
albeic Hipolita had noc favorably received che dcclaracion which he had made her of his love,
yec he hdd ie noc abfolutely irapoflSble to touch her heart; ft having feemed unto him how
hehad obferved, thac ehe greaceft fear H//»o/j&gt;^ had, was left ehe Vxincefs Mariama fliould

you will be very ill facisfied of her, for che reafon I have cold you.
</p>
<p>tAbdalla, though very amorous, and confequently very impatient and very fufpicious, yet
made do queftion of ^'/;'s difcourfe; and remitting himfelf abfolutely to his condud, he
conjured him to remember, that on the conqueft of Hipolita all his felicity depended In ehe
inean while, albeic he had promifed Aly to give my fifter che leaft ceftimony of his affedion

unto her, it may be you will finde fome difference between the love that Abdalla hArc
and chac which I bear you: He onely loves che beaucy of Hipolita, and I adore the v ml""f
Hipohta.   He is not your fervant, but to make you his Slave ; and I do not love vou h V
marry you.   His flarae is unjuft, and mine is lawful; the end of his love is his own htlfJ^
on, andthatof mine is your glory, and your confervation. For &lt;« fne, continued he it &gt;
be true ehae you love honor, you will have fome indulgence for ehe affedion which 1 carrv r
you; feeing chere refts no other mean co warrane you from ehe violences of AbdalUS love
bue chac of receiving che fame which I offer you.   I acknowledg, faid he further to her that
I am an ill fubjed, but ic is noe buc Co be a faithful Lover, and becaufe I will not expofe vou
to che greateft miferies, which a vertuous perfon can fuffer. For, if you wilf faid he nnto
her, all che Kings love, all his force, and all his power, fliall not keep me, from protefting

<p>^ly having made an end of fpeaking, left Hipolita, for that he would not have her, faid
he, anfwer him withouc advifement, in a raatter where on all his happinefs or unhappinefs
depended. From chence he went to the Princefs Mariama, to whom in appearance he bore
a great deal of refped. And whereas for fome cime paft, this Princefs had given him more
commodity to fpeak to her then before, out of the defign foe had to difcover bis intentions
concerning him that was to fucceed Abdalla, it wasnot difficult for him to talk with ber in
private; fo that after he had protefted an inviolable fidefity tt) her, and had fworn to her,
thac nexe eo ehe glory and incerefts of Abdalla, noching in che world was fo dear to him as
hers; he cold her, chac knowing her exceeding vercue and prudence, he choughc he wasob-
liged to acquainc her, how ehe King was fo defpcracely in love wieh HipoUta, as he teared
thac his paffion would carry him eo lofe che refped which he owed Co her, in drawing him to
ufe fome violence to ehis maid: That if in chis occafion he mighe be permicced to give adver¬
tifements and counfel both together, he conceived chac che beft courfe could be taken, would
be to remove HipoUta out of the way,or to marry her; That, as her Slave, foe might difpofe
of her, wichout the Kings having any lawful precexc co coneradid her, fince he himfelf had
beftowed herionher.
</p>
<p>The Princefs received this difcourfe of AL's, as if foe were obliged to hira for it; and
akhough fhe knew not as yec the intereft which he had in this affair, becsufe foe had not feen
Hipolita; yet fhe believed that chis generofity, which appeared in his fpeech, was not in his
heart: Slie chanked him notwithff anding for the advice he had given her; promifed him to
obferve the Kings and HipoUta's adions; and then told him, thst foe would refolve of no¬
thing in this affair, without demanding his counfel about it; and that he onhis part Ihould
not fail to advereife her of all that he knew. Aly, to let the P. incefs fee that he lyed not, de¬
fired her to call to minde all che eeftimonies of unquietnefs and affi:dion, which tbe King
could not conceal in the vifits he had rendred her for fome time paft. And when as (he had
told him that flie reraembred them very well, he went very well fatisfied of her. Foe
knowing che vertue and prudence of this Princefs, he doubted not buc ehae now underftand¬
ing che love which the King bore to Hipolita, fhe would oppofe it with all her power; and
fo, if it happened ehae HipoUta fliould cell her che pr poficion he had raade Co marry her, (he
would noe coneradid it; becaufe it would be a raean to keep the King frora committing a
fault; and becaufe fhe would believe al o by this way to puc bira ouc of grace with Abdal¬
la, which he feared noe much, in regard ehae all che force of che Kingdom was in his hands;
thae all ehe Governors of Places depended on him; and chac ic was impoffible fox A bdak
torid himfelf of him, buc by caking away his hfe; whichhe ftood in no doubc of, for he
could noc imagine, that a Prince to whom he had conferved che Crown, could make him loie
his head. And afeer this manner he refolved eo make a ftiew of confiding in ehe Princefs A?&lt;&lt;-
riama; judging chae noching could arrive cherein thac would noc be advantageous to him.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Abdelcader had his defigns both of love and ambition, as we I as Aij;
and though he was no very excellent Prince, yet the defire of reigning isfo natural in men,
as ic found a place in his heare, and fo much che more ftrongly, becaufe he knew that acco u-
ing to equity the Crown of Marocco appertained to him af^r the death of his brother, cnoug

</p>
<p>Neverchelefs, whereas ac chac time ^/; had other defigns, h- never faid any thing to/f^-
delcader, which might make him hope for ought from [bim.   fiut whereas he was dextrous,
and knew not certainly whether he tbould let Abdalla's fon raign, or raign himfelf, he had
never difobliged hira, but was contented to tell him ftill. Upon the divers propofitions which
he had made unto him, that for matters regarding the State, he was noc the fervanc of the
pexfono\ Abdalla, but of theYiv:)gof Marocco; That as for him, he was perfwaded, how
it was neither reafon, nor juftice, that ordinarily made Kings, but Fortune only; And with¬
out conlidering whether foe were blind or no in the diftribution of Crowns, hc was refolved
always to ferve the State with fidelity, in the p.^rfon of thofe whom ftie would place on the
Throne of Marocco.   But in the terms wherein things then were, he neverthelefs alcered hiS
mind, albeit he bad an hundred tiraes proraifed Abdalla, if he fhould happen to dye before
hira, to conferve the Crown for his fon, to che prejudice of Abdelcader: And whereas Alj
undertook not this d.fign, but for his particular intereft, for in raaking a young King to raign,
he foould in a raanner be King hirafelf; that intereft coraing Co change, hc alfo changed his
refolution.   For after he had well examined both che Kings love and his own, he found chac
whae induftry foever he could ufe, ie would be impoflfible for hira co marry Hipolita wieh
Abdalla's confent; who foould no fooner be incenfed againft him, but the Princefs Maria¬
ma, joyning her credit and addrefs to the juft occafion foe had to wifh him ill, would no
doubt conftrain him to have recourfe to extream remedies.
</p>
<p>With fuch like thoughts it was that Alj had entertained hirafelf a good while already,when
as Abdelcader, who believed he was in love w h Leonida, and confequently hoped, that he
would excufe the paffion he had for Sophronia, came unto him with an intent dextroufly
Co learn of him whae defigns he had for chac maid , Co ehe end he mighc rule his by
thofe of a man, who, as he believed, durft not conderan that in anocher, which he fuffered
in hirafelf.
</p>
<p>All their converfation at firft was but of indifferenc chings, and of che beauty of Mariama's
Slaves. And whereas Aly was not ignorane of Abdelcader's paffion for Sophronia, he was
willing in ehis occafion co incenfe che mind of ehis Prince againft Abdalla, and wholly to gain
him Co himfelf, eo the end chit ifhe were to raake a univerfal fubverfion in chis Seaee, Abdel-
cadermiQ,ht furnifo Mm wich a precexc fpecious enough, by giving thepeople Co underftand,
chac AbdAla by a ttfta-menc, which always reraained in Alfs hands, incended his fon foould
raign Co his prejudice: For howfoever, Abdekader was Mahomet's fon, as well as AbdAla;
and albeic he was no very able Prince, yec had he no vices, fo ebac the people did not hate him!
^/y confidered further, thac ifhe foould come to extream violence, and difpoffefs Abdalla,
that Abdelcader might raign, he foould make a King, without ceafing to be one; ic being cer-^
tain, that he would have need ofhim for the Government of his State.
</p>
<p>After this reafoning which ^Z; had within hirafelf, and after an indifferent lon^difcourfe
which he ufed to Abdelcader, Co prepare hira for that he was going Co fay co hira. he gave
him co underftand. thac Abdalla, very far from approving che love which he bore ci a Slave,

be dextroufly bruted amongft the people, chac Abdalla would defraud him of che righc he

matter more plaufible, he fliould in a publique audience go and demand perraiffion to marry

delcader then toh^xm. If flie fliould be granted unco me, I fliould be excreamlyperj^ext;
for indeed I do noC defire ehe Crown of Marocco, buc co ftiare it with the Slave Sophrma.

pence which I demand of you. You miftake ehe name, faid Abdelcader eo him, and you
wonld no doubt fpeak of Leonida. No, no, replyed Alj; and ehen he declared unto him the
truth ofthe matter, and fo they parced, afeer they had well examined their encerprize again,
and fully refolved not to let a day pafs, without laboring to advance the execution thereof as
much as chey could.
</p>
<p>In the mean fpace Abdalla lived ftill in fome hope, chat he fhould be able co touch the heart
of Hipolita, efpecially fincc che Confpiracy of ^^&lt;if/c&lt;i«/*r; for che fubtle ^4/; fince thar, to
bufie his mind the more pleafingly, had aflured him, chac provided he would continue living

<p>Bue noc Co prolong ray difcourfe wieh raaccers which ate noC neceffary for you to know,
I foall cell you, ehae in four or five converfaeions ehe Princeffes addrefs was fo great, ehae flie

for ehe Kings children. And wichout being able co divine chac diey wete in forae fore Co ehe
idnnta^eoi Abdelcader, foe knew ehae if che King carae Co dye, he Would noC conferve the
Crown for his fon. That which raade Mariama more eafily difcover Alj's defigns was, that
feeing ehe civility which foe had foewed to hira forae days before, and the vertue ofthis Prin¬
cefs being more dreaded ot him then all Abdalla's authority, he had ufed certain obfcure dif¬
courfes unto her, to make her apprehend, that if foe would embrace his friendfoip, he would
caufe the Crown of Marocco to fall upon the head of whomfoever foe would. For whereas
Qaevjistheviidowof Muley Zidan, to whom of righe che Kingdom appercained, ifthey
had let him live, he thought that it may be foe was capable of the defire to remount into the
Throne of her Fathers. But that being no intention ot hers, foe feemed not to underftand any
of Alfs fpeeches in that raanner, though indeed foe raarked thera very exadly. After flbe
had throughly run over again in her mind, even to the leaft circumftances, whatfoever might
either increafe or dirainifo her fufpicions, flie refolved to advertife the King thereof But to
prepare his raind for the entertaining of forae diftruft of Aly's fidelity, flhe willed HipoUta to

<p>Abdalla following Aly''s opinion in all things, contradided hira not in this, where he
thoughc his incereft alone was regarded. He fenc Abdelcader word then, chat he tbrbad him
to think of marrying himfelf, either to che Princefs of Tunis, or eo any ocher; ehae he ffiould

thereupon, flie could not difcover the truth. And whereas HipoUta had for fome time toge¬
ther lived with the King, as flie had ordained her, fhe obferved that Abdalla perceived this
change; fo thac feeing the macter in chis eftace, flie wene one morning co his lodging, where
flhe craved fhe favor of him eo calk wieh him in privace, and the King having granted it toher,
fbe befought him co promife her, chac if he did noc give credic to whac foe was going to tell
him, he at leaftwife would never fpeak of ic again; being fully refolved noc co acquaint him
with chae fhe had co communicace unto him, unlefs he would engage his word unto her
to do fo.

<p>The King, being touched with an extraordinary curiofiey, and yet fearing that Mariama
would fpeak to him of his love to HipoUta, ftood a while without anfwering her; but at
length having promifed her as much as fhe had defired of him, ftie began to prepare his mind
with a very particular addrefs. I know, faid flie unro him, thae for chis which I am going

betrayed by a man whom you have fo much obliged will difquiee you; and whedier icbc ouc

which I am to tell you be noc iraporcane, fince bearing you all ehe retped and all the atfettion
thac I ought CO have for a Prince, who is boch my King and my broeher, I expofe my fclf not¬

And making ftiew of being raore moved with Aly's wane of refped eo her, ehen wieh his

which had been caufe of her fufpicions: but at length the trouble of this Princes raind being
fomewhac appeafed, he beleeved that Aly raight be his Rival, but beleeved not thac he had
any defign upon his Crown. Howbeie Mariama faid fo much unco him, chae in ehe end
wieh her enereaeies and reafons foe obcained of him, chae for fifteen days fpace he would do
whaefoever foe would have him for ehe clearing of the bufinefs. This Prince had much ado
to refolve upon making any doubt of Aly's fidelity, fo tar forth as Co feek oue the means of

ried hira unto it: yet was it upon condition, that ii Aly wete found innocenr, fhe (hould

Je would either convince, or juftifie his favorite: And having inftruded him in that which
ftie would have him to do, flie caufed a Guard to come in for co feizc on Aly, in cafe ehere
fliould be need of ic; and cook order for all chings fo fecretly, as no body difcovcred any
thing. The day following Aly early in che morning came co Mariama, wirh an intent to
employ all his addrefs for che clearing of che doubc wherein he was: for ambieion and lovc
gave him fo much irapacience, as he had no reft. And verily in ehis occafion the proteftion
of Heaven appeared vifibly, both to revenge ^rfn^w^i o[ Aly's cruelcy, and to preferve us.
For icis cercain, thac as ehe maccer was carried, Abdalla and Mariama had been loft; So.

Aly, and che reft of us Co be conftrained co dye in defending chem,or noc eo furvive their lofs

<p>But in fine, Aly, being come one morning, as I have cold you, to che Princeffes chamber,
and fhe having ufed as much addrefs in calking wieh him, as foe had done ac ocher times, aug¬
mented in fuch fore ehe opinion which he had chac Abdalla was dead, as noc able colec him¬
felf be any longer guided by prudence, he in plain cerras defired che Princefs eo tell him whe¬
ther che King were not dead ? becaufe, faid he, if ic be fo, ic were fie chac ehe affairs of the
Kingdom were fpeedily provided for.   Mariama, feeing fo fair a beginning co her deiign,
did noc anfwer him buc wich a great figh, and wichouc faying any ching unco him, (he led
him into Abdalla's chamber.   Now albeic he was already perfwaded chac che King waj
dead, yet lefc he not co be mighcily furprized Co fee all ehis chamber hung wich black Velvet,
all che windows fliuc, in che midll a great bed of State invironed with a baluftrate of Ebony,
fet all abouc with flaming Torches, and upon Cufoions near to the Bed, the Mantle Royal,
the Scepter, che Crown, and che Turbanc of aAlbdalla, wich his Scymiear ae ehe teet of the
Bed, whereupon was a large black Cloth trailing a greac way on che ground, which feemed to
cover ehe body of the King; fome of his Wives and Slaves were about the Baluftrade, who
teftified by their couneenance fo fenfible a forrow, as would have drawn cears from any other
bue Aly.   The Princefs having conduded him chen inco chis charaber of raourning, and per¬
ceiving chae this fad objed had (utficiencly perfwaded hira chac which foe defired he fhould
beleeve, fhe began Co fhew an excream afflidion, and Co ft queft him wieh feigned cears, that
he would perform ehe Kings laft Will, in confc ving ehe Crown for his fon, according to
the Teftamene he had made, whereof he had ehe cuftody, chough ic was contrary to the Xerijfe
Mahomet's intention.  And then, faid fhe unco him, he hach comraanded me eo reftore the
Slive Hipolita, and her fellows, Co cheir libercy; inregard iehid feemed uneo him that he
had violated the Law of Naeions in retaining perfons in flavery, who by Tempeft had been
driven into Marocco.   Buc, concinued flie, generous Aly, ehis laft ching imports not much;
nor have I cold ic you, buc ehae! would noc fail in any thing which my King, my brother,
and my Lord, hach given me in charge ac his deach.   For fo much as regards ehe Prince his fon,

rufoing into the chamber, Alj Wis fo furprized, and fo confounded, as he knew not at firft
whether it were an apparition, or whether effedively this Prince, whom he had beleeved to
be dead, was living. In fo great a trouble Abdalla without doubt had killed hira, if cbe
Princefs Mariama, who would noc have him dye by fo illuftrious an hand, had noe hindred
him; which was che caufe, chae ^/y, beingcoraeco hirafelf again, and freeing himfelf from
che Guard which would have feized upon him, opened a window when as they were noc a-
ware of ie, and whereas all the houfes of ehae Councry, as chey are here, are exceeding low,
he leaped inco the Court-yard, and was fo forennaee as he did noc hurc himfelf, bue goe fhiet
away oue of ehe Palace; leaving Abdalla fo amazed and afflided ae his perfidioufnefs, and
Mariama fo facified wieh che happy fuccefs of her defign, thae if the difplcafure of feeing
Aly efcaped had not moderaced her joy, ic would have been eoo violenc.
</p>
<p>Abdalla inftandy comraanded him cobe purfued wieh all fpeed, and alive or dead Co be
brought unto hira: But Aly was already gotcen inco a raans houfe, whofe life before eimes he
had faved. For in whac diforder foever his foul was, yet had he judgment enough not co go
to his own horae; imaginingrightly thae he would be foughc for ehere. In che mean eirae,
the fear he had left ehe King fliould caufe che gaees of che City Co be fliue,raade him feek oue all
kinde of inveneions to efcape. For albeic ttie plot which he had layd wieh Abdelcader was
ready eo be execuced, yec waneed ic fo rauch cime, as he durft not encerprize ie, efpecially
oue of ehe thoughc he had, chat chey would noc have made ufe of fo cxcraordinary an inven¬
tion to difcover his ineentions, without having taken order for all things. He fenc word
then fecretly to Abdelcader, chac he fliould accempc noching uncil he was in one of the places
of cheir intelligence, to the end they mighc be affiired of a reereac, if their affairs fliould go
iU. Afcer chae, he difguifed himfelf like a woman; for whereas chey are all vailed in thac
Country, he believed chat getting fpeedily out of the Cicy, before any exad order was given
at the gates, it would be eafie for him to fave himfelf, as indeed ie fell oue. He ehae ferved
him in ehis occafion promifed to bring him an horfe to a place, which was not above a mile
from the Town; zndi^enAly, being difguifed in the manner chat I haverelaccd, wene out
of ^4r«;cf&lt;» a very hede before the Guards had been placed ac che Gates, with a Command
to fuffer no body ro pafs ouc upon any precexc whatfoever. In the mean fpace Abdalla had
fene eo fearch for Aly in his Palace, and afterward caufed ic Co be proclaimed over all the Cicy
</p>
<p>thac whofoever could bring ^/y unco him fliould have a recompence able to enrich him for

and manitelting their fecrec hacred uneo him, plundered his Palace; and chis wrecched man

whereas ehe people arc inconftanc in cheir refolueions, afcer ehey had commieeed an hundred
oucrages, there ran a bruit amongft chis mukitude, that Abdattu was dead; and that che pro-
clarattjon which had been made was an arcifice of Aly, who meanc co difcover by this fidi-
on, whether he were beloved,or hated. And whereas all extraordinary noveleies eafilv find^

<p>who taking che fame horfe which ehe other had made ufe of before, he went to ore of the
gates to get forth, but hehad the like fuccefs as the former; who, willing to hazard all for
Aly, fenc a third perfon thither: which was the caufe, that one ofthe Guard, who had more
brain then the reft, perceived, that although three feveral men bad prefented chcmlclves for
to go ouc of che City, yet it had been ftill with one and the fame horfe; fothat hecrtainly
believed there was fome myftery in this adventure, and how it might well be that /j/rwas
not far off.  This Soldier having imparted his thought to him that commanded the gat., he*
conceived chae his opinion was noc ill grounded ; wherefore, to clear himfelt therein' he
made fhew of being perfwaded by the intreatics of this man who d-fired to be let forth;
buc whil'ft to gain time he made yet fome new difficulties, he fent for three horfes, to the end
he might follow him a far oft'with two of bis compai i:;ns; which were no fooner come, but
having lee him go out, and fet them elves to follow rim, they faw thac contrary to thecuftom
c f all fuch as tear co be followed, he went on ftill without turning his head to rhe place from
whence he parted, fo great a defire he had to arrive where the unhappy W/7 waited for him.
Seeing then that they might follow him without his b-ing aware of it, they approached netn:r
to him, then they would have done if he had behaved himftlf ocherwife, and quitting the
high-way as weil as he, when chey came neer eo a wood, whither chis man feemcd tohavea
purpofe to go, they efpyed a woman, who having difcovered them, hid her felf in the thickcft
of thebuflies. This adion made him,that was carrying the horfe to ^/;, turn about his head;
who knowing that he was followed, would have tak.n more on the left hand, and nut have
gone to the place where he was attended • but this trick would not ferve his turn; howfo¬
ever it was not becaufe thofe which had obferved her believed that this woraan was effedive¬
ly y^/y, buc being neer unto ic, ehey would needs know cercainly whac ehis adventure was.
The Captain then, having given order to the two Soldiers to feize on chis man, went to the
place where he had feen che woman hide her fclf, and had noe gone fifty paces bue he found
her ae ehe fooc of a tree; where, keeping down her vail ftill about her, fhe befought him, in
counterfeiting her voyce, not to do her any violence.   And when foe faw chat this man had
no incenc to ufe her civilly, and feemed fully refolved eo difcover whae foe was, foe would
have cempced ehis Capcain wich che hope of a greac recorapence; fo chae fuddenly lifting up
her vail. Thou feefl, faid flie, the infortunate Aly, r^ko can ma^e thee happy if thou bee}
Vpije; for if thou VciU refolve to let me efcape, I \VUlput thee in a condition that thou fhdt
never need to atk. any thing more of Fortune.   This Captain, who was faichful, or it may be
did noc believe chae Aly in ehe cafe he was in could recompence him as much as he faid, an¬
fwered him, chae he would never enrich himfelt byalreaion, and wichouc further delay he
called his companions, who, having eyed cbe man, on whom ehey had feized, Co a tree, went
to help him co cake the miferable v^/7,who,though without A'ras,left noc off rt fifiing them tor
while.   Buc ac laft ehey broughc him co Marocco, and having conduded him before At-
dalla, rhis Prince reviled him wieh all imaginable reproaches.   And whereas Aly had always
been happy, chis one blow of unhappinefs fo mightily furprized him, as chac judgment and

would never difoblige Ibrahim if forae raighcy pafllion did noc force hira ro ic. In fine, ehe
love eo Ifabella was chae, which begac a hope in her heare of deftroying a man, whom fhe
did noC hace, bue becaufe he was eoo generous, and chae foe would raign alone. And where¬
as foe faw eliac if//^^^'//^ wene every day oue of the Serraglio, ie mighc come to pafs that

the Muphti had advertifed her, that the people began already to murraur at ir. There needed
no further raatter Co oblige Soliman co a ching, which he defired far more chen flie. Buc
whereas che fear oi iifpleafing Ifabella was fo much che greaeer, as his love was che ftronger,
he could noc refolve, noc only Co forbid her frora going forch, buc Co fee her chat day wherein
flie foould receive this order; neicher knew he whac perfon co chufe chac raighc deliver chis

<p>My Lord, faid &gt;4/m.« uneo him, haeh thy Highnefs forgot what chou faidft Co her yeftcr¬

I will noc raake a prohibicion which concravenes che civilities I have ufed Co her, buc I would

<p>This news ftrangely furprized all this fair Troop; but whereas the precexc, whereof M-

</p>
<p>This hope failed not to work the effed w hich Ifabella expede-,.rora it; all this company

that they were ferved there by the Grand Signior's order exceeding magnificently, their exile

faid Leonida to her, will needs know it, I ftiall make advancage of it if you will take the

Ih-otcencimes gave him ehe pleafure to hear her jeer his Rivals in his pnfence, and an ^o- \

content, then che extream love which he bore her feemed to permit; for, as I have heard it
faid, this paflion feldom leaves any greac tranquillity in the Souls of thofe whom it
poflcffeth.
</p>
<p>B\it fox Alphonfo, he was che moft generous Lover that ever was; his inclination had not

loved ofher ; flic cook care not Co give him any caufe of jealoufie; his very Rivals ferv, d for

render him contented, Lt onida, to affure her felf yet further of his love, would not (c much
as let him make ufe of his friends for the motioning of their marriage. In fo happy an eftate
methinks it is hard Co imagine whac could crouble his felicicy, efpecially when llball have
told you, chac Leonida ufed him ftill as favorably as before, and wichouc any change arriving
in her, yec ehere arrived a change in him. I well perceive, concinued Sophroma, atccr (lie had
been a while wichouc fpeaking, thae you cannoc divine whac ic was which croubled Ahhoii.
fo's happinefs; and cercainly I cannoc chink ic ftrange, feeing accoiding to my 1= nie this ad¬
venture is fo extraordinary, as ic is impoflible Co conjedure ie. You fliall underftand then,
thac one day Alphonfo being gone to fee a kinfman of bis, whereas the perfon beloved is a part
ofall converfations, and a man infinitely amorous fpeaks withouc choyce and judgment othis
Miftrefs Co everyone, became tofpeiV.oi Leonida ctJ his kinfman, chough eo fay truth hc
was noc worchy of chac honor j for chis man is boch malicious and blockifo; According
then to his humor and ftupidiey he rudely asked of Alphonfo, whether he beleeved that he had
been che firft which ever had been affeded of Leonida ?
</p>
<p>Now whereas Alphonfo had been a long cirae in che voyage, frora whence JtifUnim
broughc him back, hc had underftood nothing of what had hapned to Leonida, for being fallen
in love with her prefently after his return, no body had been fo uncivil as to fay any fuch thing
to him. It was noe, as you fliall know by ehe fequel of ehis Hiftory, becaufe ehae which ar¬
rived unco Leonida was noC glorious for her; bue becaufe love is a paflion ebac renders the
fpirit fo fenfible and delicaee, as ie is irapofllible to hear ehae the perfon whom one loves,
fliould have affedion for another, without fome fenfe of grief. And verily Alphonfo tryed
it but Coo well in this occafion; he beleeved at firft notwithftanding, that this was an effeft
ofehe malice ofhis kinfman, who regarding his fuccefsion, had perchance a defign co do what
hecould for che rendring z:tfo«tV&lt;» lefs amiable: but when as continuing his incivilicy he had
told him, ehae one, mmedOBavio, of ehe Houfe of the Tallavicins, and who was dead
fince, had in cimcs paft loved her, and chac he had been infinitely loved of her, he did not be¬
leeve ehae chis man durft have cold him chings fo precifely, if ehey had noe been crue.
</p>
<p>Atkn^ih Alphonfo, having made his vific, recired with fome unquietnefs; neverthelefs,
whereas he had noc yec loft his Reafon, he did noc find chat he had any caufe eo complain ot
Leonida, fot chae ftie had been loved ofO^lavio, or for that foe had loved hira in a time when
as he was not known to her. For, faid he, I ftiould be unjuft eo defire, ehae ehe ^V" of ^^a-
nida fliould noC have begun Co raake Conquefts before chey capcivaced rae; and 1 foould be
unrcafonable co defire alfo chac flie fliould have been abfolucely infenfible of ehe affedion ot a
man, who ic may be was of more worch chen my feP. Now whereas Love is ingenious to
torment thofe which are under his Empire, Alphonfo did noe complain of having a Rival, thac
had noc been haced, bue for chac Leomda had made a fecrec ot ic eo him: This unquiecncis was
noc for all chat very ftrong, buc you foall underftand by che fequel of ray difcourfe, that ic
carried him co another, which puc him to a greac deal of pain.

briefly all that befell you till the tirae of his death; ocherwifcyou will give rae ciufc to cora-
plain of you. Leonida would not at firft accord to Alphonfo that which he defired of her;
for as foe knew how highly her heart had been touched for O^avio, fo foe knew likewife
thac ie would be impoflible for her Co remember all chcir felicities, and all iheir misforeunes,
wichouc a greac deal of unquiecnefs; wherefore foe excufed herfelf from icas much as fhe
could; neverchelefs feeing ehae Alphonfo cook ehis refufal for a wrong, fhe promifed co grant
bim his defire, fo ashe would give her fome eirae; and in chis fore many days paft away,
Alphonfo being unable co make her keep her word wich him. Bue ac length, his curiofity be¬
ing grown the ftronger by Leonida's refiftance, hc teftified unto her one day fo ferioufly, that
he foould hold himfelf difobliged by her, if fhe continued in the refolution which fhe feem¬
ed to have, as having appointed him a tirae to come to her for that purpofe, foe refolved to
content him. If one had then demanded of Alphonfo why his curiofity was fo ftrong, he
could not have told, at leaft-wife he hath acknowledged fo mut^toLeonidaf\nee: For
whereas he was perfwaded that foe had loved oElavio, both by that which his Kinfraan had
told him, by that which he had alfo learned other-where concerning it, and by the marks
which he had feen of ie in her couneenance, if in her fpeech neverchelefs foe had difguifed che
truth, thatiying would have given hira a great deal of unquietnefs j and yec hc felc In his
heare, that if contrarily foe foould avouch unto hira, that foe had loved hira very rauch chis
difcourfe would not pleafe him. But at laft, carryed by a fecret raotion, which he could' noC
refift, he went with an extream impatience to the affignation which Leonida had given him
He found her more fad then ordinary; for whereas her imagination was filled wich difpleafl
m^idea's, that charming and jovial ayr, which foehachufuillyin her face, was fomewhat
changed. After foe had caufed Abhonfo to fit down, and had told him, that foe was going
to render him the greateft proof oT her affedion chac he had ever yec received, foe was readv
to impare uneo him whac her fortune had been, when is Alphonfo, before he would give
her leafure foco do, conjured her once again noc Co omic any pare of all chat which bad arri
yed unto ber. But he had no need to intreat her thereunto, for Leonida had no fooner began
to fpeak but forgetting that foe was recounting her Hiftory to her Lover, flie fuffered her

<p>nally; that this fpring-ng fovc fti dd one day be the caufe of his death, and cif rrtfol
ny tears; and withouc dreaming ofany fuch thing, the pleafore alone of feeing one anoth i
and talking together, took up all our Souls. We knew not as yet for all that added Z
what thofe thoughts were which we had one for the other; neither did we peoive
them, till decency would noc permit us to fee one another fo often. The privation ot a eood
makes us know the greaenefs of it, and the defign which we had to conceal our affedion be¬
gan to make me fufped that there was fomething in it more then good-will: I did then all
thar I could to difengage my minde ftom a paflion, which I had always heard to be vry dm
gerous; but whereas it was more ancient in me then Reafon, Reafon was not ftrmg enouch
to chafe it ou: of my Soul; but contrarily it was foe whxh engaged mc further in it^and ihat
fpeaking to m-; of OUavio, drew the pidure of the worthieft man that ever was. She told
him moreover thac, which flie felc in her hearr, whenas by any reafon of honor, or bufinefs,
he was conftriined to bc abfent from Genoua; the fraall delight foe took in Affemblies whcti
he Wis not there; and how rauch flie enforced her felf to feem merry during his abfence. She
acquainted him alfo, howexad'Off&lt;«z'/o wasin following her pleafure in all things; what
care he ufed to take from her all occafion of fufpeding his fidelity; and with what difcretion
he ftill demeaned himfelf towards her all che time ot his ferving tier.
</p>
<p>But, faid Alphonfo incerrupcing her, had you never any of thofe petty diforders, which
augment love, rather then dirainifh it? No, no, anfwered Leonida, OHavta re\tx gave me
caufe CO complain; befides, our affedion had no need of that artifice to render it the ftrong¬
er ; fince it is certain thac^jever any perfon loved more perfedly ehen we. Alphonfo would
fain have affured Leonida, chae he loved her yec beecer ehen OUavio had loved her, but his
minde was fo unqu'ee,.as he could fcarce fpeak. And then again, Leonida gave him not lea-.
fure Co do it; for fhe was foaeeencive in exadly relacing all chac had paft beiwi\iOUavio
and her, as fhe never took heed ofall the feveral changes which her difcourfe made in his
face. She continued chen celling him, chac afeer an indifferenc long love, OElavio, having ob¬
tained permifllion ot her eo demand her of her parents, believed that his happinefs was fo fure,
ashe had no doubt at all of ic; for whereas his Faeher and hers had always lived as good
friends cogecher, and cheir forrunes were equal, hecould forefee no imped imene in it. But
he knew noc, faid Leonida ehen looking on Alphonfo, that a paffion lefs noble then that
which raigned in his heart oppofed his; and that avarice, which is lar raore powerful in the
mindes of old raen, then love is in that of young folks, flbould deftroy his and myhopes,and
fliould finifh our love by his death, for to fetrie a grief in my foul, which I foall conferve chere
eternally.
</p>
<p>In fequel hereof, Leonida likewife declared to Alphonfo, that one named Livio, of the
Family of theFrigoz.es, a raan very rich in che goods of fortune, but very poor in thofeof
the minde, being touched with her beauty, without any thought of difcovcring his affeftion
toher, or gBining her favor, went the very fame day that he fell in love with ber, and de-..
manded her of her Father; prefcribing him no other conditions, then thac ot giving him his
daughter; and thae this old man, who knew Liviu's wealth, being more mightily touched
wieh ehe love of riches, ehen Livio was with the beauty of Leonida, had promifed him to
beftowed her on him, and had engaged his word to him in fuch fort, as nothing was able- to
make him break it.  So that OElavia arriving an hour alter that Livio was gone, and making
his propofition, he was wonderfully furprized to learn frora Leonida's Father, that he had
promifed his daughtar, and thac ie would be in vain for him eo hope he raighc make him
change his refolucion.   Ollavio could noC apprehend, ehae Leonida could be promifed to any
one, andfliinocknowof ie; and on che ocher fide, fi\d Leonida to Alphonfo, my fidelity
wasfo well known cohira, ashe durft nor doubc of ir.  In fo deplorable an eftate, con-
tinned flie, he left ray Father, and came and found rae out at an Aunts of mine who ta-
vored our affedion, and where I had appointed him to come and acquaint me with the an¬
fwer he ftiould receive.  But O Heaven 1 cryed flie, I did noc forefee chac this fencence
fliould be chac of OBavio's deach, and of ehe lefs of all che felicicy ehae I attended from it

<p>After chis cranfpore of affedion, foe recounced unto hira all ehe refiftance^ fhe had made a-
gainft her Parencs pleafure; her griefand defpair, whenas foe faw ehae neicher her prayers,
her rears, nor her reafons could avail; the pain foe was in not to grant OBavia the permiffion
to fteal her away, or to rid himfdf ofhis Rival; and fora conclufion, foe acquainted him,
how the tyranny of her Father, and the confideration of her honor, having forced her to a-
bandon OUavio, Co raarry Livio, foe faw her felf in fo deplorable an eftate, as that which
would have made up the bictereft grief of another, was her onely confolation. For, faid fhe
to Alphonfo, I had no other in ehis encouncer, ehen Co know chae I raarrycd a raan whora I

I was noe refolved for my own glory Co live well wichhim, buc becaufe I had ac leaft-wife

foould be, che more he would foorten my days.   Judg chen, faid fhe unco him, if thefe

</p>
<p>Buc in ehe end, faid Alphonjo unto her,'you raarryed Livia? %es, infwered Leonida
wich cears; and the infortunate OEiavie, unable to refolve to fee me in the poffeffion of an¬
other, departed from Genoua to go and feek for the death which he found foon after. For
although I had done an hundred things beyond what was fitting, to oppofe my felf againft my
Fathers will, yet he believed with reafon, notwithftanding he knew thac I loved noching but
him, chae feeing I could noe bc marryed wichouc mine own confenc, I foould never have

able a chought, defpair feizing on his foul, he went to the Emperors Army, and arrived

<p>Leonida, having finiflied her relation, and wiped her eyes, thanked Alphonjo for the fad¬
nefs which appeared in his countenance; imagining chat it was an effed of the compaffion he
cook ot her paft misfortunes. But foe knew not, that che fame which foe believed to be a fenfe
of pity, was one of the moft violent jealoufics thac ever an amorous fpirit was tormented
With. For he fo ftrongly perfwaded himfelf that Leomda could noe have the fame appre¬
henfions for him, which flic had had for oaavio, as he went away from her, with an af¬
flidion che like whereof was never feen; yet he lefc her wichout giving her any notice there¬
of: but when he was come home, and had fout himfelt up alone in his Chamber, he ran over
all thar, word tor word, which Zf(Si«/^.« had told him, for ehey had made fo powerful an
impreffion in his Soul, as I think there efcaped noc fo much as one ouc of his memory. The
more he confidered the maccer, ehe more was he confirmed in his jcaloufie. Hc remenibrcd,
thac fhe had loved 0&lt;57^'://&lt;7, outof fympaehy, ouc of acknowledgmene, and ouc of reafon;
that cheir affedion began from their infancy, and continued all their life. Now, faid he to
himfelf, OElavio is not dead in the heart of Leonida, he lives there ftill in defpite of me, and
in fuch a manner as I cannot chafe him from chence. He is noc onely dead Co keep mc ftom
being revenged of him, buc he is alfo dead co raign eeernally in her foul. For, added hc,
quice cranfported wich grieF, infortunace Alphonfo, Leonida loves chee noc neicher buc for the
love of him; chou knoweft it ftom her own mouth, and thou canft not doubt of thy unhap-
pinefs. Ah how wretched I am, continued he, and how imprudent have I been in laboring
mine own ruine my felf 1 if I had not been curious, I had been the happieft of men, and I
have rendred my felf the raoft infortunate that ever was. Thae which I have feen, that
which I have heard; the cears of Leonida, her fighs, her fpeeches, and the marks of love
and cendernefs, which fhe hath rendred to the memory of OElavio, have not onely deftroyed
my prefent pleafures, and all thofe which I hoped for, but alfo my pleafures paft. I no longer
marvel, continued he, if Z.foW&lt;&lt; iil-intreats my Rivals, it is for the afoes of O^-J^"* that
fhe hath this refped and this fidelity, and noc forme. O b\e^ed OElavio, cryed he, how
worthy of envy is chy fate, and how unhappy is mine 1 This fantaftical jealoufie got fuch
deep rooting in his heare, as he loft all reff, and almoft hs Reafon. He wifoed fomecimes
thac OElavio were ftill living, Co ehe end he might be revenged of him; and by and by after
in another quite concrary thought he confidered, thae if he had been living Leonida had never
loved him, and in chis manner he was in forae fore glad chae he was dead. Soraecimcs lil^e-
wife, he comforced himfelf for ehae Leonida had noc loved OElavio fo much as to marry him
againft the will of her Parents; but then when be came to remeraber che laft mirks of af¬
fedion which Leonida hid received from Octavio, and whac refentment foe had teftificd tor
ic in relating it to him, he entred into defpair again. What can I do, faid he, that can ever
perfwade her that I love her as well as Octavio ? When I foall tell her, that foe raigns in my
heart; ehae her will may difpofe of mine; chac flie is abfoluee Miftrefs of my foul; and m
conclufion, that I live noc bue for her alone; wieh one onely word, foe will fee Octavioi-
boveallchatl have faid; for celling me thac he dyed co eeftifie his affedion co her, isco telJ
me, chac he hath incomparably done more then I; chat he raigns always in her minde; and
that I can never precend to the firft place.                                                          .u,„„f.

<p>cranfporcs; and demanding of himftlf whit he defired of Leonida in this occafion ? he knew
not very well what he would have; but chefe good intervals lafted fo lietle a while,as icmighc
have been laid thac he had no reft ac all. Ir 1 had a Rival, fa d hc fometimes, I ftiould fpend a
pare ofmy an^u fo in feeking occafion ro hurc him, and co fet him ac odds wieh her I loved,
and whom he foould love; I foould obferve cheir adions, and knowing chem, I foould make
ufe ot them, t icher Co crouble cheir dcfigns, or to advance mine, or co cure me of my pafsion.
Buc as the cafe ftands, I have a ftcret Rival inthe heart of Leonida, whom flie entertains, I
not knowing, nor being able to hinder it: She weeps, foe fighs, even as foe is talking with
me, for this bleffed Phantofm, which foe loves ftill, and ever will love, fince he is no longer
in a condition tobe able to do any thing that can difpleafe her. As for me, faid he, I am in far
other terms; for I can eafily difpleafe her, and I cannot be agreeable unto her, but becaufe I
referable OElavio. Who ever faw, continued he, fuch another thing ? I am jealous, and yec
I have no Rival; I am beloved, and yec I am noe happy; and chrough an excravagancy of my
deftiny, or ofmy huraor, I foall never be; \et Leonida do whit fhe wiW, icis irapofsible chac
ever I fhould be fo. For fay I foould raarry her, ie would always run in my mind, thac if by
a miracle OElavio could rife again, foe would abandon rae for hira : Yea and I beleeve, added
he, that if foe could buy his life with my death, foe would content unto it wieh joy.
</p>
<p>This deadly ehonghe feized fo ftrongly on Alphonfo's hearr, as ehere were cercain moraencs
in which he had as much hatred for Leonida, as he was capable of. For whereas ehis extra¬
ordinary jealoufie agitaced all his pafsions, and principally hace atid anger, noc finding a nearer
objed co employ them upon, he had for her no doubc very different choughcs^ and wholly
rtplen focd wich violence. Love remained neverchelefs ftiU vidorious over all ehe reft, orco
fpeak more rightly, all thofe feveral pafsions were but effeds of thae fame.
</p>
<p>But in the end, after Alphonfo had fpent forae days in the entertainraent of his anguifli of
raind, without feeing Leonida, che excreara love which he bore her, carried hira eo her
whecher he would or no. He haeh cold her fince, ehae being gone ouc of his lodging, wieh
an incenc Co walk in forae place ouC ofehe way, chae he mighe mufe by himfelf beceer chen at
home, and exadly run over all the favors which Leonida had conferred on him, to the end
he might compare thera.with thofe which OElavio had received frora her; he acquainted her,
Ifay, that againft his purpofe, and without being aware of it, his fteps conduded him to her
door, where he ni fooner was, but without coniulting whit he was co do, hc knocked chere,
and underftanding that Leonida was wichin, he wene up diredly co her charaber wichouc ad-
vercifing her of ic, though ie was noC his cuftom fo eo do; for Leonida feldora ever faw him
ac htr houle, when foe was alone ehere; bu: at chis time Alphonfo was noc in a cafe regulatly
to obferve good manners. When as Leomda firft faw him, flie received him fomewhat cold¬
ly ; tor whereas he had been a good while without fending to her, or enquiring after tier, ftie
thought it was buc juft to ufe him fo.
</p>
<p>hskox Alphonfo, how difordered foever his mind was, yet durft he not make ftiew at the
beginning ot chat which he had in his heart; for refped and Reafon had fo much power over
him, as he could not refolve to difcover his foffcring to a perfon who caufed ir, until he ftiould
be extream ypreffd thereunto by her. After Leonida bad received him fomewhat coldly,
arid had obierved the change which jealoufie had made in Alphonfo\ face, the anger wherein

It IS as eafie for you to reftore tranqu llity unto my Soul, as it was eafie for you to deprive me

jealous chac ever was. I donor underftand you. fi\d Leonida tohim wich more coldnefs

Buc cake heed Alphonfo, of leaving me long in ehis fufpicion, for fear left, whereas I am
proud and difdainful, I do not prevenc you, and it be too lace for you chtn co have recourfc

</p>
<p>Alphonfo, furprized boch wieh Leonida's difcourfe, and the manner wherewich foe fpake,
refolved at lengch freely to tell her the caufe of his grief. I know very well, faid he unto her,
that I am going to fpeak in vain for my felf, and indeed it is rather out of defpair then Reafon
that I am carried to obey you. Know then, continued hc, that I am jealous, and that I (bill
be fo eternally, fince the Rival that furmounts me in your heare can never dye; for eo conceal
the truth from you no longer, the bXt^tdO^avio is eheobjedof my jealoufie. The tears
which you flied for his memory are the caufe of thofe which I ihall pour forch all my life time;
the fighs which you fetch for him,fl:iall always make me figh;and his paft felicicy foall b^et the
mifery of all che reft of my days. You have loved him fo much,coneinued he,and yon love him
fomuch ftill,ehat I can find no place in your Soul: Hc muft raign there alone,for indeed you do
not fuffer me there but only eo conferve the memory ofhim the better. Ah cruel man! cryed
Leonida hearing him fpeak in this fort, ts it pofilible that you have the inhumanity to open the
Tomb of OElavio to perfecute mc ? and in ftead of weeping with rae, or at leaftwife of be¬
moaning and comforting ms, you are fo audacious as to give ms marks of your hatred to a
perfon, whom I have fo much loved, and whofe raeraory is ftill fo dear unto me; and yet in
grateful as you are,faid flie to him, you owe ehe afftdion which I bear you to that Httle refem¬
blance yon have with OElavio; bue as this inforcunace creacnre hath been the caufe of ie, ^o
fliall he likewife give an end co ic: for in regard of ehae which you have faid eo me, I ordain
younever to fpeak co me,and never to fee mc more. Why do noe you foue your fclf up then
in OEiavio's Tomb, anfwered Alphonfo,fvnoe you can love none bue him ? Reply no fureher to
me, inhumane thae you are,faid flie to him, and take from my fighc ehe petfecutor of Leonida,
and the enemy of OUavio.
</p>
<p>Alphonfo feeing Leonida in fuch choller, and not able to give her a good reafon, either tor
the maintainir^ of his error, or for che obtaining of his pardon, went away more jealous then
before. Alas, faid he to himfelf, how fenfible flie is on that fide I what a powerful mark tl

flie would have caken pity of my weaknefs; flie would have given rae fome new proof ot

concrarily ic augmenced it; for he bdeeved chac Leonida did noc abandon Genoua, bue co be¬
wail OEiavio with ehe more libcrey.   This thought for all that was noc the moft powerful in
his heare; the impoffibilicy of feeing Leonida, redoubled his defire of ic, and lovc being

But no fooner did che Phantofm of OElavio prefenc ic fclf eo his imiginacion, no fooner did fee
all the tears and fighs of Leonida to remembrance, buc he re-encred inco his former furies.
He made an hundred irapoflible wiflies, which deftroyed one anocher, and led a very irkfom
and melancholick life.   Daring thae time he wroee divers Leccers Co Leonida, according co
the divers thoughts wherein he was; buc when as foe perceived fo great an inequalicy in his

neverthelefs, thac ac the firft time he fpake to her he moved her eo anger, and the fecond cime
he moved her to pity.   What is the reafon, faid he to her wieh cears, ehae I can neicher con¬

<p>It was much after thig fore that che firft conveifaeion ended, which Leonida and Alplmfo
had Cogecher ae^ Marocco. Buc whereas Leonida affeded him, and faw the eftate whereunto
this fantaftical jealoufie reduced hitn, fhe opened h r heart to me, and having asked my advice
what flie fhould do, I counfelled her, I think, as flie defired to be, and as indeed was juft.
I cold ber chen, chac flie was eo do all that foe could to fet his heart at reft I that thiscapn.
chioufncfs proceeding raeerly from an excefs oflove, fhe was to pardon fo bad an tffcf, fince
ic came from fo noble a caufe, and labor Co reftore his Reafon to him, which foe bad deprived
him of. I agree wieh) ou, faid foe uneo me, thae Alphonfo is eo be eafed, but in what man¬
ner do you think I may do ic I* if he were jealous of theFrench Marquifs, of Doria, or of
any ocher, ic would noc be ditficule for me to fatisfie him. The coldnefs which I would (hew
to them, fhould foon fee him ae reft; and if ehere were no ocher raeans for ir, I would de¬
prive my felf abfolutely of cheir company co preferve ic; bue as ehe cafe ftands I know no
remedy for ie. Ie is from my felf thac Alphottjo hach learnc the affedion which I have born
to OElavio, I cannoc unfay ic; and if I fliould be fo bafe as Co fwear co him chac I have noe
loved him fo much as he imagines, I fliould cell a lye to no purpofe; it being very certain that
he would give mare credic to my tears, then to my latter fpeeches; and then again, that is
a ching I could never do. Counfel me chen, continued fhe, how I foall carry my felf. I
profefs unco you, that I was chen very much perplexed whac counfel co give her, for 1 faw
no affured means chac could cure Alphonfo.- Neverchelefs after I had mufed a little, my opi¬
nion was, thac the only thing which flie could do was, eo endeavor eo perfwade Alphonft,
thae fhe loved him as much as fli; hid loved Octavio, as indeed, I chink I did not oblige her
to tell an untruth.
</p>
<p>At firft Leonida told me that this would ferve to no purpofe, bue finding nothing to (land
with more reafon, flie refolved eo follow my advice: So chac the firft time foe could fpeak
with Alphonfo in private, his melancholy ftill increafing, foe demanded of hira, whether be
were refolved to live long in that manner ? Truly no, anfwered he, tor I do not doubt, bnc
from the mi'ery which I feel, deach will come ftiortly and deliver me. Is it not poffible, fud

<p>How unjuft you are, {i\d Leonidauntofim, to fpeak to rae thus 1 howfoever, fince I am
refolved ro try whether I can draw your rainde out of that diforder, whereunto this ftrange
jealoufie bath carryed it, proraife rae, that it by my difcourfe I can let you fee, that you
have received more teftiraonies of ray affedion, then I have given to the infortunace Octavio,
you will then repent you of your error, reftore tranquillity to your foul, and leave raine in
reft. Alphonfo, after he had withftood it a while, in faying that foe propounded an irapof¬
fible thing to hira, and by confequence he wasnot to anfwer unto it, refolved for all thac Co
hear her, and promifed her ehae it foe kept her word with hira, he would crave pardon for
his fault, and would live better for che fucore. Afeer ehey had raade ehis agreemene j cell me,
Alphonfo, faid foe unto hira, if I can raake ie appear eo you, ehae fince ehe day wherein I
permicced you to ferve me, you never have had occafion co complain of me; and if lean
foew you, ebac ehe unhappy Octavio, if he were living, mighc wich juftice accufe mc of
lietle affedion; would you noe have reafon ehen cobe contented? Thae will not be enough,
anfwcrcd Alphonfo, for it may be that you have never given me juft caufe to complain, and
that you have given Of?&lt;ix'io occafion foto do, and yet forall that I cannot be happy: Buc
that which 1 defire is, you would let me know, that you have not done any ching for Octa¬
vio, which you would noc have done for me, and chac I chink will noe be eafie for you co
perform.
</p>
<p>I will peradventure foew you yec raore, xepXyed Leonida, and Co begin Co cure you, is ie
not true, Alphonfo, that che original of che affedion which I bear Co yoa, is far raore advan¬
tageous CO you, chen ehae which I have born Octavio ? when I began eo wifli him well, con¬
tinued foe, I was in an age, wherein perchance chac which I chen called love, was none-
wherein I counted for great fervices petty things, which now I fliould not regard; and
wherein I aded without knowledg, and without judgment. I, faid Alphonfo interrupting
fier, but not without inclination, which is that which renders affedions the ftronger and more
durable. I agree with you therein,faid foe untohim,but howfoever I had this indinaeion in an
age, wherein ac h'ft ray reafon did noe corabae with ir, for I had none at thae cirae. Thac is
the caufe, faid Alphonfo why ie is fo well fecled in your foul. And chac is che caufe, replyed

for indeed if I had known how to love perfedly, I had not raarryed Livio, I had not aban¬

fwers ; ie foall fuffice rae chen co fay, that afcer an hundred odd precaueions, co affure himfdf
of theXove of Leonida igiin^OElavio's phancofra, whereuneo chis amiable creacure ouc of
her goodnefs anfwered ferioufly, he recurned co Reafon, and cercain days after craved pardon
of her for his error, and abfolucely proraifed her never eo fall inco ic again.   1 believe noc¬
wichftanding ehae he was noc fo foon rid of ic, and chough he haeh noe fpoken Co Leomda
fince of ic, becaufeic was one of cheir condicions. yec he hach noe for all chac lefc off having
raany eiraes very odd choughcs.   This difpuee and chis peace were fo fecrec araongft us, ehae
I was foe alone who was acquainced wich ic; and chac was ie which perfwaded Horatio and
the reft, ehae Alphonfo's melancholy proceeded from che jealoulie he was in of ehe affedion
which///y feemcd eo carry to Leonida; bue indeed ic was thac which I have declared un¬
to you.
</p>
<p>The Marquis feeing ehae Sophronia hdd her peace, and chaC Leonida was going Co fpeak,
as if foe would have excufed Alphonfo: Iemuft be acknowledged, faid he, thac there is a
marvelous diverficy amongft men; and thatwhich makes rae moft to wonder, is eo fee by
example, ehae Alphonjo, who in all ocher cncouncers haeh a greac deal of wic and difcrecion,
and would in indifferenc raaccers wichouc doubc chink che fame things chac I do, fhould fall
inco an iraagination fo far diftant from all good fence. I think, anfwered Leonida fmiling,
thac in raatter of love, it raay be faid that you are both of you an objed of adrairation and
wonder the one to che ocher, hue wieh chis glorious difference for Alphonjl, chac his fan¬
taftical jealoufie was noe derived bue from an excefs of paffion; and chac your inconftancy
proceeds noe bue from a defed of love.
</p>
<p>If che very excefs of Reafon, replyed ehe Marquis, comes near to folly, I bdieve chat ehis
excefs of love IS noe far from ie: and if ie be crue, chac byeheefl^cds one may judg of che
caufe, acknowledg, fiix Leonida, chae this inconftancy, which you call defed ot love in me
gave you noc fo much unquiecnefs, when I abandoned you for anocher, as chis excefs of paf¬
fion haeh been che caufe of to you; and confefs withall at leaft, that icwerebeccee cobe
loved of a man of my humor, then of chat of Alphonfo. It would be more advantageous,
replyed z;««,^4 very roundly, becaufe as long as one foould not beloVed hue by an incon¬
ftanc man « you are. one foould noc be expofed eo ehe hazard of too rauch engaging
ones felt m this affedion. And then again, condnued foe, there is this difference becwixl
you too, chad have cured ^/;,^.«/'. of his error, and that nothing can cure you of yours.

<p>I confefs, faid Sophronia laughing, as well as the reft of the Affembly, that in this ncr.fi.n
I am of the Marquis his fide, for / cannot but follow Reafon wherefoever / meet with it   /
perceive, faid Leonida then, that all the world abandons rae, and cl.ac/ have need of"//

ed the Marquis, to go and fetch him my felf; and faying fo, he went and called l^M,„r/
Who was almoft sftiamed to corae unto che Company again, making no queflion but tliat tbej

untohim, as long as/am on your fide, yoUwill haveno Enemies which you may'not over

me angry with you.   / believe you to be too juft, replyed he, for me to fufped you of any

and thatby this means/ fhould bcthe ciufe of condemning a vertue in you, which makes
one to be commended in all che world befides.
</p>
<p>If we engage our felves in making of'Corapleraents, faid Sophronia interruprit^ bim, the

chac he cannoc cell us any thing but whac will delighc us. I do not know, anfwered tbc Mar¬

</p>
<p>The Hiftory ofthe coo gooi Slave.
</p>
<p>N Ever was any fo happy in fervitude as I, and never did happinefs produce an effed like
unco chae which lam going eo recounc unco you. You remember wichouc doubr,
that when we arrived all at ConftantinopU, and landed at the Port, there was a man, who
lightly imagining by the chains we had on us, rhat we were deftined tobe fold, and finding
foraething in my perfon chat pleafed him, bought me for the price chae was demanded of
him. This raan, who was ray firft Mafter, carried rae horae to his houfe; and whereas he
was one of the raightieft men in Con (I ant inopU, Iwas comforted in my raisfortune tofee,
thac ae leaftwife if I were a Slave, it fliould be in a place where I foould have corapanions.
I was no fooner come thither, but to teftifie that he had fome indination for me, he caufed
the chains that I had on me to be taken off, to give me lighter; fo that defiring to be ac¬
knowledging for this favor, and render my flavery alfo raore eafie, by raaking ray fclf be be¬
loved of thote, who raight ill-intreat rae, I becarae in ewo hours ehe beft Slave that was in
Confiantinople. I did not only that which was ordained mc, but I alfo helped others Co do
that which had been commanded them. Andwhereas it is the cuftom of theTurkj, as I
learned afcerwards, carefully to obferve all their new Slaves at their firft coming, my Mafter
was a witnefs of all the fervices which I rendred him, and feemed Co be fo facisfied with m/,
that all the other Slaves began already Co hate me.
</p>
<p>The firft day being paft over in this fort, che next morning my Mafter would needs have
two wives thac he had CO fee rae; he coraraanded then that 1 foould go to their lodging, and
whereas I knew noc whither they led rae, I was fo furprized with their beauty, as I could
not forbear teftifying a great deal of joy by ray carriage at it. I found them fo much the
fairer, becaufe for four and twenty hours before I had feen none buc black Slaves; I fabted
them then very civilly, and beheld them at leaftwife with as rauch aeceotion, as ehey had in
confidering rae: and wichouc regarding whecher ray Mafter cook ic well or no, and wichouc
remembring chad was a Slave, I choughc of nothing buc of raaking foew with low obcy-
fances, as ofcen as I could judg by their behavior that they fpoke of rae, chae I was as re-
fpedful for chem, as I was ferviceable and diligene for cheir husband. Bue ae lengch h^ com¬
manded rae Co wichdraw, which prefently I did; erue indeed ie is, ehae ie was noc wichout
turning back my look to the place where I lefc cwo fair women, and Cruly I felc fome pain in
feparacing my felffrom th!m.
</p>
<p>I was no fooner gone down, and had done fomething which had been enjoyncd me, but
I went with all fpeed into a back Courr, upon which the windows ofthefe womens chamber
opened, out ot a hope that I might peradventure fee them again : But by ill fortune ray Ma¬
fter was there as well as they; fo as having obferved that I had nothing to do ehere, I cannot
etllyou whecher he fufpeded the truth or no, howfoever without having any caufe Co com¬
plain of me, he commanded me to be conduded the next morning to che Markec where
Slaves are fold, and that there they foould rid themfelves of me at any price whatfojver. I
nuft confefs to you that this change forprized rae; neverthelefs whereas I comforc my fclf
eMy, as you know, in all things, I refolved for patience.
</p>
<p>He that next bought me was a Merchant oiTripoli, whom I ferved as exadly as the ocher:
And whereas in thefe kind of houfes the reftraint is not fo great, as in thofe of perfons of qua¬
lity. I had fome content to fee that in ferving my Mifter, I foould at leaftwife have ehe fa¬
tisfadion to raeec fometimes witha wife thac he had, andtwoGrf^ Slaves that ferved her,
and that certainly did not foime their Nation. I got their good-will che very firft day, with¬
out being able to tell you how I d^d ic. If they faw that I hid a purpofe to go forth, they
went in all hafte to open me the door; if I carried anything, they prefently offered co help
rae; in condufion I won theit inclination in foch fore, as my Mifter hated me for it. For
when he was withdrawn to his chamber, his Wife and the Slaves praifed rae fo rauch, as out
ot jealoufie and covetouinels he refolved to be rid ofme. He feared left his wife would love
mc too wdl, and that his Slaves would agree together with me to rob him
</p>
<p>In this thought, he conduded m.'himlUf tothe Market; buc whereas he was known to

<p>In this opinion no body bought me the firft day, nor on the fcond neither. Howbeit mi;
Mafter, having obferved that his Wife and Slaves were very gbd tofee me brouRbthome
again, he purpofed to part wieh me for lefs ehen he had incended. hoping ehereby to be the
fooner nd of me. Bur I.e confidered nor, that ouc of ehe opinion tbe world had of him the
lefs he fliould ask tor me, che more he would be croubled to fell me. And verily there was ne.
ver any pleafantcr thing, then th^ choller of this covetous wretch when as he could noe refolve
to lofo his money, and was conftrained in the evening to carry back to his houfe a man, whom
he beheld as his Rival, and yec had no caufe to complain of him. For whereas I was noc
Ignorane, thac Slaves in this Country are at cheir Msfters mercy, the ftarof fome crofs ad.
venture made me very prudent, fo chac as long as my Mafter could fee me I did noe anfwer
che complacencies of his Slaves. Wherefore noc being able either to fdl me, to complain of
me, or to refolve fo give me my liberty, becaufe he would noe lofe bue a parr of rhe
money he had given for me, he was in an unquietnefs which I im noe able co reprefent unto
you.
</p>
<p>Bue ae laft on che third day a Boluchbajfi, who had cheapened me when fitft he would have
fold me, and who imagined that I could have no other defed ehen of being uofaithful,
tempted by ehe good peni worch, refolved to take mc into his fervice. And to fecurc himfdf
from the vice whereof be fufpeded me, he purpofed to employ me in his Garden, untill fuch
time as he had made tryal of my fiddicy. I was then conduded home Co his houfe, where I
no fooner was, bue having given me wherewich to labor the ground I found myfclfatfiift
fomewhat troubled. Neverthelefs whereas I had whil'ft I was in the Wars helped many
timesoutof a bravery Co aft up Trenches, and raife Fores, I became in cwo hours fo good
a Gardiner, as I levelled an Alley betcer then all they of Conflantinople could have
done.
</p>
<p>My addrefs having pleafed my Mifter, he broughc three Wives thae he had, followed by
all cheir Slaves, Co fee my work, which ehey admired; and paffing from tbe commendation
ofmy work Co chat of my perfon, chey faid eoo much for ei.emfclves, if ehey took any plea¬
fure in feeing me. Neverthelefs ic was noc chac alone which made me change my dwelling,
buc ic was for chac, my Mafter being gone a lictle way off, and ehae I faw all ehefe women

refolved to fell me away, which he did the next day witha great deal of rfgcec, becanfe I
pleafed him excrearaly.
</p>
<p>Itwas my deftiny to be bought by an/^r«?^/^«Phyfidan; for whereas he had asked co
whac eraployraent I had been put in ray Mafters hou'"e, and bad been anfwered that I was an
excellent Gardiner, be iraagined that I knew fome Simples, and confequently might be nfe¬
ful to him, by reafon the Phyfick of this Country confifU much thert^n. In effed, he ac¬
knowledged that be bad n§ver been ferved more diligently ; and ajb-it I was very ignorant in
all the things that he made me do, yet my addrefs and confidence fupplyed thae defed. This
Phyfician had ewo daughters, who having loft their rapther lived alone wieh him; fothat
whil'ft he was in bis vifits, I had fometimes tbe pleafure to fee thero. For whereas the wo¬
men ofC&lt;"»/?'««/'«&lt;'/'/^ are very curioas oftheir beauty, thedffifetfeey hadtogainme, to ike

thac I had to do cbe beft tl»ey couW.
</p>
<p>I had no fooner made an end of whatfoever the Arabian Phyfician hsid commanded me to
do at his going forth, but I went to entertain his daughters at a lattice window that was very
low, and teach them new means to become f«if, whkhl fakd I had learnt in Italy ; fothat
when ray Mafter carae home, he never found me araongft his effences: yet he could not cora¬
plain of rae, beaufe whatfoever he had ord*ined me eg dp, was always performed. He iraa¬
gined then, that fince I wasfo diligent, he wu to give me more employment, for fear left
ouc ofidlencfs I foould have coo much converfaition wirh his daughcers; bue whereas chey
were dextrou«, they percdved his defign, fo as finding that tobulie me, befides neceffary
things he had left nie great ftore of Grite roots to prepare for the Bacbs, which are fo frequent
in th« Country, they made me give them part of item; fo chat all three vvorking,the bufinefs
was quickly dirpatched,and we had tirae enough bdides for converfation: Info rauch thae my
Mafter coming horae in tbe evening, wich an opinion chac he fliould find me very bufie, and
a belief tbat he had wee wich an excellenc cxped;&lt;nt to keep rae from eneercaining his daugh¬
ters, he wa» ftrangdy furprized to ftc mc Isbor ao more then I was wont to do. Neyetchdefs
hs could not refolve to quarrel with me , having never been fo well ferved as

<p>In this unqaietnefjs he itootk a new refolution, which was to en/oyn mt to wait upon him
in the ftreees, and toiegve himin my place who was ufually to accompany him. Buc ehefe
maids were no kfs witey in this occafion thtn the other; they won this Slave with money
and dealc in fiich fori, as wben we came home, there was nothing done of all that had beeri
ordained him ; and this out of the hope that their father would alter his mind, and not carry
rae any more abroad wirh bim. This flight nocwichftanding wrou^t that which they ex¬
peded tiot; for the Phyfician, feeing that when he carried me abroad with him, none of his
worli was done; and that when 1 ftayed at hc«ne, hisdaughtersalwaysfentforme, refolved

<p>Now you muft underftand, chac ehefe cwo JanizarUs had each of them a fair Slave • and
that as long as I was wich them, though they were both of one company, yet were thev ofa
different Squadron, fo chae ehey were noe boch upon che Guard at one and rhe fame day bv
vvhich means one of them always remained ae home, as it were the Guardian of the tw^
Slaves. In the mean cime I acquieced my fdf admirably of the employment had been con-
f.irdnnm.-; and never had their Arms beenfo wdl ktpr, as fince the time that Ihadbecn
in their f rvic ■. But if they were contented with me, no lefs were the two Slaves though I
contribured nothing rhertunto: For by reafon of that which I told you in the beginning I
was never k(s above , then inallthtfe feveral encounters, albeit I was never fo much^be-
lovf d. Thefe fair Slaves did not for all that teftifie unto me both at once the good- will thev
bore me; and out of a particular addrefs they chofe thediy whexeinthefar^iz,aryth3ii\\i
their M.'ft'.r was upon the Guard, fo chac he which ftayed ac home very well perceived the
care and coraplacency which his friends Slave had for me ; but whereas he was contented with
my fervice, andfiw that i contributed nothing thereunto, be did not advertife him of it.
1 he fame roafon which this Soldier had, tbe other had alfo; and by this means I was for fome
time equally beloved of both the two fanizaries, and ofthe two Slaves. It hapned at
1-ngth, that by order of War thefe two fanizaries were put into cne and the fame Squadron,
and thereby would have been conftrained to leave rae alone with their Slaves, being obliged
to go upon the Guard the farae day, had they not bethought themfelves of telling one ano¬
ther that which they knew concerning the good-will thefe Wenches bore rae. Wherefore con-
fidering how they were equally intereffed in the bufinefs, they difputed a good while betwixt
themfelves what they were to do. At laft,though they loved me exceedingly,they fdd me that
very day, not being able to refolve to leave me alone with their Slaves.
</p>
<p>The fantafticalnefs ofmy fortune fo wrought, that a Mufician ofthis Country, who tacght
to play on the only Inftrumenc which they have at Confiantinople, and that holds fomewhat
of the form ofthe Lutes of/^-j/y, took me into his fervice, and carried me horae with him.
The next day after my coming chicher, when he was gone abroad, I rook one of thofeTari^i/J
Luces (for he had many of them,) and whereas this Inftrumenc hath buc one ftring.I thought,
thac if Icould put more toir, ehis Harmony icmay bc would pleafe my Mafter, and might
obcain my liberty.  I cook one of chofe Lutes then fecretly, and going toone ot thofe that
makes them, who dwelt hard by rhis Muficians houfe, and whom! bad by chance taken
notice of as I came thither, I direded him how I would have it done.    At length I made him
fie this Luce for feven ranks ot ftrings; and whereas I bad ftill one of thofe enamelled Gold
rings left, which are worn rather out ot galliniry. then for their value, I gave it him tor pay-
men: ofhis pains.   Being returned home, I put ftrings to this Lute, and beginning to touch
it, I drew to me with my harmony my Mafters wife, two fifters that he had. and three
Slaves.   So thae when he returned, he found me in the midft ofall thefe women, who barken¬
ed to me wieh a greac dealof delight and attention.   Ac firft he was angry,both with them.and
with me; but coming to hear me himfdf, he pardoned thera their curiofity, and hoping to
gain good ftore of money by my means, he careffed me extraordinarily.  He undertook not¬
withftanding to maintain againft me, that in fomething thdr Lutes were more perfed then
ours; becaufe, faidhe, having but one ftring they can never be outof tune.   This pleafant
reafon being noching hard eo be deftroyed, I raade bira eafily comprehend, thac ray Mulick
was beecer then his; and che very nexe day he carried me coall cbe houfes, whither he ufed
to go; where they had no fooner heard me, but chey would hear him no more.   This man
being as proud as he was covetous, although I raight have got him a great deal of money, yec
could he noe refolve Co carry me any more along wieh him ; fo ehae purpofing eo learn eo play
as I did, he lefc me ae home; and mornings and evenings only I took him out Ldlons.  But
I was noc long boch h'S Mafter and his Slave ; for whertas' hc was \o lefs jealous then proijl,
knowing thac his Wife, hisSiftets, and his Slaves, did nochir:g buc barken to rae, ouc of a

<p>This laft paffion bdng the ftronger, he foughc to rid himftlf m-; and had fo niuch malice,
that to keep me from teaching fome other that which he would not learn of rae himfdf, he
went to fdl me at the Port, where I was prefently bought by theCapcam of a Galley, who
wasupongoingforth to fcour the Seas. Iconfsfs. that this adventure vexed mej for confi¬
dering that I kityoUi\\itConflanti»opU, without kno wing whither I went, I wasoutof
quiet above an hour at leaft; howbeit I hoped to meet with foms good fortune which I did
not forefee; and in this thought I ferved my new Mafter with as much care as I could, yec;
was I not long wich him, for whereas he was avaricbus, and had no need hut of one Slave,
that could row, he was perfwaded that he might fdl rae for fomuch, as he raight therewith
get two in ftead of one ; fo that all the endevor which I had ufed for cwo days fpace, Co
foew hira ehe greaceft addrefs I could poflibly exprefs, ferved noe buc Co raake me be fold a-
way ehe fooner, and to give mc a Mafter of an higher condition then thofe laft I had had ; for
whereas the price which he asked lor rae was great enough. I was no longer cheapned but by
perfons of quality. The Cadilefquer then of Natolia becarae ray Mafter, and to his houfe I
was carried; but from hira I parted a little after for the like reafons; ehen was I encercained
by ehe Muphti; and ehe next day after I paft into the fervice of the Aga of the fanizaries,
where they chat fought tor rae by the Grand Signior's coraraand found rae. Indeedie iscrue,
that I lliould not have been long ehere, for / was Co have been fold away again the very
fame day.
</p>
<p>In conclufion, after I had had for my Mafter a great man of ehe Pore, a Merchant of Tri-
poU, an Arabian Phyfician, two fanizaries, a Piaycr upon the Luce, an African Captain of
a Galley, the CadtU I attcroi Natolia, the Muphti,ind the y^^^i of the fanizaries; after,
I fay, I had eqjally fatisfied them all, Forcune ac laft reftored ms eo libercy. And cruly I was
noc a little obliged to het for fo far complying wich my humor, as not to lee me wear cha fame
chains long; ic being raoft cercain chae I foould have been dead wich grief, if fhe had ufed
the raaecer ocherwife. For is ic credible, coneincd the Marquis, chac a raan, who could not
live long under ehe Empire of one onely Miftrefs, whofe dominion is incomparably more
gentle ehen a Merchane of Tripoli's, could have lived long under chae of an imperious Ma¬
fter? And CO fay all in a word, icis eafie Co be iraagined, chae if I had ftill worn but one
chain, ic would have feeraed very heavy eo rae, feeing even bracelets of hair would incommo¬
date me if I foould wear them long. Change is the charra ofall pleafures, and the eafe of all
forrows. There is not an evil, how lictle foever ic be, chae would noe become infupportable
tome, if I foould always endure ic afcer the farae manner; nor is chere any which I fhould
noe bear wich pacienc-, if it were noc always ehe fame. For in fine, whecher it be for the
pains of che body, or for the pains of the minde, one cannot pafs from one evil Co another,
without fome moments c f reft. Change hath this marvellous in it, that in pain ic fdf, mau¬
ger tbac which we hei, it diverts, ic eafes, and fortifies us. And of what humor foever we
be, wc chink not fo much of the evil that is arrived to us, but thac we have fome joy for
that which hath left us.

<p>You are Ceo dcquent on this fubjed, faid Leonida interrupting che Marquis, and if I might

isnoc contrary either CO common focicey, or ehepubliqac good. For never haeh any incon¬
ftanc man precipitated himfelf; never hath any inconftanc raan killed his Rivals, nor ill-in-

Conftancy that makes Lovers unhappy, but Fortune, that delights to perfecute Vertue • and

<p>The Third Boo\,
</p>
<p>WHil'ft this agreeable Corapany endeavored to forget their prefent misfortunes, by
remerabring chofe which ehey had avoyded; Ifabella was in an extraordmiry melan¬
choly, although foe was as yet but in the apprchenfion of an evil thac was co arrive uneo her.
Every cirae that foe heard her charaber door open, flic always bdieved that Solman was
corae to difcover his unjuft palTion to her; and every cime chac ehe Sultana cAfteria wenc
frora her, ic feeraed to her that foe abandoned her to che Sultan's violence. There were yec
fome eiraes wherein foe conderaned her own thoughts; and wherein Emilias fpeeches gave
her forae confoladon. Thefe good intervals for all that lafted not long; and how conftant fo¬
ever Ifabella was, flie was always nearer to defpair then to tranquillity. On the other fide,
SoUman Wis in no lefs pain; his love, his vertue, and his irrefolution upon chae which he
was Co do, put his Soul into fo great a diforder, as he then raeritcd to be as rauch lamented,
as blamed.
</p>
<p>But at length, whereas it is hard to confenc to the rendring of ones felf unhappy for ano¬
thers feiidty, and to renounce things out of generofity which one ardently affeds, Soliman's
Reafon being combated by his own defires, by a violent paflion, and by ehe Artifices of Rox¬
elana, it found it fdf in the end fo weak, as he abfolucely refolved ro fpeak eo Ifabella of his
paflion. I know very well, faid he Co himfelf, chat chis is Co becray the friendfliip which I
have promifed Co Ibrahim; bue I know wiehall, that ic would be ehe beeraying of my fdf,
and che caufe ofmy deach,if I foould bereave my felf of che hope which I have of prevaiFng
one day wieh Ifabella.
</p>
<p>In ehis refolucion, Soliman wene Co the Princeffes charaber on a tirae when as the Sultana
Afteria was Corae frora her, and ehae none buc Emilia was wich her. When as firft che Prin¬
cefs faw hira, ftie changed colour j and Soliman on his pare, who very ranch refpeded her,
and thac ftill loved Ibrahim, thought Co alter his refolution; and in chis fore, fear eroubling
IfabeUa, and refped filencing SoUman, they were a while unable to fpeak to one anocher.
The SnUan was he ac laft ehae began ehe Converfation, in craving pardon of Ifabella for che
conftraine wherein flie lived. My Lord, faid foe unco him, fince ic concerns the quiet of thy
State, I dare not murraur at it; and though the privation of ray friends be a difpleafnre fen-
fible enough, I do endure it without coraplaining of thy Highnefs; I do accufe Fortune, and
do juftifie Soliman, who without doubt will never be bue equieable. Would Co Heaven, faid
he unco her, I raighc be fure chac you would fpeak chus always 1 My Lord, replyed fbe, chis
is a ching which will abfolucely depend on chy Highnefs; ie being moft cercain chae I fliall ever
be reafonable, and not be fo inconfidetate as to think ought to ehe difadvancage of ehy Majeftyj
if I be noc conftrained chereunco by chy felf. I could have wifoed, xep\yid Soliman, chat
wichouc excepcion you had promifed rae never co chink araifs of rae; for it may be you will
learn from mine own raouch ehae I ara faulcy.
</p>
<p>Ifabella blufot at thisdifcourfe, and cafting down her eyes without daring Co look any
more on Soliman, and being unable Co anfwer him, foe was a pretey while in this incertainty s
but on a fudden, Soliman, carried away by his paflion, refolved to difcover it nnto ber. I
know full well, faid he unto her, chat I ara going to deftro/ray felf; that in acquainting you
w-ith ray thoughts, I am going to raake you hate rae; but I would fain have you edl rae.
added he, before Icontets ray crime unto you, whether an error, which is not voluntary,
merits as rauch chaftifemcnc, as a preradicaced malice i» My Lord, infwexed Ifabella all
perfons that hive great Souls like thy Highnefs can never commit faults but voluntarily There
IS nothing that cm force Reafon whenone willmikeufeof it; andthe raoft violent paffions
withouc doubt are but the pretext of weak ones, whenas chey will excufe che bad adions

my crime, I will acknowledg, divine Ifabella, chaC I know being your Protedor, lought
not Co be your Lover; chjt loving Ibrahim as I do, I oughc noc cobe his Rival; thatre-
fpcding you as I ought, I fliould not ufe ^ny difcourfe Co you thac offends you; that loving

this, that lovc never fh;;ws it felf, either greater, or more perfed, then when it deftroys
friendfhip, forces Reafon, and wic/iouc confidering either honor or glory, carries us to dye,
or Co mike our felves be beloved of ehe perfon whom we adore. This, incomparable Ifa¬
beUa, is che dhee whereuneo you have reduced my Soul; buc if nocwichftanding I maybe
permitted to eraploy Reafon for che obliging of you to pity, remember thac you would be un¬

<p>Great Prinos, replyed//^^.//^, ou.,hc to be fenfible of piry, but they never ought to put
theraklvcs into a condition of being the objed of it to others: Neither will I be drawn to
beleeve that Solimm hath a thought fo unworthy of hirafelf. For, ray Lord, how can I
think that thy Hig'm \ will ftab a Poignard into the heart of Ibrahim, after thou haft faved
his htr f* if -t foould be fo, ic hi- better, both for him, for me, and for thy Highnefs, that
he ha \ bee n left to languiOi in his irons, or to dye of melancholy, then to fave him for to kill
hm the more cradly. Lee thv Mai'efty confute wdl with thy fdf, and thou wilt find without
doubc, thac thy hea. t agrees noc with thy m-utn; that thy words betray thy thoughts; and
that/^r.ii!;/w is yet mire powerful imhySoul, then the fatal beauty of Ijabella. No, faid
Jo/iW4« interrupting her, do not juftifie me in this fort; fince in rhe terms wherein I ara, I
have no other defign, then to lee you know, that I am the raoft faulty of all raen, in perfwa¬
ding you, that I am the moft amorous. Ah, ray Lord, faid foe to him weeping, doth not
thy Highnefs confider, that at this very time ic may be, wherdn chy Highnefs ufeth fo ftrange
a difcourfe unto mc, //^r^/;/&gt;w is fifghing with thine enemit^s, is hazarding his life for thy fer¬
vice, and focddiog his blood tor a Prince, who mikes rae foed tears, and who widiout doubc

</p>
<p>Soliman being moved with fo prefling a dilcourfe, ftood a while without anfwering ihert-
unto; but at length his paffion ftill furmounting his vertue in this occafion; I know, faid he
unto her, that Ibrahim's life oughc to bc dear unto me; but I know wiehall chat mine oughc
to be confiderable co me: and I am certain, chac whae exploits foever he can do in Perfta, I
have done more yet in confideration of him. I have foughc for him againft my felf; I have
felc my felf in che flarae withouc daring eo coraplaipi; love and friendfhip have corn ray heare;
and I know no corments fo terrible which I have not endured fince the firft inftant that I faw
you, rather then to do any thing againft the affedion which I bear hira. But being corae to
the terms, either of dying, or fpeaking, I chofe the laft; and fo rauch the rather, becaufe I
do not think but a man, who could abandon you at Monacc, to corae uneo rae Co Conftan"
tinople. Will eafily enough refolve co quie you, for che faving of a Princes life, co whom he is
indebced tor his own. Ah, my Lord ! cryed Ijabella, if Ibrahim be faulcy in ehis occafion,
ic is againft rae, and nor againft chy Highnefs, who by ehis very faulc arc yec ehe more ftraicly
obliged noc to comrait one againft him. For what doch noc a raan deferve, who racher ehen he
would fail in his word which he had given thee, refolved to abandon,noC only his Country, not
only his Friends; but tbe only perfon whora he could love; who was in ftead to hira ofall the
world; and without whora his life had been irkfora, and death the terra of his defires? No,
my Lord.continued foe,flatter not thy felf in this occafion; think better.both of Ibrahim and of
ifabella, and be raoft affured, that as I am certain he would dye a ehoufand eiraes rather chen
abandon me, fo foould I do che like, rather chen be unfaichful eo him. And if by forae pro¬
digy, which I cannoc fear foould happen, Ibrahim foould confenc Co chy paflion; if he him¬
felt foould fpeak co me of chy love, yec lee ehy Highnefs know, chac I ara noC capable of fail¬
ing by exaraple. I foould ceafe co love Ibrahim, if he ceafed Co be generous, but I fliould
love chee never a whic che more; concrarily, I foould regard thee then, both as having out¬

this advice was but a weak confolation to Ifabella. Howbeit foe defired the Sultana Ajl^nl

mifed her to do ; upon condition that ftie might obtain of her generofity, that he foould be

frora his foul, he refolved to fpeak co her once for all, co fee if he could gam her. Thatwhich
carryed hira the racher to this extreara refolution, was the thought hc had that it would not
peradventure be long before Ibrahim returned; and that a conqueror or conquered, the love
which he bare Co Ifabella would raake hira foon finifo this war: for when as Ibrahim went
away wieh an abfolute power to treat ofall things, without having new order frora Salman
he had affured him, that he would corae and render hira an account of his voyage hitnfdf,
without ever fending to hira before.                                                           h r    r •

that his voyage would not be long, if by ill fortune he had not received his laft order, as hc
began CO doubt, racanttotryif he could obtain thatby fear, which hecould not obtain by

ftancy were not ftrong enough to keep her trom wifoing, that deach would fpeedily deliver
her oue of che deplorable eftace wherein foe was. She faw her fdf far ftom Ibrahim, wich¬
ouc means Co hear from him, che place of her refuge become her prifon, Che fighc of her

dear Kinfworaans cears. Her friends on ehe ocher fide, were noC wiehoue unquiecnefs; fo
long an abode at ConflantinapU poffeffed them with a great dealof grief; and the privation
of the fight of Ifabella very much troubled them; but at length, nothing refting for them but
patience to mitigate their difplcafure, they comforted cheratelves as well as chey could with
the hope of Ibrahim's recurn, wherewich they were ftill entertained from Ifabella; who
not able to dirainifo her own misfortunes, endevored at leaftwife Co flaccer thofe of others
with ehis hope chac foe gave thera: for che Grand Sigmor had ftill permitted her to fend un¬
to thera by a Capigibafii, in whora he abfolucely confided.

<p>All chefe illuftrious perfons being in chis deplorable eftace, Soliman, chruft on by defpair
and his love, wenc one day co Ifabella's lodging, having firft fene a Coramand co che Sul¬

bu' I have alfo fome intereft in my life. I have done what I could to procijre my content with-'
ouc troubling yours; but at length, feeing I cannot do it, and thae there is a late v.hich vvi'l
not let me live wichouc you, I muft feek ouc the means for if. Remember chen, thac he which
cnves your affedion, can command you; chac he which offers you his heare, is no: unworthy
your love; chac Ibrahim owing his life co me.ougc Co render ic rae in this occa Jon; that li ctr
fo many fervices, fubmifsions, refpeds, fighs, and tears, the anger and fpite of being Jdp Ad

cenfed Kings; chae Ibrahim is in my Armies; ebac you have in Confiantinople perfons which
are dear co you ; and chae you are in che Serraglio.
</p>
<p>Ic is true, my Lord, replyed Ifabella, that 1 cannot be ignorant of all thefe things; but I
know wiehall, chac thy Highnefs commands, both in thy Aimics, in Constantinople, vai^ in
the Serraglto; and that Conf quenrly I have nociufe to fear any thng; but contrarily I
think that ibrahim, my friends, and I, are in more fafety in thy Eftaces, then inonrown
Country. And then ac^ain, my Lord, I cannot imagine thac the remerabrance of Ibrahm is
uccerly defaced ouc of thy memory; that a man whom thy Hignefs harh fo much loved, and
fo much obliged, can be ill- intreated by chee ; nor can I believe that Ifabella can infpire thee
with fuch unjuft thoughcs; no, my Lord, I cannoc think it.
</p>
<p>Ifabella, replyed SoUman, hath not pofl'eft me with unrcafonable thoughts, I have nothing
buclovefor her; howbeie I muft conrefs, chac her cruelcy poffeffes rae wich fury; and that
fhe may carry me eo deftroy all chac I foall chink can ravifo her from mc; and confequently to
do all chae I fhall believe can ferve my turn concerning her. This being fo, anfwered IfabelU,
I need not be chreatened in the perfon of my friends, nor in that ot Ibrahim, fince on my
onely will that abfolutely depends which thy Highnefs calls rigor, and which I term an effed:
of Reafon and Vertue. For, ray Lord, continued foe,, were not ray heart, nor ray word en¬
gaged to Ibrahim; nay,had I as rauch aff^ dion for thy Highnefs as I am capable of, yet foould
I not give thee more cefliraonies of it chen I have done. Were noc ray Religion, I fay, dif-
ferenc from chine, yec in thae I could noe beihy wife, I foould noe be ehy Slave, fince che heart
of Ifabella can never have choughcs contrary to her honor and her glory. The Slaves of Soli.
man, replyed he, are more then Queens of other Nations; and then again, to fay the tmcb,
to have you command abfolutdy in my heart and foul, is not to treat you as a Slave.

to him with a more confident voyce then before: Finally, my Lord, all that I can fay to thy
Highnefs, is, that if, forgeecing chy ufusl mildnefs and generofity, thou couldft refolve to carry
me by fear ro char, which chou couldft noe get by love; and for chac effed wouldft perfecute
me in ehe perfon of I brahim,who is dearer then ray felf,to rae I would fee him dye rather then

<p>After this Challenge was finiflied, and that Vlama,io render the dvility to /^r&lt;«Ai&gt;w which
he had ufed tqwards him, had fhewed ic unco him, hc gave ic Co a Trurapet, who was to

whom chey found invironed with che moft pare ot che Commanders of his Army. Afeer that
the Boluchbafft had made a low obeyfance to the Sophy, and told him frora whom he came,
he prefented him with Ibrahim's Letter, which the Sophy read foftly with forae change of

great foout: You fee, faid he. Fellow-Soldiers, that I have no intent to abandon you, fince I
deprive my fdf of the means ro fly. After this he comraanded to march on; and that great
body, compofed of fo many different parts, began to advance withfo regular a motion, asit
might bc faid, that one fpirit made it raove.

<p>In the mean time Tachmat, who knew the manner of the Turks fight, had ranged his Ar¬
my in battd array rauch after the farae fort, wieh chis difference neverchelefs, chac whet eas he
had more Horfe ehen Fooc, behinde ehebatcalion which corrcfponded Co ehae of the J*««&lt;&lt;-&lt;«-

qually came wichin five hundred pices one of anocher ; and by the manner of their march¬
ing, it had been a very difficult raatter to difcern to which fide che vidory would lead.
</p>
<p>When as chey were at this diftance, Vlama, after he had obtained perraifsion of I ibrahim
for it, fevered hirafelf frora the Array, and went diredly towards the Enemies with his
Scyraitar in his hand; buc fcarcely was he advanced fifteen paces, when as Deliment, having
alfo fevered hirafelf from his party, came and encouncred him in the fame fore; and ehefe cwo
brave Cavaliers joyned cogecher juft in che middle of the place of batcel. The two Armies
raade a ftand to fee ehis corabae, which was beheld by boch pares almoft as an infallible pre¬
fage of che vidory eo chac fide of chera ewo which fhould carry ie from che other. As loon
as Vlama and Deliment were raet, ehey fell Co fighcing, eieher of chem having coo greac a
heare for Co ftand reproaching and reviling one anocher. Ac ht^, Deliment foughc like a de¬
fperate man, and Vlama like one, who withouc lofing his judgmenc, or otherwife cranfporc-
ed, made ie neverthelefs fufficiently appear by che manner of his c jrriage, chat he was refolved

courage in the other; the fir ft ftruck wtrh violence, and inconfiderately; and thelaft, expo¬
fing himfelf valiantly fome cimcs eo his Enemies blows, affaulced hira wich judgraent, and
warded with addreGs: Bac ac length after they had made an hundred paffades to no purpofe,

'L'/&lt;«»i»4 feeming to be vexc for ftaying fo long from vanquifoing or dying, redoubled his en¬
devors, and preffing bis Eieray more vively then before, hehad ac lengch che facisfadion co
fee his blood firft, wich a blow of his Scymiear, which he layd aebis fhoulder buc lighced on
his chigh. This firft advantage more augmenced Vlama's courage, and redoubled Deliment's
rage; for afcer chae ie was irapoffible eo difcern rhe blows chey gave each anocher: Deliment
was in conrinual adion, ^/^w.*, no raore rhen he, loft noc a rainuees cime; and wichout ci¬

hurc in ewo places, when as in an inftane flying violently at him,he difcharged fo great a blow
with his Scyraitar on his neck, that falling from his horfe, he extended him dead at his feet
This fall made all thofe of Vlamp's party to foout for joy, but he without longer tarrying in

thereunto, onely catiled his arm to be bound up witha piece of linnen cloth of a Turbant
and placing himfe f by Ibrahim, and all the Trumpets, Drums, and AttabalUs having found
ed a charge, they began to march with thofe great cries, which all the Oriental Nations make
at tilt beginning of battels; but yet with this difference, ih^t Ibrahim'% Soldiers feemed to
be almoft allured of the vidory, whereas the others on the contrary feemed to have no other
deiign in fighting, then to revenge the death of Deliment: It was not for that he was be-
loved, but becaufe the %/?; fliewed fo much refentment for it, asit paffd even into the
hearcs of his men.   In rhe end ehefe ewo Armies bdng provoked, tbe one by the deiire of
glory, and the other by that of revenge, chey encouncred cogecher.   And togive yet a further
courage to/^r^^iVs forces, it happened chae T'^t^/^w^, bdng arrived firft in ehe field, had
ftized on an high piece of ground, upon the which he had planted his Ordnance; but that
which hc conceived would have been advantageous, proved unprofitable unto hrm; tor
when as the two Armies caufed their Cannon eo play on eieher pare, thae of ehe Per fum did
no hurc fo ehe Turks, becaufe all ehe flioc paffed over cheir heads in regard ic was planted too
high.   IbrMm's Ordnance wrought another effed, and bis firft difcharge lighting juft in the
midft of that Sq -ladron, where the Sophy was in perfon, cleared all the ranks, wich che fliugh-
ter of a world of men.   But when as the Sophy, who loft not his judgment in this occafion,
had commanded thofe behinde to take the place of them before, /^r^/[)/?wonhi$fide,cauftd
two battalions, behinde tbe which were ehe reft of his Ordnance, eoopen, and the Soldiers
having accord ngly divided themfelves to the right hand and ro ehe lefc, ehe remainder of his
Ordnance difcharged all together through the voyd fpace that was between the ranks, and put
his Enemies into fo ftrange a diforder,as the like was never heard of. And truly it was zi^yixwA-
geous to ihtTcrfians, chac the thicknefs of the fraoke and duft, which enveloped thefetwo
Armies, kept chem from (eeiog the horridnefs of chis execution, for ocherwife peradventure
they would not have had fo much heart to fighr, as they ceftified afterwards.
</p>
<p>Ac length, Tachmas having formed hisbaecalions anew, for repairing of che diforder which
the greac Ordnance had made, and Ibrahim's Soldiers having re- affumed cheir ftations, thete
two Armies came to cope with one another.   Ibrahim, followed h'j Vlama, gave firft in¬
to the batealion, behinde ehe which was ehae broken fquadron, where the Sophy and Ifmud
were in perfon.   And itwas there, where out of a prodigious valor hedid things, which
would not finde belief with pofterity, if they were written.   He made way through all op¬
pofition, and not contented with carrying fear and terror wherefoever he went; with defend¬
ing his own life,and giving death co his Enevmies; but took care alfo for the confervation of his
own party.   He faved the Ba^a Sinan from being killed, by discharging a greac blo\y with
his Scymiear upon him chac was ftriking him : now though he performed the Soldier in this
encounter, yet left he noc for all that co behave himfdf like the General of the Army, and to
have an eye to all things.   Somecimes hc fenc eo fuccor chofe chae ftood in rieed; fomecimes
he wene Co chem in perion, and joyning boch prudence and valor cogecher, ie mighc bcfud,
thaencver cwo feveral men exercifed chem fo nobly, k Ibrahim in his perfon alone made
them co appear in chis occafion.   And che courfe chac he held was fuch, in fending his diredi¬
ons to every pare, as ie mighc alfo bc affirmed, that he was in all the fights that were in the
field, and that he might with reafon be lamd the foul of his Army.  Vlama in hke manner
worthily feconded his valor; and all the famzaries, feeing in che head of chem fo couragious
a Chi'train, performed cheir pares fo well in this encounter, that they pierced q^'^e througn

<p>WHereas it is not enough to have vanquifoed, ifone does not know how to ufe
thevidory, the  Illuftrious Baila knew too well how  tO make ufe of
the advantages of fortune, for to negled his enemy after he had furmounted hini.
He was not ignorant that the chance of war is inconftant; that Conquerors may
oftentimes bc Slaves to thofe whom they have put in chains; andthat the Crowns
which Viftory hath fet on the head of thofe whom foe favours, are not fo Wc il fet¬
led, but that they may bc plucked from thence. Out of fo juft a reafoning, Ibrahim
took as much care to have good order obferved in his Army, as if that of Tach¬
mas hzdhccn^WWn the hdA^ and had not been defeated.   He difcamped then the
next day, and ftill advancing into the Enemies Countrey, without incountring any
obftacle, he carried terror over all the Perfian Empire.   For whereas the Sophies
/jniy had been utterly routed, they which had not followed hini to Sultania , and
that iiad cfcaped killing in the battell, fled to thenext adjoyning Provinces, and by
their report wrought that in the mindes of thofe that heard them, which the Arms
oi Ibrahim had wrought in them, poffefling their hearts with fear and terror.   And
whereas it is naturall enough for a man to feek to* excufe himfelf, they made the
Army of the Turks far greater than it was, for the juftifying of their flight; they
commended the valour of Ibrahim to cover their own cowardice, and fighting for
him in this occafion, they induced many Towns to render themfelves, who other-
wife had at leaftwife attended the Canon,   and  the fight of their  Enemy.   But
whereas the moft part of the Palaces inthis Empire arc not much fortified, and
are commonly his th.it keeps the field,/^r&lt;t/'/&gt;» being become fo abfolutely Mafter
of it, as there was not an enemy appearing, hc had no other imploymenr after the
battell of Niphatesj than to receive the Deputies of Towns which came to bring
him the keyes thereof,and one would have faid, confidering in what manner things
paft, that Ibrahim was rather a lawfull King, that rode in progrefs about his King¬
dom to raake himfelf known to his Subjefts, than a Conqueror, which received the
fubmiffions of the people whom he had fubdued.    In fine, the matter went in that
fort, as in two moneths fpace the Grand Vifier reftored unto Solimans obedience all
the places which he had formedy conquered, andthat had revoked after Ulamaes
defear,anddunng the time of his ficknefs.    In the mean while he had fent to
VnncG Mahamed znA to jixiamira,to &amp;i!iuTc them that he did not conquer their
Countrey but cnly to oblige the Sophy to demand peace ; and if it foould bc long
before he heard from him, he would fend to propound it unto him, with fuch juft
condidons, as hc could not refufe it.  Ulama likewife on his part had written to the
Princefs and Feltxana, who had not failed to teftifie unto him by their Letters a
great deal of acknowledgement for the viftory which hc had obtained of Deliment.
Axiamira was neverthelefs m.uch difquieted, to underftand by all them which came
from the Camp to Bitilifa^ thuhncc Tachmas cnttcAinto Stiltania ^ there had been
no news of him: For albdt the Sophy had intre.ited her very ill, yet ftill he was
her F.uher, and the apprehenfions of Nature were yet ftronger in her heart   than
the remembrance of injunes was fenfible unto her.    This unquietnefs was not par-
ticular to her, and though it was after a diff-erent fafoion, yet certain it is, that
the Grand Viher was troubled for that he could learn nothing of Tachmas; not
being able to imagine what defign he foould have in foutdn^ himfelf up in Stdta-
ma, and never appearing fince, nor giving any order for fetting fome forces on fooc

prued both Ibrahim and Ulama ; for the Grand Vifier rcmcmbred very well that
this Arfalon was hc who had taken Doria ncer to Naples; that he was Father to AU-
bechy whom Ofman the BaflTa of the Seas fon had maried; but he could not conipi c-

the Levant', fo thatboth of them provoked by curiofity, prcflcd^Wbr^fA to explain
himfelf more clearly. My Lord, faid he to Ibrahim, before I tell you what Arfalon
defires, may you be pleafed to let me relate unto you the fcqudc of an Hiftory
the beginning whereof you are acquainted with, co che end thac by the knowledge
you foall have thereof, you may be the more eafilier carried to grant the favour

<p>I Make no doubt, my Lord, butif the generofity of Alibech mowed you at fuch
time, as by your goodnefs you got the Grand Signior to judge her caufe to her
advantage, I make no doubt, I fay, but that which I am going to impart unto you
will carry you to fcrve her. I will not ftand to run over her firft advcntures,thcrc-
by to make you underftand the reft, fince 1 hold it impoflible that you ftiould not
ftill remember, that fhe is the daughter of Arfalcu the Pirate, or to fay better, of a
Satrap of Perfia, whom ill fortune hath made a Pirate. And I do not think you
have forgot that this Pirate took Ofman prifoner, who in a few dayes became defpe¬
rately in lovc with the veituous Alibech, and that flie delivering him, faved herfdf
with him, upon condition that he fliould marry her when he came to Conflantinople:
No more can you be ignorant, that the Baflla of the Sea would never have permit¬
ted his fon to have kept his word with her, had not the Grand Signior by his
commandment, and by his liberality, forced him to receive this fair iVlaid, in whom
hefound no other defeft but poverty. Now fincc that, my Lord, I canaflTurc you,
thztAUbechh^th not rendred her fclf unworthy ofthe grace you did her , nor
of that which yet flic attends from your goodnefs. She hath lived with the Baffa of
the Sea in as much obedience to him, as if ftie had been his own daughter; and
with her fubniiinons and refpefts hath in fuch fort acquired his aflcftioivs he loves
not his fon with more tendernefs. As for 0/»»^, there hath never been heard fpeak
ofa more violent, or more durable lovc than his, and every day too he fees fome
new grace in his dear v^/*itffJ&amp;} for whereas the beauty of her foul is fer greater
than that of her face, flie hath given him fo many new marks of her vertue, of her
courage, ofher love, and ofher generofity, as he ftiould be the ingratefulleft of men,
ifthe affeftion which he bears hcr,could enter into comparifon with any ottier.
This perfon then, being fo ftraightly linked in good will to her Father.in-Law,aiid
toher husband, could not refolvc to abandon them, at fuch tmic as the Baffa of

more than^of chooling a place where they might make a delcent, according to
the order they had for it: but a horrible tempeft that arofe, deftroyed all then de¬
figns. It was fb great, fb long, and fb extraordinary , that the whole Fleet was
difperfed- fo that when it t^rew to be calm again, three Vefl-ells were fcarce found
together: Howbdt fo great was our good fortune, as in four or hve c^ayes tlie
whole Rivyreioyned, aBdalbdtmoft of the ftiips had fomething o^' odier broj
ken,yctwe rcioycedtofeethcmallftiatteredas they were, after we had believed
they were loft. The two Vcfl"ells of Ofman , and of the Bafl'a of the Sea, were on¬
ly vvandng to the Fleet; but at length that of 0/?»^« comming m, made us hope
thatthe Bafla would return in like manner. After he had been attended fome
dayeswithan impatience, which well domonftrated the love which QfmanyZndtht
generofity which Altbechhiidiiovhim ; and after that many Veffells had been fent
out to crofs up and down the Seaj for to try if they could meet with him, one
day as 0/w/t« was looking forth himfelf to fee if he could defcry any thing, he
difcovered a Veflell: and though it was fo far off as he could not difcern of what
Nation ftie was, yet the extreme defire which he had that it might be his fathers,
perfwaded him that it was he. In this belief he caufed his dear Alibech to come
upon the deck to kt her fee that which all the reft of his Veflell faw as well as hc ;
they continued a pretty while in this fort, between hope and fear , but at length
this Veffell approachint:; by lirtle and little, deftroyed the firft, and increafed the
other; for 0/?w*jw certainly knew that this Veffell was a Brigantine, and not that
of his father, whofe fortune had b cen very different from his. The tempcft having
fevered him from his Fleet, aud the ftorm having raightily bruifed his Veffell, he
had beenfo unhappy as to encounter witha Pirate-, who having found him in
fo deplorable an eftate, had fet upon him, or to fay better, had taken him, he not
being able to make .my refiftance. The Baffa ofthe Sea afterthis misfortune,
was perfwaded^ that tobe the more gently ufed, and to get the fooner out of his
enemies hands, hc was to tell who he was, to theend that offering a great ranfom
he might be reftored to his liberty ; the rather, for that in this occafion the affairs
of the Empire being much concerned , he fhould have committed a crime , ifhe
had concealed his name for the faving of money. But that which he thoughc
would conduce molf to the getting himfelf out of trouble , gave him the more;
for be pleafed to know, that by an encounter altogether prodigious, he that had ta¬
ken him was the Pirate Arfalm, father tothe vertuous Alibech ; who no fooner
underftood that this prifoner was the Baffa of the Sea, but he appeared to be migh¬
tily incenfed with anger. W^hat, faid he unto him, are you the father then of the
Traytor Ofnian^ or to fay better, of the Ravifher ofmy daughter ? and hath for¬
tune, who hath alwayes perfecuted me fo cruelly, at laft furnilhed me with meant,

to make you tell it by force. The Baffa of the Sea furprifed with this

neverthelefs, fince he had faid fo much alreadyj that the beft would be not
to difl^cmble , and to indeavour by the afllirance which he would give hin;
that Alibech vj-a.i Ofmanswik, andthat he had alwayes ufed her as ff ftie had

think, or what ♦to refolve on.    He knew by the report of his Ibnne, and of .i^'&gt;

perceiving the intention of them that were making towards him, ftruck fayl, hung

which were advanced towards him. When he was fo near them a&gt; he mightbe

from the Baffa of the Sea his father. This name made them all to ftiout for joy
that heard it; and the word pafling ftrait from Veflell to Vcliell, and from Gaily
to Gaily, the;e was a generall rcioyciiig over all the whole Fleet. In the

the P&lt;fr/i2« was condufted unco him. Thefightof thisnian nude the vertuous ^-
libech change colour, for fhe prefently knew him, as having feen him with her fa¬
ther, all the time that fhe lived at fea. This firft motion was quickly feconded with
an extreme grief; for when as O/Jw^w, outof an impatience derived from his af¬
feftion, had demanded of this man where his father was; My Lord, faid heunto
him, witha great deal of boldnefs, he is in a place from whence you ma^ eafily
draw him, and to clear the matter unto you, know, that the chance of War, or
rather the equity ofHeaven , hath made him fall into the power of the invincible
Arfalon. Alas, (uid Alibechy looking on Ofman, what have I heard ! and what a
deftiny is ours like to be ! What, faid Ofman, interrupting her, and all amazed,
is my fadier in the hands of Arfalon &gt; Yes, my Lord, replyed the Perftan, and it is
from hini that I come to tell you, that you fhall never fee the Baffa your father
more, ifyou do not render him his daughter : This is the price he hath fee for his
liberty, and it is that which you ought to pay him. I know that I fpeak boldly,
and that in fome fort I endanger my felf; but be-think you that you have a per¬
fon in the power oi Arfalon, which ought to keep you from entreating ms ilL I'
leave you to judge, generous Ibrahim, what this propofition effeftcd in the minds
of Ofman and Alibech, and what a combat that Was, where one muft refolve to a-
bandon a father, or lofe a wife; yea a wife, to whom Ofman owed his life and li¬
berty : which made up all his felicity; and which was both his wife and his mi¬
ftris. Nature and Love could not be fatisfied in this occafion : Ofman could not be
acknowledging without bdng ingratefull; and finding cradty in both the pardes,

generous Alibech, faid he unto her, what the choice is which I can make in Co crofs
an adventure. My Lord, faid fhe unto him, wholly difiTolved into tears, vou re
quire a counfell of me which is very hard to be given ; it is not becaufe I fear the'
rigor ofmy father fomuch, as I cannot refolve without pain to indure it to del
ver yours; but, my Lord, it is becaufe I cannot do it without abandoning you  Yet
I muft, continued ftie ; for whereas I am the daughter of Arfalon, it is for me
to receive the chaftifement of her fault; and wheieas 1 am in part the caufe of his
captivity, it is for me alfo to ddiver him ; and it is for me alfo to dry up the tears
■which you flied for him : Suffer me then to go and undo his chains, and wear his
irons. Ah / too generous Alibech, anfwered Ofman, do not offer me a reniedv
worfe than the difeafe, and which I cannot accept ot: My father is too generous
too, continued he, to indure it; and he would difavow mc for his fonne if I were
capable of fuch a bafeiiefs. To have fuch thoughts vvould be a thing worthy of
his great heart, replyed v4//^fcA, but it would alfo be a thing unworthy  both  of
you, and ofme, if I could fuflper you to be crudl to the Baffa your father,  and that
he fhould lofe his life by my means. No, Ofman, it is that vvhich I can never indurc
and fince we cannot live happy together, let us at leaftwife die innocent.    Do what
you ought for your father; owing him your life, you ow him all things; facrifife
your wife to deliver him, it is juft, and fhe defires it.    I muft, added fhe,  for the
love of you, deprive my felf of you ; and fear not that I will accuCc you of want
of affeftion, whenas you fhall confent thereunto ; no, Ofman, I ftiould not be glad
that your love to me fhould ftifle the motions of nature in you.   Reafon muft bc
ftronger than all other things; and hc that could .abandon his father, niight alfo in
fome other occafion abandon his wife. Permit me to do what I ought, and leave
the reft to the conduft of fortune. That would not be juft, anfwered Ofman. What
will you do then, replyed ^/'^fc^? I do not know, anfwered he; onely I know
that the eftate wherein my fotil is, I can neither be wanting to my father, nor to
you ;  and yet being unable to fave you both, I fee that nothing but death can fuc¬
cour me.    After this, Ofman fell a niufing, then fuddenly comming to himfdf a-

Heaven can witnefs, anfwcrcd  Ofman,   after hc had  raifed her up, whether F

der wherein my foul is, I fay whatfoever my grief fuggefts unto mc, vvithout giving
my reafon Icafurc to examine whether the thing be juft, or whether it be not.   lit
fine, generous Ibrahim, after fo long and fo fad a convci-fation, Ofman, not able ci¬
ther tod.liver his facher, or deprive himfdf of his wife, or fight with Arfalo/t,
refolved at leaft, and made Alibech refolvc fo too, to go with all his Fleet, and
fet himfelf in the fight of that of ArfaUn; iot ill the Pirates ofthe fcas ofthe Levant
had a little before betaken themfclvei to him, and acknowledged him for their
Chieftain.   It was neverthelefs after he had promifed Altbech, that hc would not
fight with him ; and that it ftiould bc only to endeavour to make him do thatby
fear vvhich he could not make him do by reafon. All the dillicultic of the matter
was but to know precifely where hc was; but this obftacle lafted not long: for Of-
muM having fent for the ?*r/54» to come again to him, he talked to him with fo
much addrefs, that he learnt the place ofhis retreat; afccr which he told this man
in a gentle manncr,for fear his father fhould be ill intreated,that before he anfwcr¬
cd  direftly to the propofition which had been made to him, he would willingljf
have aLettcr from his fathcr,to the end thac being fure he was Iiving,he might deal
with the more certainty. The P^r^** finding fome jufticc in Ofmans dem^iTid, pre¬
fently lefc him, wich a promife to return him an anfwer of ic wichin a few days ;
but take    heed, fayd hc unto him, that you go not away, for fear left Arjaloh
fliould revenge himfelf on your father, if you ftiould deceive him.    So Ofman ha¬
ving affured him that hc vvould not ftir; and this iPrr/Mw having fet fay], he made
his whole Fleet to fteer the fame courfe ; fo that two dayes after, at the break of
day, the Pirate Arfalon, who could not oblige the Baffa to write to his fortne, faw
his whole Navy appear.   At firft his ddign was to fight with it, andto that ef¬
feft, he caufed alfo his Fleet to bc made ready; but when as that oiOfman appro¬
ched, and that enlarging it fclf, he could diftinftly count all the vcflcls, whereof
it was compofed, he found it fo great, and his fo fmall in comparifon of it, as fee¬
ing that it would have been temerity and folly in him, to hope for the Viftory
with fo unequall a number, hc took another refolution t And after he had inftruft¬
ed the fame Perfian wfiom hc had formerly imployed, with his intendons, he fene
him back to Ofman; who feeing a vcffell loofe from Arfalons Fleet, and comming
towards him, hoped that it might be his defign had fucccedcd. Alibeeh was not of
this opinion; and fear fo abfolutely oppreffed her foul, as there was no place left

<p>man then, is to put me in remembrance ofthe obligations wherdn I fiand encage 1
to you •, and it is to fay to me alfo. Do not abandon me.   Do not you abandon L
anfwered flie, but fuffer me to abandon you. I cannot, replyed 0/w^». Bot could
you indeed, fayd Alibech to him, fee a dagger in my fathers hand to ftab the heart
of yours? For my part, continued ftie, I would rather dye. Let us die then, faid
Ofman to her; for I tell yon once again, that it is as equally impollible for inc to
refolve to lofe my father, as to abandon you.   In purfuance ofthis difcourfe, ./-
libech did yet what flie could to obtain her husbands permiffion that fhe might &lt;'o
to herfather: She joyned tears toher prayers, and albeit that which ftie defired
would deftroy her felicity, bereave her ofher liberty, expofe her to the fury of
her father, and deprive her of her husband , yet was fiie fo generous, as to omit
nothing of whatfoever fhe thought was capable of perfwading him not to refufe
her that flie   demanded. But feeing at laft that fhe entreated in vain, and that Of
man unable to refolve on anything, yet feemed to be refolved not to render her,
fhe purpofed to make ufe of a kinfman of the Baffa ofthe fea, whom fhe had won
after the firft time that Arfalons Meffenger came thither: And that (he might talk
■ivith him at liberty, and without fufpition, I fee very well, fayd fhe to Ofman,
that the tears which I fhed to move your heart, do but harden it the more, and
that as long as you fee me, you can refolve of nothing, wherefore fuffer me to
•withdraw my Cdi, and remember, fayd flie unto him, that the life of your father
is in queftion. Afterthis, fhe retired into the Captains cabbin, whither having
fent for the Baffa of the Seas kinfman, who flie knew was very much affefted, and
greatly obliged to him, as holding his fortune of him;   When hc was come, and
that ftie cOuid fpeak to him without witneffes, flie fummoned him tothe perfor¬
mance of the promife he had made her two dayes before, to doany thing forthe
deliverance ofthe Baffa of the fea, when flie fliould furiiifh him with means for it.
For rightly forefeeing that Ofmanwould never refolve to remit her int., the hands
of Arfalon, though he was very generous, and that he loved his father exceeding¬
ly ,   this courageous woman had forecaft a way hovv to beguile him.   Af'rcr then
tha't flie  had asked of him, who was to ferve her in her defign, whether he was re¬
folved for it or no ? and that ftie had told him how all that ftie vVould have of hini
•was   that he would give her the opportunity the night following to go to Arfi-
/o« in the veflTel which he commanded.    This man, albeit very much obliged to
the Baffa of the Sea , was notwithftanding fomewhat unwilling ro confent there¬
unto.    But lr4//^&lt;?(r/:'adding art to her entreaties, undertook to peifwadc that to
him,'which ftie did not bcleeve her felf.   She told hira that her father would let
himfelf be moved with her tears; that without doubt this generous aftion would
touch him; and thatfo without expofing her to any great danger, ftie ftiould de¬

make the Baffa our Father fee, that we doe for him all that we can.   He hath given
me life, I am ready to render it to him .igain ; and   I cannot think that Heaven
would approve ofthe ddivering ofan innocent tothe crueltic of ^r/^j/&lt;7«; neither
doc 1 think too, added he, but his revenge would be more fatisficd with having me
in his hands, than with having/^///^fcA.    And albeit he hath not demanded mcaf-
well as flie, it vvas doubclds becaufe he bdeeved, that I would render him my wife,
rather than render him my fclf But alas cryed he, how was hc ill informed of my
thoughts! As for my Father, faidhe,I may not beleeve that he can complain  of mc,
fiuce 1 indanger my felf for the love ofhim. And as iov Arfalon,hQV]i\\ in my
perfon find an objeft worthy ofhis wrath ; it is I that ftoleaway his daughter from
him ; it is 1 that was the caufe ofthe flight of that generous Slave, from whom hee
expefted fb many things; in fine, I alone am culpable ; and if there bc any jufticc
in his cruelty, I alone too fliall be puniflied. He fhall deliver my Fadier, or at leaft¬
wife 1 fhall wear yrons with him ;  and if rage carries him to take away my life,
I fhall howfoever have the fatisfaftion to dye , without having abandoned, either
my Father, or my wife.    1 owe my life to my Father, and i (hall render it to hini
again, in lofing it for his fake. I owe my liberty to the generous Altbech,znd char¬
ing my fdf with the fame chaines wnich are prepared for her , I fliall have done for
her all that the unhappinefs ofmy deftiny permits me to do.Let us goe then, added
he, let us goe to Arfalon fincc it is as equally impoftible for me, to abandon my Fa¬
ther, as to lofe-^//^ff/;.   This defignc being ftrongly imprinted in his heart, hee
drew the Perfian afide, and told him foftly, that as foon as night was come bee
fhould have fatisfaftion ofhim, and affured him befides, that if hedid not render
Alibech to him, he would at leaftwife goe along with him in his veffell, and carry
hisanfwer himfelf to Arfalon.    Thisnian, being able to doe nothing elfe, refol¬
ved to wait the time he had appointed; in the mean fpace Ofman fent for one,
named Alahomet, a man of command, and one that you know hath courage and ex¬
perience; and having told him thathe was going the iicxf night to try if hee
could deliver his father, by meanes ofan intelligence which hee'had with Arfalons
meffenger, he willed him, itby misfortune his deiigne ftiould not fucceed, to com¬
mand ihefleei in his abfence, and not to fail in taking fpeciall heed to Alibech,
and to fend her back to Conjlamimple in a vcffell; but not before hee had tarried
fome dayes in the view of Arfalons fleet; and whatfoever flioidd happen not to fight
with him.   This man, vvho vvas prudent, would faine have been a little better clea¬
red of Ofmans dehgne; but whatfoCver hecould do, he could not obligchim un¬
to it ; and Ofman making ufe of his abfolute power,   hee could doe no other
but obey.   Alter this , Ofman went to Alibech, but whereas both of them had
eadi their dehgne, dthough they had an hundred things tofay to one another, out
of the opinion wherein they were, that they fliould never meet again , the defire
they h^d to execiite their enterprife made them fay litde, feadng left their conver-

out doubt but to be a fpeftator of her puniftiment.But if Ofman was amazed, no lefs
Wis Alibech; for fome ofher veffell having known Ofman,3Lnd having told it to her,
fhe was infinitely afflifted, &amp; beleeved the fame of Ofman which hc had bdeeved of
her.In the mean time v^r/^/o»,having fent to difcover this veffell, was much furpn-

proaching afwell as the othcr,niade him fee Ofman on the poop.Now albeit he could
not comprehend that which he faw,yet was he glad to fee more in his hands than he
bad hopedfor; and caufing the Baffa ofthe Sea,ladcn vsith chaines, to mount upon

extremely afflifted; and Ofman feeing his Father in that eftate,was fenfibly touched
therewith. At length thefe two veffels being come up to Arfalons, and Alibech &amp; Of

to reenter into your favor, I come to break his chaines who hath been in ftead ofa

to that which I doe;, it is a pure effeft of mine own will. Alas! cryed Ofma» then,

bech, as I am the caufe of his misfortune, it is juft I fhould be fo too of his liber¬
ty.    But faid fhe to Arfalou, confult no further hereupon, Ofmanloves me tothat
height, as he will never yeeld but by violence. And fear not, tny Lord,faid fhe unto
him, to give him his liberty, you will punifti him enough in punifhing mc; and
the irons which I fliall wear, will be more heavy to him without doubt than to me.
Arfalon not able to forbear frora bdng moved with fo much generofity, and Alibech
having incountred his eyes, where flie faw (as flie thought) fome marks of tcnder¬
nefs, continued her difcourfe, and redoubled her prayers.    My Lord, faid flie un¬
to him, I believe that i my felf labour mine own ruin, and that confclTing my felf
guilty, vvithout feeking excufes for my crime, I render my fclf unworthy to ob¬
tain that which I defire of you : Wherefore , continued fhe , permit me for the
leffening of my fault to put you in remembrance of that bleffed time, when as the
Pirate vfr/i?/i5« was aSatrapeof Perfia; you know, my Lord, that my Mother a-
bandoned her Parents to follow you, and that then you called that excefs of love
andgenerofity in her, which now you term an horrible crime in me.    Ic is true,
thatlhavefollowed0y7»/r»,butit was not as a flave, it was as my husband; and
let heaven be my witncfj, whether in abandoning you, 1 do not quit a part of my

mighty Fleet which is ready to fet upon me (faid Arfalen to her, who yet did
not yecld) is without doubt an effeft ofyour prayers and affeftion. Alas I anfwc^
red Alibech, if Ofman would have fought with you, he would not have come and
put himfclfinto your hands without Arms. Confiderthen, my Lord, if there be
any fenfe of pity refting in you, whether you can with jufticc refplve  the deftru¬
ftion of a man, who feeing his father in captivity, hath notwithftanding had that
refpeft for you, as not to fight with you becaufe you were mine; you fee too that
he is not an unnaturall fonne, fince he comes himfelf to offer you his liberty and

(Certainly for his part ftiewed fUch marks of his repentance, and fpake fo many ge-
alerous, and obliging things, as itwas eafie to perceive that he had not alwayes
been a Pirate.    Now, my Lord, that I may not prolong this relation any further,
you fhalf underftand, that Arfalon notonly pardoned his daughter, promifed an in¬
violable affeftion to the Baffa of the fea and his fonne, but alfo took the refoluti¬
on to ceafe from being a Pirate : For which effeft he obtained the Baffa of the
feas permiffion to difm ifs all them thathad ranged themfelves under his obedi¬
ence; who although they were forry to lofe fo courageous a Chieftain, yet vvere
they comforted with the greatnefs of the booty which he left them; and cmbar-

ferving any part ofthe riches which he had gotten ; You fee, faid he, fmiling to

fo univerfall a rejoycing, as the like hath never been heard fpoken of.   Inthe

Arfabn, who had been acquainted by Alibech with the obligation wherein ftic was
engaged unto you, hc defired the Baffa of the fea to obtain of you, thac if any
treaty of peace were to be made between the Sultan and the Sophy, you vvould be

<p>till their vertue were worthily acknowledged.    And verily it might be fayd, that
Ihrahtm knew what would happen s fur le.nvcly was Mjrath z diyes jour ley from
the Camp, when ashe was advertifed that there were Deputies icom Sultama thac
defired to fpeak with him ; he was told alto that thefe deputies wereall in mourn¬
ing, and feemed to be extremely afflifted. This novelty fui prifed bim, and where¬
as UlamavTHsnot prefent at fuch time as this meffage Was delivered unto him, he
fent for him in all haft, and when he was come to his Tent, and  the Deputies
likewife, one amongft them, afterhehad begun his difcourfe withanElogitim of
Ibrahim, the better to prepare him not to refufe them that which they purpofed to
crave of him, acquainted him with all tbathad paft at Sitltani.t, 'iince the battell ot
Niphates, wherewith ULim.i and hc were ftrangely furprifed :   And truly this rela¬
tion was extraordinary enough, to beget no mean amazement.     For it hud fallen
out, that after that day which had proved fo glorious to Ibrahim, and fo fatall co
the Sophy, the death of r&gt;tf//&gt;Wf«^, and the di^leafure for having been vim^nilhed,
poffeffcd him with fomuch grief, as he fell fick at the very fame inftant,  Asfor
the ambitious-P^rc^, flie reioyced in her heart at the death oi Detirh'ent, as a thing
which flie  had long wifhed for; the fickneft of Tachnas did not difquiet her, but
contrarily flie beleeved, that the lefs able he fliould be to direft, the more power
the fhould have.  As fbr the ftupid Ifmofel, Ihe did not regard him as any great ob¬
ftacle to her defign; fhe was notwithftanding very much vexed, when fhe Under¬
ftood of hira, after the lofs of the battel!, that in the heat of the fight Ulama had
given him his life and his liberty,  in drawing him out ofthe hands of agreat
many fouldiers, who would have either taken or killed him : For albeit flife for¬
bad him to publifli this aftion, yet was he fo filled with joy iO\' his efcape out ot
thac perill, as it was impoffible for her to keep him from telling it to divers per¬
fons, though it was not out of any acknowledgement.   Perca was not ignorant,
th^tUlama had a number of fecret friends, who watched but fot" an occafion to
declare themfelves for his  advantage. She knew likewife, thit all which Were of
Mahxmedes znd Axiamiraes party, fought but for a pretext to ftir ; fo as fhe
fi:ared that this aftion comming tobeknoWn, in the eftate wherein things were,
ufe mightbe raade of it forthe making of fome propofitions to Tachmas, vvhith
might be prejudiciall unto her, inthe defign which flit had to reign. But this in¬
forcunace Prince  was not long in a   condition  to think of the affaires  of
his Empire ; for albeic his Phyficians  had imployed all their skill for the pre*
fervation of his life, yet could they not poffibly fave hiirt ; and the fourth day after
the lofsof the battell, death ftifled that paffion in his heart, which had made him
do fo much injuftice.  As foon as he had given up his laft breath, PeH'a, Without
amufing her felf in unprofitable tears, took great cate to conceal it, Uhtill fush
time as ftie was affured of the minds of the principal! perfons of Sultnkin ; for as
forthe men of command, fo great a number were flain in the day 6f battell, as
there fcarcely refted any conlidcrable enough, tfrongly to oppofe what file m64nt
to undertake.   She caufed the Courtcill then to be affembled in the name ofthe So¬
phy, where flie and//w^?/appeared in nioatning ; and whetcas ftie had Wit and
fubtilty, after flic had with feigned tears made the hearts of thofe that heard her
pliant, ftie acquainted them with che death of the Sophy, craved their affiftance for
the direftion of Ifmael, and in conclufion flieWed thcni a paper, vrhich indeed flie
hzd^zdeTachmas to fign, without knowing What he die!, vvhereby hi declared
that in cafe Ifmael fliould prove incapable of reigning, his intent then was that
the Empire fliould devolve to Ptrc/j, not holding them forhis lawfull flicceflbrs
which hadcaft themfelves into the armesof his enemy. All thefe things exceed*

<p>them; and that confequently, they werenottogo tiimultuoufly andacquaintl^
enemy with the death of Tachmas, for fear left he fliould make ufe of this ad
vantage to ruin them; yea,and thofe perfons too whom he had in his hands   and
■which were fo infinitely dear unto them.   The moft of them then refolved, with
out making any ftiew thereof, to defer the manifeftation of thdr hatred to ' Perca
of thdr contempt oi Ifmael, and of their affeftion to Mnhamed, Axiamira, ind Hal
ma, untill fuch time as they had recovered new forces, to the end they might oppofe
Terca,znd to the end alfo that in making fome propofitions of peacejthey might yet
be in a condition to defend thenifelve?,if"it were refufed.Concealing then their true
meaning, after they had lamented the death of Tachmas , they acknowledged
Ifmael for their lawfull Prince ; faying neverthelefs to Perca, thac fliee was to
affilf him with her counfell, and that fhe fhould raign under the name of//5w&lt;?f/.
This Princefs, who thought that the moft faithfull might be corrupted , and that
particular intereft was alwaies preferred before honor and glory,becaufe fuch were
her true thoughts, beleeved, that if fliee inriched all thefe which were in thiscuim*
fell, ftie fhould abfolutely gain them to her felfe, and oblige them to fet the crown
on her head.   To which effeft, whcnas the Affembly was ready to break up, ihee
faid further, that the Sophy her Father having given all his treafure unto her, by a
teftament which he had made in her favor ( as indeed it was true) flie did not think
that ftiecould better difpofe of it,than in diftribudng it amongft thofc,that were ca¬
pable of aiding Ifmael to CnHain the Scepter which hewas going to bear.  Afterthis,
Ihe made them pafs, though they were unwilling to it, into a great room, where
fhe had caufed all the Sophyes riches,and treafure,to be laid ; to the end that by the
light of fo tempting an objeft, their hearts might be overcome with the defire of
snaking themfelves mafters ofit.    They  proved notwithftanding more generous
than fhe imagined ; for although they teffified a great deal of acknowledgement
to herfor her liberality,yet would they not accept of it.ln the mean time they refol¬
ved to let no body go out ofthe Citty, which might acquaint the enemy with the
death oiTaehmas; for being fo powerfull as he was, it m ight give him a minde to
come and affault them in Sultania, which otherwife it may bee hee would not doe.
Durin&lt;^ all thefe things, every one had their defignes; Perca thought of nothing but
oi mzkin^ Ifmael to be hated; the iviend^oi Mahamed, Axiamtra, and Vlama, at¬
tended with impatience the troopes which were to come unto them from the re¬
mote Provinces, to the end they might doe thatwhich they thought would bee
moft requifite; Ifmael fought how hemight free himfelf from the care of affaire?.
Things having'continued fome dme inthis fort, it hapned in the end that thefame
facility, which ftie had fo much liked in//w^f//difpofition, gave her agreat deal
of unquietnefs, for even in the like manner as ftie had made her fdf miftrefs of ir,

according to the humor ofthofe that talked with him; and ui.ercas every one was
enemy to Perca, as often as flie returned to hira,ftic found him changed; and thought
5t was not difficult for her to bring him to her bowagain, yet fhee feared thatat
fome time or other ufe would be made of his name to undoe her. They,unto vvhom
Zael had told that Vlama had faved his life, having reported it to others, ad the

yielding up a Crown, is not worthy to live /  In the mean feafon, the firft gates of
the Palace were forced, there wanted no more but breaking up the reft for to get in,
they which garded them having abandoned them.    In this drcadfull eftate, Perca
taking a dagger, which had been brought to Ifmael out of a beleefthat he would
have armed himfelf, and feeing that flic could not avoyd falling into the power ot
a people filled vvith fury, did yet what fhe could to get him to fliew himfelf.    Shec
joyned threatnings to intreatics, and perceiving at laft rhat all which fliee fa id vvas
in vaiiijSf that in an inff ant flie the uld no longer be miftrd^s ofher felf,rage fo feiaed
on her foul,as prefenting the dagger unto him with an extreme tranfport;Chufe,faid
(he unto him, either to pierce my heart, or to doe what I would have you.    And
when as Ifmael had told her, that he would not doc either the one orthe other, and
that fhe heard a great noyfe, whereby fhe knew that the laft door was broken open;
fince thou knoweft not, faid flie unto him, cither how to reign, or how to obey, 1
will keep thee at leaftwife from dying a Ihamcfull death; faying fo flicc ftabbed
the dagger into Ifmaels heart, who presently fell down dead, and without furthei
delay ftruck it into her own bofoni, and falling down upon her brothers body, fhe
ceafed to be ambitious in ceafing to live.    Thefe confpirators being entred into the
Palace, and having learned from fome ofthe Princefs women the caufe of IfmaeU
death, and likewife that of Ffrc/j, they redoubled their cryes, and teftified afmuch
joy, as if all their enemies had been defeated.    In the mean time the Wifeft and
the moft confiderable of Sultania had begun to oppofe the people, although they
loved not Percn ; but comming to underftand the fuccefs ofthe bufinefs, they held
it not fit to incenfe them, but rather in fo ftrange an accident to make ufe of theit
zeal in favor of Mahamed and Axtamira. After then that they had let them know,
how there was no further uced of taking up armes, fihce the objeft oftheir hate Was
no longer in an eftate to hurt them ; after that for the calming of their fliry, they
had removed the bodies oi Ifmael and Perca out ofthe Way; audi after that they had
promifed fpeedily to fettle a peace for them, and call home their exiled PrinGes,e".
very one retyred to his own houfe : and the CoUiiccll being fet, it wag advifed
chat it was no time any longer to defer the pi'Qp&amp;uftding erf" a peace? becaufe if

<p>rcftiops, he could affure them thatthey ftiould have caufe to commend him • that
his grief was, he could not keep Mahamed and Axiamira from receiving this pea e
with tears, fince they had fo lamentable an occafion for it; but whereas this af¬
fair direftly concerned them, they were to treat with them about it; that in the
mean time hc hdd it requifite, that one of them ftiould return to Sultama, to affure
the people that ere long they ftiould fee their lawfull Princes again ; and that the¬
reft ftiould go to Bit ilifa, to do their duty to Mabamed and Axiamira; that to
comfort thcni forthe grief which fo dolefull an accident would bring thcni Hi..-
ma fliould take rhe pains both to conduft them thither, and alfo to accompany the
Prince, Princefs, and Felixana back vA'hen they returned.   Ulama perccivinj; that
/^r4^;&gt;w in turning himfelf towards him, feemed to demand his confent for that
■which he had fpoken, aflured hira that hc vvas very ready to do it.   And whereas
he was generous, I doubt not, faid he, but the Prince and Axiamira will be fenii-
bly touched with this lofs, fmce I that am not obliged thereunto by fo ftrift bondr
and that have feen my felf the objeft of the hatred and perfecution of thofe whom
Ibcwail, cannot choofe but be grieved ac the accident which is betallen thcrn.
After that ^/^wrf had given fufficient proof of his generofity by his forrow, and
that Ibrahim had commended him for fo noble a refentment, he gave him coniniif-
fion totake care of the Deputies of 5«/f&lt;i«/^ till rhe next day, when bethought it
fit they fhould depart for to go and fetch Mahamed, which accordingly was exe¬
cuted.     Ulama parted with thofe that were to accompany him, carrying Letters
from Ibrahtm to the PrinceG i one ofthe Deputies went to Sultama, and. the
Grand Vifier remained with a joy that cannot be expreft; for whereas he was per¬
fwaded thatthe beginning of his felicity depended on the happy end of this war,
feeing the favourable means which fortune prefented him with to terminate it
fpeedily and with glory, he could not render thanks enough to heaven for foad¬
vantagious a fuccefs.    And whereas hc knew that the people generally delircd
peace, he was affured that the treaty of it would be agreeable to every body; not
knowing that Soltman had any other intereft in this war, than that of the glory of
his Arms. In ibis thought it niight be faid, that never any Lover abfdit from his
Miftrefs was fo happy as he, whilft hc entertained himfelf with fo fweet a hope.
In the mean time Ulama arrived at BitiUfa, prefented the Deputies to Prince Maha¬
med andthe Vrinceh Axiamira., and delivering Ibrahim's letter to her, and ac¬
quainting them with the lofs they had fuftained, they being generous inftandy for-
£ot allthe perfecutions they had fuffered, and no longer remembred ought but
that r^f/:'w4&lt; was their father,//w/Jf/was thdr brodicr, and Perca thdr lifter; in
the thought whereof they were extremely afflifted with their lofs. But at length,
tllama having imparted to them the generous defigns of Ibrahim, and how neceffa¬
ry their prefence was to their people for their confolation againft fo many iiiite-
rics as they had indured, they fet forth on their way. As for ^W, the fight of his
dear F.///^«^'comforted him for the lofs ofhis enemies,   and the Princes and
Princeffes forrow was to both of them their greateft difpleafure. In theend after

ruptinghiui, as tu fpeak in this tort tothem which ow their lives and libertie to
bim, ought alune to make it fuch as he pleafeth, fince it is certain that he cm doe
nothing that is unjuft. After that thefe illuftrious perfons had rendred all the civi¬
lities to one another which their generofity obliged them unto, they fell to accord
upon the Articles of this peace, vvhich were fo advantageous for the two Lmpire?,
and fo glorious for Ibrahim, as the people and the fouldiers, who will meddle with
judging of all things vvithout knowledge, and outof intereft, could finde nothing
to murmure at.    This Treaty, having been figned by Axiamira, for the fupply¬
ing of ^^^^wf^-f defeft, was alfo figned by/^mA«»?, by Ulama, by the Deputies
of Sultania, and by the chiefeft of Ibrahims Army.    After this, Mahamed, who bad
alwayes loved ^.v/Vzw/r/j exceedingly, defired her that flie would Ihare in his pow¬
er, and having requefted her that ihe would be his guide, flie promifed him, that
as flie had never had a deiign to marry, fo fhe vvould neither think of it, nor aban¬
don him.    And in this manner flie fatisfied that which flic owed toher own incli¬
nation, that \A\:\&lt;ih Mahamed dtiued of her, and thatwhich the memory of Prince
GMw^friequired of her generofity.   Mahamed then 2i%]ked oi Ulama, whether he
vvould not injoy the felicity of his reign? And think not,  faid   he   unto    him,
thatfucceedingtotheSophy, I will fucceed to his pafiions ; I fhall be your Prince,
and your Friend, but i fhall never bc your Rivall. Ulama anfwered to this difcourfe
with a great deal of generofity ; and whereas the love to ones   Countrey is ffrong
enough in every mans foul; and whereas there was a very ftraght union between
all thefe illuftrious perfons; though Ulama was exceedingly obliged to the Sultan,
and that he loved Ibrahim as much as himfelf, yet he refolved to abandon his pro¬
teftor for to follow his lawfull Prince.    Things being in this eftate, Arfalon arri¬
ved luckily for himfelf, accompanied with Ofman and Alibech ; and whereas
/^r^t/j/w was prefently advertifed thereof, he went and received them, and condu¬
fted them to Axuimiraes Tent, where Mahamed was: and after he had recounted
unto them the hiftory of Arfalon, whereof the beginning was not unknown to
them; after hc had commended the generofity of 0/ilw/«« and ^//i'ei-/?, and excu¬
fed the violence of her father, he obtained this grace of the new Sophy, who in¬
gaged his word to him to reftore him to his former dignity.    In the mean time the
Articles of the Peace had been publiflied^ both in the Army, and in Sultania, with
great ligns of rejoycing on either fide; andthe hour of feparation being come,
the Sophy faid to Ibrahim, that owing his Life, his Libcrty,andthe Crown which
he was going to wear, unto him, he felt himfelf obliged to tell him, that he fliould
alwayes fiiide him ready tohazzard them forhis fervice : In fine, faid he unto him,
generous Ibr.xhim, I ow unto you not onely that which you have done for me, not
ondy the good vvhich my Empire receives from you, but alfo that which you have
done for the Princefs Axiamira, for Felixana, and for Ulama.    judge after this, if
without being ingratefull I can be meanly acknowledging.    And I profefs unto
you, added he, in taking his laft farewell of him, that rhe moft fenfible forrow
which ever my blindnefs gave me, is that vvhich I now fed, for that I cannot fee my
Proteftor.    y^ra^/wgoing to anfwer him, was  hindred  from it hy Axiamira;
Defend not your fdf, faid (be untohim, with an unjuft modefty, and permit, that
iiowatparting, we may teftifie unto you, how not finding means to   oblige you,
we are not unworthy to be obliged, (ince we know hovv to prize your vertue, and
dkcm of the rare qualities that are in you.    And for my particular , added ftie,
I hold 5o//w^«to be gieater, more mighty, and more happy in having you for his
Subjeft, than in being Mafter of fo great a number of Provinces, which make him
to be redoubted over all the earth.    You fo confound mc, Madam, anfwered Ibra-
/vw, with an high refpeft, asl cannot anfwer you ; but know, faid he , that into
what part of^ the wodd foever fortune cardes me, you fliall ever have ofme a
faithfull and paflionate fervant.   If one might be a Subjeft out of choice   vou

nothing but of withdrawing his troups out of the enemyes country ;   to the end

<p>r-rHe Illuftrious Baffa having paft the whole night without fleeping, fomuch
1 had the hope of feeing//^W/^ pleafingly entertained hmi, ^nt .is foon as the
Sun appeared to know whether Soltmau would be pleafedth.it he ftiould come wait
upon him, and render him an account of his voyage. The Sultan furprifed with
athinti which hehad not much apprehended, in regard he thought it not fo
near, gave not his anfwer fo fpeedily. He marvelled ac the grand Vihers return,
confidenng the order which he had fent him, not to come back before he heard
fromhim, what profperous fuccefs foever he fnoiild happen to have; but in Hne,
it bdng no longer time to reafon on things paft, and being conftrained to anfwer
precifely to that which vvas demanded of him, his mind was in agrcat diforder.
The name of Ibrahim, vvho vvas fo near, poffeffed him with fome remorfe of his
fault , but the thought then of lofing the Princefs, madehim inftantly repent him
offo good amotion, and with never to fee Ibrahim more, that he niight ftill re¬
tain IfabelU, whom he had not feen fince that crudl inftant, wherein out of his
fear of the Baffaes return he had joyned threatnings to entreaties, and given her
but only eight dayes time to refolve once for all, whereof fix were already paft
when as the Baffa came back to C&lt;'w/?'&lt;«^'w/'/f ; and he had been three moneths a-
•way without any news at all of hira, fo exaftly had the refolution which he had
taken for it been executed. But in fine, how violent foever Soltmans love was,
yet could he not refolve to fee Ibrahim, and keep Ifabella from hini: For wherc-
.is he had alwaies a ftrong difpofition inhis heart to gCKid , and fome thoughts
of friendlhip for the Grand Vifier, the fliarae of his crirae, the fmall hope he had
of vanquifliing Ifabella, and the fhort time he had to refolve in, made him fend
Ihrahimviovd that he might come prefently; and thatat his arrivall he fhould
find Ifabella at his Palace, whither he was going to return her : This Prince cer¬
tainly would never have yeelded to this, had he had any hope lefc of gaining the
Princeffes heart; but fince the day that hc had laft fpoken with her, and that hc
had taken great care to have her narrowly obferved, hehad learnt, that fhe was
in fo great an aftliftion, as he was afraid the extremity ofher grief would kill
her: So that confidering he (hould commit a crime to no purpofe, if he fhould
retain JfabelU, he was the more eafily induced to let her go forth ofthe Seraglio.
In this thought he would not fee her, but fent for the Sultana Afl-eria, who vvas
no fooner come to him^ but he commanded her to go and tell Jfabella, that Ibra¬
him vvas returned, and that out of an excefs of bounty he permitted her to go out
of the Seraglio ; but that fhe fliould beware of acquainting theGrand Vifier with
oughtthat he hadfaid unto her, becaufe an extrenie mifchief might thereby ar¬
rive both to him, and to her. Afieria went and executed her commiflion
with a great deal of pleafure ; for albeit flie loved IfabeUa very dearly, yet
the defire of her confervation was ftronger in her foul, tiian her own con¬
tent. The Princefs received this news with fo exceffive a joy, as her heart
was not capable of refenting it fiifficiently ; Emilia likewife was infinitely glad
ofit: At firft Jfabella could not beleeve it ; after flic had beleeved it the gain-
fayd herfelf; and flie wasfo accuftomed to misfortune, as fhe could not think
fogrcat a good hap was befallen her. In the mean time the Chariot, which
was to carry her to Jbrahims Palace, being come, ftie embraced the Sulta¬
na Afieria i promifed her that Soliman fliould have no caufe to complain of
her; gave her thanks for her goodnefs in protefting her; affured her that fliee
would never lofe the memory of it ; and then ftie got into the Ch.inot
vvith Emilia , and went to Jbrahims Palace to meet with her friends to
whom fliee gave a greater and a purer joy, than that which ftiee fdt her Vdf

of 5.W, caufed a ftately Galliot, which he knew was in the Arfenal at Pera to 1-
launched into the water; and it was for this purpofe that hee had fent one of hVs
fervants certain dayes before, to the end he ftiould give order fecredy for the ha
ving of It in a rcadiiiefs againft became. As foon then as he underftood the SukaiK
pleafure hee irabarqued himfdf, attended by all the Commaiuicrs which had acl
companied hini: and truely there was never a more magnificent or more .'.prccabL-
objeft: feen than this Galliot, efpecially when Ibrahm was abord it.    All that was
looked upon was painted and gilt; the whole Poop was hung with Perfian Tape¬
ftry, whofe ground was gold ;  it was covered all over with if aggs and ftreamersof
divers colours; all the flaves that rowed were faftned with filver chaines, and all
of them had garments of cloth of gold; twelve Trumpeters were on the Courfey
cloathcd in velvet, whofc ground was gold; all the Commanders appardl was
imbroidered vvith pearles and diamonds; and in the midft ofthis ftately troup
ftood/^r^^&lt;»» alone, though be had fixgreatcufliionsof cloth of gold at his feet;
He held in his hand a battoun of command, and was fo fuperbly apparelled, as it
■was eafie to perceive that this petty triumph was an effeft of peace, fince richcsand
abundance were every where feen, and very few marks of war.    Jbrahim hid thar
day on a robe of cloth of filver, imbroidered with gola and diamonds, intermixed
with certain carnation filk twift, which added very much to the beauty of that ha¬
bit ; His turbant was covered all over with carnation and white plumes of feathers,
fet up with jewels of diamonds of an ineftimable value ; His Scymitar, and the
golden   chaines  whereunto   it was faftned, were anfwerable to the gorgeouf-
3iefs ofhis garment: now akhough filk , iilver, gold, pearl, and diamonds richly
appeared there, yet might itbc faid with truth,that Ibrahim gave rather a new lufter
to all thofe things, than that he recivcd any from thera. His fliapc was goodly, well
made, and advantageous ; his cariage free and noble; his face ovall; his eyes black,
and full of fire and fweetnefs; his mouth agreeable; his complexion neither too de¬
licate, nor too grofs, neither too pale, nor too rcdj but fuch as M.in is painted,
■when ashc is amoroufly reprefented unto us; His hayr wasofchcfnut color; and
his nofe fomwhat aquilin, yet fo as it ferved to give him the better afpeft; His phy¬
fiognomy was promifing and fprightfull; his foul was feen in his eyes, his courage
and his affabilitic appeared equally in them; and without having ought of the
beauty ofa woman, hc was the goodlieft man that ever was beheld. In tine there
■was feen in his whole perfon, a lofty ayr without pride, a gallanterie without af¬
feftation, a iieglcftfull handfomnefs, a frcenefs without artitice, a civility without
conftraint, and fomthing fo great and fo high therein, as one could not behold him
without judging him worthy to wear a crown. All thefe naturall graces had a new
luftre the day wherein Ibrahim entred into Conflavtmeople, and the hope of feeing
/f^^f//4 had painted fuch a joy in his face, as gave him a certain cxtiaordinarya-

length Ibrahims Galliot being come lb near, as it permitted him te) difcern Soliman,
who was leaning on the Baluftrade, he faluted him vv/ith a profound relpeft, auel
being landed, all the people redoubled their (bouts.    The moft confiderable ap¬
proached to falute him, and they that could not do fo, did at the leaft: what they
could tobe feen of hini.    After that   this multitude had flifhcieiitly cunfidercd
him, vvhom they acknowledged for their Proteftor, Ibrahim, followed by all the
Grandees, and all thepeople, went to the Seraglio, where he entred alone ;  for
Soliman iteXin^ the diforder of his foul, vvould not give hini any but a private:
Audience. Whcnas he  was come into the Sultans chamber, Soliman could not
chufe but be fomewhat glad, yet was he poffdfed with confufion at the very fame
inftant,  and received not the Baffa with ;^hat freenefs, wherewith hc was wont to
teftifie the aifeftiun which he bore him.    Before time, he would rather haye fpoken
to him ofthe grief his abfencc had been the caufe of to him; of the fear he was i»
for him ; of the health of IfabelU; and of the   joy he had for his return ;   than
of affairs of State: but in this encounter, he would needs have him at the very
firft render him an accompt of the War;   and although hc had refolved to give I-
brahim no marks of the diforder of his foul, yet could he not forbear it.    In the
midft of his relation hc asked ofhim, whether he hadnot received a new order
which hehad lent him?   AndvAiems Ibrahint had affured him that he hadnot
he fcemed to be vexed at ir, without telling hini what it was :    And at fuch time
as the Grand Vilicr had informed him, how advantageous the peace which he had
made in Perfia was for him, he CQuld not chufe but tdl him things, which might
make him judge, that hc would have been glad he had not terminated the War as

Roxlana and Rnfi-an had periwaded him from making a Peace fo fbon.This thoui?ht

that they have not been in vain, fince I can affure you, that my voyagehath been

tourbeautifull companions of the infortunate Ifabella, who each of them in their
pardcularniadehinia complement; and then Ibrahim having lent the Pnncefs
his hand, this fair troop entred into the Palace, and went to Ifabellaes chzmhzr
It was there where thefe illuftrious friends teftiiied the true thoughts which they
had for one another; Ibrahim neverthelefs marvelled to fee fewer marks of joy

VAgnaes zndLeomraes de^loT^le de^th.    You fee, faid IfabelU tohim then iioh-

as   in   civility    he  could   fpeak to her without  being   heard, not to   lofe
the occafion   for   it,   which    inftantly prefented it felf.    For all thofe  per¬

that after a long abfence it would have been fome inhumanity to keep two
hearts that loved one another fo perfeftly,  from communicating their thoughts
in private; fo that prefently after they were rifen from meat, fome went into
the Cabinet, fome into the Gallery, and ?..4^w/7/V« alone  remained in a corner of
the chamber with the French Marquis.    In the raean time IfubclU was not with¬
out unquietnefs, the remembrance of what Solman had faid to her poffeffed all
her foul, andthe incertainty wherein fhe was, whether fhe fliould impart it to

mufing' May I, faid he unto her. Madam, without lofing the refpeft which I owe
unto you, coraplain to you of your felf,  in reproaching you for thac you have
notasrauch joy for my return, as yoa had grief for niy departure?   If this be a
crime, faid the Princefs, it is true that I am guilty of it; yet can I affure you, ad¬
ded (hc, that it is not occafioned by any defeft of affeftion, but by an habit which I
have gotten of mdancholy, I am afflifted more eafily than I am comforted ; I am
raore fenfible of grief, than of joy; and in the eftate wherein I finde my icM,
there needs more things by far to content mc , than there needs to render me infi¬
nitely unhappy. It is iiot,continued flie, becauft your return doth not give mc all
the joy thac I aai capable of, and even to that height, as without this remedy I an\
perfwaded I fliould not have lived long ; but in conclufion wc are at Confiantinople,
and that is no litde evill.  Jbrahim hearing IfabelU fpeak in this fort,and obferving
her eyes and her face, hc contirnicd himfelf yet more in the opinion which he had ;
fo that to be the betcer cleared therein, I confefs, faid he unto her, that we arc al¬
wayes neerer to bad fortune, than to good; but you rauft confefs unto mc withall,
that untill fuch dme as .bV;»;/i« hath refufed us the liberty which I ara to ask of
him, you havenot foniuch caufe to be melancholick, as you had whenl parted
for Perfia.    The event of the war was doubtfull; it might have been long; I mighc
have been beaten ; I might have dyed there; and flncc none of thcfc hath hapned,
and that I may juftly demand my liberty for a recompence, why do I, Madam, fee
mor: figns of grief in your rainde, than when we had all to fear, and noching to
hope for?   The Princefs not anfwering precifely to Jbrahim, began to make him
partake her unquietnefs.     He believed then that he was raore unhappy than he
thoughc hc was; and fuddenly calling to rainde the change which he had noted in
5o//w4«x face, he no longer doubted but that there was foraething which Ifabella
did not tdl hira.    What accident, faid he unto her, Madara, is befallen us ? Hath
fortune invented fome new torment to perfecute us withall? Speak I earneftly
befecch you, and whatfoever itmay be, be pleafed to let me know it.    Jfabella
would then have put him off, with affuring hira that (he had no new matter to ac¬
quaint him vvith ; but the more (he ftood off, the more unquietnefs flie gave him :
Wherefore he began to caft in his minde what the mifchiefmight be, which would
not bc told him; Hath any one, faid he unto her, wronged you during my abfence^
hath any body confpired againft your li'c ? hath the hate which Ro.xeUnahe^iV^ me,
carried her to feek the means to hurt you ? would flie have facdfifcdyou to her
revenge, as flic hath facrififcd Pdnce Mufiapha to her rage ?  would they have for¬
ced you to change your Rdigion ? hath Ruflan plotted any thing againft rae ? and
(that which would be ray laft mifery, and which I think cannot poffibly be) is Sdli^
man becorae ray Rivall, or mine Enemy &gt; The Princefs thereupon not able to retaiti
her tears, put her hand before her eyes to conceal them from Ibrahim.   Ah ' Ma¬
dam, faid hc unto her then, gently pulling doWn her arra, do you anfwer mc with
tears? can it be poflible, that this Pdnce ftiould hate me, or loVe you too much?
leave me not long in pain, and I befeech you, Madara, exprefs your felf more clear-

IS no time to fpeak of that which is paft, faid the Pnncefs unto him, but to think of
thatwhich is to come. Ibrahim wz&amp; not for allthat in an eftate to give counfaile
for his minde was filled with fo many feverall thoughts, as hee fcaicdy underftood
what Ifabella faid unto bim.   He vvas poffeffed with grief, anger, and repentance •
hatred and jeloulie had alfo fome place in his foul; ncverthdefs in the midft ofhis
tranfports, and although the interedoi Ijabella prevailed over all others, yet had
he loved Solimanio much, that there were tome inftants, wherein without confide¬
ring Ifabella, and without confidering himfdf, he was afflifted for that this Prince
had given this blemifli to his life. But when as he furprifed himfelf in this thought
hc repented ofit, as ofa crime, and recntrcd into his former fury.    At length after
that Ifabella and he had faid all that their griefand affeftion could fuggeftrand that
the Princefs had related to Ibrahim all that flie beleeved vvas neceffary hee fliould
know, the better to advife on that which they h.id to doe,they found that their rea¬
fon was too much troubled, and they themfelves too much intcreffed in the bufi¬
nefs in queftion, for to judge fbtindly thereof    They rdolved then to call unto
this counfell, both their he and fhe friends; to the end that all ofthcra together
might feek out the meanes to avoyd the mifchief that menaced them.    IfabelU iox:
that effeft willed Emilia to czW them, and the French Marquis taking this imploy-
mentuponhini, brought this fair troup alittle after into the Princefs chamber,
ivho with teares in her eyes craved pardon of her deer friends, for having made .i
fecret to them of a thing, which flic would fain have concealed from herfelf; and
then, having recounted the eftate wherein (hee was with .Soliman, flie filled thdr
hearts with grief, both for the intereft which they had in her fortune, and for thdr
own ; knowing very well that their liberty depended on Ibrahim and Ifabella, vvho
being at odds themfelves vvith Soliman,'were not like to obtain that for others,vvhich
they could not obtain for therafelves.    This mifery rhen being common, they all
fell to think ofwhat niight bcdoiie.    Some would have Ibrahim, without teftify¬
ing any knowledge of this unjuft love, purfue his firft defignc, and demand his
lihcnyoi Solman, becaufe, faid they, it may be that this Prince bdng afliamed of
his fault, and incenfed with Ifabellas conftancie, will grant him his rcqueft, and re¬
folvc to deprive himfelf ofthe fight of a man whom he can no longer look upon
but with confufion, and of a perfon, whom it is impoflible for him to conquer. But
Ibrahim oppofed this opinion; for whereas he knew Salman full wdl, he vvas fure
that love being (aicc entred into his heart, would never goe out ofit again but with
violence; andthat hecould not be capable of repenting, but v/henas the cnmes
Tvbich love made him commit, were far greater than his paflion. Then it was pro¬
pounded, that no refoludon ftiould be taken, till the dght daye.s which Solman
had given IfabelU to make her anfwer in, were expired; becaufe the fight oUh-a-
him it iiiicht be had revived the fnendftiip which he bore him, and had banifhcd,or
dimifticd the lovc which he carried to her.    But if Ibrahim was oppoute to the hrlt

<p>but two reniidies to be chofen, cithcrdeath or flight, The laft is the belt, replyed
the Marquis, .and ifl raay bc beleeved , it IhiU be the only thing we will think of.
This advife having been found the fureft and the ealicft, there was nothing m^ore
thought of, than of feeking out the meanes to extent; it.    It was not becaufe Ibra¬
him did not upon the firft apprehenfion of it follow this opinion with repugnancy,
but becaufe he was perfwaded, that a Prince, who coram iticd fogrcat an infidelity
againft hira,could not coraplain of hira with reafon for his going out of his Erapire
vvithout his confent.    In this thought hcconfidcred with the reft, which way they
might draw therafelves out of captivity; in theend the refolution was, that Ibra¬
him, being able to doe what he would, ftiould fecretly affure himfdf of a veffell;
and that untill it was ready to part, he Ihould fee Salman as often as poflible hee
could, and take great care to keep him from fufpefting that Ifabella had fpoken to
him ofhis lovc to her.   The reft ofthe day being fpent in this fort, the nexe mpr-
ning the Grand Vifier having underftood that there was a Chriftian Vcffell which
was to fet fail theday enfuing, wrought in fuch manner as hc abfolutely affured
himfelf of her ; and without any bodies being aware of it, he caufed a great raa¬
ny Chriftian flaves, which were newly delivered, to enter into her.    After hc had
taken this order, he went tofee Soltman again, but it was with fo rauch repugnan-
c^ie, as it fdl out well for hira that he did not fee hira ;  it being raoft certain, that
•w)hcreas hewas  not accuftomed to difguife his thoughts, it would have been
impoffible for him not to have teftified fomewhat of that vvhich he had in his
heart. When hc arrived at the Seraglio,  he was told thac the Grand Signior vvas
at the Sultana Queens lodging ; andwhereas it was the onely place in the outward
Seraglio, where Ibrahim entred not, he returned to his Palacc;  and there as long
as the day lafted, he received the vifits of all the Baffaes, Beglerbei s, and Sangiacs,
that were at Confiantinople.    Inthe mean tirae .S&lt;7/;&gt;»4« wasnot vvithout unquiet¬
nefs, he would willingly have had Ibrahim alwaies with him, to keep him from
being viith Jfabella, and would willingly withall never have feen him, fince he
could not do fo without being afliamed ofhis fault; and indeed it was out of this
confideration that hewas gone to the Sultanaes lodging, that he might decline
the fight of hira.    It was not becaufe his mind was quieter in that place than in
another; for he carryed his torraent in his heart.    His love, Jfabellaes conftancy,
and J^M^/w/return, poffeffcd hira with ftrange thoughts; and in the diforder
wherein his foul was, hc made wiflies againft his own glory, and would that Jbra¬
him had been beaten in Perfia ; that his Array had been defeated ; and that with a
^vvafull pretext he could banifti him from the Port,and retain Jfabella.lt yvis not
becaufe he knew not rhat his defigns were unjuft, but  it was becaufe his paffion
was inftead of reafon to hira, and made hira deal inthis fort.    Roxelana on her
fide was not in a little pain; (he fnw JfabeU.t out oi the Seraglio j and albeit the
Slave, her confident, had affured her, that Soliman had not changed his mind for
this Princefs, yet flic feared that feeing her no longer,' and feeing Jbrahim, the love
which hc bare to Jfabella  would diminifli, and that his good will to the Baffa
would reaffume new forces. Howbeit flic hoped that Jfabella would acquaint the
Grand Vifier with the love diat the Sultan bore her; and that thereupon fie would
do fomething which might give him opportunity to ruin hira. In this belief an
hour after JfabelU was gone oue of the Seraglio flic fenc to Will  Rufian that he
fliould carefully obferve all Jbrahims aftibns by the farae Slave which before dmes
had informed him ofthe Love that he carried to Jfabella.    Rufian obeyed her fo
cxaftly, that what care focvcr theGrand Vifier took to conceal his defiffri    vet
did he fufpeft it.   Firft hc underftood that the Baffa had enquired, whether

^oxelanah^d no fooner received it, but ftie went her felf without further confl.lt-
ing to acquaint Soliman with what Rufian had ceaified ; and whereas this Pnnce,
blinded by his paffion,fbught but for a pretext to complain oijhahm, he hearkned
to her with a great deal of impatience, which Ro.xelana having obferved, flie made
ufe of the occafion, and told him, how flie had a long time known that Jbrahim fa¬
voured the Chnftians; that without doubt he had fome hidden defign,which could
not be comprehended ; and adding yet more to that which Rufian had wntten, fre
fo wrought, that Solman, to bc cleared in the bufinefs, rdolved to fend to Jbrahms
Palacc for him. And whereas there vvas no body about him whom hc judged tit for
it, Roxelana having propounded Rufian unto hira, who flie faid was at the gate of
the Seraglio, he confented thereunto ; and having caufed him to enter, the Sultan
commanded him to go to Jbrahims Palace, and will hira to come prefently to him.
For Soliman doubted not, if it were true that he had caufed a veffell to be made
ready, but that it was iox Jfabella,   or for his friends; and that fo, which foever ic
■were, he fliould have (^according to the mind he was in^a juft occafion to ruin Jhra-
him. But Rufian was not like to find him at home ; for as foon as it was night, he
had caufed Jfabella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia, with the reft oftheir troup
to go fecretly out ofhis Palace ; and he hinifelf had got out after thera thorough a
door of his Garden, which was towards the Port, to erabarquc himfelf in that
veflTell which he had made to be prepared, and whereof the Cuptain and the Pilot
■were abfoliitely his, by means ofthe raony which he had caufed to be given to thcni.
Before his departure he had written a Letter to ^c^/iw^^, and had left it with one
ofhis fervants, with order, that if any one came to ask for hira frora the Grand Sig¬
nior, to deliver it unto him; fothat ^«/?^« arriving at his houfe, found hira not.
It was in vain that he enquired after him , and what care focvcr hc took for it, he
could learn no other, than that hc was not in his Palacc , that JfabelU, his friends,
and her friends, were not there neither; and that he had left a Letter for the Grand
Signior. Rufian having taken it, fent to the Port to learn whether any veffell had
fet fail, and then went in all haft to the Sultan,to acquaint hira with Jbrahims flight,
and prefent him with the Letter which he had written to him ; for hc durft not
conceal it, though gladly he would, becaufe ra.iny had feen it delivered tohim.
My Lord,faid he when he was come unco him,Jbrahim is no longer at Confiantinople.
This fpeech amazed Soliman; but when he knew thzt Jfabella vvas out ofhis power
he feha redoubling of love, jealoufie, anger, hatred, difpair, and fury. And when
as Rufian had given him Jbrahims Letter, he broke up the feal with violcnce,and not
knowing whether he ftiould read or tear it, hc ftood a pretty while without fpeak¬
ing; but at length carded by his curiofity, or rather by his paflion, he opened it
lighing, and found that it was thus.

ted his fury the raore. Let this ingratefull wretch, faid hc to Rufian, be purfued ,
and let all that is poflible bc done to return him into ray power.   Roxelana entring
hereupon into Solim.ins chamber, from whence flic had gone a little after Rufians
departure, and perceiving his mind to be in the tcarms wherein &lt;flie had long de¬
fired to have it, provoked his anger yet more; and propounded untohim the im¬
ploying of Rufian in the purfuit of Jbrahim : But that which flie thought cunning¬
ly to do fucceeded not with her ;  her intention was fo to ufe the raatter, as Rufian
fliould nothnd Jlirahim : For whereas her intereft was, that be fhould no longer
have power, nor be longer at the Port, fhe feared if he fliould be brought back a-
gain, that fhe fliould not oblige ^o/w^« to ruin hini uttetly ; andfo hemight re¬
turn into grace again.   Howbeit this defign was not executed; for befides that fhe
could not fpeak with Rufian in private, the Grand Signiorfo abfolutdy comman¬
ded him to bring hira back Ibrahimund JfabelU, or never to return, as fhe vvas
conftrained to let hini go without faying any thing tohim.   He wenc then in all
haft to take a Galley to purfue him, becaufe hc had underftood from him whom
he had fent to the Port, that a Chriftian veffell had fet fayl by the Grand Vifiers
order a little before. He imbarqucd himfelf then with all the fpeed that poffibly
he could; and not doubting but that he took the way of the Archipelago, he made
his Pilot hold the fame courfe.   In the mean time Soliman wasnot without un¬
quietnefs; the privation of a good whichhe ardently defired, made him  regard
it as a thing yet more precious; IfabelU appeared to him more amiable than ever
hehad feen her; yea he beleeved thatit may be he might one day have won her
heart; and in this belief hc was infinitely afflifted. He looked upon Jbrahim with
hatred, and this Prince was fo unjuft, as no longer to remember cither his merit,
his courage, or the friendfhip he had born hira ; nor to confider him inthis oc¬
cafion but as his Rivall, and as a man who had ftollen a perfon from him, of whom
he was infinitely amorous.    In this unjuft thought he termed him ingratefull, he
called him ravilher, unfaithfull, and perfideous; and thinking of nothing but how
to find out means to ruin him, outof a fenfe of jealoulie hefaid, Were I fure that
I fliould never touch the heart oi Jfabella, yet 1 fliall alwaies have this advantage,
if they be brought back to mc again, thatl can feparate them for ever ; and I ftiall
at leaftwife have this fatisfaftion, that if 7y4^&lt;r//«be not mine, ftie ftiall never be
anybodies elfe.    WhiJft Soliman was incenfing his fury and his rage, Jfabella and
that dear troup, which flie loved fo rauch, were already thinking of giving thanks
to Heaven for their deliverance.    For  whereas they had embarqued'themfelves at
the beginning of the night, they beleeved that when their flight came the next day
to be known, they fliould be then far enough off frora being taken any more •   So
thn Jfabellaes raind was quiet enough   ; and the hope of^bcing foon out of the
Grand Signiors power, entertained her fo agreeably, as fear had foarcely any place

device failed not to work the expefted effeft; for Ibrahim knowing that there
were on both fides of this ftraight forty pieces of Ordnance planted even wit h the
■water, which without doubt would after this fignall difcharge upon him if he at¬
tempted to pafs, found himfelf ftrangdy troubled. For of one fide he feared left
hecould fee //&lt;t^f//&lt;J carried away wich a Cannon- fhot; on the other, Rufians vio-
lence \yas little lefs terrible to hini; and in this unquietnefs he commanded his Pi¬
lot to doe one thing, and byandby unfayedit again. IfabelU would have had
them expofe themfelves rather to the fury of the Cannon, than to fight with Ru¬
flan ; but they were not long in an eftate to choofe what they had to doc; for this
Galley which purfued them having overtaken them, and fpite of their utmoft in¬

fented themfelves againft him, fell prcfendy dead, cither at his feet, or into the
Sea. All Rufians fouldiers fled from his incounter, and chofe rather to fet upon
ten others, than defend themfelves from him alone. In the mean time frcfli fuccor

piece-which he had caufed to be ftiot off, came inFdgotswith agreat number of
fouldiers to fee what the matter was; and finding a Chriftian Veffell fet upon by
Turks, they never inquired further, but joyned with them; M^d Ibrahim feeing his

conftrained to doe; fbr Jbrahim fighting no longer, and being loaden with chains
by Rttfians comniandment, they had all the enemies upon them ; fo that fight how
they could, number prevailed over valour, and Rufian made hitnfelf Maffer of the
Veffell, and of the perfons whom he fought for ; and having forced them to pafs
into his Galley he returned to Confiantinople.    Thefe infortunate ones had yet the
contblation to make this voyage together without being feparated; for Rufian,
bufied about ftopping theblood which he loft at the wound hc had rcceived,had not
the inhumanity to keep them from talking together.    Jbrahim was likewife as well
as Horatio, Alphonfo, Doria, and the French Marquis, loaden with chains,   which
had been knocked off from fome of thofe flaves, who had been the caufe of their
taking by rowing with fuch fpeed. JfabelU and her friend?, being with thera, and
not able to fuccour them, augmented their torments yec more with the extreme af¬

death would be the greateft mifery that can arrive unto me in the place whither wc

the malice of our perfecutors ftiall make you beleeve nothing to my prejudice' Ah '
Madam, ci yed Ibrahim, it is for me to demand this favour of you; for whereas I
have not rendred you fo many markes of niy affeftion, as I have received from
your vertue, you may the mere eafily doubt ofit.    But beleeve. Madam, that I will

your liberty, as I purpofe to befeech it ofhim, 1 fliall dye even with pleafiire.   Let
us not feparate our deftinies, anfwered the Pnncefs; either let us live toaether, or
let us dye together.   After fofad a difcourfe, the excefs of thdr affeftion forced
them to hold their peace; and their difpleafure being fliut up in thdr heart, they
feltic more vively than they did, whom as they eafed themfelves with their com¬
plaints.    The unhappinefs ofthe perfons which were ingaged in their misfortune
afflifted them the niore;aiid they faw all about them fo many occafions ofdifpair,as
it niight be faid, that never was the vertue ofa perfon put to fo hard a triall.   Hi¬
polita, Sophronia, Emilia, and Leonida, were wholy diffolved into teares; Alphonfo
Doria, Horatio, and the French Marquis, were alfo intinitdy afflifted : and if Ruftan
could have been touched with  any compaflion,   hee had been doubtlefs with
fo lamentable   an objeft.    But far  from  having  any   humanity for another,
he was cruell to himfelf} for though he were wounded, yet the defire which
he had to deftroy  Ibrahim, and to finifli a thing which he had fo well begun,
made hira in ftead of repayring to his houfe to look to his wound, to goe di¬
reftly to the Serraglio affoon as hc arrived   at Conftantinople,   and to   behave
himfelf fo as ifhe had not been hurt at all. Prefently upon his landing, hee fent to
advertife Soliman ofhis return, and ofthe facccfs ofhis voyage. And whereas this
Prince had increafed his fury with his folitarinefs, he inftantly commanded, that
Ibrahim and Ifabella fhould be brought into the Seraglio , and put into feverall pla¬
ces with a fure guard; and that all thofe which had follcwved them fliould bee put
likewife into another place.    Never was fo deplorable a thing feen,as theexecution
ofthis commandment; Ifabella would not quit Ibrahim, he too would not abandon
her; and though they had well enough forefeen that they fliould be feparated, yet
could they not for all that confent thereunto.    Their frends likewife would not
leave them, and ii Soliman could have been a fpcftator.offb fad a converfation, hee
might peradventure have been moved to piety.    But at length/(^/-/e/i/w znd Ija¬

farwell of each other, as perfons that were never to fee one another again ; and fol¬
lowing each other with their eyes as far as they could, they fware unto themfdves
to dye loving one another as faithfully as they had mutually proraifed.    After
Ruftan had condufted Ibrahim to one quarter ot the Seraglio, caufed IfabelU to bee

And chen, continued he,if h t could perfwade m: to it,that would be yec a further rea¬
lon to oblige mc to deftroy him.  Ic behoves he thould die ouc of reafon of State, as I
pretend he ftiall die out of reafon of Love. If I regard him as a flave, I have power o-
ver his life,finceevery flivethat breaks his irons deferves to lole it. if I regard him as
myfLibjcft,hc is worthy ofdeath for going out ofmy Eni^iiie withouc niy confent.
If Iregard himas a Chdftian, I cannot hate him enough; andif I confider him as an
Eueiiiy-Prince,ic behoves he fhould die,that the end of his life may make an end of fci"
ling my Throne to ray fucceffors. Soliman having,as it feeraed to hira, feded his refo¬
lution firmly enougli,fdc fome reft in his minde.Howbeit fuddenly fome beam of light
coming to him again, he was aftiamed ofhis own thoughts; yet would he not oppofe
them, but rather fought how he might fordfie them ; neverthelefs there was one thing
that retained his fury for a while: Suppo(e,faid he, that I refolve to deftroy Jbrahim;
thathe be already puniflied forhis ingratitude and perfidioufnefs-, that the end ofhis
life hath ended the lovc which he bears to Jfabella ; let us fee  afterthis, whether
in thinking to do our felf fervice, wc do not hurt our felf: For can flie love a Prince,
who bereaves her ofthe perfon that is deareft to her in the world ? But can fhe, con¬
tinued he, love any other thai^ Ibrahim, as long as he is living? No, no, fayd
he raifing   his  voyce , it  behoves  hee  fliould dye  ; and   I fliall  alwayes have
this confolation ,   that if  fhee  love noc mee,    fhee fhall at  leaftwife love no¬
thing in the world.   But Ccricd he again,  after he had continued a while without
fpeakingj hc whom I will deftroy, is the fame Jbrahim who hath done me fuch impor¬
tant fervice, and whora I have fo rauch loved; howbeit, continued he, it is Jfabellaes
Lover; it is a fugitive flavc;it is a revolted fubjeft; it is a Prince my enemy; or itmay be
an irapoftor.In fuch like thoughts as thefe was the Grand Signior,when as Ruftan came
to hira, who ou.t ofhis raalice carried hira to further violence againft Jbrahim, by for¬
ging matters,vvhich he affimied hc had heard hira fpeak againft hira. Prefently therup-
on Roxelana entred, who, raaking as ifflie did not know, that there was any intereft of
love in the hatred which Soliman bore to Jbrahim , fpake not but of the good ofthe
Scate,and ofthe glory ofthe Erapire. She reprefented to Soliman, how mightily hehad
alwaies protefted the Chriftians in all occafions that had been prefented; as indeed ftie
lyed not. But although the moft part ofthofe things were done by Solimans confent in
the favor oijbr.thim, yet was this Prince fo unjuft, as to hearken to this accufation, a&amp;
if hehad been acquainted with new criraes.   After then that this wicked Woraan had
made him refolve to put Jbrahim to death, flie told him moreover,that if haft were not
made to take away his life,the people undoubtedly would rife to fave him;for,faid flie,
ouc ofthe defign w.iich hc hith had to ufurp the Empire, he hath alwaies taken great
care to make hirafelf to be beloved oi them. Selimanieeing hinifelf upon the poinc of
abfolutdy refolving the raatter,fdt a new corabat in his heart; lovc, hatred, jcaloufie ,
frieiidfliip,fliame,andglory,did their laft and uttcrnic ft endeavor to vanquifli one ano¬
ther; but at length vertue was furmounted in this occafion by the wickednefs of Roxe¬
lana and Rufian : And Soliman confented that without further delay he ftiould go and
execute this fatall fcntence, which their hatred,rather than hc, pronounced againft the
illuftdous J^r^W. Away hcwcnt with agreat deal of fpeed, for fear left the Sultan
fliould alter his mind.   Neverthelefs not dadng wholly to fail in the ufuall form    he
fent iot Jbrahim to conic to fupper; and this perfidious wretch, who feared a revolt
kept all that were in the Seraglio frora going forth. In the raean tirae Jbrahm bdns fet
at table as the reft, Rufian in the midft of the meal prefented him with a robe of black
velvet, which was an undoubted mark, that the end of diis fatal feaft fliould be the end
ofhis life : For after thismanner is the news ofdeath denounced to perfons ofquali
ty, that are to lofe their lives in the Seraglio. Jbrahim feeing his ruin cercain, received
this robe for all that with a great deal of conftancie.   And whereas dt   was Drcfenrp.f

jeft poffeft all thofe that confidered it, with te-rorand pi tic,//^r^W feemed no more

<p>The Sultana, who was not fo fcrupulous as Soliman, nor made fo exaft a profeffion of
keeping her word,did what flie could to perfwade him not to keep his. No, faid he unto h; r,
I may not fail in it ; and had I promifed my Empire and my Liberty, I fhould defcend from

oi the Muphti, whoflieknew was abfolutely hers, as having gotten him the place which he
held during/^r^ibjw's abfence. And a\bdt Soliman did not think that this man could find
out any thing that would fatisfie him, yet he fent for him. When he was come, and that
Roxelana, in propounding the matter unto him, had dextroufly fignified to him that flie de¬
fired the death oi Ibrahim; this man, who naturally had wit, malice, and cunning, was ncver¬
thdefs fufficiently troubled to anfwer precifely unto that which was demanded ofhim for the
contenting oi Roxelana. He (aid then that this affair was not to be fpoken of precipitoufly;
and having required an hours time to think of it, after he hsd caufed Soliman to repeat unto
him the very fame words, which he had before-time ufed to Ibrahim, he fdl deeply a mufing:
But he was not long in fearching out that which he did not think to find; My Lord, faid he to
Soliman, the Prophet, whom we worfhip, hath no^doubt inspired me with that which I
am going to tell thy Highnefs, that thou mayft be able to punifh him whom thou wouldfi:
deftroy. And when as SeUman had asked him how he thought to perform that which he faid,
he obliged him to repeat once more unto him the promifc which h« had made to Ibrahim. I re¬
member it but too wdl, anfwered the Sultan, and lo the very words which I fpake. Re¬
member (faid I unto him) hare I fwear unto thee by kLL h., that as long as Soliman lives^
tkott fiialt not dye a violent death. This fufticeth, replyed the Muphti, for, my Lord, to
exprefs my thought to thy Highnefs; is it not true, that the promife, which thou haft raade
to Ibrahim, is a thing which cannot fecure him but only during thy life ? and is it not cer¬
tain, that thy Succeffors fhould not be obliged to preferve hira i* It being fo, my Lord, faid
he unto him, it will not be hard for me to content thee. For thy Highnefs having promifed
Ibrahim, that he (hall not dye a violent death, as longas Soliman lives ^ iff Can make it ap¬
pear to thee, that there are every day fome hours, wherein Soliman doth not live, it will ap¬
pear to thee by the fame reafon, that during the faid time Ibrahim may dye,without breaking
of thy Highnefs word.

<p>The J'w/f^jw hearing him fpeak thus, beleeved that this man knew not very wdl what he
would fay; but the ocher noching daunted, and fpeaking to him with as much confidence,
as ifhe had been infpired from Heaven; My Lord, faid he unto him, it is a matter whereof
nobody is ignorant, that Sleep is called the brother of Death by all Nations, and in all Lan¬
guages; and truly it is not without caiife thathe is termed fo, it being certain, that a man
which is afleep cannot with reafon be faid to be living, fince we fee thathe is deprived ofall
ths funftions of a reafonable lite, which alone is thelife ofman: I confefs indeed how in
that eftate he ftill enjoys the life of plants, but not that of man, which confifts not but in the
ufe of Reafon, whereof he is wholly bereft in that eftate. Sleep equals Kings and Shepherds
as well as Death, the ftupid and the witty, thehappy and the unhappy, good raen and bad ;
and there IS no difference feen between them, buc chacfl;epis aihoct death, and death an
eternal fl;ep. Wherefore it being evident, that a m^n afleep cannpt (to fpeak reafonably)
be faid to be living, I conclude from thence, that thy Highnefs, without breaking thy word
may take away Ibrahim'^ life when as fleep hach throughly benummed thy fenfe and Reafon!
^».rf/4«4 failed not to approve of this advice, and maintained thac he had fpoken judicioufly]
mioxSoltmrn, he yielded notwith fo much facility; he made many objeftions to the
Mnphti, whereunto he ftill anfwered, with as much cunning as wickednefs.

<p>Thas, although this Prince hid a very piercing wit in all other things, yet the defire which
he had to mtke^my Ibrahim, perfwaded him that the yl/a;)!;^* had Reafon; and that he
might put the grand Vifier to death when he was afleep. For, this wicked man faid to him
thy Highnefs hath not abfolutely promifed him, not to put him to death, but only, that he
Jhould not dye a violent death, as long as Soltman lives, and Soliman (hall not lire,' when as
the Baffa (hall dye. This defign being conduded, it was refolved, that they ftiould tarry till
night was come for the executing of it. For whereas fleep is not a voluntary aft, they thoueht
it requifite to attend till the time of fleep was come.
</p>
<p>In the mean feafon Ibrahim had been broughc back to the place which ferved him for a
prifon, not knowing whether grace would bc fhewed him, or whethei bis execution was but
deferred. This incertainty was almoft: as difpleafing, as the affurance ofan approaching death
had been grievous to him; yet did he not ask any thkig that regarded himfdf direftly, but only
enquired after Ifabella, who on her part was not without a wodd of grief, siie had under¬
ftood, thn Ibrahim had been lead to a place, where oftentimes thegrandFifiers hiibtm
deprived of their lives, and that made her to be as much afflifted, as if flbe had already feen
him breathe out hts laft. It may be, faid (he, that now whil'ft I am fpeaking fu/iiniano is
defending himfdf againft his Executioners; it maybe he is yielding up his laft breath, and is
thinking of me once for all. Ah I if it be fo, ayed fhe, I befeech Heaven at leaftwife to fpare
me the afflidion that I may not hear of his lofs, and by my death to keep me from the grief
of limeating his. Howbeit I fear, faid fhe, that my prayers will not be heard, and that So¬
liman's Cfuelty will let rae live to perfecute me: But let him arm his Executioners, let hiin
invent torments, I will complain no more after this forrow; he that fhall acquaint me with
the lofs oi Juftiniano, fhall render me infenfible to all others. Alas I what fay I ? added ftie,
it feems in hearing me fpeak, that I will conferve my life after he fhall be deprived of his; no,
no, Ifabella ^'^notiwiKVii'iuftinianox; and that which the rage oi Soliman will not do,
gtief jdonc fhall execute: Let this unjuft Prince do what he will, I hope, that I fhall get out
ofhis power, by getting out ofmy life; Heaven is intereffed in the prayer which I make unto
it; I beg this grace of it to preferve mine innocence j and if my defpair be a fault, I hopeic
will pardon it in regard of the greatnefs of my misfortane, of the parity of ray affedion, and of
mine own weaknefs.
</p>
<p>In this deplorable eftate, Ifabella having underftood, that Ibrahim had been brought back
to his quarter, hope began again to find fome place in het Soul; and ftie beleeved that.yo-
liman having defired to fee him, had peradventure been moved to compaflion: Sophronia,
mpalita, Leonida, Emilia, and the reft of their Troop, which were in another place, had
the fame hope, hearing what had paft: But the matter went otherwife; for as foon as nighc '
was come, Rufian, who wholly governed this deadly ceremony, went himfelf a fecond time
to ietch Ibrahim by ±z Grand Signior's Command. He led him then into thefame HaU,
where formerly he had been; and having left him in the company of four mutes, which were
to ftrangle him, as foon as ^('//w-iw was afleep, he returned to this Prince, whohadatthat
time no greater a longing then to make away Ibrahim. As for him, although he did not feat
death, and was exceeding peaceable, yet had his Soul g'^e^ag.tanons. Ah faidhe o h.m.

</p>
<p>Hereat Ibrahim redoubkd his grief, and his mind feeking for new occafions to torment him,
he was taken wich a remorfe ot Confcience for having folong a time worn a Twr^jTZ-habir.
He was perfwaded that the mifery whereinto he was talkn was a punifliment for this diffcm-
bling. He thought he had been ill counfelled, and though his intention had been pure, and
that he had not done it but out of a defign to fetve Chriftendom, to whom it had been very
proficable, and that his faith had never been fliaken, yet he beleeved notwithftanding thathe
was faulty. This reflexion made him lift up his fpirit to Heaven; crave pardon for his levity j
repent him of his mifdeeds; and then pray that Ifabella's innocency might not be involved in
the chaftifement of his crirae.
</p>
<p>The lift thing that yet afflided Ibrahim was, that in his misfortune he could not find any
that would tell the Sultan that which he had refolved to requeft of him in the favor oilfa¬
bella, iot Rufian had taken order to the contrary. He had alfo by the power of Roxelana
kept every body from going ouc ot the Serraglio, afcer/^r^^/Vw was enered inco it; fothat
akhough it was known in Confiantinople, that there was fome great diforder between Soli¬
man and Ibrahim, yet the people did not fufped, that the Sultan could hate him with fo
much violence -, for it they had been of that opinion, loving Ibrahim as they did, they would
withouc doubt have fet fire on the Serraglio, rather then not have fuccored hira.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Ruflun being returned to SoLman, whofe mind was ^ull of nothing but
deadly thought?, this Prince, to fatisfie that fantaftick fcruple, which obliged him not to be¬
leeve the death of Ibrahim to be unjuft, but becanfe he had promifed him, that he fliould not
dye as long as he lived, commanded him to keep at his beds head, and to be fure not to go to
put Ibrahim to death, till he was faft afleep. Alter tliis order given, Soliman layd him down
with an intention (ifone may be permitted to fpeak fo) as it were to fummon fleep with fi¬
lence and'quietnefs. He did what he could to divert his raind frora all kind of objeds j to
the end that ceafing to think, hc might the more eafily let himfdf be vanquifhed by this invi-
fibk Enemy, who-always furmounts thofe more eafily which refift him, then thofe which
fetk him.
</p>
<p>The Sultan, being thus recolleded within himfelf, remained a while with fo much tran¬
quillity in appearance, as RaFlan beleeved that he was afleep, and that he might go and put
Jbrahim to death j But he had fcarcely made one ftep, when as this Prince rifing up in his bed.
Stay, fiid he unto him, I am noc afleep; and I will not have thee part from hence, till thou
art certain I am fo. Rufian, not daring to contradid the GrandSignior, and fearing to
make him more awake then be was, ifhe talked longer to him, only promifed him not to offer
any more to go ouc ot his chamber, till he was wtll affured that he could hear nothing. After
this Solman did yet all that he could to fleep j howbeit he had no fooner clofed his eyes, but
his unquietnefs augmented; he was vexed that he could not be mafter o f his thoughts, and
thac chat which he did to provoke fleep, was that which awakened him the more. He turned
him on one fide, and then on the other, and yet was not able to find any reft. One might
have faid that hc met with chorns every where; that the change of place redoubled his un¬
quietnefs; and whtn of purpofe he forbore from fpeaking, and complaining aloud, his fighs
gave Ruftan but too many figns thac he was not afleep. Soliman'^ impatience growing
ftronger, he thought if he walked a white, chat it may be he (hould become drowzy wittt
wearinefs: He got ouc ofhis bed chen, and walking fomecimes wich violence, and fometimes
with lefs precipicanon, it might have been faid, that he was the caufe of as much unquietnefs
to Ruftan, as he f U himfdf, to fee that he gave him not the means to execute the defires of
the cruel Roxelana. He ftood ftill many timej, and then began again to walk fafter then he
had done. Afterwards he leaned down in one place, and then in another, fcarcdy knowing
what he did, nor what he would do. When as he had walked a long tirae, and that through
wearinefs he had layd himfdf down again upon his bed, he found yet lefs difpofition to fleep
then before; forhis agitation having difljpated fome vapors, which peradventure might have
lulled his Reafon, and charmed his difpleafure, he no fooner had a mind to clofe his eyes, but
t'.is imagination reprefented things yet more lively unto him j And whereas a long time before

<p>he had had none but violent paflions, fuch then too were all his thoughts. How unhappy am
I, faidhe to himfdtl I find an impoffibility in all that I defire; the leaft things are forbidden
me; evenfl-ep, which afl my Subjeds enjoy, is to me a prohibited good; that which I do
to get it, IS that which deprives me ofit; and though I change place, yet ftill is it all one with
me ; fur( ly I muft be feparated from my fdf, if I will find the reft which I feek for. h Le
I am more an enemy to my fdf, then Ibrahim is, yea and I am more unhappy then he.
</p>
<p>After his onqaietnefs had made him change pbce an hundred times, Ruilan, feeing day ap¬
proach, would have perfvvaded him not to amufe himfdf about this fcruple, and to permit
him to go and ftrangle Ibrahim with his own hands, to punifli him,faid he,for the unquietnefs
which he givrs thy Highnefs: But SoHmart fpake unto him with fo much fury, as he was con.
ftrained to hold his peace.   This crud motion oi Ruftan's, ftruck this Prince wich horror, and
whereas ic is a way co compaffion, leaning on a table, which was near to his bed, his imagi¬
nation infenfibly prefented him with other objeds.   He faw Ifabella all in tears for the death
oi Ibrahm; yea it reprefented to him thedeplorableeftate wherein he was; he remembred
the time when he was his Slave; and that glorious day, wherein loaden with chains hehad
faved hitn his Empire and hislife: And comparing ic with that wherein he was then, he could
not chufe but be moved at it.   After this, tne fight of Ruftan brought to his memory all the
miferies of his houfe, and all the violences which he had done by his, and Roxe Una's counfel.
The deith of Mufiapha, that oi Sarraida, oi het fon, oi Gianger, the forcible carrying
zw^y oi Axiamira, her imprifonmcnt, theWitoi Per(ia, the things vihich Ibrahim hid
performed therein, the denhoi Zele bta, and many other fuch like things, which filled his
mind with fo many deadly ideas, as the love which he bore to Ifabella began to be too weak
to diffipate them.   He fdt fome repugnancy in his heart for that which he did; and his Reafon
being fuddenly untangled, What do I, faid he to himfdf, fenflefs that I am, not to confider,
that the impoffibility which 1 find to deftroy a difarmed man, whom I hold in my bands,
who is loaden with irons, and who is without defence in the midft of his Executioners, is
wichoat doubt a fign that Heaven proteds him. For if it were not fo, I had deftroyed him
ere this; I had not promifed him fo long ago that I would not put him to death; I had not
remembred it fo precifdy ; this Artifice, which they have found out for me to be revenged,
had fucceeded ; I had flept, and Ibrahim had been dead.   But I fee plainly, as I have faid,
that Heaven guards him, and that it will not let me bc revenged.  But ahs! faid he ftill to
himfelf, fot whit crime, for what in/ury, for what outrage will I be revenged ? No, no,
continued he, i^r^^iw is not guilty, and I alone am the offender; for I owe all things to
him, and he owes nothing to me.   It is true, that he would have gone out of my Empire
without my leave, but it was to fave his Miftrefs; and this generous man, who might have
overthrown all my State, to fecure himfelf, and to be revenged of the infidelity which I have
ufed to him, was contented to fly away like a fimple Slave. Let us harken to Reafon which
fpeaks to us; let us barken to the voyce of the Prophet who holds our hand; and let us barken
no longer to this un/'uft love that poffeffcth us.
</p>
<p>Here Soliman could not retain his tears, and the love which he bore to IfdelU made him,
that he ftill found fome difficulty in refolving to be deprived of her: But if«/?rf»'s endevoring
once more to carry him to violence, made him indine wholly to Vertues fide. No, no, laid
he unto him, bafe as thou art, Iwill commit no more crimes by th; ^unfd ; the Prophet,
who guards me, will keep me frora dipping my hands inthebloodof/^r^fcw; and it lam
to flied any, it muft be thdrs, who blemifli my glory with their pernicious counfels Ruftan,

JfabelU! After this, he fat him down on four Cufliions, and hiding his face with both his
hands, leaning on a table, as it were the better to think of that which he would refolve of,
Rufian reraained in ftrange pain.
</p>
<p>In the mean tirae Ibrahim could not comprehend, for what reafon they made him attend
folong for his death. He feared kft fome vic^ence (hould be done to IfabelU; he doubted
left they ftiould be fo cruel as to put her to death before his eyes; and in this pain, death no
doubt would have been a remedy unto hira, had not the thought of never feeing IfabeUa again
rendred it raore grievous to him, for that confideration, then for the lofs ofhis life. The dif¬
orders ofhis Soul for all that appeared not in his face; and one would hardly have bdeeved in
looking on hira, that he did think he fhould dye every rainutfi. Ifabella, on het part, was
not without trouble; tor having underftood, that they came to fetch Ibrahim, flbe certainly
beleeved that he was loft, and was already preparing to follow him, when as they, who had
order togo for her, entred all into her chamber. As foon as flie faw them, and that they had
told her how they had order to carry her before Soliman; if it be to put me to death in his
prefence, anfwered flie, I will give him thanks: But acquaint me at leaftwife, whether /-
trahim be living, and whether we fhall dye together or no. Thefe men, not knowing So¬
liman's inrenrions, durft fcarce anfwer her; only they affured her that fhe (hould fee the
^rattd Fifter very fuddenly, as indeed they led her into the Hall where he was, attending the
time ot his execution. There were feen about him his Guards weeping, and four Mutes that
were to ftrangle him, and that having in their hands Bow ftrings of black filk for that purpofe,
feemcd alfo to haue fome compaffion ofhim.
</p>
<p>This doleful objed having touch'd the heart of Ifabella, (he could not forbear giving a
great skriek: Alafs, fakl flie, how do I repent me of my wifh I and how much more fupport¬
ablc had it been for me to dye alone, then to dye with you ? Ibrahim leeing and hearkig her
fpeak thus; What, Madam, faid he unto her, will they attempt upon your Ife? Abl no,no,
continued he, turning him to thofe that invironed him, it is a thii^ I fliall never endure:
when they ftiall meddle with none but me, I will tender my neck to them without refiftance;
but if they attempt any thing on this Princefs, I prc^eft that I will ftrangle him with mine
own hands that fliall offer any outrage to her. This is not that which I will have, anfwered
flie; defend not my life, if they attempt upon yours, fince they are to be infeparable. I
have not wiOi'd to live, but onely that I may not fee you dye. As they would have continued
fpeaking, they thac came for them told them, that they had nothing elfe in charge but to car¬
ry them before the C^r^iw^ Signior. Let US go then, faid the Princefs to him, let us go my
dear Juftiniano; I repent me of my weaknefs, and fince I muft dye, provided that I dye in
your prefence, I fliall be glad that we may dye together: Let us go then and beg for death of
Soliman as a grace. Ah ! Madam, cryed the illuftrious Bajfa, fpeak not of your death, if
you will not have me dye in defpair. Let us go, Madam, let us go rather to beg your liber¬
ty of Soliman, and obtain of him that the lofs of ray life may be the price of it. I will not
have it without you, anfwered fbe, wherefore perfift not in wifhing to fave me.
</p>
<p>In the mean rime||)ey an-ived it Soliman's Chamber, whom they founci ftill leaning on a
Table, and in a poftuVe, that they could not fee his face. As foon as they were there, Ibra-
/i/w and//4^f//«j caft themfelves at his feet; My Lord, faid thePrincefs, if I may obtain the
grace of thee, that I may dye with Juftiniano, I will not complain of thy Highnefs; but
contrarily I will praife thy juftice. I am guilty, my Lord, and of an horrible crime againft
thee. I have made thee defpife the friendfliip which thou bareft to Jufliniano; I have made
thee abandon Reafon ; I have put a ftam on thy life; I have blemiftied thy glory; I have
troubled thy reft; and I have conftrained the greateft Prince of the Earth to oppofe all his in-
dinations, which carry him to vertue, for to folbw an unjuft paffion. Thou plainly feeft, my
ford, that wrath ought to have a more juft foundation in thy foul, then this Love, which af-
flidsthee, and perfecutes me. Change thy paffion in my favor, but in fuch fort, that as I
have been the objed of thy love, fo I may be likewife of thy hate. Think of revenging thy
felf on the true caufe of thy unquietnefs; think of deftroying, and not of gaining me • the
laft IS impoffible, and ttie other is very eafie for thee. It isnot becaufe, if my tears could
move thee, I can yet affure thee that hate fliould have a place in my foul: For know, my Lord,

rdufe me the grace that I may dye, andthat he may be faved, fince I am guilty and he is in¬

<p>My Lord, faid Juftiniano interrupting her, barken not to tbe vertuous IfabelU, but to ad¬
mire the greatnefs of her courage, and fuffernotthy feff to be perfwaded to tha: which ftie
defires of thee. I will not ftand to examine whether I am culpable, or whecher I am not
fincc to be hated of thee, is tobe fo j but, my lord, I will onely tdl thee, that if the
fentence of my death fliaU be pronounced by thy mouth, I will not murmur at it. I
confefs my weaknefs to thee, my Lord; I cannot yet believe, but that all that which
I have feen fince my return, is an inchantment, and noc a truth. For bow can it be
imagined, that great Soliman, who hath loved me fo tenderly, and given me fo glori¬
ous marks thereof, can be carryed at this prefent to fuch unjuft defigns? That with the
fame hand, wherewich he broke my chains, and put the reyns ot his Empire inco mine, he
can puc about my neck the ftring which is to ftrangle me. Doth thy Highnefs no longer re-
member tbe thoughts which thou hadft, at fuch time as, feeing me ready to enter into the
grave, rather then difpleafe thee with craving my liberty of thee, thou refolvedft to have the
incomparable Ifabella be brought away by force. Was it then, my Lord, out of a defign to
ravifh her from me, to perfecute her, to blemifh thy glory, and to take away my life, in ha¬
ving unjuft thoughts fot her ? Think not, my Lord, of, the fervices I have done thee, but of
thofe which I purpofed to do thee; yet think noc of them, my Lord, for to pardon me, bat
think of them ro i^ve Ifabella. Reftore herto her liberty, make not me ihe caufe of het
undoing, fend her back into her Country, and after that put me to death here. But grant me
at leaftwife the grace to pronounce my fentence unto me; for I conlefs to thee once more,
that I doubt whether it be poffible, that thou fliouldft be the fame Soliman which hath fo
dearly loved me.
</p>
<p>It is in vain for you to defire, did Ifabella, that we fliould be feparated; that thought is
unjuft, and does wrong to our affedion; ic is a motion whereof I repent me, and whereof
you ought to repent you. Beg then of Soliman, that we may dye, or that we may live toge¬
ther ; for provided he will grant os this, I will attend bis fentence, without grief, and
wifhout unquietnefs. You fliall live, faid i'o/j&gt;w&lt;i» then to ber, difcovcring his face, which

believe for a certain, that the good-wiH which I have born thee is recovering its place in my
Soul: Repentance, which was a motion unknown tome, chafes the love of IfabelU hom
it, therein to rceftablifli my friendfliip to Ibrahim ; I fed it coming, my Reafon re-affumes

permit you, faid he unto her with a voyce interrupted wich fighs, to go out of my Empire
when you pleafe: I fhould alfo be generous enough to fhare it with Ibrahim, to whom it
appertains more juftly then to me, if I could infafe into the hearts of my fubjeds the thoughts
which are in mine.
</p>
<p>During this di'courfe/?«/if&lt;e» was in a ftrange unquietnefe; and when as he believed that
Soliman had bib minde bufied, and did not think ot him, he would have flipt out of the
Chamber, to go and advertife Roxelana of that which was doing: But Soliman perceiving it,
Stay, faid he unto him, infamous wretch ; and then he commanded him to be turned out oi
the Serraglio, without permitting him to fpeak to any body; and charged him with a great
deal of fury never to fliew himfdf more before him. After this, he fent for the vertuous
Achmat, vnd ths Sultana Afteria. It isby thefe two perfons,'faid he to Jbrahim, thatl
will be counfelled, to know what way we may take, that Jufliniano may ceafe to be Ibra¬
him, without making a noife amongft thepeople, which mighc prejudice my State: For as
for my felf, continued he fighing, it isfo little a while fince my Reafon hath recovered its
place, as I dare not yet rely upon ic. Ibrahim, whom we will call moft commonly hereaf¬
ter Juftiniano, anfwered the Grand Signior with as much generofity as joy; for wheras he
had exceedingly loved this Prince, how great foever that was which he fdr, to (ee Ifabella
efcaped from fo great a danger, yet was he not a little glad alfo to fee in Soliman the marks
of his ancient vertue again.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, after thst the Sultan had acquainted the fage Achmat, and the generous
Alleria with the bufinefs in queftion, in fuch terms, as well declared the repentance of his
foul; and after they had commended the refolution he was in, and mightily confirmed him in
the defign which he had to reftore Jttfliniano and Ifabella to their liberty ; Achmat, who ne¬
ver knew of Juftiniano's difguifing till then, counfelled^ fince the matter was fo far advanced,
that the people (hould be made to believe, how the Grand Signior had put Ibrahim to death,
upon fome difcovcry that he had held intelligence with the Emperor Charts, and favored
the Chriftians in all things; yea and that fome leccers too fliould be forged, which fhould be
faid he had been made to confefs, by which means the matter would eafily be credited, be¬
caufe it was true that every one knew, how the illuftrious 'Baffa had always proteded ihe
Chriftians. He faid moreover, that if the bufinefs was not carryed in that lore, it would be
impoffible to finde out a plaufible pretext to keep the people from fufpeding fome trick in the
:^{enceoi Ibrahim, which might produce dangerous confequences.
</p>
<p>This advice being approved of, yet becaufe Juftiniano and Ifabella could not be fent a-
way towards Genoua prefently, it was thought requifite to have them fecretly conveyed to
Pera, and there to remain concealed with thofe Greel^ Pnefts, whom Jufliniano had fo much
favored, until fuch time as a veffel could be made ready for them. This farewell could not
be taken without fliedding ofa world of tears; Solimatt craved pardon oi Juftiniano and Ifa¬
bella, who after they had anfwered him with tendernefs and fubmiffion, and affured him that
they would forget what was paft, defired him he would be pleafed to give their friends theic
liberty, which the Sultan having granted them, they were fent for and conduded along with
them to Tera. The Sultana Afieria and Ifabtlla faid to one another all that a moft flrid
friendftiip could make two generous perfons fay in fuch like encounters. And the ptudentyfcA-
)w&lt;«/,charging himfelf with the condud oi Juftiniano and his Mifirefs, conveyed them with all
dieir Troop aboard a Barque, whrch arryed them to Pera. Soltman could not for all that lee
Ifabella part, without foHowing her with his eyes, nor could he fee Jbrahim go away with¬
out forgetting//&lt;«^f//&lt;i; it being moft certain, that never was there a truer repentance, then
that of this great Prince.
</p>
<p>In the mean time to make it be beleeved that Ibrahim was dead, a black Standart was fet up
before the gate ofhis Palace: Achmat, fearing a fedition, put all the ^&lt;j»&lt;i«ri« into arms,
and gare them to underftand, that Ibrahim was a Traytor, that he bad gone about to over¬
throw the Empire, and that his death had been abfolutdy neceffary for the prefervation of the
StA\e. He fliewed them alfo certain forged Letters, to give the mote credit to that which he
faid But whatfoever he could fay, no fooner was the black Standart feen before the gate of
bis Pilace, but all the people began to murmur; There was nothing but weeping and crying

<p>Thofe Janizaries that had been the beft perfwaded, left not for all that tobe exceedingly
afflided; for he was fo univerfally beloved, as there was not any body which did not lament
and commend him. Some faid, that Roxelana wichout doubt was the caufe of this mifchief
and that flie ftill remembred, how he had been the Protedor of Prince Muftapha. Somt
cryed out to have at leaftwife the body of their Defender given unto them; others, that his
Executioners might be delivered into their hinds; and all of them together agreed in thebe^
lief, that Soliman had loft the force of his Empire, and tbe fupport ot his State.

cations, and with foch fury^ as they tore hira in a thoufand pieces. Froni thence they went

Jufiiniano on his enemies. For Roxelana having underftood that he was not dead, and that
Ruftan had been torn in pieces by the people, this fierce and proud fpirit, was fo fenfibly
touched with fp'ght for that fhe could not exercife all her whole fury, that after fhe bad con.
tinued three hours together without fpeaking aword, flie dyed for very rage and tnadnefs;
and Juftiniano had the fatisfadion to know, that he was lamented of all the world, and th«
the only perfons which could rej&gt;yce ac his death had been puniflied for their in-
juft.'ccs.                                                                                         -.y,

l^efent aboard her all the riches of/^r&lt;»fcj»»'s Palace, and agreat dea\moj:e, which hewa
conftrained to accept of againft his inclination. The Sultan Wrote alfo with his own hand
to tbe illuftrious Baffa, and again affured him of his repentance and affedion, whereunto Ju-
ftiniano and Ifabella anfwered with a great deal of generofity. The dtzihoi Roxelana touch,
ed Soliman lefs, then it would have done at any other time. For as he could not but remera¬
ber that flie had been rhe objed of his affedion; fo could he not but much more remember,
that flie hsd been the caufe of all bis misfortunes, and ofall his crimes, and that flie would have
carried him to put to death the only man of the world whom moft he loved.
</p>
<p>This fdgned death of Ibrahim was carried with fo much addrefs by the prudent Achmat,
that every body bdeeved it tobe fo; and that is it which hath made Taulm Joviw, and alt
thofe which have fpoken of the raign of Soliman, to lay, that the grand Fifter ^etxiiiedh
that fort; but indeed the matter paft as I have delivered it: For a Greek^Caloyer, who had
this Hillory from Juftiniano's and Ifabella's own mouth, left a relation thereof,which is come
even unto us.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, three days after the feigned death of Ibrahim, the true Jufliniano, Jfa¬
belU, Sophronia , Hipolita , Emilia, Leonida , Horatio, Alphonfo , Doria , the French
Marquefs, and a number of Chriftian Slaves, whofe hhexty Jufttniano had obtained, im-
barqued themfdves one night, and fet izxMot Genoua, without fear of other enemies, then
the winds and the Seas; but Fortune had made too much tryal of their vertue, for to infld
new difafters on them; and indeed flie was fo favorable unto them, that never was there a
more profperous Navigation heard of.                                                                ti   r l

<p>Daring this Voyage, thefe illuftrious perfons had no other entertainment, then to talk ot ttie

<p>fecret, which I have never told to any body; know, that the true caufe of my inconftancy
hath been the fear of marriage: I have always been fo afraid of engaging my fdf therein, as to
avoyd the occafions ofit, I have ufed to change Miftrefs often. But if I can obtain of Emilia,
that flie will not oblige me to be her husband, I will be eternally her Slave. All tbe company
then burft oat a laaghing, and beleeving thac their difcourfe was nothing but fport, every
one tell to preffing of £k«7/^, that (he would make him become conftant, in not marrying
him. Whereupon the Mirqacfs and (hc made a Satyre againft marriage, wherein on either
part they faid very pleafant things. And for a conclufion, that which was beleeved to be but
jelling, proved to be their true thoughts; and they took as much care to promife one ano-
ilier that they would never marry,as the others took to obtain oftheir Miftreffes, that as foon
as they fliould come to genoua, they would render their fortunes infeparable, as indeed
they did. The wind having been extreamly favorable to them, they arrived'in a few days at
Monaco; where the Princefs was received of her Subjeds with as much aftonifhment as joy.
The brute of their return being prefently got to Gf«e«^, the chief of the Senate came thither
to vilit them.

<p>Ttiefc illuftrious perfons concealed fo much of their adventures, as they thought was not
fit to be fpoken of; and having been intreated by their friends, that they would after fo ma¬
ny misfortunes celebrate the cereraony of thdr nuptials at Genoua • Ifabella yielded thereunto
with blulhing: for which effed they parted away tbe next day, and fliortly after the lAsx-
ia^tsoi Juftiniano ind I/^bella, oi Haratto and Hipolita, oi Daria ind Sophronia, and of
Alphonfo and Leoni&amp;i, v/ere folemnized with all poffible magnificences.   The French Mar¬
quifs and Emilia promtfed anew an inviolable friendfhip to one another, with an oath that
neither of them would ever marry: and during certain days there were nothing but Balls,
unning at the Ring, and publique Feafts.   After which Juftiniano and IfabelU bling re-
;ntred into the poffeffion of all that belonged unto them, they were conduded with a great
leal of ftate to Monaco-, where the|||jircd with as much fatisfadion, as they had had mif-
haps; y»^»«w«o efteeming himfelf raSrc happy inthe poffeffion oi IfabeHa, then if hehad
reconquered the Empire of his Fathers. But by a revolution which commonly arrives in all
things, it is come to pafs, that the Principality of Monaco is retiujned into a branch of the
Houfe of the Grimaldies, which poffeffeth It at this day, under the protedion of
Spain; nothing remaining of Juftiniano but the memory of his glorious
adions; which certainly are great and famous enough, to oblige
