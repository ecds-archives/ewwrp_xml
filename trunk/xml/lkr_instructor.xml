General R.E. Lee
As An Instructor Of Youth
The golden chords attuned by thee Not by each alone, but through the limitless Expanse of all Eternity shall throb.
Southwick

A Prince among men!  A Hero great
Who peerless stand on mountain height,
Far, far above the ????,
A soul illumed in Heaven’s own light!
With manhood’s noblest gifts bestowed,
He might have held illustrious reign
In pomp and power, and homage ???
A world wide statesman free of stain

And yet the ??? what things may deem
A lowly ???.   From lofty height
He say ahead the future gleam
That onward led to wisdom’s light,
Thus patiently his work was wrought
On Mind immortal, ever free,
And thus America’s citizenship
Grow ‘neath the Godlike soul of Lee!
