What I want my Wife to be.

1 She must be an acrobat yet gentle as a cat
Riding, dancing, full of grace, with of course a pretty face.

2 Tall and stately Full of vim
Yet with never a foolish whim.

3 Just so she can make a cup of tea
And all things nice for only me.

4 I do not want my wife to cook
Nor even look into a book,
But she must work my garden well
And make a lot of things to sell!

5 I need a wife to broil my steak
And have a plenty of cream and cake.

6 She must know the intricate art
Of cooking well a cherry tart.

7 She must be a musician and never grow weary
Of playing for me when the day is so dreary.

8 I want her to paddle her own canoe
And allow me the same privilege too.

9 Never to frown, never to scold,
Never to say its too hot or too cold,
But smile and smile and lively be
That’s the kind of wife for me!

10 I want her perfect – nothing less
Made to comfort and – to dress!

11 If she wears a Merry Widow hat
And ???? her hair a rat
Should I deride and roughly chide
And threaten there to ???
Oh, no I’d kiss her cheek and sing
“They are lovely dear, the very thing”!

12 My help??? must be both funny and wise 
Tall and slim with sharp black eyes.
