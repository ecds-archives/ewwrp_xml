Dinner, let not your Hand be first in any Dish, nor take your place

suspected of Levity; that she keep all things in her Chamber in good
Order, and have them in readiness on all occasions to take off the
care of the Mistress. Skilled likewife she must or ought to be, in
buying fine Knacks, and be just in returning her Accounts: If there be
no Butler, she must see all things decently managed for the
Accommodation of the Guests in the Parlour and Dining-Room; and above
all, have a regard to the Linnen, Plate, and other Furniture under her

<head>CHAP. II.</head>
<p rend="italic">Instructions for Young Gentlewomen in Behaving themselves dutifully towards their Parent.</p>
<p>AS our Parents are those from whom, next God, we have our Being, and by whose tender Care and inseparable Love we are nourished and preserved from innumerable Dangers and Hazards; therefore observe,</p>
<p>In the first place, your Reverence, Love, and Obedience, is strictly required, not only by the Tyes of Nature, but by God's Holy Word, as sundry places in Scripture manifest; nor can their Infirmities in any wise absolve you, or dispense with your non-performance; but in such a case you ought to double your observance, that thereby, as much as in you lies, you may hide their Weakness and Defects from the Eyes of others.</p>
<p>You must observe at all times to obey the Will of your Parents (if
it be in your power, and not contrary to God's Command) without
repining, or entring into dispute, performing what you do with
cheerfulness, shewing by your willing mind your ready Obedience, and
by your quick dispatch, demonstrating the Pleasure you rake in the
performance, shunning all occasions of giving them any disquiet,
pacifying their Anger, if it at any time arise, with submission either
in Words or by Behaviour, tempering your Anions with a moderate
sweetness of Disposition and Silence, for too much Ostentation or
Loquacity is displeafing: When your Parents greve be you sad; when
they rejoice, be you pleasant, as sympathizing with them in Heaviness
and Joy; yet <seg type="catch">be</seg>

<pb n="175 Instructions to young Gentlwomen."/>
be not over inquisitive into the cause; but if you are desirous to know it, wait their leisure to reveal it, or learn it from some other Hand.</p>
<p>Forget not to pray for your Parents as often as you put your Vows to Heaven, beseeching the Almighty to shower his Blessings upon them; which is one great advance by which a Child endeavours to make his Parents restitution for their Care and Tenderness; for nothing without calling God to your assistance can in that nature be effectual; the diffarence being otherwise so vast between what has been done for you, and what you can do to deserve it.</p>
<p>Let not the hopes of Riches, no, nor the seveity of your Parents, imprint in your mind a desire of their Death, let the Almighty be offended, and shorten your Days.</p>
<p>Shun those that speak ill of your Parents and would make them seem
contemptible in your Eyes: Nor let their Poverty, should you be
advanced by any means to Riches or Honour, render your Duty and
Obedience less, for they cannot be but the same in all condition: If
they be poor, you ought to relieve them; if they are weak of
Understanding, you. must assist them with your Counsel: If they be
injured or oppresed, endeavour to succour and redress them; for no
Years can exempt you from observing your Duty to your Parents; nor
ought you to dispose of your self in Marriage, nor otherwise, without
their allowance and content, your Person being indispensibly theirs in
a lawful way to dispose of. And so it was under the Law of Moses in
relation to a Virgin's Vow; the which, though the had made, yet if her
Father approved it not, it was void; as in <hi
rend="italic">Numb.</hi> chap. 3o. vet S. <hi rend="italic">But if her
Father disallow her in the day that be heareth, not any of her Vows,
nor her Bonds- wherewith she hath bound her Soul shall stand; and the
Lord shall forgive <seg type="catch">her</seg>

<pb n="176 Of Behaviour towards"/>
her, because her Father disallowed her.</hi> By this we see the great Power that Parents had over their Children, even to a degree of cancelling, and rendring of none effect the obligation of a Vow, which Power was given by God himself.</p>
<p>Certain it is, that no poverty, fault, or unkindness of Parents,
can dispense with that Duty and Obedience, which, by the Law of God
and Nature, Children owe their Parents, for the tender care, labour,
and cost, bestowed on them: Nay, though Parents should prove
unnatural, and expose them, even in their Infancy, to a desperate
Fortune of Hazard and Danger; yet still those Children are bound to
perform their Duty, and look for their Reward from him who is the
Author of all Blessings.</p>

<p rend="italic">Instructions for a young Gentlewoman at the Age of Six, or upward, how to behave her self towards her Parents, Superiours, Equals, and Inferiours, and upon sundry other occasions; as Learning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>IN all your Undertakings, let it be observed that you are an Enemy
to Sloth, not only by your early rising, but by your activity; for
having neatly dressed you, or caused some other to do it, having
prostrated your self before your Maker, and refreshed you with what
was appointed, fall upon your Knees before your Parents, and receiving
their Blessing, then hasten to School; or else betake you to such
business as your Parents or Governess than appoint you at Home, doing
it with chearfulness, and respect those that are over you, as well in
their absence, as when present; and whether it be Reading, or any
curious Work, observe that your Face and Hands are clean, and that you
handle no dirty or greasie things; neither presume to eat before
those <seg type="catch">who</seg>

<pb n="177 Superiours and Equals"/>
who are your Instructors, whilst you at your Work or Lesson, if there be more under the same Tutorage, behave your fell kindly towards them; call no unseemly Names, nor make unseasonable Complaints; Defraud them not, nor take the least matter by force that is not your own; be courteous and mild, with a decent and winning Behaviour if your Mistress or Governess be sharp and severe, strive by your diligence to prevent displeasure or correction; and as you approach or return from her, make your Reverence, and the like to your Parents; make your Obeisance in the most becoming and obliging manner, to your Superiours and Equals: nor forget to be courteous to your Inferiours: Be sure your Tongue run not too fast, but in Discourse but moderate; Speak with deliberation, and weigh your Words before you utter them and where you are seated, observe you continue till you are called thence, or it is time to leave it. In reading upon any occasion, use not a Tone, but read distinctly, observing your Stops, that you may the better understand what you read. In Writing, beware that you blot not your Paper, but imitate your Copy in cutting your Letters fair and even; Let not your Work, of any sort, be soiled or dirty, and keep what things you use in good order, and render your Parents an Account of your improvement.</p>
<p>When you are to be at Meet, be not out of the way, but attend the
Grace, and then take the place that is appointed you: After having
done your Reverence, see your Napkin be fastned about you to save your
cloaths, and thankfully take what is given without craving; nor is it
seemly for you to speak at the Table, unless you are asked a question,
or them. Be some great occasion. Cut your Meat handsomely, and be not
over desirous of Sawce, nor of another sort of Meat, before you have
dispensed of <seg type="catch">what</seg>

<pb n="178 Of Behaviour towards"/>
what is on your Plate. Put not both your Hands to your <sic corr="Mouth">Month</sic> at once, nor eat too greedily: Let not your Mouth or Fingers be greasie, no more than need must; and when you are satisfied, take your Plate Or Trencher with you, or give it to those that wait, and retire, but not out of the Room till Grace is said and the Cloth taken away; at what time making your Obeisance, you may depart, unless you are desired to stay: Nor must you sit before your Parents, Governess or Superiours, unrequired, unless at your Meat, Needle, Writing, or the like; and observe. you attempt not to drink in any company till you have emptied your Mouth; and that you breath nor, nor blubber in the Cup or Pot. As for your Recreation, when leisure hours permit, let it be innocent and moderate, never staying late abroad, above all, be Wary in the choice of your Companions and so you grow up, shun the Conversation of those that have a report of Lightness, lest they draw you into a snare, or bring a scandal causelesly upon your good Name, but chuse those whose Reputations are candid; Converse with those who are modest yet of affable; Stay not at any time, where the least occasion of Lightness and Wantonness is administred; nor lend your Ear to Discourse tending to Lewdness.</p>
<p>For your Carriage, in the general, let it be a <hi rend="italic">Medium,</hi>, not expressing too much reservedness, which by some, is interpreted Pride; nor too much Freedom on Familiarity, which, on the other hand, will be looked upon for Fondness. Be no Makebate between your. Parents and their Servants; nor at any time tell a Lye to excuse a Fault, to keep you from the hand of Correction. Go to Bed in due Season, without any Noise, and never be seen in unseemly Laughter; nor in pointing, or nodding, especially in Company or  in places of Divine Worship: Ho-<seg type="catch">nour</seg>

<div id="accomplady006" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>CHAP. IV.</head>
<p rend="italic">Instructions for a Young Gentlewoman how to behave her self towards her Governess and Servants, &amp;c.</p>
<p>AS for your Governess, if discreetly chosen, she must be a Woman of Gravity and Discretion, learned in curious Arts, such as you are desirous to improve; and although her Age render her reserved, yet must you not censure her as rigid, but comply with her lawful Commands; and by your Mildness and Industry move her to Gentleness, refraining to make Complaints, especially unjust ones; for in disapproving of her, whom your Parents set over you, you tax them with Imbecility in chusing, and by that Complaint will either incur their Displeasure, or, by removing your Governess, perhaps procure a worse; which causing undoubted, a second Complaint, will possess your Parents with a jealousie of your untractableness and ill disposition.</p>
<p>Some there are that covet to be under a young Governess, with whom they may have the more familiar Conversation, though to their small Advantage; for it is somewhat improbable that a Person, who cannot perhaps Govern her own youthful Fancies, should discharge so great a Trust as she ought: However, consider with your self that in being conformable to her, you obey your Parents, who thought fit to commit you to her Charge; and that if you do otherwise, you disobey God, in abusing or slighting, their Care and Indulgence, who study your Advantage.</p>
<ab type="catch">To</ab>

<pb n="180 Of Behaviour in General "/>
<p>To the Servants you must be courteous and affable, but not over-familiar, lest it beget Contempt. Tell no Tales of them to your Parents, but rather strive to hide their Failings, unless they be such as are prejudicial or unseemly; and do them what good you can. If at any tine you find occasion to reprove them, let your Reproofs be rather Admonishment than Reproaches: Be not Peevish nor Froward in your Dressing, or in any other Office done you by the Maid, that more immediately attends you, but by gentle Words let her know her Error, that she may amend it; which Method will oblige and command a constant Diligence, which otherwise would be but Eye-Service. If your Parents be angry with their Servants, do you become their Mediator. Turn not your Face from the Poor; but if it be in your Power, without offending your Parents, relieve them; or as you see occasion, petition on their behalf; by which demeanour you will command Love and Reverence, and gain the Character of an humble Spirit: In which you may rest satisfied, that it is better to be Good than Great; and that Humility forcibly commands Love and Service, when Pride, on the contrary, begets Hatred and Contempt. If Heaven has endowed you with a large Fortune, and a noble Birth, let your Virtues shine with the greater Lustre; and above all things, give God the Praise, and use what you have to his Glory, and your own Comfort.</p></div>

<head>CHAP. V.</head>
<p rend="italic">Instructions for Young Gentlewomen how to behave themselves in all Societies, upon sundry Occasionns.</p>
<p>First, to qualifie your self to understand the modish and courtly
Expressions, it is convenient that you learn the <hi
rend="italic">Latin</hi>, <hi rend="italic">French</hi>, and <hi
rend="italic">Italian</hi> Tongues, <seg type="catch">not</seg>

<pb n="181 Of Behaviour in General"/>
not only by Rote, but by Rule and Grammar, the better to understand them, since the most refined <hi rend="italic">English</hi> has borrowed from these Languages, and without this Knowledge you will be at a lots to understand those that utter high Phrases in the Court-air, as they term it; nor must you be ignorant in Singing, Dancing, and Playing upon Musick suitable to your Sex; though in Exercising your self herein, you must be very modest and moderate, your Words few, yet to the purpose; Discretion, Silence, and Modesty, being the Ornaments of the Sex. And as Society is that which all Creatures naturally covet; so, if it be well chosen and managed, it is recreatory to the Body and Mind but as bad Society is worse than none, so is it to be avoided.</p>
<p>Wherefore be not easily won to enter into Discourse with those you
know not, unless urgent Business require it, lest you be suspected of
Levity and Indiscretion. Always observe to consort your self with your
Betters, or Equals, knowing them to be virtuous; and avoid too much
familiarity with Inferiours, unless you find them very discreet, lest
you fall into contempt, if Female: or if Male, lest you give them
encouragement to make their Addresses of Courtship, and by subtil ways
to insinuate themselves into your good liking; for Love, that takes
the Diadem from Queens, is blind: and Passion distinguishes not
Servility from Greatness; by which means, though you are high in Birth
and Fortune, you may be brought to a yielding, which may turn to the
grief of your Parents, or perhaps to their and your own Disgrace. And
in this case presume not too much upon your own Strength, by
interchanging Gloves, Rings, Ribbons, or such things, which you may
term Trifles, left by this kind of familiarity, Love by infallible
ways opens a Passage to your heart.</p><ab type="catch">Be</ab>

<pb n="182 Instructions to young Gentlewomen"/>
<p>Be not over-desirous of being seen often, in places of resort, lest you expose your self to the Aysault of the Tempter, and purchase that Curiosity with the lots of your Honour, by giving Licentious Amorists Liberty to meet you in your Walks, and by powerful Persuasions to linen to their <hi rend="italic">Syrens</hi> Charms, whilst you are no longer capable of mastering your Affections: Nor trust too much to Female Confident, lest for their own Advantage, they persuade you to a yielding.</p>
<p>As for your Dress, let it be neat, but not gaudy, for Vertue is comely in any Dress and be content to appear in your native Beauty: Let your Dressing time be short, and your Recreation moderate: In your Speech or Behaviour shun all Affetation; and be not over-fond of new Fashions.</p></div>

<head>CHAP. VI.</head>
<p rend="italic">Instructions for a Young Gentlewoman to Manage her Gate and Gesture; to Govern her Eyes and Tongue, &amp;c. upon sundry necessary Occasions.</p>
<p>IN this case observe that you walk not carelessly or lightly,
shouldering, as it were, your Companions, nor .strutting or jutting in
a proud manner; Keep in your walk your Head steady, your Countenance
not too much elevated, nor dejected; keep your Arms likewise steady,
and throw them not about as if you were flying: Let your Feet rather
incline a little more inward than outward, lest you be censured
Splay-footed; for by the motion of the Body, the thoughts of the Mind
may be discovered: as whether the Party be of loose or proud <sic
corr="Behaviour">Behavour</sic>, or humble and complacent. Do not run
or go extream fast in places of Concourse, unless great occasion
require it; for in such Violent motions it is not always in your power
to keep your Body steady; nay, by <seg type="catch">too</seg>

<pb n="183 Of Behaviour in General"/>
too much hast you may chance to fall and expose to view what you would conceal. And as the gesture of the Body is seemly and commendable, so is the Management or Government of the Eye; in which many things are to be observed, and chiefly these.</p>
<p>Keep your Eyes within compass; that is-letthem not be too much
fixed upon idle and vain objects, nor drawn away by unseemly sights;
roll them not about in a careless and lascivious manner; nor stare Men
in the Face as if you were looking Babies; Send not private Glances;
or look, as they call it, with half a Face, turning your Head, as it
were, aside: Look not at any time over your Shoulder, if you have
opportunity to turn your self: Open not your Eyes too wide, thereby to
distort your Countenance; nor keep them in a manner half shut. Wink
not too often, nor call your Eyes ascant; as if you squinted; neither
keep them too reserv'd; nor scornfully turn them away when any Object
offers. Look not too much downward; nor with a more than ordinary
Elevation. Gaze not often against the Sun, nor on the Fire, both of
them impair the Lustre of the Eyes. When you discourse with a woman,
look her in the Face with as much composedness as you can: but if with
a Man, to look a little downward; for modesty is commendable: But,
above all things, as often as opportunity will permit, lift up your
Eyes to your Redeemer, and, with holy <hi rend="italic">David</hi>,
implore him to <hi rend="italic">turn them away from Vanity</hi>: For
the Eyes being the Windows of the Soul; lets in Good or Evil;
according as it fixes, or is intent upon good or bad Objects,
therefore chuse the former, and refuse the latter.</p> 
<p>Let all your Discourses be to the purpose, and suffer not your Complements to be high flown, extravagant, blunt, or nonsensical; but, in all, suit them with modesty to the capacity and quality of the Person to whom you utter them; and see they be <seg type="catch">done</seg>

done on fit occasion and in season be fare not to Congratulate Persons, when you should Condole them; use in your utterance no Hems nor Stammerings; Sputter not as you speak, nor speak many Sentences between breathings; use not Tautologies or affected words or lispings; neither speak with a Tone. Decline to speak much before Gravity, and multitude of years, unless urgent occasion require it: and beware that you speak not, when you are bidden to hold your Tongue; for indeed Womens discourse should not be much, because Modesty and Moderation is her Ornament, and are in them fires a moving Rhetorick. And when you have opportunity of discourse, let it not taste of Confidence, Affectation or Conceitedness, nor border upon Obscenity.</p>

<p rend="italic">Directions for a Young Gentlewoman she ought to be seen in her Habit or Apparel; and what Garb is most commendable, and otherwise, according to the Quality of the Wearer.</p>
<p>IT matters not, of what Stuffs or Silks your Clothings are made, so
they be decent and civil; neither by their ridiculousness discovering
the Wearer foolish and slovenly; nor by their gaudy and careless
putting on, to render her suspected of loose or light behaviour, or at
leastwise subject her to the censure of the Ignorant. Apparel may be
rich, and yet decent, and indeed whether, it be rich or not, if
decent, the matter is not great; though, in this case, I leave it to
the discretion of young Gentlewomen or those that provide them
Apparel, to let it be suitable to their Quality or Fortune, and will
not be of the Morose and Cynical temper of some, who either believe,
or spitefully give it as their opinion, that gorgeous or glittering
Apparel is the Attire of Sin, and suits with the Pride of the Wearers
heart; but <seg type="catch">I</seg>

<pb n="185 Of Behaviour in General"/>
I am persuaded that the Quality of the Person extenuates the Quality thereof, and renders that opinion vain and frivolous.</p>
<p>I must confess, there is a kind of Privilege in youth to go gay;
which, should I too severely reprove I might justly merit your
displeasure; yet that Gaity may as well be in Decency as otherwise,
the use of Apparel being to dignifie the Wearer: Nor does a vertuous
Demeanour more lively appear than in Look, Speech, Gesture and Habit,
within the compass of Modesty, though Diamonds, Gold, and other
precious things, were made for use; and without being imployed, would
be ineffectual: Therefore to wear them in my Opinion, is one of the
chiefest Ends for which Nature produced them, or Art brought them to a
fuller perfection. The Pride in this case being only centered in the
Mind, and not in the External Ornaments; which is rather known by the
Carriage and Deportment of the Wearer, than by the Garments. And
though to affect Novelty, and run into every Fashion, be not
commendable, yet Moderation is not amiss; for two Reasons: As first,
should you always keep in a Fashion, though decent, it would be looked
upon as a conceited singularity; or to continue in any strange Garb,
after the Fashion is altered, would appear ridiculous, and cause
Laughter, especially amongst the ruder sort; as much as a Woman of
Fourscore to be habited in the Garb of a Gentlewoman of Sixteen; or to
see a Dairy Maid in her Ladies attire: Therefore whatever you wear,
let it he proportionable to your Body, and suitable to your
degree.</p>
