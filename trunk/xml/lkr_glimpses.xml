GLIMPSES OF THE GREAT WORK WROUGHT BY
GEORGIA DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY

By Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers, Poet Laureate Georgia Division

Go ask the hills the mighty hills
Where neither church not school were
known
No upward path to life and light
Or judgment at Jehovah’s throne?
And there ‘tis found that woman’s hands
Have reared a shrine where love abides,
Where education opes the way
And knowledge over mind presides.

At Rabun Gap ‘neath mountain height
What wondrous changes have been
wrought!
What stores of thought unlocked each day
And gems revealed ‘till then unsought!
O brave Bartow! Thy spirit dwells
On every tree and sparkling rill,
Each zephyr tells to passers by
“Though dead, his fame is living still.”

At Liberty Hall, a mansion stands
In reverence to him who freely gave
Heart, hands and mind to train our youth 
And from a reckless life to save 
Hail gallant Stephens! In memory hail!
Te labor was never spent in vain,
But illumined all who followed the gleam
And in eternity they reign.

The honored names of out Generals shrine
At many hospitals o’er the sea
Bearing comfort to each soldier brave
And gratitude to U.D.C.
In World War records Georgia won
The highest prize!  And ne’er shall fade
The gift of noble Hector church
When ten thousands at our feet were laid!

Go ask the winds that sweep Oconee
Far down the crimson hills of Hall
What wondrous stories they are singing 
Of Athens queenliest queen of all
Ah, there sweet Winnie Davis smiles
As daughters of heroes come afar
To life high and higher the banner of lear
ing,
Until its folds entwine a-star.

Throughout all Georgia lands are found
Memorials of out “Boys in Gray.”
And truths of history certify
A stainless banner led their way
From broad Savannah on the east
To Chattahoochee’s rhythmic wave
Confederate daughters ne’er have ceased
To honor, revere and crown the brave

On mountain crest, a vision lives
The wonderous dream of Helen Plane
Heaven gave the hallowed Cenotaph
All through the years it must remain 
Oh mountain, speak with loving voice!
The merit of they sons proclaim,
And tell to cycling years that roll
They won by right, eternal fame!
