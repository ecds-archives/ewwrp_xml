THE PHAROS
NO I. TUESDAY, NOV. 7, 1786.
*Comme les hommes ne se dego&#x00FBtent point du vice, il ne faut pas aussi se lasser de le leur reprocher: ils seroient peut-&ecirctre pires s'ils venoient &agrave manquer de censeurs ou de critiques; c'est ce qui fait que l'on pr&ecircche &amp que l'on ecrit.
LA BRUYERE.

<p>THE writer of a periodical paper is officially a censor of public manners, and as such, is frequently more the object of dread than of love: he is considered as incessantly purveying for his work, sagacious in discovering and industrious in noting obliquities of
<pb n="2 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
character, and when once known, is shunned as a spy and informer. For this reason, and that he may not defeat his purpose of observation by freezing his beholders into *petrifaction, concealment is necessary to an author of this class: he must envelope himself in eternal shades, unless his labors effect that stupendous change in the human heart which shall incline it to love what it is painful to suffer.</p>
<p>To speak in my own person--against all fear of detection I am abundantly fortified by the consciousness that I shall not rouse curiosity: I have not humility enough to think I than want readers: the utility and convenience of my productions will soon be manifest ; and a lady or gentleman will no more submit to the operations of a <hi rend="italic">friseur</hi>, without the consolatory aid of my paper, than a *kinght-errant would undertake an adventure without invoking his mistress;
*but
<pb n="3 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
but yet I do not expect such approbation as will make my patrons uneasy while they are ignorant of my name.</p>
<p>It may probably be asked by those to whom chance may direct the following sheets, what could be the incentive to an undertaking of this kind, in an age replete with publications of a similar nature, so excellent as to afford no hope of surpassing them, and so comprehensive as scarcely to have left any thing to be said by a subsequent writer. By some I shall be censured for presumption, by others for vanity. I shall, no doubt, be reminded that the talents of Steele and Addison, of Johnson and of Hawkesworth have at different times been exercised in the same species of composition: if they have succeeded in the endeavor to instruct and amend, what remains for me to do? If they have failed, who shall *hazad another attempt?</p>
*B2 As
<pb n="4 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
<p>As I foresee the charge which will be brought against me, I am prepared to meet it, and to vindicate myself from the imputation of presumption by declaring that though I wish to leave the world better than I find it, I have at no time entertained an opinion that reformation of manners is reserved for my pen's *achievement. Nor can I be justly accused of vanity as I never shall claim any praise vouchsafed me, and the keenest sagacity will be defeated in search of one.</p>
<p>It now remains to explain my undertaking, and to divulge . my intentions. And first, I am to make good my title.</p>
<p>A Pharos, every one knows, is nothing more nor less than a light-house, whose benefits are chiefly calculated for the service of the sailor: its flame is intended to warn him from the shoal and the rock ; and thus, by his super-added knowledge, it proves a guide to safe an-
*chorage,
<pb n="5 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
chorage, or contributes to the safety of his voyage. In life, a friendly monitor of this kind is no less useful: few, who compare the world to a sea, feign it a pacific ocean: it is by its best friends acknowledged not only exposed to the storms, but likewise to every danger of the deep: whirlpools, quicksands, promontories, and shallows perpetually oppose the voyager's way, and miserable indeed is he if deprived of light and warning.</p>
<p>In one particular I confess my work resembles not a Pharos. It is not placed in a conspicuous situation, consequently the orbit of its rays will be much confined. But let this be no discouragement: it pretends to illuminate no boundless ocean, but its light may be seen timely enough to avoid every danger it intimates. It will instruct all who, in a heady endeavor after safety, appeal to its power; for however partially
*B3 it
<pb n="6 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
it may direct its flame, or however dimly it may. burn, still shall be visible to the mariner this important monition, that he can no longer hope for security than while he sails by the chart of scripture and the compass of reason, towards that new undiscovered country, where all his labors than end, and a final remuneration avails him.</p>
<p>But as in one particular I own my Pharos deficient, so in another I hope it will excel its archetype: its light shall be to none terrific. I cannot promise it will ever blaze into admirable brightness, nor that I can always preserve more than a lambent flame; but a friend of mine, a very ingenious artist, has promised occasionally to amuse the beholders with a few *corruscations, which, if well-timed and applied, may obliterate or obtain toleration for any natural defects in my edifice.</p>
*The
<pb n="7 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
The method by which I shall endeavor to serve those who resort to my light for counsel, will not be always the same. In some cases it may be most useful to render the dangerous body luminous: in others I may do more good by directing a few rays to the shipwrecked vessel or mariner. To him or his vessel will always be found attached a scroll containing the history of his fate, an attentive perusal of which is all the impost I exact. Sometimes I shall warn by pointing out the errors of other voyagers who still vainly beat the waves, and sometimes shall endeavor to make manifest to those I guide that no nautical skill, nor the best applied exertion, can aid them if they steer towards an inhibited port.</p>
<p>Having now informed my readers of the engine I mean to use, it is fit that I make them acquainted in some measure with the temper, disposition, and views
*B4 that
<pb n="8 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
that shall regulate and direct its powers.</p>
<p>Can I hope those who encourage me by their attention, will believe that however conspicuous I may render vice and folly, I indulge no malignant spirit! I may perhaps be less lenient to that fashion which stamps new characters and blends contrary properties, than the world in general are, for I assert the privilege of thinking for myself. I cannot condemn or approve with apathy, but I never yet dipped my pen in gall, nor would I point out, to observation, the frailties of my fellow-creatures, were I not convinced that morality is injured by the forbearance.</p>
<p>That no one may complain of being unfairly surprised in their follies, I here give this preliminary notice, that the flame of my Pharos possesses an uncommon property. Nothing is a security from its rays; it can penetrate into the most obscure places; no building, no
*tiling,
<pb n="9 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
tiling, roof, or ceiling of any kind, is a defence against it. Should a lady or gentleman meet or pay a visit to any acquaintance or friend, I advise all of the party to be cautious in their behavior; for a few of my ignited particles may be blended with the solar beams, and I may, by that means, know all that passes. At a card-table I warn all the players to observe strictly not only all the laws of honesty but of decorum, for their wax candles probably burn by my aid. Thus
I frequently partake of a <hi rend="italic">partie quarr&eacutee<hi rend="italic">, a <hi rend="italic">t&ecircte-&agrave-t&ecircte</hi> at piquet, or a game at mirth-inspiring loo; and as I am possessed of a wonderful degree of sagacity, whetted by the necessity of providing, twice in a week, a mental repast for my readers, I can in a moment discover the passions by which those I observe are agitated or governed. Every church window admits. this perforating, light, and reflects the objects to me: ladies are
*B5 there-
<pb n="10 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
therefore requested, if they would avoid my censure, to visit that place <hi rend="italic">sans rouge</hi>: their eyes mull be restrained, and their countenances composed: they must not talk of last night's opera, or next Thursday's concert, nor make future engagements: they must join decently and devoutly in the worship they assist at, and leave all solicitude about their dress and admirers at home or in their carriages. Those few gentlemen who attend divine service mutt postpone ogling the beauties till they meet them in a more fit place: their boots and riding-canes, I would advise them not to assume till their return home; since, in my opinion, a previous preparation for pleasure is not the best employment of the short space between rising and church-time, and besides, this extreme readiness argues some little impatience of the duty to come to perform.</p>
*When
<pb n="11 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
<p>When I say I can direct the flame of my Pharos to any object, I would not have it understood that I use this power in its full extent; there are many rocks, within the scope of its limitation, which it never than bestow its beams on; there are many haunts and habitations into which it never shall penetrate. It shall never *controul the efforts of those Syrens who would allure their fellow voyagers to ruin, in the unfashionable gulf of infidelity, any otherwise than by shewing the comforts of settled faith; the blasphemous Socinian, the feud-fomenting Arian, and the superstitious Manichean may enjoy their heretical opinions. To, all their endeavours I oppose the consolatory promise of an all-powerful divinity, that the gates of Hell than not prevail against his religion.
With politics I shall never intermeddle. I have but one opinion respecting. them, and that inclines me equally to,
*B6 a11
<pb n="12 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
all parties. The disinterested exertions of real patriots shall ever have my best wishes, but my paper shall not be the instrument either of promoting tyranny or inciting faction.</p>
<p>The haunts and habitations, which I shall leave in their natural opacity, are such as have before admitted the presence of sin in her original *emmitigated state, for though many of the foibles I *develope may be the produce of her cultivations, yet not having her deep-stained hue, they rank in a less odious class, and are too frequently found in minds that would abhor positive wickedness. Guilt is, I fear, proof against any exposure I could make of it; and, from using its Medusa's head as a means to raise horror and detestation, I am deterred from a doubt of the success of this practice. It is with me a very strong objection to some of our most celebrated periodical papers, that in order
*to
<pb n="13 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
to warn the inexperienced from vice, its features and actions are so portrayed and described as to communicate information that can never be useful in the degree it is pernicious. Ignorance is a much safer bulwark against vice than any initiation, however well-designed or guarded; let us aim at strengthening and supporting infant virtue, and she will soon introduce an abhorrence of her enemy; our pupils will then be virtuous, not out of fear of the punishments they are to apprehend from the seducer, but on the noble principles of love and steady attachment to her under whose auspices they hope for happiness.</p>
<p>My fair friends may therefore read, without apprehension, that the next paragraph may call a blush to their cheeks--they may read without fearing that the ensuing story will explore the recesses of vice and libertinisin, or that,
*under
<pb n="14 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
under a specious appearance, they are imbibing poison.</p>
<p>To those who, with a laudable desire of putting into the hands of young persons whatever can tend to their advantage, are curious to know how far the conductor of this work may be trusted, it is necessary to say, that no subject, no sentiment, no expression, no word shall be admitted, which can militate against their endeavors; they shall find no tales that can stir up passion against reason, no immorality palliated, nor any weakness of the judgment excused by fashionable sophistry.</p>
<p>Such is the plan of this work, and such the manner in which it shall be executed; what may be its success is problematical: if it is kindly received, I shall hope I have added one to the many amusing and instructive books this age has furnished; if it is neglected, the absence of ambition will render disap-
*point-
<pb n="15 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
pointment tolerable. And, above all, I shall be comforted. by reflecting, that I can incur little respectable censure, for, to tie honor of my contemporaries be it said, they are ever disposed to patronize every attempt</p>
*To please by scenes unconscious of offence,
By harmless merriment or useful sense.

*My humble spirit waits your social hand.
ANN YEARSLEY.
<p>WHEN I had resolved on personal concealment during the publication of there papers, I began to fear it would injure my work by discouraging correspondents. Five or six of my intimate friends I knew I could rely on for their occasional aid; but as I wished to present my readers with variety, I cast about for a way to attract contributions. This care I have reason to believe will prove needless, for from the many applications made to my book-seller since Tuesday, I am persuaded I shall have abundant communication. Many persons, I hear, approve my plan, and think my paper will be a good vehicle for their sentiments on
*various
<pb n="17 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
various topics, Others say, it will afford a delicate means of well-intentioned accusation, as they can covertly intimate to their relatives or friends any foible that tends to the uneasiness of others. One young lady, I am told, offered an essay, and another seemed comforted that she had now an opportunity of gratifying her desire to appear in print, without being known.</p>
<p>As I did not expect this encouragement, I had not instructed my publisher to accept it: this omission I therefore here supply by returning my thanks to all who thus honored me, and by assuring them I shall, with alacrity, substitute their labors for my own, provided the productions sent to me conform to the outline I have already given of my plan, and that I am never made responsible for slander. Whatever is amusing or instructive, gay or serious, elegant or
simple, if it be innocent, shall find a
*place
<pb n="18 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
place in my papers:--subjects of learning deserve a better situation, and would be leis acceptable than any I admit, because I expel the fair sex will furnish me moil readers :--such of them as have acquired considerable literature wish now and then to relax their minds by works that require no painful stretch of attention; they therefore might be offended to find the subjects they had just quitted in weariness again presented to their eyes:—and such ladies as have confined their researches to the common circuit of information, seldom hope to find an author very gravely profound.</p>
<p>The inclination my volunteer correspondents professed, has operated in two ways on me; it gives me hopes of rendering my Pharos more particularly useful than I imagined I could make it, and it flatters me with the prospect of success in the general intention of my undertaking, as I am now almost certain
*of
<pb n="19 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
of being able to furnish a variety distinguished, whenever I print the spontaneous compositions of my new friends, by genius and elegance.</p>
<p>Should I not be deceived in my expectations, I shall present myself to my readers every <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> while I remain in the metropolis, which probably will extend my periodical existence nearly to the conclusion of the approaching session of parliament. During that time every contributory <hi rend="italic">morceau</hi> left for the Pharos, with that universal disseminator of literature Mr. HOOKHAM of New Bond-street, will be carefully forwarded, and respectfully attended to.</p>

*<hi rend="italic">Answers to the Messages and Queries, sent and delivered to the Publisher.</hi>
<p>To the Lady who asked if I would give some imitations of Sterne's man-
*ner,
<pb n="20 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
ner, I answer that few imitations have merit, that I wish to please by originality, but that if I were inclined to imitation, I should not *chuse to copy Mr. Sterne, either in his life, his morality, or his style.</p>

*<p><hi rend="italic">The elderly Gentleman</hi> who so vehemently combated my resolution to avoid political subjects, need not be angry: I had rather see his prediction, that my work <hi rend="italic">would not do without them</hi>, fulfilled, than embroil myself in contests, or blow up the sparks of sedition.</p>

*<p><hi rend="italic">The right honorable Countess</hi> who enquired if the Pharos would prove as excellent as the Mirror, is respectfully informed, that in the nature of things it cannot be; fore even should the abilities of the volunteer essayists be equal to those of the Mirror's correspondents, still the conductor's part would debase
*the
<pb n="21 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
the work far below that justly applauded standard.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">The young Lady with fair hair and blue eyes</hi>, who, in the author's hearing, desired Mr. Hookham to tell him she would not give a pin for the Pharos, unless it contained stories that would make her cry, and laughed immoderately while the spoke: may rest satisfied, that if, like the philosopher of old, she is inclined to weep at the follies of mankind, the plan of the Pharos promises her abundant amusement.</p>

<p>I would advise <hi rend="italic">the Stripling</hi> who <hi rend="italic">demanded</hi> to be told whether there would be any <hi rend="italic">fun</hi> in the Pharos, to spend his time rather in reading the writings of Smollett or the "Probationary Odes."</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">The Lady</hi> who wished it could be written in French, is intreated to remember it is published in London.</p>
*To
<pb n="22 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
<p>To Satisfy the many who have enquired whether it will be a <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi> work, I confess I know not the meaning of the term—-a. work <hi rend="italic">without sentiment</hi> it would be difficult to produce, therefore I do not think this will be so. If, by <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi>, they intend that vice-varnishing cant that is used to recommend the substitution of frailty for integrity, I can promise this work will be far from sentimental.</p>
<p>Nothing that is not honest can gain admittance into this paper—-unmerited praise is not honest-—therefore no puffs can gain admittance.</p>

No III. TUESDAY, Nov. 14, 1786.
*The prize belongs to none but the sincere.
COWPER.
<p>MY readers and myself, are, I trust by this time, tolerably well acquainted, at least sufficiently so to render superfluous any further ceremony. I shall therefore lay before them a notification, which it may be of importance to them to receive early: it is chiefly designed for the perusal of the ladies; but as many fathers, husbands, and brothers are fond of testifying their regard to the females of their family, by purchasing gifts for them, both sexes are interested in the following advertisement which I print <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> as it came to my hands:</p>
*WHEREAS
<pb n="24 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
<p>WHEREAS this is unquestionably an *economical age, and duchesses spend mornings in search of bargains, it perhaps will be deemed serviceable to such ladies as love to have their penny-worth for their penny, if they are informed where they may be certain of buying, at a very inconsiderable expence, some inestimable habiliments and decorations.</p>
<p>They are therefore hereby given to understand, that when the town is at the fullest, during the next setting of parliament, there will be an auction of an antique wardrobe bequeathed by a lady of great quality, lately deceased, to her grand-daughter, with an injunction never to be prevailed on by the intreaties of any one, to part with it, or any articles in it; which circumstance obliges the legatee to sell it, the dowager certainly having no antipathy to that mode of conveyance, as neither the word <hi rend="italic">sale</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">auction</hi> occurs in her will.</p>
*Before
<pb n="25 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
<p>Before the lots are particularized, it is necessary to mention that nobody living ever remembers any one of these articles being publicly worn; for which reason they ought to be much esteemed, as by a little judicious alteration or addition they may be made appear quite modern, and if they are named after some celebrated <hi rend="italic">frail</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">balloon-flier</hi>, they will doubtless attract public admiration. Another circumstance to be remarked is, that if kept with care, they will be liable to no misfortune or decay: time, so far from injuring them, will. render them more capable of duration: and, betide this important recommendation, they possess another still more valuable; they can never become common: the vulgar may pretend to imitate them, but the counterfeit will be easily distinguished from the original.</p>
*VOL. I. C LOT
<pb n="26 THE PHAROS No. III"/>

*LOT I.
<p>THE VEIL OF MODESTY. A most beautiful and becoming ornament, intended to be fastened to the back part of the head dress, and to hang over the face and neck. Its particular qualities are, that it reflects a lustre on all good actions, it makes an indifferent face agreeable, heightens real beauty, and is an effectual preservative from many mental disorders.</p>

*LOT II.
<p>THE ROBE OF CHASTITY. Quite white, plain, but of exquisitely fine texture. Some India traders who once law it, allowed it to exceed any muslin ever imported, but thought it too tender to be worn, which circumstance .must recommend it to those ladies who enjoy dragging ten pounds worth of chintz up and down St. James's Mall, especi-
*ally
<pb n="27 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
ally when they are told that nothing can injure this graceful garment if worn
with <hi rend="italic">the sandals of Discretion</hi> hereafter described, and that its singularity, when once it is admitted, will always make it admired. Its properties are, that it always directs the affections to proper objects, and that no lady who wears it openly will be pestered with licentious conversation.</p>

*LOT. III.
<p>THE MANTLE OF DECORUM. This, though it has an antiquated name, is no other than a very becoming cloak, fit for any season of the year. Notwithstanding it is adapted to all weathers, it is transparent. A fine shape is seen to great advantage through it, and its color sets off the complexion admirably. The wearer will never be at a loss how to behave to superiors, equals or inferiors: it will teach her when to smile
*C 2 or
<pb n="28 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
or to look grave; and it is particularly friendly to such ladies, if any such there be, who doubt their quantum of good sense.</p>

*LOT IV.
<p>THE CESTUS OF HONOR. Cerulian blue, studded with gold. It has, at the
pendent end, a fringe of a very uncommon sort, called <hi rend="italic">Integrity</hi>, and is singular in this respect, that it fastens on each fide of the waist with two resplendent jewels; the one a present from Justice, the other the gift of Love. The beauty of this cestus is not to be described or imagined. It has been in the family many ages, and is said to be
that Venus wore, with some additions made about the time of our Queen Elizabeth. It diffuses over the whole person an air of graceful dignity. The possessor of it will never be at a loss to pay tradesmen's bills. If purchased
*by
<pb n="29 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
by a single lady, she will never feel any temptation to an expedition to Gretna, Green with her footman. A married lady, who should be the happy mistress of it, would always prefer her husband to the most accomplished libertine in the world. No promise was ever broken, no secret ever divulged, nor was an intrigue or divorce ever thought of by the successive possessors of this elegant ornament. To prove its efficacy it may not be impertinent to observe, that since the present owner resolved to part from it, and sent it to the auctioneer's, lest by frequent sight of it her resolution. should be shaken, she has spent in a ratio of ten to one of her income, and cannot now venture out lest her mantua-maker should arrest her: beside this, her windows have been twice broken by the friends of ladies to whose husbands the had made advances.</p>
*C 3 LOT
<pb n="30 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
THE BRIDLE OF FORBEARANCE. A plain ribbon of a most delicate hue, intended to reach from the top of the head, down each side of the face, to the chin, where it ties. in a bow. It forms a fine outline to a well-turned face, and is an infallible preservative against many errors; it prevents satire, slander, ridicule, taunting, hard speeches, and excess in words of every kind. Many an indifferent husband has been charmed into virtue by its power: the peace of many families has been preserved by it: it spares the wearer a vast deal of trouble, and saves her lungs amazingly, as it removes all necessity of scolding servants, *&ampc. for natural defects or inevitable ignorance.</p>
LOTS
<pb n="31 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
*LOTS VI and VII.
<p>THE STOMACHER OF PATIENCE and THE BREAST-KNOT OF MEEKNESS. These it has been found difficult to separate without injury: they will therefore, as forming one ornament, be put up together; and it is not doubted that the lady to whom they may be knocked down will approve of the junction, as the stomacher was never known to fail in alleviating misfortune, and the breast-knot has the property of making blessings preponderate against afflictions.</p>

*LOT VIII.
<p>The next. article. is as singular as it is beautiful. THE BOUQUET OF SINCERITY, composed of the finest flowers produced in any climate, which will retain their lustre and fragrance as long as the owner's thoughts and words go together. Should any lady, having this
*C4 in-
<pb n="32 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
invaluable bouquet in her bosom, be prompted to profess friendship, esteem, admiration, or any other passion or inclination she .does not feel, she will immediately perceive the flowers droop, and will, by that signal, be warned to correct her speech. Thus she will avoid the sin of deceiving, and be spared the inconveniences resulting from the practice of flattery, and the misery of reflecting that she has raised hopes she did not mean to gratify.</p>

*LOT IX.
<p>THE SANDALS OF DISCRETION. These are to the feet what <hi rend="italic">the Bridle of Forbearance</hi> is to the tongue. No lady wearing them can be abroad when she ought to be at home, nor dance so long as to injure her health they prevent the effects of late hours, and thereby preserve health and beauty.</p>
*LOT
<pb n="33 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
*LOT X.
<p>THE BRACELETS OF BENEFICENCE. These are unerring monitors in the article of donation: they will, of themselves, incline a lady to with-hold her subscription from masquerades, ridottos, *&ampc. &ampc. and teach her the exquisite pleasure of relieving merit in distress.--That no one may have reason to complain of imposition, it is here acknowledged that these bracelets were for some time lost out of the family, and. that for the right hand, named <hi rend="italic">Liberality</hi>, was so exactly copied by many ladies of high rank and large fortune, that it is now thought to possess no uncommon, power: that named <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi>, designed. for the left hand, was recovered before many imitations were made.</p>
*C5 LOT
<pb n="34 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
<p>The last article of dress in this curious wardrobe, is the most magnificent and valuable, but without the preceding decorations it will not be worn to advantage, nor will any spectator believe the jewels which form it are real. This is THE CORONET OF PIETY. It is composed of finer stones than ever were
dug out of the earth, and has a celestial radiance which nothing can equal. It
gives dignity and sweetness to the countenance, and if carefully worn, and kept
bright, will fupply the place of all wit, learning, and accomplishments. It takes from the possessor all painful passions, and inspires the mind with such calm joy as no earthly possessions can give. It will likewise attract universal love, insure satisfaction through life, and mitigate even the sufferings of pain and
*sick-
<pb n="35 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
sickness. To use the words of a living orator and poet, it
*'In chains, in torments, pleasure can bequeath,
'And dress in smiles the tyrant hour of death.'

Surely no price can be thought adequate to such a treasure! but yet, as an inducement with ladies to become purchasers in this sale, the proprietor has instructed the auctioneer to make a present of it many person who will bid, to the extent of their ability, for all the other articles with a sincere intention of wearing them. And to this gratuitous donation she has likewise ordered to be added, in case any lady buys the whole collection, the glass at which these decorations must be put on, called

*LOT XII.
<p>THE MIRROR OF CONTENT, which will convince the possessor that how-
*ever
<pb n="36 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
ever dearly she may have bought some articles, she has made a very advantageous purchase, even should she have spent her Taft guinea at this sale; for this mirror will preclude all anxiety, furnish an inexhaustible source of new delights, and convert afflictions into blessings.</p>

Without waiting for the appearance of any fymptoms of genius, or confulting the bent of his children's inclinations, any farther than allowing the two addl. their choice of the three elec`l:ed branches of learning, he began his arduous- work, and continued in the profecution of it till his youngeft fon had attained the age of nineteen, when death, by ending my friend Peter's cares, robbed him of the felicity he had fo long labored for, and ethancipated his three fcholars from their rural confinement.
As London was the theatre on which their father defigned to exhibit their talents, they repaired hither on his deceafe, and as I was his oldeft friend there, to me devolved the office of Cicerone and mailer of the ceremonies. My cu:

as iliffl y hors de lei mode.
What was uncouth in their habiliments, a short time and a little exertion correfted : their deportment was not inflexible, and difcovcring that their attainments were as far beyond the generality of fcholaftic aequifition, as their mode of education had been different from the common one, I began to think

This was a grievous mortification to my Greek critic, who had in hand ,a work that would admirably make his debut, and which it (till required two years attention to fit for the prefs. He had inherited a large portion of his father's enthufiafm, and chagrin was to be the reward of his labors.
The fecond ion, v iio had chofen natural philofophv as his field, had fubmitred rather patiently than willingly to the fetters of literature : pea'feverance had done much, and I predicted him a future Prieftley or Walker, till on closely examining him as to the courfe of emolument he meant to adhere to, he with great mode,fty told me, that what-ever I advifed he would follow ; but that he could never be thoroughly ,pleafed with his profeflion, unlefs h~ was allowed to chufe that of hiftorypainting.—He produced to me fome

The lapfe of a few months fettled my old friend's children in their various profefiions : a curacy of fifty pounds a year, in a fituation where his learning can be of little ufe to him, has provided for my Grecian :—the natural philofopher in an enthufiaflic purfuit of his beloved art,_ which probably for force time will not pay the expellees of color and canvas, is endeavoring to forget the rigors of his youth ;—and mathematics have hitherto procured the votary of Mars little other honor than the nick-name of Euclid,. with which, and the fcant.ly pittance of an enfign, he. mud yet red contented.

AVARICE, or a love of money' for its own fake, is a vice fo in-:ircly factitious, is fo produc`iive of miiery, and fo incapable of procuring pleafure, that it is aflonithing how it f rcl found admiflion into the humah heart : that it has, is certain ; but that real and true genuine avarice, that kind of infirmity which prevents men from regarding wealth as a means to an end, and reprefents it as the end itfelf, is perhaps much lets commonly met with than is generally fuppofed : where we cannot find out the motive to amafling wealth we are apt, too haftily, to pre-fume that the poffeffion of it, is the good fought, and till we are indued

with the faculty of teeing into each other's hearts, and while the difpoftion to fix the wort conitrudion on the ac tions of our neighbors lairs, this will continue an evil to be reprobated. However, it is not to be denied, that there are fome people avaricious to no purpofe, nor that it is a mental diieafe perceptible in fome children hen they are too young to be acquainted with the real vaIie of riches, or to have coniidercd the evils from which parfimony may proted them. All here con-tended for, is, that we affix the epithet of avaricious, to tempers that, al-though their bad qualities may be no jets rcprehenfihle, do not merit the charge of avarice.
On the other hand it may be alledg.-
ed, that thoie who are cenfured thus
unjufily, often draw the imputation on
themfelves, by their own want of pru-
dence and judgment. We fee people
{paring,

sparing; where they ought to be.liberat, and we therefore almoft naturally conclude that their temper leads them to with-hold ; but to this it may be anfwered, that our deciflon ought to be fuipended till we are allured, that they are not liberal where they might be, and perhaps it behoves them to be fearing, which if they are, their error takes another name, as arifing from another cause, and we must fay of them,. that they, either from vice or folly, are injudicious in their expenditure.
Of thefe who `thus acquire the chaxader of mifers, there are two' clafres : the firft confitls of filch as being governed by no regular principle, and wanting equability of temper, obey fudden impulfes thefe have fits of generofity,, 'which, as deftitute of difcretion to control them, they generally furfeit on,. and extreme indulgence feeks its anti-&ote in parfimony :--a retention which

An indulgence of tafle, has often pro.
cured its votary the charge of avarice,
and a worthlefs favorite has frequently
been found the only witnefs of liberality.,
Thus AcRELIO is called avaricious, be-
caufe he could not _fpare five guineas

not backward in owning their opinicn

cenfors are here more to blame than the cenfured : if the reafon of the latter is governed by religion, and not jaundiced by a nnorofe reicc'lion of the fnpernurnerary bleiiings of life, their forbearance is highly commendable, and filch perfons «ill frequently, if not without exception, be found ready tc contribute in :n n av to the good of fociety, or to relieve particular diftrefs.

Neither ought the greedy and rapacious, though equitably called the covetous, to be indifcriminately ranked with the avaricious. The rapacity of one hand, is perhaps equalled by the profufon of the other : their power of retention is leis than that of a fieve, and their demands arc but to fupply the torrent of extravagance.
On the whole then, it will appear, that unlefs we area acquainted intimately with the temper and purfuits of others, we ought to with-hold the cenfure of avarice. It is a vice that has fo little to recommend it, and is coupled with fo much anxiety, that few care for its company.
