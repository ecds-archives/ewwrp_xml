THE PHAROS
NO I. TUESDAY, NOV. 7, 1786.
*Comme les hommes ne se dego&#x00FBtent point du vice, il ne faut pas aussi se lasser de le leur reprocher: ils seroient peut-&ecirctre pires s'ils venoient &agrave manquer de censeurs ou de critiques; c'est ce qui fait que l'on pr&ecircche &amp que l'on ecrit.
LA BRUYERE.

<p>THE writer of a periodical paper is officially a censor of public manners, and as such, is frequently more the object of dread than of love: he is considered as incessantly purveying for his work, sagacious in discovering and industrious in noting obliquities of
<pb n="2 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
character, and when once known, is shunned as a spy and informer. For this reason, and that he may not defeat his purpose of observation by freezing his beholders into *petrifaction, concealment is necessary to an author of this class: he must envelope himself in eternal shades, unless his labors effect that stupendous change in the human heart which shall incline it to love what it is painful to suffer.</p>
<p>To speak in my own person--against all fear of detection I am abundantly fortified by the consciousness that I shall not rouse curiosity: I have not humility enough to think I than want readers: the utility and convenience of my productions will soon be manifest ; and a lady or gentleman will no more submit to the operations of a <hi rend="italic">friseur</hi>, without the consolatory aid of my paper, than a *kinght-errant would undertake an adventure without invoking his mistress;
*but
<pb n="3 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
but yet I do not expect such approbation as will make my patrons uneasy while they are ignorant of my name.</p>
<p>It may probably be asked by those to whom chance may direct the following sheets, what could be the incentive to an undertaking of this kind, in an age replete with publications of a similar nature, so excellent as to afford no hope of surpassing them, and so comprehensive as scarcely to have left any thing to be said by a subsequent writer. By some I shall be censured for presumption, by others for vanity. I shall, no doubt, be reminded that the talents of Steele and Addison, of Johnson and of Hawkesworth have at different times been exercised in the same species of composition: if they have succeeded in the endeavor to instruct and amend, what remains for me to do? If they have failed, who shall *hazad another attempt?</p>
*B2 As
<pb n="4 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
<p>As I foresee the charge which will be brought against me, I am prepared to meet it, and to vindicate myself from the imputation of presumption by declaring that though I wish to leave the world better than I find it, I have at no time entertained an opinion that reformation of manners is reserved for my pen's *achievement. Nor can I be justly accused of vanity as I never shall claim any praise vouchsafed me, and the keenest sagacity will be defeated in search of one.</p>
<p>It now remains to explain my undertaking, and to divulge . my intentions. And first, I am to make good my title.</p>
<p>A Pharos, every one knows, is nothing more nor less than a light-house, whose benefits are chiefly calculated for the service of the sailor: its flame is intended to warn him from the shoal and the rock ; and thus, by his super-added knowledge, it proves a guide to safe an-
*chorage,
<pb n="5 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
chorage, or contributes to the safety of his voyage. In life, a friendly monitor of this kind is no less useful: few, who compare the world to a sea, feign it a pacific ocean: it is by its best friends acknowledged not only exposed to the storms, but likewise to every danger of the deep: whirlpools, quicksands, promontories, and shallows perpetually oppose the voyager's way, and miserable indeed is he if deprived of light and warning.</p>
<p>In one particular I confess my work resembles not a Pharos. It is not placed in a conspicuous situation, consequently the orbit of its rays will be much confined. But let this be no discouragement: it pretends to illuminate no boundless ocean, but its light may be seen timely enough to avoid every danger it intimates. It will instruct all who, in a heady endeavor after safety, appeal to its power; for however partially
*B3 it
<pb n="6 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
it may direct its flame, or however dimly it may. burn, still shall be visible to the mariner this important monition, that he can no longer hope for security than while he sails by the chart of scripture and the compass of reason, towards that new undiscovered country, where all his labors than end, and a final remuneration avails him.</p>
<p>But as in one particular I own my Pharos deficient, so in another I hope it will excel its archetype: its light shall be to none terrific. I cannot promise it will ever blaze into admirable brightness, nor that I can always preserve more than a lambent flame; but a friend of mine, a very ingenious artist, has promised occasionally to amuse the beholders with a few *corruscations, which, if well-timed and applied, may obliterate or obtain toleration for any natural defects in my edifice.</p>
*The
<pb n="7 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
The method by which I shall endeavor to serve those who resort to my light for counsel, will not be always the same. In some cases it may be most useful to render the dangerous body luminous: in others I may do more good by directing a few rays to the shipwrecked vessel or mariner. To him or his vessel will always be found attached a scroll containing the history of his fate, an attentive perusal of which is all the impost I exact. Sometimes I shall warn by pointing out the errors of other voyagers who still vainly beat the waves, and sometimes shall endeavor to make manifest to those I guide that no nautical skill, nor the best applied exertion, can aid them if they steer towards an inhibited port.</p>
<p>Having now informed my readers of the engine I mean to use, it is fit that I make them acquainted in some measure with the temper, disposition, and views
*B4 that
<pb n="8 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
that shall regulate and direct its powers.</p>
<p>Can I hope those who encourage me by their attention, will believe that however conspicuous I may render vice and folly, I indulge no malignant spirit! I may perhaps be less lenient to that fashion which stamps new characters and blends contrary properties, than the world in general are, for I assert the privilege of thinking for myself. I cannot condemn or approve with apathy, but I never yet dipped my pen in gall, nor would I point out, to observation, the frailties of my fellow-creatures, were I not convinced that morality is injured by the forbearance.</p>
<p>That no one may complain of being unfairly surprised in their follies, I here give this preliminary notice, that the flame of my Pharos possesses an uncommon property. Nothing is a security from its rays; it can penetrate into the most obscure places; no building, no
*tiling,
<pb n="9 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
tiling, roof, or ceiling of any kind, is a defence against it. Should a lady or gentleman meet or pay a visit to any acquaintance or friend, I advise all of the party to be cautious in their behavior; for a few of my ignited particles may be blended with the solar beams, and I may, by that means, know all that passes. At a card-table I warn all the players to observe strictly not only all the laws of honesty but of decorum, for their wax candles probably burn by my aid. Thus
I frequently partake of a <hi rend="italic">partie quarr&eacutee<hi rend="italic">, a <hi rend="italic">t&ecircte-&agrave-t&ecircte</hi> at piquet, or a game at mirth-inspiring loo; and as I am possessed of a wonderful degree of sagacity, whetted by the necessity of providing, twice in a week, a mental repast for my readers, I can in a moment discover the passions by which those I observe are agitated or governed. Every church window admits. this perforating, light, and reflects the objects to me: ladies are
*B5 there-
<pb n="10 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
therefore requested, if they would avoid my censure, to visit that place <hi rend="italic">sans rouge</hi>: their eyes mull be restrained, and their countenances composed: they must not talk of last night's opera, or next Thursday's concert, nor make future engagements: they must join decently and devoutly in the worship they assist at, and leave all solicitude about their dress and admirers at home or in their carriages. Those few gentlemen who attend divine service mutt postpone ogling the beauties till they meet them in a more fit place: their boots and riding-canes, I would advise them not to assume till their return home; since, in my opinion, a previous preparation for pleasure is not the best employment of the short space between rising and church-time, and besides, this extreme readiness argues some little impatience of the duty to come to perform.</p>
*When
<pb n="11 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
<p>When I say I can direct the flame of my Pharos to any object, I would not have it understood that I use this power in its full extent; there are many rocks, within the scope of its limitation, which it never than bestow its beams on; there are many haunts and habitations into which it never shall penetrate. It shall never *controul the efforts of those Syrens who would allure their fellow voyagers to ruin, in the unfashionable gulf of infidelity, any otherwise than by shewing the comforts of settled faith; the blasphemous Socinian, the feud-fomenting Arian, and the superstitious Manichean may enjoy their heretical opinions. To, all their endeavours I oppose the consolatory promise of an all-powerful divinity, that the gates of Hell than not prevail against his religion.
With politics I shall never intermeddle. I have but one opinion respecting. them, and that inclines me equally to,
*B6 a11
<pb n="12 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
all parties. The disinterested exertions of real patriots shall ever have my best wishes, but my paper shall not be the instrument either of promoting tyranny or inciting faction.</p>
<p>The haunts and habitations, which I shall leave in their natural opacity, are such as have before admitted the presence of sin in her original *emmitigated state, for though many of the foibles I *develope may be the produce of her cultivations, yet not having her deep-stained hue, they rank in a less odious class, and are too frequently found in minds that would abhor positive wickedness. Guilt is, I fear, proof against any exposure I could make of it; and, from using its Medusa's head as a means to raise horror and detestation, I am deterred from a doubt of the success of this practice. It is with me a very strong objection to some of our most celebrated periodical papers, that in order
*to
<pb n="13 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
to warn the inexperienced from vice, its features and actions are so portrayed and described as to communicate information that can never be useful in the degree it is pernicious. Ignorance is a much safer bulwark against vice than any initiation, however well-designed or guarded; let us aim at strengthening and supporting infant virtue, and she will soon introduce an abhorrence of her enemy; our pupils will then be virtuous, not out of fear of the punishments they are to apprehend from the seducer, but on the noble principles of love and steady attachment to her under whose auspices they hope for happiness.</p>
<p>My fair friends may therefore read, without apprehension, that the next paragraph may call a blush to their cheeks--they may read without fearing that the ensuing story will explore the recesses of vice and libertinisin, or that,
*under
<pb n="14 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
under a specious appearance, they are imbibing poison.</p>
<p>To those who, with a laudable desire of putting into the hands of young persons whatever can tend to their advantage, are curious to know how far the conductor of this work may be trusted, it is necessary to say, that no subject, no sentiment, no expression, no word shall be admitted, which can militate against their endeavors; they shall find no tales that can stir up passion against reason, no immorality palliated, nor any weakness of the judgment excused by fashionable sophistry.</p>
<p>Such is the plan of this work, and such the manner in which it shall be executed; what may be its success is problematical: if it is kindly received, I shall hope I have added one to the many amusing and instructive books this age has furnished; if it is neglected, the absence of ambition will render disap-
*point-
<pb n="15 THE PHAROS No. I"/>
pointment tolerable. And, above all, I shall be comforted. by reflecting, that I can incur little respectable censure, for, to tie honor of my contemporaries be it said, they are ever disposed to patronize every attempt</p>
*To please by scenes unconscious of offence,
By harmless merriment or useful sense.

No. II. SATURDAY, NOV. 11, 1786.
*My humble spirit waits your social hand.
ANN YEARSLEY.
<p>WHEN I had resolved on personal concealment during the publication of there papers, I began to fear it would injure my work by discouraging correspondents. Five or six of my intimate friends I knew I could rely on for their occasional aid; but as I wished to present my readers with variety, I cast about for a way to attract contributions. This care I have reason to believe will prove needless, for from the many applications made to my book-seller since Tuesday, I am persuaded I shall have abundant communication. Many persons, I hear, approve my plan, and think my paper will be a good vehicle for their sentiments on
*various
<pb n="17 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
various topics, Others say, it will afford a delicate means of well-intentioned accusation, as they can covertly intimate to their relatives or friends any foible that tends to the uneasiness of others. One young lady, I am told, offered an essay, and another seemed comforted that she had now an opportunity of gratifying her desire to appear in print, without being known.</p>
<p>As I did not expect this encouragement, I had not instructed my publisher to accept it: this omission I therefore here supply by returning my thanks to all who thus honored me, and by assuring them I shall, with alacrity, substitute their labors for my own, provided the productions sent to me conform to the outline I have already given of my plan, and that I am never made responsible for slander. Whatever is amusing or instructive, gay or serious, elegant or
simple, if it be innocent, shall find a
*place
<pb n="18 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
place in my papers:--subjects of learning deserve a better situation, and would be leis acceptable than any I admit, because I expel the fair sex will furnish me moil readers :--such of them as have acquired considerable literature wish now and then to relax their minds by works that require no painful stretch of attention; they therefore might be offended to find the subjects they had just quitted in weariness again presented to their eyes:—and such ladies as have confined their researches to the common circuit of information, seldom hope to find an author very gravely profound.</p>
<p>The inclination my volunteer correspondents professed, has operated in two ways on me; it gives me hopes of rendering my Pharos more particularly useful than I imagined I could make it, and it flatters me with the prospect of success in the general intention of my undertaking, as I am now almost certain
*of
<pb n="19 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
of being able to furnish a variety distinguished, whenever I print the spontaneous compositions of my new friends, by genius and elegance.</p>
<p>Should I not be deceived in my expectations, I shall present myself to my readers every <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> while I remain in the metropolis, which probably will extend my periodical existence nearly to the conclusion of the approaching session of parliament. During that time every contributory <hi rend="italic">morceau</hi> left for the Pharos, with that universal disseminator of literature Mr. HOOKHAM of New Bond-street, will be carefully forwarded, and respectfully attended to.</p>

*<hi rend="italic">Answers to the Messages and Queries, sent and delivered to the Publisher.</hi>
<p>To the Lady who asked if I would give some imitations of Sterne's man-
*ner,
<pb n="20 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
ner, I answer that few imitations have merit, that I wish to please by originality, but that if I were inclined to imitation, I should not *chuse to copy Mr. Sterne, either in his life, his morality, or his style.</p>

*<p><hi rend="italic">The elderly Gentleman</hi> who so vehemently combated my resolution to avoid political subjects, need not be angry: I had rather see his prediction, that my work <hi rend="italic">would not do without them</hi>, fulfilled, than embroil myself in contests, or blow up the sparks of sedition.</p>

*<p><hi rend="italic">The right honorable Countess</hi> who enquired if the Pharos would prove as excellent as the Mirror, is respectfully informed, that in the nature of things it cannot be; fore even should the abilities of the volunteer essayists be equal to those of the Mirror's correspondents, still the conductor's part would debase
*the
<pb n="21 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
the work far below that justly applauded standard.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">The young Lady with fair hair and blue eyes</hi>, who, in the author's hearing, desired Mr. Hookham to tell him she would not give a pin for the Pharos, unless it contained stories that would make her cry, and laughed immoderately while the spoke: may rest satisfied, that if, like the philosopher of old, she is inclined to weep at the follies of mankind, the plan of the Pharos promises her abundant amusement.</p>

<p>I would advise <hi rend="italic">the Stripling</hi> who <hi rend="italic">demanded</hi> to be told whether there would be any <hi rend="italic">fun</hi> in the Pharos, to spend his time rather in reading the writings of Smollett or the "Probationary Odes."</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">The Lady</hi> who wished it could be written in French, is intreated to remember it is published in London.</p>
*To
<pb n="22 THE PHAROS No. II"/>
<p>To Satisfy the many who have enquired whether it will be a <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi> work, I confess I know not the meaning of the term—-a. work <hi rend="italic">without sentiment</hi> it would be difficult to produce, therefore I do not think this will be so. If, by <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi>, they intend that vice-varnishing cant that is used to recommend the substitution of frailty for integrity, I can promise this work will be far from sentimental.</p>
<p>Nothing that is not honest can gain admittance into this paper—-unmerited praise is not honest-—therefore no puffs can gain admittance.</p>

No III. TUESDAY, Nov. 14, 1786.
*The prize belongs to none but the sincere.
COWPER.
<p>MY readers and myself, are, I trust by this time, tolerably well acquainted, at least sufficiently so to render superfluous any further ceremony. I shall therefore lay before them a notification, which it may be of importance to them to receive early: it is chiefly designed for the perusal of the ladies; but as many fathers, husbands, and brothers are fond of testifying their regard to the females of their family, by purchasing gifts for them, both sexes are interested in the following advertisement which I print <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> as it came to my hands:</p>
*WHEREAS
<pb n="24 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
<p>WHEREAS this is unquestionably an *&#x0153conomical age, and duchesses spend mornings in search of bargains, it perhaps will be deemed serviceable to such ladies as love to have their penny-worth for their penny, if they are informed where they may be certain of buying, at a very inconsiderable expence, some inestimable habiliments and decorations.</p>
<p>They are therefore hereby given to understand, that when the town is at the fullest, during the next setting of parliament, there will be an auction of an antique wardrobe bequeathed by a lady of great quality, lately deceased, to her grand-daughter, with an injunction never to be prevailed on by the intreaties of any one, to part with it, or any articles in it; which circumstance obliges the legatee to sell it, the dowager certainly having no antipathy to that mode of conveyance, as neither the word <hi rend="italic">sale</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">auction</hi> occurs in her will.</p>
*Before
<pb n="25 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
<p>Before the lots are particularized, it is necessary to mention that nobody living ever remembers any one of these articles being publicly worn; for which reason they ought to be much esteemed, as by a little judicious alteration or addition they may be made appear quite modern, and if they are named after some celebrated <hi rend="italic">frail</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">balloon-flier</hi>, they will doubtless attract public admiration. Another circumstance to be remarked is, that if kept with care, they will be liable to no misfortune or decay: time, so far from injuring them, will. render them more capable of duration: and, betide this important recommendation, they possess another still more valuable; they can never become common: the vulgar may pretend to imitate them, but the counterfeit will be easily distinguished from the original.</p>
*VOL. I. C LOT
<pb n="26 THE PHAROS No. III"/>

*LOT I.
<p>THE VEIL OF MODESTY. A most beautiful and becoming ornament, intended to be fastened to the back part of the head dress, and to hang over the face and neck. Its particular qualities are, that it reflects a lustre on all good actions, it makes an indifferent face agreeable, heightens real beauty, and is an effectual preservative from many mental disorders.</p>

*LOT II.
<p>THE ROBE OF CHASTITY. Quite white, plain, but of exquisitely fine texture. Some India traders who once law it, allowed it to exceed any muslin ever imported, but thought it too tender to be worn, which circumstance .must recommend it to those ladies who enjoy dragging ten pounds worth of chintz up and down St. James's Mall, especi-
*ally
<pb n="27 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
ally when they are told that nothing can injure this graceful garment if worn
with <hi rend="italic">the sandals of Discretion</hi> hereafter described, and that its singularity, when once it is admitted, will always make it admired. Its properties are, that it always directs the affections to proper objects, and that no lady who wears it openly will be pestered with licentious conversation.</p>




*LOT. III.
<p>THE MANTLE OF DECORUM. This, though it has an antiquated name, is no other than a very becoming cloak, fit for any season of the year. Notwithstanding it is adapted to all weathers, it is transparent. A fine shape is seen to great advantage through it, and its color sets off the complexion admirably. The wearer will never be at a loss how to behave to superiors, equals or inferiors: it will teach her when to smile
*C 2 or
<pb n="28 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
or to look grave; and it is particularly friendly to such ladies, if any such there be, who doubt their quantum of good sense.</p>

*LOT IV.
<p>THE CESTUS OF HONOR. Cerulian blue, studded with gold. It has, at the
pendent end, a fringe of a very uncommon sort, called <hi rend="italic">Integrity</hi>, and is singular in this respect, that it fastens on each fide of the waist with two resplendent jewels; the one a present from Justice, the other the gift of Love. The beauty of this cestus is not to be described or imagined. It has been in the family many ages, and is said to be
that Venus wore, with some additions made about the time of our Queen Elizabeth. It diffuses over the whole person an air of graceful dignity. The possessor of it will never be at a loss to pay tradesmen's bills. If purchased
*by
<pb n="29 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
by a single lady, she will never feel any temptation to an expedition to Gretna, Green with her footman. A married lady, who should be the happy mistress of it, would always prefer her husband to the most accomplished libertine in the world. No promise was ever broken, no secret ever divulged, nor was an intrigue or divorce ever thought of by the successive possessors of this elegant ornament. To prove its efficacy it may not be impertinent to observe, that since the present owner resolved to part from it, and sent it to the auctioneer's, lest by frequent sight of it her resolution. should be shaken, she has spent in a ratio of ten to one of her income, and cannot now venture out lest her mantua-maker should arrest her: beside this, her windows have been twice broken by the friends of ladies to whose husbands the had made advances.</p>
*C 3 LOT
<pb n="30 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
THE BRIDLE OF FORBEARANCE. A plain ribbon of a most delicate hue, intended to reach from the top of the head, down each side of the face, to the chin, where it ties. in a bow. It forms a fine outline to a well-turned face, and is an infallible preservative against many errors; it prevents satire, slander, ridicule, taunting, hard speeches, and excess in words of every kind. Many an indifferent husband has been charmed into virtue by its power: the peace of many families has been preserved by it: it spares the wearer a vast deal of trouble, and saves her lungs amazingly, as it removes all necessity of scolding servants, *&ampc. for natural defects or inevitable ignorance.</p>
LOTS
<pb n="31 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
*LOTS VI and VII.
<p>THE STOMACHER OF PATIENCE and THE BREAST-KNOT OF MEEKNESS. These it has been found difficult to separate without injury: they will therefore, as forming one ornament, be put up together; and it is not doubted that the lady to whom they may be knocked down will approve of the junction, as the stomacher was never known to fail in alleviating misfortune, and the breast-knot has the property of making blessings preponderate against afflictions.</p>

*LOT VIII.
<p>The next. article. is as singular as it is beautiful. THE BOUQUET OF SINCERITY, composed of the finest flowers produced in any climate, which will retain their lustre and fragrance as long as the owner's thoughts and words go together. Should any lady, having this
*C4 in-
<pb n="32 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
invaluable bouquet in her bosom, be prompted to profess friendship, esteem, admiration, or any other passion or inclination she .does not feel, she will immediately perceive the flowers droop, and will, by that signal, be warned to correct her speech. Thus she will avoid the sin of deceiving, and be spared the inconveniences resulting from the practice of flattery, and the misery of reflecting that she has raised hopes she did not mean to gratify.</p>

*LOT IX.
<p>THE SANDALS OF DISCRETION. These are to the feet what <hi rend="italic">the Bridle of Forbearance</hi> is to the tongue. No lady wearing them can be abroad when she ought to be at home, nor dance so long as to injure her health they prevent the effects of late hours, and thereby preserve health and beauty.</p>
*LOT
<pb n="33 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
*LOT X.
<p>THE BRACELETS OF BENEFICENCE. These are unerring monitors in the article of donation: they will, of themselves, incline a lady to with-hold her subscription from masquerades, ridottos, *&ampc. &ampc. and teach her the exquisite pleasure of relieving merit in distress.--That no one may have reason to complain of imposition, it is here acknowledged that these bracelets were for some time lost out of the family, and. that for the right hand, named <hi rend="italic">Liberality</hi>, was so exactly copied by many ladies of high rank and large fortune, that it is now thought to possess no uncommon, power: that named <hi rend="italic">Prudence</hi>, designed. for the left hand, was recovered before many imitations were made.</p>
*C5 LOT
<pb n="34 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
<p>The last article of dress in this curious wardrobe, is the most magnificent and valuable, but without the preceding decorations it will not be worn to advantage, nor will any spectator believe the jewels which form it are real. This is THE CORONET OF PIETY. It is composed of finer stones than ever were
dug out of the earth, and has a celestial radiance which nothing can equal. It
gives dignity and sweetness to the countenance, and if carefully worn, and kept
bright, will supply the place of all wit, learning, and accomplishments. It takes from the possessor all painful passions, and inspires the mind with such calm joy as no earthly possessions can give. It will likewise attract universal love, insure satisfaction through life, and mitigate even the sufferings of pain and
*sick-
<pb n="35 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
sickness. To use the words of a living orator and poet, it
*'In chains, in torments, pleasure can bequeath,
'And dress in smiles the tyrant hour of death.'

Surely no price can be thought adequate to such a treasure! but yet, as an inducement with ladies to become purchasers in this sale, the proprietor has instructed the auctioneer to make a present of it many person who will bid, to the extent of their ability, for all the other articles with a sincere intention of wearing them. And to this gratuitous donation she has likewise ordered to be added, in case any lady buys the whole collection, the glass at which these decorations must be put on, called

*LOT XII.
<p>THE MIRROR OF CONTENT, which will convince the possessor that how-
*ever
<pb n="36 THE PHAROS No. III"/>
ever dearly she may have bought some articles, she has made a very advantageous purchase, even should she have spent her last guinea at this sale; for this mirror will preclude all anxiety, furnish an inexhaustible source of new delights, and convert afflictions into blessings.</p>

*Timely notice of the day and place of sale will be given.

JUVENAL.

<p>HOWEVER manners and customs may appear to degenerate or change, we have reason to believe that virtue and vice, and all their fainter shades, remain unalterably the same* the number of persons endowed with the one, or infected by the other, may be greater or less in different centuries, but the honest man and the knave of our day, are as much like those who flourished with our progenitors as the present race of animals or natural productions of the earth are like those our ancestors fed on. No one supposes Fabricius's turnips were things different from ours; nor have the patriotic Ro-
*man
<pb n="38 THE PHAROS No. IV"/>
man geese ever been denied the modern form and properties. From this permanency it arises, that in the writings of the ancient. moralists and satirists we often find portrayed the manners of our own times, the excesses or defects of our contemporaries, and often, would self-love acknowledge it, a mortifying similarity comes still nearer to our bosoms.</p>
<p>The characters of Theophrastus have been remarked on as in some sort prophetic; but I fear few pet-ions regard them in any other light than that which shews a whimsical casual resemblance, or turns them on their friends and neighbors. What so experienced a judge as this venerable author deemed responsible, I wish all concerned in his various censures would account so; particularly let the conversationists and <hi rend="italic">how d'ye do</hi> visitors of the rising generation attend to the following sketch, which he inti-

<p>He says, *'A silly love of prating is the offspring of an habit of speaking much without reflection. A prater finding himself seated next a person he never saw before, begins at the outset to entertain him by talking of and praising his own wife; then tells him his dream, and gives him a tedious account of a feast he was at without omitting a single dish. When he grows warm in conversation, he declaims against the present age, and asserts, that men are every day degenerating; from thence he digresses to the dearness of provisions; remarks on the number of foreigners who are flocking to the city, and foretels, that,

when the frost breaks the Thames will be navigable: then he observes, that a little rain would be very seasonable, and give hopes of a plentiful harvest; declares how he means to cultivate and dispose his land next year, and repeats, that times are hard, and that a man has now much ado to live. He next informs his unknown intimate, that Damippus's equipage was the finest at court; asks how many pillars support the roof of the opera-house; and what day of the month it is—-tells him that the preceding night his stomach was disordered; and, if the person he talks to has patience to hear him, he does not let him off so: he announces, as news, that the parliament will meet in January, adjourn at Easter, and rise some time in June.—-With such people there is but one course to be taken, which is, to shun them as the plague,

<p>Now who that reads this description with attention, would believe, that with only the substitution of the <hi rend="italic">Thames</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Sea</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">equipage</hi> of Damippus <hi rend="italic">at court</hi>, instead of his splendor <hi rend="italic">at the feast of Ceres</hi>; the parliament for the <hi rend="italic">rites of Bacchus and Ceres</hi>; this is a portrait drawn from the manners of Athens, by a native of Lesbos, who flourished three hundred and fourteen years before the christian *&aeligrra!</p>
<p>The folly Theophrastus here tacitly censures, obtrudes itself daily on our view: it is almost impossible to pass half an hour in the company of three or four of there praters, without hearing similar and often the identical impertinence, and if it is, as it seldom fails of being at all blended with vulgarity or, ill-breeding, it is intolerable. Our au-

thor has given to the features of this latter character, some touches that are
inimitable. He describes his man of rustic manners, as inattentive to decorum in his garb and deportment, as being reserved and uncommunicative to his friends, familiar with his servants, and relating to the meanest of them, what had passed in a popular assembly:--as never admiring any thing really curious, but standing still to gaze on an ox, an ass, or a shaggy goat. A person of this class, he says, has always a great dog lying under the table, he calls him-—takes him by the chaps, saying-—This is he that watches us and guards our house. These gentry are very troublesome in receiving money: they never suppose the guineas one gives them weight, or conceit them bright enough: they mull therefore be changed.--They will stop people in the street, to enquire how they sell fish, and if they buy any,
*will

will carry it home themselves in broad day-light.</p>
<p>A similarity thus observable between ancient Athenian and modern London manners, proves that no propensities of the mind become obsolete; and the censure implied in the exhibition of these characters, shews, that human opinion, when well founded and unbiassed, will, in all ages and all civilized countries, be the same. Cicero's Offices, though superseded by the beneficent Institutes of Christianity, are as applicable to us, as to him for whole edification they were intended, and will remain standing testimonies that the law, promulgated by the Gospel, has its basis in nature and reason. In reading Plutarch, our censure and applause generally agree with his; his morality is our's. The Manual of Epictetus, the Tablature of Cebes, the Meditations of Marcus Antoninus, may at this day be read with advantage. Numberless other instances

might be adduced to prove the immutable properties of good and evil, and the uniformity of opinion discoverable in the first and latest writers on the subject of ethics.</p>
<p>Happy would it be for us, if we could emancipate our reason from the usurped dominion of custom, and steadily guide our practice by the light of this truth, that however modish levity or scepticism may palliate what is wrong, or oppose what is right, that opinion, which stamps our actions, can never change or err; that like water, all moral qualities will, when uninfluenced, find their own level; like gold, however casual or local plenty or scarcity may depreciate or raise its value, every action will retain an average worth; and that, in the revolution of time, some moment intervenes when the standard is fixed, and the irrevocable fiat, even of terrestrial judicature, will consign our characters to fame or to oblivion.</p>

*SIR,
<p>HAVING frequent occasion to beat the pavement of London, many things attract my observation which escape the notice of the studious and recluse. Amongst the rest, I remark the indiscriminate use of the adjectives <hi rend="italic">new</hi> and <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, as terms of recommendation by shop-keepers: —<hi rend="italic">the old bell</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the new bell</p> summon an equal number of tipplers:-—<hi rend="italic">the new coffee-mill professes to serve as well as <hi rend="italic">the old</hi>, and so on in a variety of other instances. In short, our hopes of fair dealing and civil usage are equally raised by either epithet: from the <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, we expect the advantages of long-established trade, and from the <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, the assiduity and other good qualities which attract resort, so that the recommendations, being apparently of the same force, seem to loose their effect. But
*an
<pb n="48 THE PHAROS No. V"/>
an attentive investigator of the motives that prompt mankind will discover a circumstance which will enable him to ascertain the merits of each pretender, and will find in this trivial competition, a means, if not of rewarding integrity, at least of discouraging deceit. A shop or other house of public resort is opened, and a trade must be drawn to it: the proprietor, in the true spirit of plebeian generosity, affixes to his house the designation of a well-accustomed shop of the same class in his neighborhood, with an inscription under it, denoting that it is <hi rend="italic">the new</hi>, whatever the sign may happen to be: then, by the help of foppish decoration, extravagant lights, and servile civility, he exerts himself in the honest endeavor to cut the ground from under his neighbor's feet; and having just sagacity enough to discover that caprice always acts in favor of novelty, and that there is a rank of customers
*with

with whom the attractions of his house will prevail against old-fashioned, and perhaps uncourtly honesty, it is ten to one but he succeeds.</p>
<p>Having long been convinced, that this is the principle and practice of upstart traders, it is my rule to lay out no money in there fascinating repositories, many of which indeed resemble illuminated grottos, and Cytherean caves, and are furnished with a Calypso, struck up to draw custom. I will never in any way countenance that industry, which has imposition for its object. The man, who to deceive ignorant buyers, put out the sign of the <hi rend="italic">Hog's</hi> head in the porridge-pot, next door to an established ironmonger, who for many years had used that whimsical one of the <hi rend="italic">Dog's</hi> head in the porridge-pot, never had either my aid or my wishes for his success ; nor do I ever feel my heart warmed with that philanthropic notification

I made her transcribe it, and was convinced that, by negligence, she had entirely loft the power of forming the characters in their proper shape, and that I must never hope the would write as well as she did when she had learnt but a few months. To excuse, or rather to justify herself, she produced to me many letters from her female correspondents, and, to say the truth, no better written than hers. Lest you should imagine she had never had any education, I burned her letter, and than improve this occasion by desiring you, in force way or other, to tell the young ladies of the present age., that there is nothing impresses one with a stronger idea of female assiduity, attention, and good sense, than a sheet of paper written in

<p>IT occurred to me the other day., when I dined at the house of a friend who has. many children, that we had done well in rejecting the use of those nick-names, by which it has long been the custom to express infancy or fondness; such as Bobby, Sammy, Tommy, Polly, Betsy, Sophy, *&ampc. &ampc. &ampc. Young people are now called as they are baptized, and a vast many foolish ,contradictions and diminutives are expunged from our nomenclature vocabulary; but I am at a loss to account for the rise of the fashion (for a fashion it certainly

It founds in my ears rather formal, and not very affectionate: indeed I believe I should have been prejudiced against the custom, had it been ever so proper, when I heard my friend's wife thus ceremonious to her daughter, and yet uniformly addressing her hufband by the too familiar appellation of <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>.

*How are the powers of genius misapplied
COWPER.

<p>IT was ever a favorite maxim with my old friend, PETER STEADY, that any thing might be accomplished by perseverance:--an opinion certainly capable of producing much good, but. which experience daily proves, not free from evil. He was, from his early youth, strongly attached to learning; and, by the aid of this firm persuasion, acquired a very high rank amongst the literati of Europe: but he was not content with possessing all the same that could adhere to his own character: he had three sons whom he wished to acquire the same sort of reputation, and finding, to his infinite joy, that Provi-
*D 4
dence
<pb n="56 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
dence had not denied them ability, he determined they should be scholars. It was not his design that all should excel in the same branch of literature; he meant their excellence to be various, but equal, and would often talk himself into a heat, when he described to me the pleasure he promised himself in hearing one commended as the ablest greek scholiast of the age, another as the best mathematician, and the other as understanding, in the fullest extent perfection, all the ramifications of natural philosophy.--'And why should they not arrive at these honors?'—-said the anxious father 'they do not want capacities: they shall not want an instructor:--all I ask is application; and this I will make as easy to them as possible, by keeping at an equal distance from them vice and pleasure.'</p>
<p>With this fixed resolution, Mr. Steady retired into a sequestered part of Eng-
*land,

<pb n="57 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
land, where was nothing to divert the *attenton or to excite a wish. Without waiting for the appearance of any symptoms of genius, or consulting the bent of his children's inclinations, any farther than allowing the two eldest their choice of the three elected branches of learning, he began his arduous work, and continued in the prosecution of it till his youngest son had attained the age of nineteen, when death, by ending my friend Peter's cares, robbed him of the felicity he had so long labored for, and emancipated his three scholars from their rural confinement.</p>
<p>As London was the theatre on which their father designed to exhibit their talents, they repaired hither on his decease, and as I was his oldest friend there, to me devolved the office of Cicerone and master of the ceremonies. My curiosity was hardly ever more awake than to see what performance and intense ap-
*D 5
pli-
<pb n="57 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
plication had atchieved, and I therefore with great patience and alacrity waited near half a day at the inn where the stage-coach was to deposit them. Imagination can hardly conceive the grotesque appearance the young gentlemen made:—nothing but the difference of age distinguished them:—they had the same mein, the same gait, the same phrase and accent:—their cloaths were made with regimental similarity:-—each had a little brown bob wig, a hat formed into an equilateral triangle, and every other article of accoutrement as stiffly <hi rend="italic">hors de la mode</hi>.</p>
<p>What was uncouth in their habiliments, a short time and a little exertion corrected: their deportment was not inflexible, and discovering that their attainments were as far beyond the generality of scholastic acquisition, as their mode of education had been different from the common one, I began to think
*Mr.
<pb n="59 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
Mr. Steady had brought to pass what he had projected. I. accordingly submitted to the consideration of the young men, the manner in which they should develope their various knowledge to the world, and likewise referred it to them to chuse the way by which their wealth might be extended to a competency; for that care, however important, had never occupied their father's serious attention: by making them scholars he made them famous—-riches followed fame—-and his sons were ideally-provided for.</p>
<p>On enquiry of the eldest, I learnt that intense application had so debilitated his constitution, and impaired his organs, that some time must elapse before he could prosecute his, studies; and the opinion of a physician, whom increasing ailments obliged him to consult, declared, that a total renunciation of laborious reading was the smallest
*D 6
price
<pb n="60 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
price at which he could purchase health. This was a grievous mortification to my Greek critic, who had in hand, a work that would admirably make his <hi rend="italic">debut</hi>, and which it still required two years attention to fit for the press. He had inherited a large portion of his father's enthusiasm, and chagrin was to be the reward of his labors.</p>
<p>The second son, who had chosen natural philosophy as his field, had submitted rather patiently than willingly to the fetters of literature: perseverance had done much, and I predicted him a future Priestley or Walker, till on closely examining him as to the course of emolument he meant to adhere to, he with great modesty told me, that whatever I advised he would follow; but that he could never be thoroughly ,pleased with his profession, unless he was allowed to chuse that of history painting.-—He produced to me some
*spe
<pb n="61 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
specimens of his drawing, done at casual opportunities, or when he could abridge his sleep, and they determined me to use my, interest for him in the way Nature had pointed out.</p>
<p>My youngest charge, to whose lot mathematics had of necessity fallen, and
who had perforce, and with disgust, drudged in this branch of science, did not express a predilection for any one art or profession: he was a lively young man, and seemed more than either of his brothers to enjoy his liberation: he answered my query as to his intentions for a provision, by saying, he could not immediately settle his mind, but would satisfy me in a short time.--An accident
determined him.—-In crossing Blackheath we were by chance spectators of a royal review.—-My spark was in raptures at the sight--'That,' cried he, shall be my trade-—put me in the way to get a commission.'--Finding
*this 
<pb n="62 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
this inclination, though suddenly planted, deeply rooted, I referred him to a friend, and the young mathematician may be seen, almost every noon in the spring, lounging the Mall.</p>
<p>The lapse of a few months settled my old friend's children in their various professions: a curacy of fifty pounds a year, in a situation where his learning can be of little use to him, has provided for my Grecian:—the natural philosopher in an enthusiastic pursuit of his beloved art,_ which probably for some time will not pay the expences of color and canvas, is endeavoring to forget the rigors of his youth;—and mathematics have hitherto procured the votary of Mars little other honor than the nick-name of Euclid, with which, and the scantly pittance of an ensign, he. must yet rest contented.</p>
<p>Thus has the toil of many years been thrown away. The time which should
*have
<pb n="63 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
have been devoted to acquiring some useful occupation has been waisted in pursuits, in one instance detrimental, in two futile; for had Mr. Steady attended to the constitutional ability of his eldest son, or consulted the inclinations of the two younger, he would have perceived, that however fair the blossom, the plant he forced could bear but little fruit. And however laudable the unremitted, endeavors of a parent to enroll a son on the records of fame, it is folly to do it at the expence of a child's ease or happiness; and still more absurd is it to make him an object of envy, if he is to be left in a state of pecuniary dependence.</p>
<p>Many a good farmer or mechanic has, been spoiled by the attempt to make him a scholar. The hand will in general be found a, member more useful to the community than the head, and perhaps, even if the attempt succeeds, the
*world.
<pb n="64 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
world does but exchange manual labor, subject to little error, and capable of much good, for idle speculations or sceptical crudities:—does the project fail, 'tis a thousand to one the young man, though he cannot construe a line of Virgil, remembers the company he kept while his abilities were in doubtful trial. and he will no longer associate with handicraftsmen, or lend his aid in his father's calling.-—If he cannot read Virgil, he can drink and roar: his old schoolfellows, My Lord, and Sir John, are always glad to see him, and with them he may be found in all forts of licentiousness: he was their fag at school:—-he has stood many a flogging for them, and is now sufficiently rewarded by their intimacy.</p>
<p>No more than an argument, founded. on false premises, can ever be supposed juft in the conclusion, can an education, pursued from motives of selfishness or
*vanity,
<pb n="65 THE PHAROS No. VI"/>
vanity, be expected to prosper. Nature often kindly points out the road the would have us take, and will aid us to overcome all difficulties we meet with in it, but she will neither be compelled or thwarted. When genius or inclination is very strong, it should, if possible be indulged; but where a child discovers no particular bias, it certainly can be no injury to him to chuse for him the profession or trade most useful to himself or others; surely no judicious parent would take this absence of choice for a signal to place his son in a situation, where, if he is not what his want of attachment demonstrates he never will be, he must be useless and his fortune ruined.</p>

*Celui qui dit incessamment qu'il a de l'honneur et de la probit&eacute, et qui jure pour le faire croire ne fait pas m&egraveme contrefaire l'homme de bien.
LA BRUYERE.
<p>THE following essay is the first attempt of a young female pen, in this species of composition, and as such it begs the reader's indulgence. I was desired to fit it for publication, but I am no friend to the practice of embellishing. If one person writes, and another corrects, it is impossible for those who read to judge of the author's merit; and, besides this, our own ideas are always best expressed in our own words.</p>
<p>There is, I believe, hardly any vice whose folly, absurdity, and unprofitableness have been more frequently or
*less
<pb n="67 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
less successfully demonstrated than that of swearing. I shall not attempt to effect what the wisest and best endeavors have failed in; but shall make a few observations on a minor kind of it, which has become nearly of general use, and into which many young people are betrayed, for want of seeing its impropriety, and by thinking it becoming in some, from whose mouths prejudice has made it appear to flow with peculiar grace and energy.</p>
<p>The error I would mark is, that of prostituting the asseverations <hi rend="italic">upon my honor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">upon my life</hi>, to the ordinary purpose of convincing. The former may sometimes be used, not only innocently, but with propriety and dignity; but the latter, however custom may have reconciled our ears to it, is morally indefensible in those who believe a supreme and absolute Disposer of the lives of all his creatures. Lest I should ter-
*rify
<pb n="68 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
rify my readers by the appearance of sermonising, I will forego all the arguments in favor of simplicity of conversation, to be drawn from that inestimable code of laws left us by him who thought and found the labors of a whole life inadequate to the eradicating our evil propensities, and shall only remark on this custom as inimical to our social in interests.</p>
<p>As it is in the power of every one to make their word pass for its value, those who frequently use any higher asseveration may not uncharitably be supposed to have lost the common implicit credit which mankind pay to each other where it is merited; but they deceive themselves grossly if they imagine they can, in any way, repair the deficiency. I cannot think myself under any greater obligation to believe him who pawns his <hi rend="italic">life</hi>, which is not his to forfeit; or his <hi rend="italic">honor</hi> which he must first prove to be
*worth
<pb n="69 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
worth taking; than him who assures me ,<hi rend="italic">on his word</hi>, and reminds me, that it is the most valuable pledge an honest man can give.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Upon my honor</hi> is sometimes becomingly used, but rarely in a woman: the Peer is supposed to swear by it, as the most sacred of his possessions: the soldier may make it, by his conduct and his value of it, the last conviction required; but the honor of a lady is still more serious, and if that humility which teaches that feminine judgment is fallible, form a part of her character, she will never draw into question that which it is worse than death to lose. I do not say no instance can occur in which a lady can safely protest <hi rend="italic">upon her honor</hi>: she may on an emergency, with proper solemnity, and without any impeachment of her delicacy; but the occasions are so few, that life may be passed without their arising.</p>
*I with
<pb n="70 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
<p>I wish all who can judge, especially my fair country-women, would in this and all other points *chuse before they adopt, and then, surely whatever is improper or indelicate would be expunged from their language: they would then see that it is as foolish to assert <hi rend="italic">upon their lives</hi> as to stake Lord <hi rend="italic">Betwell's</hi> horse, or Sir <hi rend="italic">Harry Bongout's</hi> sword, since they have no property in either, and therefore if they lowe cannot pay, and I hope none will go so far as to insist that they never found themselves mistaken after they had offered this pledge:—-what a foolish figure would they make were the forfeit demanded.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, I must remark, and it is with sorrow I find it necessary, that since our camps and military preparations to oppose our belligerent neighbors have inspired our lovely females with Amazonian order, they have, for the public cause, neglected their
*private
<pb n="71 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
private interests, and while with their fathers, husbands, brothers, and lovers, they have undertaken the defence of our island, they have lessened our stock of collective merit, and contaminated themselves with the vices of those whose virtues are little addition to their own. From Warley and Coxheath, I am sorry to say, a greater cargo of <hi rend="italic">strong expressions</hi> was imported by the ladies than they ought ever to have even heard; and the gay ideas connected with the remembrance of their being uttered, gave a <hi rend="italic">go&#x00FBt</hi> that recommended them; so that it is no longer uncommon to hear a lady, whose external attractions excite almost superstitious adoration, protesting by her maker's name, or pledging that incorruptible part of her, which Mahomet, perhaps, thought it a favor to suppose women without, to prove the most insignificant assertion that the trifles of female *&#x0153conomies can give occasion to.</p>
*Those
<pb n="72 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
<p>Those who have gone such lengths I regard as incorrigible, since no woman can shake off the whole of her delicacy in an instant, and, to adopt this praise, requires a degree of deliberation and effrontery, which renders the heroine scarcely worth reforming for this world: a more serious repentance than the light argument of an essay can work, must bring her back to the path she has quitted. I therefore give her over, and shall only observe, that the brandy-bottle and this vice are too nearly allied to be supposed separable, and that nothing would so soon convince me that a lady had recourse to the exhilaration of liquor, as her assuring me on her immortal part, that she never tasted any thing stronger than tea.</p>
<p>If what has been urged is insufficient to my purpose, let not the cause but the advocate be blamed. I will substitute intreaty for argument, and beg my
*fair
<pb n="73 THE PHAROS No. VII"/>
fair readers only to think for themselves, and to bestow five minutes in the consideration of this increasing blemish. That sterling good sense which, I hope, will ever be found amongst them, and which is now rendered so amiable by education, will shew them that this vice is in itself and its consequences dangerous and alarming; and as from the higher ranks, hairdressers and footmen, milliners and cookmaids have learned to protest <hi rend="italic">'pon their lives</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">'pon their honors</hi>. I trust a reformation will soon pervade all classes, and that they will no more be suspected of contemning the laws of omnipotence, or of uttering what they do not understand.</p>

*Ev'n the soft sorrow of remember'd woe,
A not unpleasing sadness may bellow.
Miss H. MORE.

<p>HARDLY any office of humanity or friendship requires so much discretion in the exercise, or is so difficult to execute as that of consolation. People not only see but feel so differently that it is dangerous to suffer our own sentiments to guide us, if we would render our condolence acceptable: we must first learn how our friend estimates the misfortune we deplore, and then accommodate our sympathy to the degree of sensibility we meet with.</p>
<p>But even this rule which gone would imagine by inclining us to become all things to all men, would at least save us from <hi rend="italic">offending</hi> any, is often fallacious, and
*may
<pb n="75 THE PHAROS No. VIII"/>
may draw on us the dislike it was intended to avert, for there are persons who, though destitute of tender feelings, .are so conscious of their necessity ,in the formation of an amiable mind, as to be driven to counterfeit them; and yet these very persons, supposing themselves but like the generality of the world, will brand with the name of hypocrisy the compassion their situations excite. I have known many a widow half angry at the farce of etiquette, which debarred her from the pleasures of the world; and at her friends, for not understanding her better than to *teaze her by expressions of sympathy:-—numbers have laughed in private at the compliments of condolence they were forced to receive:—-nay some have been so honest as to chear their friends, by saying they hoped a little time would remove the oppression of their spirits, and that they should be
*E2
able,
<pb n="76 THE PHAROS No. VIII"/>
able, when the gloomy ideas connected with a funeral, were dispelled, to enjoy a little society again: this experience has taught me to regard as a hint, that the first opportunity will be seized for a relaxation of dress, and then a card for a party will not be ill-accepted.—-It would look like affectation in me, says one, to go to the extreme of mourning. Six months deep and six months slight is as much as is expected.--I am too young cries another to disguise myself in those odious weeds--I should look dike a ghost—-they may do very well for threescore, but I am sure I could never endure them--they would bring my poor husband every moment to my mind.</p>
<p>That there is a luxury in woe, persons by nature destitute of the finer sensibilities, or who have by their own perverse endeavors conquered them, will with difficulty be persuaded, but that
*the
<pb n="77 THE PHAROS No. VIII"/>
the indulgence of grief is the only method of supporting it, example has not unfrequently proved. As there is no object more deserving of contempt, than a surviving relation or friend substituting hypocritical grimace for real sorrow, so is there nothing which induces a more pleating melancholy over a sympathetic mind than to see the loss of dear connections, borne with patience, resignation and genuine marks of affection. That calm tranquil grief which overspreads the countenance after its first, ebullitions, gives it charms that no face of hilarity ever wore: it may rob beauty of much of its brilliancy, but it atones for the theft by imparting graces peculiar to itself.—-But to return to the subject of consolation.</p>
<p>In all cases where condolence is required, it is the part of humanity to offer at soothing the sufferer's mind, either by pointing out remaining com-

<pb n="78 THE PHAROS No. VIII"/>
forts or future hopes, and, as far as is possible, actively to relieve the distress: it is likewise the part of discretion to suppose the chastisement, be it of what nature it may, sensibly and submissively felt. I own I have seen instances where expressions of sympathetic cordiality were not only superfluous but ridiculous, and where the friends of the suffering party have shed the only natural tears. Yet still were there examples of heroism or indifference more frequent, it will never warrant our supposing what ten to one is the truth; few, however callous, like to be thought so, and it is better far to err a thousand times in shewing our participation of an unfelt calamity, than once to shock an elegant sensible mind by presuming, that it feels less than it ought to do. I would therefore advise all such persons as consanguinity, alliance or friendship conducts to the house of mourning, without re-

<pb n="79 THE PHAROS No. VIII"/>
garding the irregularities they may meet with in a temper devoid of natural affections, to reflect before they set out on the misfortune that has called them, to impress their minds with a due sense of its magnitude, and to consider what, if the case were our own, they should look for comfort they will then be in a disposition suited to the business they, are going about: it may be in their power to quiet the perturbation of grief; or they may do essential service by awakening the feelings of a callous heart; but to make a visit of this kind in a round of gossiping calls, to put on a. demure aspect in. ascending the staircase, while their heads are filled with opera news, scandal and fashions, will never discharge this duty of humanity, nor be productive of any good.</p>
<p>Poor MELISSA has, I fear, experienced in her state of woe all the misery friendly consolation can inflict. She is,
*E 4
herself,
<pb n="80 THE PHAROS No. VIII"/>
herself a woman of little reflection, but acute sensations; borne down by misfortune, without hope of remedy and utterly incapable of struggling against it.</p>
<p>The death of her husband, and the consequent loss of income, sickness, and untoward children, are the griefs that oppress her. and have brought her to a fate of nearly total torpidity. I called on her a few day ago, with a design to suggest such considerations as I hoped would rouse her to exertion, and for this purpose was obliged to outstay a number of friends who had assembled in her chamber, as they told me, <hi rend="italic">solely to amuse her</hi>. When I surveyed them, and heard their conversation, I could not wonder at the little progress Melissa's mind had made towards regaining its proper tone, for the company of such visitors must of itself be a disease.</p>
<p>Melissa had a natural love for the gaieties of dress and amusements, before
*her

her spirits received this shock:—one lady therefore came, in' her way to the Countess of Gewgaw's d&eacutejeun&eacute, to shew her the fancy dress she had made up on the occasion:-—another brought with her three rude children:—-a gentleman took much pains to inform her how happily he had married a very deserving daughter:-—and a fourth mourner gave an elaborate description of a masquerade, to which Melissa was to have accompanied her on the night of her husband's sudden death:-—in short, the. whole conclave seemed to join in the same erroneous opinion, that grief was to be combated by noise and folly.</p>
<p>When they were withdrawn, MELISSA burst into a flood of tears, and said, It is such comforters as these that sink me to despair. I seized this opportunity, and shall, I hope, prevail on her to admit none to see her who cannot express their good-will less injudiciously--

No IX. TUESDAY,, Dec. 5, 1786.
*Search then the ruling passion--
POPE.
<p>AVARICE, or a love of money for its own sake, is a vice so intirely factitious, is so productive of misery, and so incapable of procuring pleasure, that it is astonishing how it first found admission into the human heart: that it has, is certain; but that real and true genuine avarice, that kind of infirmity which prevents men from regarding wealth as a means to an end, and represents it as the end itself, is perhaps much less commonly met with than is generally supposed: where we cannot find out the motive to amassing wealth we are apt, too hastily, to presume that the possession of it, is the good sought, and till we are indued
*E6
with
<pb n="84 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
with the faculty of seeing into each other's hearts, and while the disposition to fix the worst construction on the actions of our neighbors lasts, this will continue an evil to be reprobated. However, it is not to be denied, that there are some people avaricious to no purpose, nor that it is a mental disease perceptible in some children when they are too young to be acquainted with the real value of riches, or to have considered the evils from which parsimony may protect them. All here contended for, is, that we affix the epithet of avaricious, to tempers that, although their bad qualities may be no less reprehensible, do not merit the charge of avarice.</p>
<p>On the other hand it may be alledged, that those who are censured thus
unjustly, often draw the imputation on themselves, by their own want of prudence and judgment. We see people
*sparing,
<pb n="85 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
sparing; where they ought to be liberal, and we therefore almost naturally conclude that their temper leads them to with-hold; but to this it may be answered, that our decision ought to be suspended till we are assured, that they are not liberal where they might be, and perhaps it behoves them to be sparing, which if they are, their error takes another name, as arising from another cause, and we must say of them, that they, either from vice or folly, are injudicious in their expenditure.</p>
<p>Of these who thus acquire the character of misers, there are two classes: the first consists of such as being governed by no regular principle, and wanting equability of temper, obey sudden impulses: these have fits of generosity, which, as destitute of discretion to control them, they generally surfeit on, and extreme indulgence seeks its antidote in parsimony:--a retention which
*their
<pb n="86 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
their finances may absolutely command, but which would never have been odious or perceptible, if the stream of their bounty had run in an even course, not pent up till it divulged into cataracts, wailing themselves by their fury. The second class of those unjust1y named misers, is composed of persons who have some favorite object of expense to gratify, for which they starve all others. An indulgence of taste, has often procured its votary the charge of avarice,

and a worthless favorite has frequently been found the only witness of liberality. Thus AURELIO is called avaricious, because he could not spare five guineas towards rebuilding his parish-church, and SICCUS is universally condemned a a prodigy of penury, because, with an income that would maintain him in affluence, he will not allow himself a horse, feeble and decrepid as he is; but Aurelio lays by nothing: he squanders,
*with-
<pb n="87 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
without reluctance, all that is: not necessary to his existence, in natural curiosities and monstrous productions, and Siccus is often forced to anticipate his revenue that he may supply the extravagance of a libertine son, whose indulgence, as it has ruined, must support.</p>
<p>These two classes of persons are certainly no misers, and their frequent and incredible plea of poverty, must be admitted in lieu of their charitable donations. There is another species of supposed misers, less justly called so, as their actions are the offspring of reason. These are people who having with a philosophic eye, contemplated the folly of mankind, in adding artificial wants to real necessities, and, as it were, cutting channels for Pactolean streams, have determined to pause ere they open their purse, and ask themselves, if what they are about to purchase, is requisite in life: the answer of their reason is so
*fre-
<pb n="88 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
frequently a negative, that in time they loose all desires: and as they are not backward in owning their opinion or avowing their conduit, their self-denial is stigmatised as parsimony. The censors are here more to blame than the censured: if the reason of the latter is governed by religion, and not jaundiced by a morose rejection of the supernumerary blessings of life, their forbearance is highly commendable, and such persons will frequently, if not without exception, be found ready to contribute in any way to the good of society, or to relieve particular distress. The scale of ANNA'S living does not extend to a third of her income.--'Tis a shame, cries MARIA, that Anna does not keep a coach, and live in a larger house with more servants.--Anna does not love self-indulgence, she has a moderate table and is rarely seen in new cloaths; but she chearfully *relinguished
<pb n="89 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
a very large debt, when a tradesman whom she had assisted became a bankrupt.</p>
<p>Neither ought the greedy and rapacious, though equitably called the covetous, to be indiscriminately ranked with the avaricious. The rapacity of one hand, is perhaps equalled by the profusion of the other: their power of retention is less than that of a sieve, and their demands are but to supply the torrent of extravagance.</p>
<p>On the whole then, it will appear, that unless we are acquainted <hi rend="italic">intimately</hi> with the temper and pursuits of others, we ought to with-hold the censure of avarice. It is a vice that has so little to recommend it, and is coupled with so much anxiety, that few care for its company. In old age, when all other desires are extinguished, it does indeed sometimes intrude itself in its natural character. 'Blessings brighten as they
*take
<pb n="90 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
'take their flight,' and gold is then loved for its own sake; but in youth it is rare; for the inclination to amass, is, so strongly opposed by the love of expensive pleasure, that, not withstanding the eagerness with which my landlord collects his rents, I cannot join in styling him a miser, his ways of spending his money are, in proportion to his means of acquiring it, as two to one.</p>
<p>DURUS is however a proof, that youth and avarice are not wholly inconsistent. When a child, his principal delight consisted in treasuring up bats, balls,
&ampc. which he never used: he would beg of. his playfellows such things as he did not want, and having procured them, locked them up: in all childish subscriptions he wished to be included, but renounced his share whenever he failed in dextrously avoiding the payment of his quota. At seven years old, his joy at the. death of his elder brother
*was
<pb n="91 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
was in manifest and though then heir to a very considerable estate, he prevailed on his father to procure him admission on the foundation of a public school. Here he bore with stoical apathy, all the obloquy such a character is subject to: his schemes of hoarding, were, for the purpose of teazing him, often frustrated, and his pilfering tricks punished; but Durus was Durus still. On quitting school, with a commendable spirit of industry and &#x0153conomy, as his father called it, he declared his, with to be apprenticed: the trade he chose was lucrative, but not respectable:-—he was warned that his equals, in rank and fortune, would now be ashamed of associating with him; but his industry and &#x0153conomy willingly renounced society; for he observed that no, young men, met together without incurring expence, and he was therefore glad to be rid of his, acquaintance. At the age of thirty-five,
*being,
<pb n="92 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
being then in possession of his paternal wealth, and established in a dirty trade, which confined him to the worst part of the metropolis, and which he rendered laborious by the few hands he employed, he married a rich *ideot, and thinks the privation of all the comfort of domestic life amply atoned for by his annual receipts.</p>
<p>With this man the love of money is natural and genuine. It is not the desire of fame that stimulates him; for he is ever offended by guesses at the sums he has realized. He has no fear of future want, for he has abridged his necessities so closely as to defy poverty. He would feel no horror at being dressed in rags, for he grudges the expence decency compels him to; and two considerations restrain his appetite, as all consumed is lost, and the time spent at table might be. profitably employed.</p>
*Such
<pb n="93 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
<p>Such is Durus, a wretched, anxious miser! The possession he seeks affords him now not even its wonted satisfaction: fear perpetually torments him-—fear, not only that his wealth should decrease in spite of his parsimony, but that great part of it may be wrested from him, by a discovery that he who has thus refined on covetousness has transgressed the laws of integrity.</p>
<p>A detestable character! exclaims FOCUS; I cannot imagine what induces men to suffer so much for the sake of money. If we have enough for our necessary support, and for the comforts of life, why wish we for more? Avarice is a most odious vice.-—True, Focus, you reason well-—but what do you call your rapacious love of colleting?-—Durus and you differ in your pursuits, because the objects you are in quest of are different, but a similar spirit actuates you. He collects guineas he can never want,
*and
<pb n="94 THE PHAROS No. IX"/>
and you heap up books you cannot read. You have profited less than Durus by your labor—-his heirs may bless his parsimony, your's will execrate your expensive taste; for you have purchased things whose value is ideal, and which are always, at a loss, reconverted into money.-—You boast your being possessed of every edition of the Bible.-—Do you think by this you testify your respect for the sacred volume? Believe me, its Great Author would have been better pleased had you attended piously to his reprobation of the covetous man.—-But you say you do good to society by bartering for these incumbrances the immediate supply of want.--This sounds plausibly; but then, tell me what was the good you proposed when you at the last literary sale outbid an indigent scholar, who wanted a particular and scarce book in order to the completion of a work of science, by which his poverty
*might

might be relieved.-—To my knowledge you heard him say, I cannot afford to bid more, and yet missing it will ruin me-—I shall never meet with it again.--You bore away the prize with triumphant insolence-—his spirit scorned to request the loan of it, but he is amply revenged, by its being made notorious that you not only do not understand the language of that book, but cannot read its characters.--What are you then?-—Are you not worse than Durus?-—Avaricious, yet profuse—-self-conceited, yet ignorant-—a cruel tyrant, and an oppressor of indigent worth.</p>

*Among unequals is what society
Can sort, what harmony or true delight?
MILTON.
<p>I Am too much occupied by the subject of the two following letters to prefer any other. The first reached in the fore-noon, the other in the afternoon, of yesterday.</p>

*SIR,
<p>IT is with no design to amuse or instruct that I take up, my pen; a heart almost broken by affliction and cruelty, seeks to pour its sorrows into the bosom of pity, and I write in hope of procuring, from a stranger, that attention which he, for whose sake I have encountered almost every possible calamity, refuses me.</p>
*I am
<pb n="97 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
<p>I am the only daughter of a gentleman of ancient family, exalted rank, and abundant fortune. I was brought up in all the luxury and indulgence that wealth and kindness could procure, and confiding most unreasonably in the love of my parents, which I imagined I could not lose, I, at the age of seventeen, gave way to a passion I had conceived for a young man much my inferior, and, by a most indiscreet and disgraceful marriage, irretrievably forfeited the favor of all my relations.</p>
<p>Poverty, against which I had always considered love as a bulwark, soon assailed us: this, I still think, I could have braved, had I met with kind treatment; but my husband, finding my expectations of parental forgiveness disappointed, heaped reproaches on me, and, in a few months, brought me to a very sincere repentance of my folly and disobedience.</p>
*VOL.I F Two
<pb n="98 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
<p>Two years. have I dragged on in inexpressible torture. Accustomed, as I was from my childhood, to all possible tenderness, the severities of my situation, even if they were confined to bodily sufferings, are scarcely supportable. I am unable to struggle with cold and hunger, yet them I often endure. I have not strength for labor--I cannot bear fatigue; nor do I know any one art by which I could earn a meal. These are all subjects of reproach which are daily and hourly reiterated to me: my husband, without regard to my inability, insists on my procuring my own maintenance--a requisition which, however reasonable it may sound, is to me, in my circumstances, absolute tyranny.</p>
<p>If you have any pity, do say something to console me, and to soften his heart, for he often sees your papers. Bid him confider the sacrifice I have made to love-—bid him think on the
*situation
<pb n="99 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
situation I quitted on that fatal day when I fulfilled my promise to him.-—Remind him of the professions, the vows he made to me, and conjure him, by all he holds sacred, to alleviate, by tenderness, the misery I am doomed to suffer.</p>
<p>O could those who are about to do as I have done, see me, the child of wealth, the darling hope of indulgent parents, me, whom kindness has enervated, and care rendered unable to brook even the inclemency of a winter's sky--could they fee me in a miserable lodging, *drest in the tattered remnants of finery and splendor, which aggravate my distress by the remembrance they excite--often without the means of procuring food or firing-—beholden to taunting ingratitude for a slender support, and threatened with positive desertions, they would fly to the arms of their parents--they would intreat protection against their
*F2 own
<pb n="100 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
own hearts, and think a close imprisonment the greatest blessing they could ask; for let them be assured, on my sad testimony, that love, and extreme disparity of situation, cannot subsist together. It was my fortune my husband expected it was not me he loved. My sinking spirits will hardly allow me to subscribe myself,

<p>I CATCHED my wife just now crying over a letter the has wrote you, and you will receive herewith. I despise all she can say or do, so I would not stop it, moreover by reason I think I can make my part good.-—She tells you she is a lady, and she married a young man for love below her; this is very true, but she does not tell all so, you than have it from
*me.
<pb n="101 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
me. I was, to make short of the matter, her father's footman, and might have had any of my women fellow servants, for I am reckoned a genteel figure; and Sir Samuel's livery was very dashing; so, miss, as the was then, used to look at me as I waited at table, and stop me in the hall to talk, and then she used to talk to her maid about me, so I soon found, as they say, which way the wind blew. She was to be sure a girl any man might fancy, for she had a monstrous pretty face, but I am sure if the had had ten pretty faces Old Nick might have had her for me, if as I had known what was to come:-—So, as I was going to say, we run it for Scotland, and was married, and she had told me she was sure Sir Samuel and my Lady would forgive her, so by that means you see I hoped to be made a gentleman at once, but it was no such thing, Sir Samuel nor my Lady won't see us, nor do nothing for us.


*F 3 Now
<pb n="102 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
<p>Now pray, Sir, don't you think I would have been a great deal better off, if as I had had some poor hard-working girl for my wife; can do nothing upon earth but spend.--She is a great slut, for file can't so much as sweep her room nor make her bed; I have seen her faint away dead with the broom in her hand; she can't dress a bit of meat, she can't wash, she can't do nothing, so if I could get her a place she can't do any work. It is more than I can do often to get my own bread, for, by marrying her, I have lost my character, which is a servant's bread, so I am obliged to do what I can. But would not it provoke you to see her crying and doing nothing, and such a litter and a dirt. If I got as much as we could live on, we could not live happy if I could not keep her a maid, for she can but just dress herself, she has been brought up such a fine Lady. Now pray, Sir, have not I the word of the bargain; I
*might
<pb n="103 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
might have had a stirring girl, as would have kept her room tidy, and been taking in work or something, but my wife can do nothing, and indeed I cannot always keep from telling her so, and indeed if she is so idle I believe I will leave her, as the says.
*From your servant, to command,
THOMAS----.

<p>In the latter of these melancholy epistles, I have taken the liberty of making it intelligible, and I ,hope without injuring the sense; I have likewise omitted the surname, which it was subscribed with, for reasons I need not mention. Let me now feize the opportunity which Harriet's complaint to me offers, of calling the attention of the juft, but rigorous parent, and thoughtless child, to the woes a ilep of irretrcivable imprudence has brought on a wretched, helpless creature. I believe I know the par-
*F 4. ties
<pb n="104 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
ties, and am afraid I have some time since in vain assailed paternal severity on Harriet's behalf. Severity so cool, so just, and, in some measure, so necessary, that I was silenced. The good of others requires this deviation from duty to be held an unpardonable crime: easy forgiveness would authorize marriages, which, were a whole world to approve them, must still be in their nature infamous: property, the most valuable and ancient, would sink into the hands not barely of the commonalty, but of the lowest order of men, and the consequent confusion might become very seriously extensive.</p>
<p>As I will ever listen to the dictates of impartial reason, before I hear what pity can urge, let me, in behalf of this *wholsome yet dreadful severity, observe, that the sin it punishes is of a deeper dye than those involved in it imagine. A child, probably an only one, reared with *anxiey greater than can be described, regarded
*as
<pb n="105 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
as the hope of an ancient and honorable family, adorned with whatever can procure the choicest blessings of life, at the expence of much time, thought and labor, as if exulting in the ability to do mischief and disappoint anxious expectation, deliberately contemns all the precepts of religion and remonstrances of nature, and by an act of the greatest folly becomes a voluntary alien from a father's house, an object of universal contempt and ridicule, and a prey to want, misery and cruelty, I know no obligation a parent is under to pardon this aggravated wickedness: but here natural compassion interposes. Compassion, which is a reproach to the flinty heart that excites it for can there be greater cruelty than this, to bring down a father's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<p>Yet, however justifiable may be the resentment of a parent under such cir
*F 5 cumstances,
<pb n="106 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
cumstances, it ought never to exclude that commiseration on which the existence of a once, loved child depends. The softness and indulgence in which Harriet has been bred, aggravate her miseries, and surely a father's arm should be extended to assist her, whom his kindness has disabled from supporting herself. I do not mean, nor wish that she should be restored to favor, but let some small donative protect her from the horrors of want. Her repentance, I hope, is sincere, and reparation it is not in her power to make.</p>
<p>To this wretched victim of folly and passion, I would prescribe the utmost exertion and cultivation of her fortitude and her talents: ingenuity may, perhaps, supply the want of corporal strength, and it is incumbent on her to lighten, as much as possible, the burthen she certainly is to her undeserving husband.</p>
<p>Greater duties than this, she must
*likewise
<pb n="107 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
likewise perform: her parents and the world are not all the has offended, let her bow before the altar of Omnipotence: let her deprecate the divine wrath by profound humility and heart-felt contrition; let her emplore God's forgiveness, his guidance, and his aid; and, stedtfast1y relying on his mercy, shun, as she would instant destruction, every vice, or the shadow of it. A frequent and dutiful application to her parents, or such as have influence over them, may perhaps soften their rigor; but this must not be attempted unless she feels the submission she expresses—-no circumstances can extenuate hypocrisy, and if she is more afflicted by her punishment than the remembrance of her misconduct, she can have no claim to their pity.</p>
<p>I shall perhaps add to Harriet's sufferings, if I neglect that part of her request which calls on me to remonstrate
*F 6 with
<pb n="108 THE PHAROS No. X"/>
with her husband; but what reasoning can I adapt to a mind thus uninformed? He has undoubtedly much cause of complaint, but then he has as much cause to censure himself: the hope of wealth, he owns, actuated him; and in the true spirit of vulgar self-conceit on the precarious chance of Harriet's being forgiven, he committed an act, which proclaims an absence of every moral quality. As it was at his option, either to regard or neglect Harriet's overtures, and as an honest man, would immediately have discovered them to the power that could control her, he suffers in his disappointment, but the just punishment of his baseness, and had he the feelings of a man, he would never be prompted to aggravate the distress he has occasioned, by recriminating on helpless, defenceless woman.-—But I well know it is preaching to the winds, to advise one who has gone so far in ini-

<p>THE inhabitants of lower Egypt, had in vain, waited the distention of the all-prolific Nile: the day appointed for festive gratitude was passed in the murmurs of disappointment, and famine, with its terrific train, appeared, when ALI the son of Hassan quitted Garam his native place, in hope of finding at Cairo, the means of subsisting life. The intense heat of the sun, which now poured its fervid rays on his defenceless head, at once stimulated and relaxed him; but despair animating him, he braved the torrid sand and vertical ray, and bid adieu to those fields, which instead of salubrious nutriment,

Since it aggravates my misery, by presenting future ca-

Let wisdom and indigence, never again meet--let those who must be poor, have no tormenting ideas of happiness they can never reach-—let them at least, enjoy the sullen pleasure of knowing nothing less wretched than themselves-—or henceforth, let silence be blessed with riches, and the halo of affluence lend its benign medium to disseminate the rays of wisdom. Then shall I no more be doomed to waste days and years in providing for corporal want-—days and years which I may then at ease employ in visiting the cemeteries of heroes, descrying new constellations, or in fathoming the depths of creation.'</p>
<p>Ali's imagination now suspended his powers of recollection, till endeavoring to raise himself from the ground, he
*cast
<pb n="113 THE PHAROS No. XI"/>

cast his eyes on the small wallet; which contained, at once, the provision for his journey and the whole of his patrimony. The presence of real evil, and the terror of its inevitable increase, overpowered him: he again sunk on the ground, and remained in silent grief, till the sound of camels approaching roused him. He looked and saw their master, SEGUED, the heir of wealth, who gave directions to his attendants to halt, and then enquired of Ali, why he found him thus supine and melancholy.</p>
<p>Segued was the most opulent merchant of Garam: his father had bequeathed to him riches that almost defied enumeration; but he had left the young man's mind as Nature formed it: he was good, he was generous, he was pious; but he was ignorant, he was conscious of it, and he was unhappy. He, was now journeying to Grand Cairo, in order to traffic with the merchants ar-

<p>Not so,' Ali rejoined, 'thy sherbet would have relieved my thirst as agreeably, even if I had not known of what form are the component particles of the ingredients. Science aggravates suffering, by presenting to us all our misfortunes in detail!</p>* (Close quote sign is missing)

I still envy thee, and, could the half of my treasures purchase thy wisdom, 0 how freely would I resign it!--I am rich; I can smile at the caprices of our river, and I have the happiness of blessing many, but a mind like mine disgraces power, and I am excluded from the society of those I reverence by the want of knowledge.—-Give me thy wisdom, and I would bear thy poverty.'</p>
<p>'My wisdom,' said Ali, 'is not mine to give, nor could I by study or tuition have obtained it. Of him who communicated it, I will ask a like portion for thee; but then thou must prepare thine eyes to see objects, perhaps of terror, certainly aweful—-canst thou stand in the presence of a super-

<p>Segued obeyed; and they Coon reached the bottom of a steep declivity. Ali then scraping away the sand, discovered a door which, having touched with a talisman he held in his hand, he opened, and they descended some rugged steps together: the door closed on them, and Segued found himself in a large chamber, lighted by millions of lamps: his conductor went to a table at the upper end, took from it spices and frankincense, and, having made a small pile, consumed

them in the middle of the floor. The smoke ascended--a noise, as of the loudest thunder, rolled above; horrid screams were heard, and the genius, clothed in ineffable brightness, flood before them. Segued covered his eyes with his hands, unable to support the dazzling lustre, while Ali requested for his friend the same emanations as he had received.</p>

POPE.
"ALI' replied the sage, 'I gave thee wisdom to sustain thee in thy necessary toil for subsistence. I have heard thy murmurs, and have found that my power has been *controled by that of my counteracting enemy, who inspires discontent wherever I bestow my blessings. I will not punish thee by withdrawing my gift, valueless as thou now deemest it: for I did not give thee fortitude with wisdom. That thou mayest learn the wisdom of submission, I will grant not only thy request, but thy wishes.-—Let Segued and Ali possess equal knowledge and equal wealth.'</p>
<p>The gratitude of Ali, and the delight

<pb n="120 THE PHAROS No. XII"/>
Segued, held them in silent admiration; while the sage, with a countenance softened by pity, continued--'wretched, short-sighted mortals! Ye ought to fear praying for particular gifts, for ye know not how much more than ye ask will be given you; but that ye may enjoy your wish, and confess my benevolence as great as my power, I will intercede with my superior genius to suffer none but natural evil to molest you: and as a reward, Ali for thy early belief on me, and thy pursuance of my counsels, that personal evil may not too heavily oppress thee, nor sorrow for that thou hast brought on thy friend afflict thee, I permit thee, at the end of a year, to visit this mansion, and will then either confirm my gifts to you, or place you again in the situations from which your wishes removed you.'--At these words he stamped on the ground, the smoke a-
*gain
<pb n="121 THE PHAROS No. XII"/>
gain ascended,, the thunder rolled, the screams filled the air, and the genius vanished. Segued and Ali prostrated themselves on the place he had occupied, and returned to the camels, not doubting that the purpose of their next visit would be to request a confirmation of their happiness.</p>
<p>They now pursued their journey together, discoursing on the new endowments they had received. As the sage had prescribed no means for attaining the promised end, they agreed to dwell together, that Segued should lend Ali a thousand sequins to trade with, and that Ali should shorten Segued's path to knowledge, by revealing his experience. Hope now braced them; the sun's fervor seemed to have abated; the lands were less desiccated, and they reached Cairo with unfelt fatigue.</p>
<p>Ali's wealth soon increased to the extent of Segued's possessions, and Se-

<pb n="122 THE PHAROS No. XII"/>
-gued's progress in science was equalled only by Ali's wisdom. They resolved to return. no more to their paternal dwellings, where knowledge would be buried in obscurity, and riches want objects for their employment; but to remain in the metropolis of Egypt, where wealth was respected, and learning courted.</p>
<p>The singularity of his situation was soon felt by Ali--Through Segued's recommendation he was a welcome guest in the houses of the opulent, but here was little to engage his mind: trade and money were the subjects of their contemplation, and these soon disgusted him: the wise were become shy of visiting him: they were dazzled by his riches and splendid manner of life and free communication was refrained by inequality: he was obliged to neglect his former pleasures for accounts: he had now no quiet leisure, and he found no enjoyment.
*In
<pb n="123 THE PHAROS No. XII"/>
<p>In Segued the gift of the genius produced immediate rapture; he conceived himself raised to a superior rank of being; the mists of ignorance vanished before him, but with them likewise, departed the former companions of his pleasure: Segued was now too wise to be easily gratified, he discovered faults he had hitherto been blind to, and though the goodness of his nature restrained him from assuming superiority, his inferiors tacitly acknowledged it, and withdrew from competition. The pleasures he had formerly delighted in, charmed no more, he was too wise to enjoy any thing trifling: he always retired to his home gloomy and discontented, and did not find his own abundance a compensation for the deficiency of others.</p>
<p>The chagrin of Ali and of Segued received some alleviation from the joy occasioned throughout Egypt by the in-
*G 2 flux
<pb n="124 THE PHAROS No. XII"/>
flux of the Nile. In the public felicity, private uneasiness was forgotten; but, when this temporary hilarity abated, each began a fresh to repine. 'I was deceived,' said Segued to Ali, 'in supposing great intellectual possession essential to happiness, or that from the late attainment of it, I should derive those pleasures which proceed from early initiation and habituated pursuit. I had beaten out a track for myself in the road of life, which it is uneasy to me to quit, and I find nothing that can atone for the pain I suffer in conflicting with settled habit. As I am wise for no particular purpose my endeavors want an object: I do not see the immediate effect of my labor as I used to do in concerns of merchandise, and I feel myself in a situation I was not designed for.--Tell me, Ali, how far thou thinkest thyself a

<p>'I confess,' replied Ali, 'that riches have no charm is for me; all they purchase is insipid. Instead of affording me the leisure and *tranquillity I expected, they keep me in continual employment. I reproach myself incessantly for my want of fortitude: I might surely have waited the next season, since it has now blest our fields with fecundity; and, had not despondency made me inactive, I could have procured what was necessary to my existing during this short period of hardship. From all I have seen in my new state of affluence I learn, that the misfortune I wished alleviated was, not that of poverty, which obliged me to labor, and sweetened my hours off retirement; the evil that oppressed me was the dread of want, and now that the Nile has :risen to its most de-

<p>Let us then,' said Segued, 'wait till the expiration of the year; do thou return to thy scientific retirement, and_ I win feel the companions of my youth, happy in being freed from that wearisome discernment which points out the failings of those I must converse with, and contented to wear, over the eyes of knowledge, such a veil as shall hinder my seeing deformity in objects, on my idea of whose beauty my happiness depends.'</p>
<p>Immediately, as the appointed time elapsed, they quitted Cairo, returned to the sage, and besought him to replace them in their original state--'Go my sons,' said he, 'I will indulge you in your request, on condition ye bear in mind this truth--that man can here look for little happiness beyond the absence

Miss H. More.
<p>THE situation of a periodical writer, abounds with inconveniences and has few charms. There is indeed, something plausib1e and alluring in the description of it, as the task of furnishing a small number of pages in a week, is no insupportable toil, and the writer is allowed to chuse stvle and subject; but of the difficulties, no one can an judge who has not made the experiment, and I believe every one who has, will decide with me; for let inc be in what humor I may, still I must write:---an agreeable visit must be shortened or a <hi rend="italic">t&ecircte-&agrave-t&ecircte</hi> abruptly broken off to wait on the printer; and I must see .all domestic irregularities with indifferences lest I should
*pro-
<pb n="129 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
procure condemnation, by communicating my spleen to my readers.</p>
<p>One species of relief is however reserved for us laborers in literature; this is the occasional aid of correspondents, who kindly now and then interpose their *lucubrations, and afford us a day's respite. Of such assistance, I cannot say I have not my share: I now experience the comfort of it, and as I know not how more gratefully to acknowledge the favor, I shall comply with the injunction of early publication, first intreating my polite readers' forgiveness for the rank of those I introduce to them.</p>

*SIR,
<p>YESTERDAY at dinner I hears my lady say as there is a book a writing every two days in a week, in the which whomsomever has any complaints may write. Now, sir, this is just the
*very
G 5
<pb n="130 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
very sort of a book I have been a wishing for, for my lady reads for everlasting, and she says she will send to Hookham's for this book; so, sir, it is very likeable that when as she sees this here letter she will see as she's a doing the very thing it writes again. So sir, I'll tell you how it is and all about it.</p>
<p>I was a poor country boy as my lady taked to be footboy, and she had me learnt to read and write, and is very good to me, and has made me her footman.—-Now, sir, it would be very wicked in me to be again doing of any thing as my lady orders, and I am sure I would serve her to my life's end; but, sir, there is one thing as goes again me more than any thing. My lady has a lap-dog, and very fond she is of it, and every day bids me walk for an hour with Pompey in our square. Now sir, I hope I will
l
never be above doing any thing for a
fellow creature, but indeed it makes
*fun.
<pb n="131 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
fun for all the servants in the square, to see me walking and stopping with my 1ady's Pompey. Now, sir, since my good lady has had me learnt, to, read the Bible, I takes great delight in it, and when as I see what great things poor men like me has done, I thinks none of them ever waited on a dog like me, and I do not think as we was made for their servants. Pray, sir, put this letter in the book directly, for I am sure as if my lady see it she would not be angry, and may be as she mought find me some work better to do than walk with Pompey.</p>
*From your Servant,
*Pray, sir, be so
good to spell
It right.
*DAVID MEEK.
<p>My other correspondent is of the same function as Mr. Meek, but having. known better fortune, is better able to state a grievance, which as well as that
*G 6 above
<pb n="132 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
above complained of, I should be glad to see relieved.</p>
*SIR,
<p>CHANCING to see one of your papers on my master's table, my natural love for a printed sheet, made me hasten the dispatch of my, business to take .a view of its contents. As your notions and mine seem in many points to tally, I conceived a hope that you would not reject a letter from me, and that your speedy publication of it might diminish the evil I complain of.</p>
<p>But that you may judge of the aggravated grievance I am about to state to you, it is necessary that you should be a little acquainted not only with my present situation, but my original prospect of life. To be as little tedious as possible, I will only mention to you that I was born heir to a considerable
*estate,
<pb n="133 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
estate, such an one as madea liberal education fitting, which I had just completed when my father, by one unlucky cast at dice, bereft his family of their patrimony, and threw me out on the world an inexperienced helpless vagabond.</p>
<p>The horror of starving stimulated me to industry, and I applied to many persons for such employ as suited my abilities and attainments, but not meeting with it, I embraced the offer of a friend of my father's, to embark with him in trade: the want of a capital I was to supply by taking the laboring oar in the business, that my partner might enjoy the pleasures of a country-house and a fox-chase. He soon sunk into extreme indolence, neglected the trade before I had learned to conduct it, and, by that supineness, which would have made the fortune of many in my situation, found the expences of his shop more than
*equi-
<pb n="134 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
equivalent to the profits of it. I cannot accuse him of injustice in dissolving the partnership between us, but I thought it hard to be punished for his negligence, since I could soon have made myself his efficient substitute, would he have bestowed proper pains on my instruction.</p>
<p>I will not detain you with a catalogue of melancholy events; suffice it to say, I had no alternative but servitude, and that I have, in the course of forty years, experienced all its varieties and hardships but I cannot chuse my condition; food and raiment are indispensible requisites to life, and the only real requisites: these I have, and with these I ought to be contented, but there is, in my present service, a circumstance so grating to my mind, that though I have little hope of removing it, I cannot refrain from complaining of it.</p>
<p>I need not tell you I am now an old man.--The family I serve is that of a
gen-.
<pb n="135 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
gentleman, a widower, with several marriageable daughters. The work required of me is not excessive, but the species of it sometimes disgusts me beyond bearing. Much of my attendance is on my mistresses: I walk after theft, and though the vigor of their youth is often more than a match for the infirmity of sixty -five, I feel no reluctance in the performance of this part of my duty, because I am still in the station of a man, and my protection might be useful in defending them from danger or insult. That to which I object is, the going on trivial errands, unfit for a man, and still more so for an old man. The other day my eldest mistress sent me to the haberdasher's for half a yard of ribbon to match in color a pattern she gave me: I went to the shop, delivered my instructions, and waited while the choice was made. At my return I was blamed, for the shade was not exactly
*matched,
<pb n="136 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
matched, and was told that a boy of five years old would have looked at the ribbon, and not hare taken whatever was given him. I was almost tempted to ask my mistress, if she thought it becoming a grey-headed old man to examine the shade of a ribbon, but I recollected the dependence of my existence on my place. A band box I have frequently to carry through the street, and not seldom to follow my mistresses with a work-bag dangling on my arm--sometimes I have a muff, lately, when their nieces are with them little miss's doll has been confined to my hands. In short I am employed in the purchase and conveyance of every article of female finery, and am, without the least regard to age or sex, made useful wherever my mistress needs an errand man.</p>
<p>Now though I am not so infatuated as to suppose the life of a footman can
*be
<pb n="137 THE PHAROS No. XIII"/>
be made tolerable to a mind like mine, yet I think a very small degree of attention to propriety, would make servitude a less wretched retreat from want and misery. A man, let him be ever so degraded by misfortune, is still a man, and though he may be forced to forget he is one of the lords of the creation, he must be unworthy his rank in being, if he can submit tamely to indignities which presuppose an absence of rational properties.</p>
<p>It is in the power of the giddy and heedless to inflict punishment without a consciousness of *cruely; but want of thought is an inadmissible plea in thinking beings, and notwithstanding the good humor which may cover the disposition I would stigmatise, it is as distant from good nature, as the mirth excited by seeing a horse dance or a lion leap over a stick is from rational delight.

*O Solitude! the foul's best friend.
COTTON.

<p>SICKNESS and solitude like unhappy friends, try our tempers and affections: they force us to become acquainted with ourselves, and to discover whether our regard to life it attracted by the solid and immutable properties it derives from nature, or by the splendor of those decorations it steals from pleasure.</p>
<p>To instruct my readers how to support the presence of two such unwelcome visitors, is, perhaps, an errand that may render me equally unacceptable. Few in health chuse to contemplate the miseries of the want of it, and as few willingly withdraw from the delights of crowded society, to consider how they shall
*make
<pb n="139 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>

make themselves happy when alone; but, as the bold, effrontery of--<hi rend="italic">not at home</hi>--however steadily pronounced or persisted in, will not drive these personages from our doors, it may perhaps be serviceable, though odiously so, to think on the subject. The privilege of neglect remains for the unimpressible, and my monitions may be avoided by waiting for a less gloomy page.</p>
<p> For the support of sickness, in its terrific forms of pain and mental disorder, we can look only to the hand that inflicts it.--Religion is here the sole consolation, and its efficacy millions have attested: but as this is not a relief attached to our couch or our pillow, and can be acquired only when our faculties have their full power, it behoves all, who do not deny its existence, to cultivate the seeds of this invaluable plant, and to preserve, in the soil of their minds, the requisites for its growth and nutriment. How
*this
<pb n="140 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
this can be done in the incessant whirl of modern dissipation, let those advise who have made the attempt and succeeded.</p>
<p>But there are periods of disease when we are capable of rationa1 enjoyments. The languor of convalescence may be rendered tolerable, and we may be made less aware of the tardiness with which health returns, by the exercise of our attentive faculties on more pleasant subjects. By the choice of these subjects our recovery may be in some measure retarded or accelerated; those which irritate or disturb the nervous system must be noxious, and it is therefore not absurd to suppose, that such as diffuse over our minds, a calm. tranquility may, with a selected atmosphere and salubrious medicine, conduce to our restoration.</p>
<p>An hypothesis such as this, however from our ignorance of the causes that work on nature, it may be erroneous,
*has
<pb n="141 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
has been generally received, but the misfortune to be lamented is, that the art is to be learned when it should be practised. We retire ,from vigor and gaiety, to debility and gloom, and under the oppression of what is called low spirits, are to arm ourselves against an enemy we believe invisible, and of whose method of attack we are ignorant. It is not necessary that to alleviate sickness we should live always as if sick, yet surely it is as inexcusable wholly to neglect preparation for it, as it would be in the commander of a besieged town to postpone victualling his garrison till a breach is made in the wall.</p>
<p>How this preparation shall be effected without a diminution of the pleasures of health, is the science I wish to teach; but as the recipe may be equally useful to those in solitude, let us first take a view of the inconveniences of a secluion from society.</p>
*Solitude
<pb n="142 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
<p>Solitude is, by many persons, considered as tinged with the dark shadows of sickness.--I had rather be ill than alone, is a trite sentiment; and indeed to those who have assiduously shunned it, its approach must be a disease, but this is our own fault. It is in the power of every body, blessed with the common comforts of life, to be as happy when left to the company of their own hearts, as when surrounded by all their friends and acquaintance; and if we have any faith in the dictum of the learned and sagacious Sir Thomas Browne, who says, 'He who must needs have company, must have sometimes bad company'--we shall be inclined to think solitude occasionally necessary to our peace and enjoyment.</p>
<p>I own my opinion and my doctrine antiquated: when I look round the microcosm of our metropolis, I am almost a convert to the general opinion, that
*solitude
<pb n="143 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
solitude is a grievance insupportable. To human nature, in its simple slate, it can present nothing displeasing, but to the children of this generation it must, on more accounts than I chuse to name, be a most hideous monster.-—With the same spirit that actuated Marc Antony against Cicero, it is proscribed, it is hunted, but where shall an Herennius be found to give it the fatal blow. The decapitation of Cicero satisfied the revenge of his opponents, and relieved their fears of his return; but this enemy can never be crushed: it is a Hydra; every head leaves its substitutes and avengers.</p>
<p>As then this unwelcome guest must, be a guest, it is our policy to render her propitious towards us. Let us receive her with smiles, and she will smile on us; and, for the respect we shew her by preparing for her reception, the will abundantly reward us. There is but one
*method
<pb n="144 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
method of doing this or of supporting the additional languor of ill health, and that is by convincing ourselves of the utility of early mental cultivation, and acting confidently with this conviction. In solitude it will dispose us to. seek amusement amongst the lettered dead, and to furnish our minds with useful knowledge; it will be the means of accumulating a fund of delight which nothing can diminish; it will make our own ideas always new company to us, and diffuse over our tempers that complacency which is equally necessary to our enjoying, in their full force, the salutary blessing of solitude, or the attractive charms of society. To enforce what I have said, I shall add a letter I received a few days since from a correspondent who is, alas! too far gone to receive assistance from any thing I can urge.</p>
*MY
<pb n="145 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
*MY DEAR FRIEND,
<p>I KNOW you are capable of giving me advice, and I am inclined to believe <hi rend="italic">good</hi> advice, for you have often given me that which I wish now I had followed; but, regret and self-condemnation do not suit my humor. 'While we live let us live', is my motto, and you must instruct me in this art.</p>
<p>You need not be told that I am not young--threescore is passing over my head, and I feel it in my bones. How I have lived too, you are pretty well aware: have never been remarkably vicious: I have gone with the tide, not rejecting pleasure when she offered herself in any spirit-stirring form, yet I think I have passed my life without injury or offence to any one. My employments, you severe judges will call idle; I rose late because I sat up late-—the levee, an airing on horseback, a shew of pictures, or a stroll with a couple of friends
*VOL. I. H through
<pb n="146 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
through the gay parts of the town, together with a, peep into a coffee house to read the papers, and a lounge in a fruit shop to keep up my intimacy with the fair, generally occupied one half of my day; the rest was devoted to dressing, to convivial mirth, the play-house, the opera, or other public amusement.</p>
<p>But these halcyon days are no more: my friends have either settled into a more sober class of men, or have proved their constitutions less strong than mine, so that I am almost a stranger in a place nobody knows better than myself, and from the extensive circle of my intimates can scarcely cull one acquaintance.</p>
<p>Natural infirmities, and a declining constitution have wrought this disagreeable change. Those who would have rallied me to death had I married, now regard me with contempt as an old batchelor. Books I never much affected, without it was a new play or a novel, so that
*the
<pb n="147 THE PHAROS No. XIV"/>
the men of literature cannot relieve me--in short, I know no set of men that can. My infirmities often confine me to my house, where I sit many hours alone: I con the papers till I hate the, sight of them; a play or farce I have not seen on the stage is insipid in reading, so that I have no resource but gazing at the passers by, many of whom, whose occupations I suppose call them out at stated hours, duly raise their eyes as they pass my window, and smile at feeing me so constant to my post.</p>
<p>I begin to think I should have been happier had I been bred to a profession, but perhaps the question is only which half of our lives shall be miserable. If you would give me your thoughts on this subject, you will enable me to deceive a quarter of an hour, and consequently oblige,

*The pride of arrogant distinctions.
COWPER.

<p>I WAS a few days ago brought acquainted with a species of folly, of whose existence nothing but positive demonstration would have convinced me. It is a folly that I believe has not yet had a particular name assigned it: it ranks in the genus of vanity, but certainly deserves distinction, for which reason I shall denominate it <hi rend="italic">a desire to shew off one's friends.</hi></p>
<p>A lately deceased writer has, in one of the papers of the Adventurer, very ludicrously described the pretences to importance made by his fellow-travellers in a stage coach. Here, as he observes, the wish of the several persons was only to procure themselves temporary regard,
*H 3 as
<pb n="150 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
as when the arrival of the vehicle dismissed them to their respective habitations and functions, their importance must vanish; but in the folly I am about to describe more is attempted: there is a reflex lustre cast on the person, and success in imposition may procure permanent homage. To render myself intelligible, I must describe the circumstances of a visit I made to Francisco, who had invited me to partake of what he called an evening's sociable conversation: I knew the vacuity of his mind too well to expect he would furnish any thing towards our improvement or amusement, but I could not easily decline his offer to introduce me to his wife, and I promised my attendance.</p>
<p>On entering the room, I found the chairs still marshalled themselves in the terrific form of a circle, an appearance which is always to me a hint that the occupiers are to do their utmost in in-
terlocutory
<pb n="151 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
terlocutory exercise, they are placed like the great guns in the sides of ships, are to load and fire, and wait a discharge from those opposite to them. An awful silence of some moments succeeded to my entrance, in which I had time to survey my friend's wife, and to discover that she was, to the utmost degree, solicitous in the display of her beauty, not, I thought, without a particular desire to attract my notice. The arrival of several visitors gave her now an opportunity of unfolding the treasures of her mind, and Francisco being, by his profession, suddenly called out, and all present strangers to me, I was content to remain silent, and be deemed a stupid creature for the pleasure of studying ELIZA'S character.</p>
<p>As this party was in truth summoned in imitation of those rational assemblies which persons of rank and learning now form, or, in other words, as we were
*H 4. <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
<pb n="152 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
<hi rend="italic">to play at a conversatione</hi>, I was curious to observe how Eliza, who I was now thoroughly convinced had more beauty than intellect, would demean herself, and support the character of prolocutor till her heterogeneous guests were warmed into intimacy. She did not seem averse to leading the discourse, she prated incessantly, collected the opinion of every one present on the last new tragedy, and then amused us with a relation of the terror the had suffered when she left Cheltenham, by hearing a highwayman had committed depredations on that road: this, and about half a dozen relations, in all of which she was the heroine, lasted till she perceived that she had all the conversation to herself, and then, I suppose, fearing her company would leave her with no favorable opinion of her good-manners, she determined to atone for it and render
*them
<pb n="153 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
them respectable by what I term <hi rend="italic">shewing them off.</hi></p>
<p>How far does your friend the duke ******* of live from your in the country, laid Eliza, addressing herself to an old <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>, for such I must call her, but who in truth I should have taken for a country-shopkeeper. The reply being given in the number of miles; Eliza observed how agreeable it was to have such a sociable neighbor, and said all that could convince me of the intimacy between his grace and her friend, giving the latter an opportunity which she willingly embraced of relating what, on various occasions, the duke had said to her, and what the had said to the duke.</p>
<p>Wealth, I found, was the attribute of the lady the next addressed-—Enquiries were here made about her four horses, her mansion-house in Yorkshire, and her diamond-necklace, and a blaze of riches would have been exposed to, our con-

templation if the arrival of a clergyman had not broken off the discourse. He excused his late arrival, by modestly saying, business had detained him.—-Aye, said Eliza, I supposed my lord would not leave you early--great folks are sometimes troublesome acquaintance. We pedagogues, replied the honest parson, though we style ourselves the masters of our pupils, are in effect their servants--if my lord is sullen I must wait till he chuses to learn, as was the case this afternoon.--I with fortune, when she makes men poor and dependent, would charitably increase their quantum of patience.</p>
<p>Here was now a fine opportunity of shewing me how many of Eliza's intimates, were the intimates of *tituladoes spoiled—-The parson had ingenuously avowed his situation, and in a way that might mortify her silly vanity, but the disappointment was obliterated
*by
<pb n="155 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
by the entry of a young man dressed in boots, and from head to foot a perfect dirty dishabille: he was followed by a pointer; and on perceiving the company he was to be introduced to, rapt out an exclamation at once declaring the insincerity of his confusion and his abandoned profligacy; but had he come in Adam's garb he would have been welcome, for he voluntarily, declared his rank and importance, by complaining grievously of the confinement to which his, attendance on the prince obliged him. Perhaps Eliza would have been as well pleased, if he had concealed from us, that she had invited him to make one of this party with that sort of compulsive solicitation that admits no refusal. The conversation was confined to the mistress of the house and this new guest, and as their stock, both of understanding and vanity, seemed nearly to tally, it was such as afforded
*H 6 little
<pb n="156 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
little amusement to the silenced majority, as on the part of Eliza it consisted principally of enquiries after persons to whom they were strangers, and the gentleman related nothing that did not immediately concern himself or his master.</p>
<p>Eliza seemed now to think herself in the zenith of splendor, and heard, without emotion, the thunder of another rap. Happily it proved a lady who had been driven to the utmost danger of disappointing Eliza, by waiting dinner for a Mr.***, the recollection of whose name gave our fair hostess an occasion of pathetically lamenting the inconveniences to which members of parliament were forced to submit, and of informing the circle that this gentleman, who was the intimate of the last-arrived lady's husband, was the confidential friend of the minister. The lady now seemed to have her cue, and with a
*most
<pb n="157 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
most ridiculous vehemence, related all the circumstances of this great man's election, the opposition made to it, and his conduct after success. As all or most of this might have been learned from the daily oracles, she confirmed her importance by predicting events in politics and changes in the cabinet, in doing which she was so very communicative that I was convinced her intelligence could not be authentic, for no one employed in the affairs of government could have been so silly as to trust this prate-apace with matters on whose *secresy so much depended.</p>
<p>I was now, as I dare say my reader is, heartily tired, and finding ceremony needless, withdrew in silence: before I had reached the bottom of the stairs, I was overtaken by the clergyman, whose situation had been exactly the same as mine, and who seemed incited by my example to a retreat. He now
ad-
<pb n="158 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
addressed me in terms of admiration at the egregious folly we had witnessed, and his remarks I shall substitute for my own.</p>
<p>It is to me wonderful, said he, that any people can fall into an error which is so obvious that nobody escapes detection, or that they can imagine this bare-faced manner of exposing themselves can procure them respect. By their desire of declaring their great connexions they defeat their own purpose, for if the comparative meanness of their own situation did not render the good fortune in some measure wonderful, it would never occupy their thoughts, nor consequently be a subject of their conversation: they therefore, by their solicitude, prove themselves the inferiors of those whose equals they would be thought. And beside this, those infected with this intolerable vanity ought to be told, that where chance or neces-
*sity
<pb n="159 THE PHAROS No. XV"/>
sity obliges persons in the middle stations of life to associate with their superiors, it is esteemed no instance of good fortune, and such people are not well enough pleased with the necessity to brag of it. Where interest is not the motive, there is an incongruity in the intimacy of persons of very different ranks, that in most cases is unpleasant, and where narrowness of income compels one to it; I, from sad experience, can declare there is nothing to be proud of. Place any man in my situation, descended as I am from one of the most ancient families in the kingdom, a family that not only came in with the Normans, but can trace a pedigree in the annals of France some centuries higher, and can prove their descent ever since the first establishment of empire in that country, whose ancestors have, to an incredible number and degree, distinguished themselves by their loyalty and

valor, whole patrimony extended over almost a whole county: place any man, I say, in my circumstances, and he will own it no felicity to be, as I am, forced to live amongst persons now esteemed of high rank, but whom I regard justly as my inferiors.</p>
<p>By this and a little more, I perceived, that though the mania was differently modified in my clerical acquaintance, it was as violent as in those whose frenzy he had been reprobating, and that had the lady, whose house we were quitting, but touched on the subject of pedigree, he would have proved himself worthy his place in the circle.</p>

*Is there, beneath Love's noble name
Can harbor, dark, the selfish aim
To bless himself alone?
ROBERT BURNS,

*SIR,
<p>I TAKE up my pen to give envy a regale:--perhaps it may afford her wretched votaries one moment's pleasure to know that one whom the caprice of fortune has rendered odious, her bounty has made miserable.--Perhaps the picture I am about to unveil to them, may induce them to suspect they have sometimes misdirected their shafts:--happy should I be if aught I urge relieves a fellow-sufferer from the addition of misery this passion has heaped on me.</p>
<p>Can I hope to engage the eye or ear
*of
<pb n="162 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>
of curiosity if I declare my humble origin?--Will any attention be vouchsafed me by the sons and daughters of grandeur and opulence if I own myself the daughter of an inn-keeper, and that not in the metropolis, nor in the first rank even of those who followed the same occupation in the same place?--I will hope a hearing from some not yet giddy with this world's intoxicating draught, for I can boast myself the child of a man of tried integrity.</p>
<p>It was the will of Providence to place my parents in that city of England which is honored with an university--a circumstance that made me no welcome visitor, but a source of great anxiety to them:--it was, as I grew up, no less unpleasant to myself, for it obliged me to live much from home or in a state of imprisonment.-—I have many times seen my poor father gaze for some moments intently on my face, turn away
*with
<pb n="163 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>
with glistening eyes, and wish it had pleased God to deny me the gift of beauty. As I sincerely honored and revered this careful parent, and thought nothing so important as his peace, it was my highest ambition to acquire his confidence: I implicitly concurred in his wishes for my safety, and did, and forbore to do, whatever he suggested as prudent or censured as dangerous to me.</p>
<p>In this state, afraid to be seen, and often debarred the pleasure of enjoying the fresh breeze out of the city, I lived till I had reached my seventeenth year, when, in spite of every precaution, I attracted the notice of a young nobleman, the son of an earl then living. As no one could get access to me personally, he avowed, in writing, that he loved me, and made me a tender of his heart. Had the most direful prophecy now been accomplished on my devoted head, I could not have felt greater horror than at this
*moment.
<pb n="164 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>
moment. I carried the letter instantly to my father, begging him to take what consequent measures he thought fit. To send me away was immediately resolved on, and I retired to the house of a relation in the next county.</p>
<p>But here I soon found myself in greater peril. My lord learnt where I was, and, under an assumed character, aided I fear by those who should have protected me, gained admission to me.-—Natural pride was, I believe, my monitor; for though his person was captivating, his manners insinuating, and his sincerity declared with all the circumstances that could obtain him credit, I thought only on my father and reputation, and dismissed him with insolence.-—Upon this I was again taken home, and forced to live as if my existence depended on my concealment. I could not stir abroad, nor approach a window; I slept in a room inaccessible but through that where my
*father
<pb n="165 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>
father lay, and yet, with all this submission to very irksome restraint, I had not the happiness of procuring his comfort:-—he was miserably anxious, and in perpetual terror, sometimes resolving to fend me to London, then recollecting that he could there substitute no guardian for me equal to his care.--At other times bent on removing with me to some distant part of the kingdom, and as often deterred by considering, that should he abandon his present situation, and not succeed in another, he must leave me in such poverty at his death as would inevitably expose me to the evil he with such caution shunned.</p>
<p>For more than a twelvemonth did I endure this aggravated misery—-his lordship frequently soliciting me by letters, which I never opened. At length, finding me immoveable, he seriously applied to my father, and offered a private marriage; but without success:--for this
*upright
<pb n="166 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>

<p>Things were in this state, and we hoped, from his longer silence than usual, that my lord was effectually discouraged, when I sustained the severest affliction I could feel:--My father, after an illness of a few hours, died, and left me to protection unavailable to my security; for what could a mother's authority do, even when exerted to the utmost, against the endeavors we were now to expect? And what hope was there for me, who knew my mother to be of an unsteady temper, and had reason to suspect she was dazzled by the splendor I was courted to accept?</p>
*That
<pb n="167 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>
<p>That this suspicion was well grounded, a short time demonstrated, and I began to look round for a retreat from her: but my reputation was in danger if I left her clandestinely, and if the knew whither I went, I was no safer than with her: I was therefore compelled to abide where I was, and to hear incessantly arguments not her own, I was well convinced, tending to prove the folly of my obstinacy. My lord frequently supplied her with written eloquence, he repeated the same offer as before my dear father's death, and, without much difficulty, prevailed on her to see him. His victory over all her scruples this interview completed; but <hi rend="italic">my</hi> resolution was unshaken, and, with a degree of pleasure, bordering on cruelty, I heard that he inclined to abandon the pursuit: when he was to quit college for the vacation, he left a message with my mother for me, professing his sorrow for the trouble he had
*given
<pb n="168 THE PHAROS No. XVI"/>
given me, commending my firmness, formally renouncing his hopes, and promising eternal silence would I but admit him, in her presence, to bid me an everlasting farewell.</p>
<p>I did not doubt my own ability to stand this trial, for I was heartily angry at the solicitations I had been pestered with. I considered it as now in my power to purchase peace cheaply; but left I should be suddenly betrayed to do what I might afterwards repent of, I desired a quarter of are hour's leisure to deliberate, and was going out of the room to spend it in retirement, when my lord entered. My astonishment was great, but I had presence of mind enough to assume an air of indifference, and fortitude enough to hear all his eloquence unmoved:--we parted-—My sprits thus long had served me, and I now hastened to my own apartment to hide

*-—Sunk to sordid interest feels no more
That noble wish, that never-cloy'd desire
Which, selfish joy disdaining, seeks alone
To bless the dearer objetct of its flame.
THOMSON.

<p>MY former constancy had now wholly abandoned me: my mother's arguments accelerated its departure; and I felt that permission to avow my sentiments to myself was all I needed to render me sensible that I returned my lord's affection. I ardently wished him ungraced with title, and in a state of life level with mine, that I might convince him it was neither his coronet nor revenue that tempted me. He soon learnt the change in his favor: he hastened to me, easily overcame my resolution to wait the death of his father, who, he
*I2 confessed,
<pb n="172 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
confessed, was recovering, and in a few days made me his wife.</p>
<p>As our marriage was to be a profound secret, I remained with, my mother, who, quitting her business, retired to a village in the neighbourhood: here we lived in a state of happiness that almost obliterated my good father's precepts and caution from my ungrateful memory, till a letter came from the earl directing his son to prepare. for his travels, as he had determined on his going abroad immediately. I want words to express the agony I. felt at hearing this news, for in our joy I had not once thought of this necessary separation :--three years was the time fixed for his absence, and there was no alternative: he left me when I most needed his support, with no other consolation than an assurance that his reluctance was equal to mine.</p>
<p>The hope of future happiness yet encouraged me: my cares soon increased
*and
<pb n="173 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
and occupied my thoughts, and I could have rested tolerably contented had I enjoyed my lord's correspondence; but his travelling tutor was an impediment to this pleasure, and a few lines in many weeks, which I dared not reply to, importing that he was well, and desirous of returning to me, were all the comfort he could administer.</p>
<p>To fill up this uneasy long-during time of expectation, I applied myself to such studies as might fit me for the station of life I was one day to occupy: my lords former bounty and occasional remittances enabled me to procure several necessary accomplishments, and I hoped I should not externally disgrace him. Never did any one cultivate their talents with such delight as I felt.--I had the strongest stimulatives, love and heartfelt gratitude.</p>
<p>In the midst of these my hopes and exertions, I learnt that our marriage
*I3 was
<pb n="174 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
was no longer a secret, that it had come to the earl's ear, and he was to the highest degree exasperated. Lest my silence should be construed into contempt, I wrote to him in the most submissive terms, imploring his pardon, but he vouchsafed me no reply. His eldest daughter, about this time, disposed of herself much against his will, and I began to think, as she had been no more discreet than her brother, and as much harmony had subsisted between them, some regard might be expected from her. She came into the neighborhood; whether by accident or out of curiosity I will not determine, and I begged permission to wait on her. This she granted, and now my hopes of her kindness increased. I went to her house taking my little boy with me, and was shewn into a ground room, where I expected either to see her or to receive a summons to attend her: after waiting
*more
<pb n="175 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
more than half an hour, a servant brought a message from her, desiring I would send up the child by him. I obeyed, and should have seen nothing of my lord's sister had not her inquisitiveness brought her to a window, when she had returned her nephew, and I was leaving the house with him. Since that time the has once stopt him as he passed her door; the asked the servant, who carried him, a multitude of questions about me, and finished all with saying, that had her brother taken me <hi rend="italic">into keeping</hi> she could have forgiven it, but that now the family honor obliged her to resent my presumption.</p>
<p>It was become incumbent on me to assume my husband's name, and by his direction I did so. No one can conceive the change it produced in those around me. I was no longer thought on but as a subject of astonishment, envy, and inquisitiveness: my ,manner of life was
*I4. a never-
<pb n="176 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
a never-failing topic for the latter, and I could not pass through the village without hearing something that reflected on me. A set of rural scandal-mongers near me forgot the delights of cards, in the pleasure of reporting and hearing how my narrow finances forced me to disgrace my lord:---in short, if celebrity is desirable, I enjoyed it; but alas! how often did it make my heart ache!</p>
<p>Yet Hope sustained me, and. I was cheared by my lord's correspondence:--the time of separation wore away, and that of our meeting at length arrived--arrived indeed; but only to render me completely miserable; for he who had drawn me from obscurity to torturing elevation; he for whom I had undergone every agony of mind, that innocence can feel, now beheld me with indifference, and his son without fondness. Instead of returning my expres-
*sions
<pb n="177 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
sions of joy, he could talk of nothing but his father's indignation and his fears of disinheritance--evils he had hitherto braved; and, after a stay of scarcely two hours, he left me with frowns and averted looks. I began to think I, had suffered a metamorphosis, or that I had lost my senses—-fool that I was!—-Could I satisfy the eye sated with splendid beauty?—-Could I charm him who had travelled Italy to. refine his taste?</p>
<p>A letter from his lordship, in a few days, informed me that he had purchased reconciliation with his family, by promising to see me no more: at the same time he, with a species of candor near a-kin to effrontery, confessed to me that he was mortified when he reflected on the indissoluble engagement I had forced him to, because it obliged him to decline a match to which beauty, birth, wealth, and power were the attractions. This letter inclosed one
*I 5	from
<pb n="178 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
from his father, stating the inconvenience I had reduced the family to, and offering me a settlement of five hundred pounds a year; secured to myself and my son, if I would quit my claim, declare myself not married, and suffer my lord to contract a more advantageous alliance. To this offer I had not replied, when news of the earl's death reached me, and I will own filled my heart with joyful expectations. I persuaded myself that my lord had acted under his father's direction, and that now he would certainly avow me his wife.-—How grossly did I flatter mvself!-—My first application to learn his intentions, he replied to, by telling me I had cost him too much vexation to retain any part of his regard; but that on condition I would remain at a distance, he would allow me an annuity--to this I am compelled to submit. I can hear of sums lavished on opera fingers and

dancers, while he tardily remits me a scanty pittance, and can see his name subscribed to charities while he has forgotten that he is a husband and a father.</p>
<p>To this heap of suffering my friendly neighbors lend their contributions. Many of them are of opinion that I have all I wished for in the appellation so grating to my ears, and for this fortuitous pre-eminence I am hated. In. every, purchase, be it ever so trivial, I .pay more than others because I am a lady: a servant will not live with me ton moderate wages for the same reason, and beside this imposition, I am perpetually insulted by being told what other countesses do. But these are the least traits of the obloquy I endure; it is not often safe to insult nobility openly, and therefore it is not wonderful that the opportunity I furnish should be eagerly embraced.</p>
*I6 Let
<pb n="180 THE PHAROS No. XVII"/>
<p>Let the declaration of my woes, which I have too long descanted on, lead those who read it to believe this truth, that no one deserves envy for possessing nominal blessings, since perhaps they carry with them an alloy debasing them below ordinary comforts. And, on the other hand, let this be ever uppermost in the minds of such as are like me solicited to accept situations they were not born to, that no misery is so great as that which is splendid.</p>
<p>Should this meet the eye of him whose cruelty suggested it, he may scorn it as a covert attempt to excite pity: let him, know I ask no pity—-for I am convinced I deserve none. If I was weak enough to trust him, against whom my honored father so sedulously warned me, if I could expect the conjugal virtues from him who made me his wife only because he could not make me his mistress, I alone am to blame. To that

*--Views the truth with a diftorted eye.
COWPER.

<p>I WAS asked the other day to give a reason why description so frequently magnifies objects, or rather, to state it more correctly, why it magnifies the degree of the quality described; for instance, why in verbally representing any thing as beautiful, it is painted on the imagination of the, "hearers as more beautiful than it really is, and so in other subjects of description. Disquisition must precede satisfaction on this head, and I therefore promised my querist to make it the. topic of an essay.</p>
<p>Passion or interest, it is well known, often occasions this deception. Where a person means to impress another with a sense analogous to his own feelings,
*even
<pb n="183 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
even while truth is not violated, the judgment maybe misled. A lover may set forth his mistress's charms in terms which her personal perfections shall not positively contradict, and yet an unprejudiced gazer may feel his expectations balked. He who has an estate to sell, will, in a verbal description, raise it to beauty. and importance, but an ocular survey shall prove it :insignificant and ill-conditioned.</p>
<p>Concealment of some one particular, not obvious to the hearer, is another means of .deception.--I once heard a collector describe a Titian he had purchased at a sale, in such terms as awakened the attention of all acquainted. with the works of that master, and made the cheap rate at which it was knocked down to him incredible. He invited me to see it--I went: the mystery was unravelled-—the picture was incontestibly deserving of what he had
*said
<pb n="184 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
said of it; but the rats had made free with the canvas and devoured the feet and legs of one of the figures: of this the possessor seemed to think lightly—-it was genuine-—it was fine-—and he was delighted.</p>
<p>In describing many things it will be found that concomitant circumstances have exaggerated the speaker's idea of their excellence: fine weather passes often unnoticed; nobody would bestow their labor in describing the beautiful diversity of light and shade afforded by objects constantly before our eyes, but these things are seen in peculiar beauty by a person just released from a sick bed; and he will talk himself into rapture about them. The gratitude of perhaps, unexpected restoration; the joy of meeting again those scenes to which he had bidden adieu, here raise emotions in the mind which assist the imagination, and *ren-
<pb n="185 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
render what is in general, common and unheeded, interesting and valued.</p>
<p>Novelty is likewise a cause of exaggeration. Intimacy with persons, situations or objects, produces satiety and insensibility to their beauty or other recommendations: here it will be said, the fault is in the hearer, but then a question arises, whether, as our judgment is unfavorably prejudiced by satiety, our admiration is not too much raised by novelty; and in support of this it may be urged, that some degree of acquaintance being necessary to our discerning the good or ill properties of whatever we meet with, we are, by novelty, kept in a state of ignorance, in which even satiated intimacy has the advantage of us.</p>
<p>A desire of causing wonder is another source of deception; but in this case the precise bounds of truth are seldom rigorously adhered to; therefore this
*can-
<pb n="186 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
cannot be considered as in the class of <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> sources of exaggeration.</p>
<p>But the powers of detail infinitely surpass those of description. Before I put my readers on their guard, I must present them with an instance for which I am indebted to a very ingenious friend.</p>
<p>In an isle of considerable note in Europe dwelt the wealthy BENADAMI, who on succeeding to his paternal inheritance, resolved, by a life spent in munificence and good actions, to atone for the rapacity and sordid avarice of his father. As a means to this end he endeavored to promote commerce by the most liberal encouragement to all concerned in it; and, by a profuse consumption of natural and imported productions, to excite industry and emulation in the lower classes of the people: elegance was to reign in his abode, hospitality to preside at his table, and
<pb n="187 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
pleasure to hover with undeparting wing wherever he appeared. He rebuilt, on an enlarged scale, his family mansion; and, to disseminate his wealth, he employed peasants, in a remote part of his own country, to dig in the bowels of the earth the substance of which the walls were to be composed: ships were ssent into foreign lands to bring home marble spotless as the snow, or variegated in beautiful irregularities: others were dispatched to a more distant region, across an ocean three thousand miles wide, to find the wood most susceptible of polish, while again the mariner plowed the wave into frozen territories in quest of strait spiral trees easy to be fashioned. In the mean time hundreds of persons were busily employed in finding, compounding, kneading, and drying with fire, masses of argillaceous earth, to form the internal walls, and in preparing a durable cement
*for
<pb n="188 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
for them. To encourage honed ingenuity, he ordered some thousand feet of a composition of *mucilated linen and woollen shreds, to be made for the hanging of some of his apartments: others were decorated with tints borrowed from vegetables, minerals, *&ampc. and a few with the finest productions of the imitative arts. To defend this edifice and its inhabitants from the inclemencies of the air, the roof was spread with thin plates of a beautiful blue stone, cut in the nicest symmetry, and fixed each separately to a covering of wood prepared for them. When the orient sun rose in its magnificence, the splendor of this covering could not be steadily gazed on: it appeared, at a distance, like a glassy current reflecting every beam of light.</p>
<p>Nor was Benadami splendid only in the erection of this mansion: the industry of millions of silk-worms was em-
*ployed
<pb n="189 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
ployed in spinning for his curtains, his beds, his chairs, and his garments. The bleating sheep was stripped of his proud fleece to make him carpets and outer vestments: other creatures contributed their down to furnish a repose for his luxurious limbs. The most valuable of all metals was ever at his hand and often decorated his person, brought to him by people who fetched it from the remotest parts of the globe.</p>
<p>His food was transported from lands in opposite quarters of the terraqueous world: the east and west were ransacked for his morning repast, while the lowing herds presented him their milk unasked. To procure him daily supplies of his lead luxurious and most necessary aliment, a rapid stream was fought, and on it erected a machine to a degree of inscrutability complex, in which grain, the product of his own domain, was levigated. Scores of stately beeves.bled
*yearly

yearly for his table, the stag (free heir of the forest) fell extended by the archer's arm to regale his friends: nor were the wild inhabitants of the coppice or thicket spared. Not only the lakes around him were deprived of their *finney tribes, the numerous people of the waters exposed in convulsions on the shore, that he might, by his choice, devote to death, but distant seas were made to render up their natural tenants. To please his palate nature was thwarted and compelled: all the powers of invigorating lenses were applied to give some species of fruit a more exquisite zest; others were carefully tended in the shade, while all the rigor of Nurwegian winter was condensed to mitigate the thirst of *solstitial fervor.</p>
<p>In all things did Benadami manifest a spirit equally and regularly magnificent. The poor were fed and clothed by his luxuries: his friends enjoyed his banquets
*and
<pb n="191 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
and admired his liberality, and he lived long in the supreme felicity of diffusing content, peace, happiness and riches to all around him.</p>
********
<p>Such was Benadami, whom my readers, I dare say, pronounce munificent but luxurious to an extravagant degree; and yet I do not know that he enjoyed one gratification uncommon to English opulence. As to the building, his house, no one will think stone, marble, timber, bricks, and mortar useless superfluities. Some of his rooms he papered, some he painted, and a few had pictures and sculptures in them:--nothing uncommon in all this, nor in his preferring a slated roof to a tiled one. Silk furniture, and part of dress silk, are allowed to moderate wealth, as are carpets and the use of broad cloth. A

He erected a corn-mill and ground his own flower--the only way to be safe against adulteration. He filled his table with beef, venison, game, and fish from the canal and the sea.--Common *hoticultural aid and various treatment procured him fruit; and he had the Italian convenience of an ice-house.--And what extraordinary luxury was there in all this?--or what gentle-

<p>They are such as deceive beyond any thing else:—-a cottage becomes a palace:--the most accustomed exertion of talents or labor is rendered a stupendous atchievement:-—an escape from the slightest danger is exaggerated into marvellous; the common crosses of life into desperate misfortunes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is this to be observed of its powers, that they will magnify to a certain and very extensive degree, but not proportioned to the thing detailed:--thus the detail of an ordinary dwelling-house may represent it in ideal
*VOL I. K grandeur,

grandeur, but that of a regal mansion, a superb ecclesiastical edifice, a fine prospect, *&ampc.shall excite no admiration, and for this reason, that as the conceptions thus raised must be borrowed from something superior, and as we have no ideas without archetypes, when the thing detailed to us is in the. highest degree whatever it is described to be, we can imagine nothing more. No eloquence or ingenuity could convey an idea of St. Peter's at Rome, or of the view from Richmond Hill, which would not be found inadequate to the majesty of the one or the picturesque, beauty of the other: but I could easily deceive a stranger into an opinion that Wanstead House rivalled Versailles, because my hearers (if I succeeded) would borrow all his images from the final palace he could conceive of.-—Hence we see it is only the credit and judgment of the narrator that can induce us to believe a prospect, a building,
*or
<pb n="195 THE PHAROS No. XVIII"/>
or any thing else, finer than what we have yet seen or heard of; we may suppose a junction of particulars, we may borrow ideas, but the human imagination can add nothing new.</p>
<p>That detail should often cause disappointment is easily accounted for. Use and long acquaintance have made our opinions far from natural:--an antediluvian would regard Benadami in detail: he would reflect with astonishment on the labor and exertions necessary to this man's luxurious existence; and with nearly equal wonder would he survey the complex machine that must perpetually revolve to fulain even the loweI order of humanity; but to us, who found the machine let in motion ready to our hand and who feldom look forward to its paufing, it feems only the regular courfc of nature.
