THE SPIRIT OF THE SOUTHLAND

Unveils a Picture Of Morn and Night,
Yet sweeps the lingering mists away!

By Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers, Poet Laureate,
Georgia Division U.D.C.

“Tis Morn, radient Morn!  Upon each hill
There gleams a tint of gold, and in the vale afar
Is heard the merry call of one who keeps
Each wandering lamb from straying o’er the bar.
The ploughman sings a cheer to new born day
And maids light-hearted roam o’er snowy field
Or who at eve should bring the finest yield?

Peace, lovely Peace, rests upon the Plantation Home!
From teeming orchard to the garden gate,
The sun-lit heights of Georgia’s old red hills
Bespeak the calm that dwells upon each State.
King Cotton proudly smiles upon his royal seat,
As autumn fruits their countless joys displayed;
And golden grain breathes life and health complete,
For Heaven’s touch on every scene is laid!

The Light of Holy Love beams o’er the peaceful hearth, for
There was no Bandit then!  No evil soul to roam,
The Master, Mistress, and loved old Mammy knelt,
To thank the Heavenly Father for their blessed Christian Home,
Our own dear land!  Our hallowed Southern Home!
Was there ever on Earth a land surpassing thee?
Where friends dependant (not slaves) who with their lates breath
Despite all war, could true and faithful be?

And was there ever a Christmas Time so glad?
With Banjo, Violin, Dance and Joy that filled 
The heart with happiness pure and unrestrained 
In knowing those whose wealth they help to build?
But list!  Far down yon vale the thundering guns of war
Break up the placid flow of Atlantic wave,
And wildly rush o’er loving peaceful homes
TO cast their blooming roses in the grave! 

‘Tis Night!  Cheerless Night!  No star illumes the way.
Our statesmen wise on terms of peace were sent
But not received.  Far different views prevailed -
Against all Sovereign Rights coercion was intent!
Then the Spirit of 1776 reawakened o’er the hills
And steel alike met steel with American valor anew,
Till “The Stars and Bars” at Manassas brought forth a hopeful light,
And proved to all, the bravery of King’s Mountain still is true!

Through strife was long avoided, yet our homes in ashes laid
Brought in the mystic ruins words emblazed upon the air
Soul cheering to the spirit with a light that cannot fade,
This slogan of the Daughters – Live, Love, Think, Pray, Dare!
The the Holy Spirit guided, and compensation came
When Davis, Lee, and Stonewall add Righteousness to Fame,
And with Heaven’s light inspired still onward marched the Gray
Though their number lessened daily mid the war clouds on the way.

‘Twas the Faith of our Fathers, which gave courage to the true,
And it led by Holy Spirit all of our Southern Soldiers through
Not a hero of the Southland under General Lee’s command
Would rob one of their property, or flash the fire brand!
Then Hail, all Hail, with loving cheer, the memory tonight
Of all who served their country in Justice and in Right,
And may Daughters of Confederacy the gates of love unbar
And lead the Blue and Gray as friends to Heaven’s Crowning Star!
