      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Tis Morn in the Southland.  Upon each hill,</l>
	<l>There gleams a tint of gold, and in the vale afar</l>
	<l>Resounds the merry call of one who keeps</l>
	<l>The wandering lamb from straying o'er snowy field</l>
	<l>To vie with each whose store shall weigh the most,</l>
	<l>Or who at eve shall bring the <hi rend="underline">finest</hi> yield?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Peace, Holy Peace rests o the Plantation Home,</l>
	<l>From teeming Orchard to the Garden Gate,</l>
	<l>The sun-lit heights fo "Georgia's Old Red Hills"</l>
	<l>Bespeak the calm that rests upon each State.</l>
	<l>King Cotton proudly smiles upon his royal seat,</l>
	<l>While Autum fruits their countless joys displayed,</l>
	<l>And golden grain breathes life and health complete</l>
	<l>For Heaven's touch on every spot is laid!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>The Light of Holy Writ beams on the sacred hearth,</l>
	<l>No prowling Bandit there!  No evil soul to roam,</l>
	<l>The Master Mistress, Child and good old Mammy knelt,</l>
	<l>To thank the Lord for peace in a Christian Home.</l>
	<l>Out own dear land!  Our hallowed Southland Home!</l>
	<l>Was there ever another spot like thee?</l>
	<l>Where dependant friends (<hi rend="underline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">slaves</hi>) who with life's last breath,</l>
	<l>Despite the War, could true and faithful be?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>And was there ever a Christmas Time so glad?</l>
	<l>With Banjo, Violin, Song and Dance that filled </l>
	<l>The heart with joy over-flowing and merriment unrestrained</l> 
	<l>In honor of the family whose wealth they helped to build?</l>
	<l>But list to that destructive March o'er Georgia's peaceful soil</l>
	<l>Tramping over human hears they hasten to the grave.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Tis Night!  Darksome Night!  No star illume the way.</l>
	<l>Then Statesmen soon on terms of Peace, three different times were sent</l>
	<l>But not received!  For other views prevailed</l>
	<l>Against all sovereign rights of State Coercion as intent.</l>
	<l>Then, the Spirit of 76 illumined all the South,</l>
	<l>And steel met steel alike with American zeal anew,</l>
	<l>Till "The Stars and Bars" at Manassas brought forth a ray of light,</l>
	<l>And proved to all the spirit which King's Mountain found so true!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>All Battles were unwelcome - but homes in ashes laid</l>
	<l>Brought forth in words immortal emblazed upon the air</l>
	<l>An urge unto the spirit, in light that cannot fade,</l>
	<l>This slogan of the Daughters - "<hi rend="underline">Live</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Love</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Think</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Pray</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Dare</hi>!"</l>
	<l>Then the Holy Spirit guided - and compensation came</l>
	<l>When Davis, Lee, and Stonewall add Righteousness to Fame,</l>
	<l>And 'neath Heaven's Light inspired still forward moved the Gray</l>
	<l>E'en though their number lessened mid storm-clouds all the way.</l>
