                  <p>No movement begun in the interest of human progress can start unmindful of the pioneer work projected and carried on by "the saints and martyrs who are on the eternal side of right." Foremost among these consecrated spirits, and serenest singer of them all stands, and will ever stand, the name of Lucy Stone, and although many months have passed since she whispered this her last message to her followers, "Make the world better," and then rested from her labors, yet to the many tributes already paid must ours be added lest the circle be incomplete. The public life of Lucy Stone begun early as all ardent, consistent and persistent abolitionist, and only after the emancipation of a race was secured did she consecrate herself to the work of freeing her sex from the many legal disabilities under which they rested, serenely indifferent to their humiliating position until some conspicuous case of the miscarriage of justice awoke them to a realizing sense of the helplessness of an unrepresented class, and to a suspicion, that law and equity was not always interpreted to mean the same thing for that class. For her untiring efforts to smooth the rough paths for all women, and for the strength and dignity she lent to their own feeble efforts to make life easier, we would have all women everywhere remember the debt they owe her. To the dismay of her loving, trusting followers she was mustered out of this, into higher service before the full realization of her dream of the complete disenthrallment of woman was realized; yet she lived long enough to see the world moving steadily, if slowly, on to the perfection she demanded of it. Let her fragrant memory be kept alive as a quicking force for all women who feel the responsibility of the part they must play in the coming regeneration of the world.</p>

                     <docAuthor>Helen A. Cook</docAuthor>
                     <docDate>Saturday, March 24, 1894</docDate>
                     <p>The Washington Colored Woman's League was organized in '92. Its officers are Mrs. H.A. Cook, president, Mrs. J.B. Bruce, and S.I. Fleetwood, vice-presidents, Mrs. C.L. Gruinke, recording secretary, Mrs. A.J. Cooper, corresponding secretary, Mrs. F.D. Shaw, treasurer, and the Board of Managers, Mrs. J.P. Bailey and Mrs. C. Terrell, Misses M.J. Patterson, M. L. Jordan, and C.L. Franklin.</p>
                     <p>This League has just issued its first annual report which cannot but prove interesting reading to ALL women. The club has reason to feel proud of its record and it is with pleasure that we make selections from the report by its President.</p>
                     <p>The object of the Woman's League as outlined in the Articles of Incorporation, is "the education and improvement of colored women and the promotion of their interests." It was conceived that this improvement must proceed on two general lines; the training of the mind and of the hand; the formation of classes for educational and for industrial work; and the first essential was a place in which this work might be carried on. It was therefore proposed that a stock company be formed with not less than a thousand shares at five dollars per share. Also, that each member of the League should be requested to take five shares of stock (amounting to twenty-five dollars) only one of which would be paid for each year.</p>
                     <p>This plan has been followed, with the result that 380 shares, equal in value to $1900 have been subscribed for. As only one-fifth of the whole amount is to be paid each year, only one fifth of the $1,900 will be immediately available. To this sum, however, must be added, $35, the price of 7 single shares of stock at $5 each, making $415.</p>
                     <p>But this house, the property of the League especially adapted to its purposes, is still a thing of the future. Until it becomes an actual and substantial possession, the educational and industrial work before referred to must be carried on by some other means. To this end classes, which meet in the parlors of the Y. M. C. A., have been formed in German grammar and reading, in German conversation, in English Literature, and in Hygiene. Though they have assembled only a few times, they have been well attended, the largest class numbering twenty-one. In each one there has been such evidence of interest, even enthusiasm, as to make the meetings a real pleasure to the committee which has the work in hand.</p>
                     <p>A series of three lectures, for the benefit of the girls of the High and Normal Schools and of the Eighth grade schools were offered by the Woman's League to the Trustees of the Public Schools and accepted. The first of the course, on Hygiene, by Dr. Julia R. Hall, and the second on Physical Culture, by Miss Mary P. Evans were delivered on the 12th and 26th of the present month. The third and last paper, on Dress, was read by Miss Elizabeth A. Cook on Friday, February 9th.</p>
                     <p>Another endeavor in the line of mental training is the promised payment of half the salary ($10 per month) of a lady who is to be employed as a Kindergartner by the University Park Association.</p>
                     <p>In the direction of Industrial Work I must first state that the League has two representatives in the Nurses' Training school, recently established in connection with the Medical Department of Howard University, that is to say, the League has paid the tuition fee of five dollars each. When the idea was first presented of including in our industrial efforts so admirable a feature as the instruction of trained nurses, the lectures at the Medical School had been in progress for some weeks and it was necessary for us to take our representatives from the classes already formed.</p>
                     <p>The Industrial Association formed in 1884, nearly all of whose members were also members of the League, decided in June, to continue their work as a committee of the Woman's League. They accordingly gave up their separate organization, turning into the treasury of the League, $50 in money, and furniture valued at $35, with the stipulation that they might at any time give public entertainments or make any special effort to raise money for carrying on their special work.</p>
                     <p>They are now engaged in a sewing school consisting of 88 pupils and 10 teachers. The directress is it lady whose knowledge and experience enable her to pursue the best methods of instruction. The Industrial Committee have also established in connection with the Sewing School a Mending Bureau by which they hope to accomplish several objects--to train the older girls in all kinds of repairing and mending, to keep up their interest by paying them a small sum for their work and to so manage the enterprise that after all expenses are paid, there will still be something left to provide material for the use of the school.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Woman's League now has in progress:</p>
                     <p>The purchase of a house and lot toward which $1,935 have been subscribed;</p>
                     <p>A course of lectures delivered at the High School and at Howard University;</p>
                     <p>Classes in German, English Literature and Hygiene;</p>
                     <p>The instruction of two students in the Nurses Training School;</p>
                     <p>A Sewing School and Mending Bureau;</p>
                     <p>The payment of half the salary of a Kindergartner.</p>
                     <p>May January 1895 find at far higher degree of advancement on all these lines and new avenues of usefulness opening in other directions.</p>

                     <head rend="aligncenter">WOMEN'S LEAGUE.</head>
                     <p>The Kansas City League was organized in February, '93. The constitution adopted was that drawn up by the Washington Association, although a few by-laws were added to meet the special needs of our case, as from the first we intended to make our work largely industrial in character, since in a young and rapidly growing city like our own constantly receiving an influx of various nationalities it is exceedingly necessary that the industrial avenues shall be open to our young people.</p>
                     <p>The next step, in order to inspire confidence, gain permanence and be ready for the transaction of business was to become incorporated under the laws of Missouri. This was accomplished through the legal efforts of our friend, Lawyer Sublette. Committees were appointed for various departments of the work. About the first of April one room was rented and classes in fine needle work and in the English
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
branches were formed, the latter class consisted of old ladies over fifty years of age, yet in spite of their years and other difficulties they learned to write their names to read etc., by spending a portion of each Saturday afternoon with their teachers.</p>
                     <p>By the first of May the league was financially able to move into larger quarters, four rooms were rented in a very pleasant, respectable quarter and tastily furnished through the co-operation of the league and the Attucks Club, the latter composed of gentlemen who represent the moral and intellectual bone and sinew of our city.</p>
                     <p>During the month of May a dress-making department was added to the regular work of the league and it has been in operation ever since. We hope to add millinery, hairdressing and other industries as soon as practical. For the dressmaking department we purchased two sewing machines; aside from regular dressmaking we buy from the wholesale stores bails of gingham, white goods etc., to be made up into aprons, dresses, skirts waists, etc., by members, and these articles are sold at regular prices. By buying a little better grade of material than is usually given in the stores we create a demand for goods. During the summer months the ladies made the rent money, payments upon the machines, and other expenses in this manner and by selling ice cream and cake at the rooms.</p>
                     <p>At stated times during the winter months coffee, sandwiches and oysters will be sold and at intervals entertainments will be given. We desire as soon as possible to buy a piece of property and conduct a regular industrial school, ladies exchange, and other matters we have in mind. It will require at least five hundred dollars cash to make even a beginning of purchasing and when we found that it would require some time to raise this amount among ourselves and that meanwhile we would in practise be as far from saving our girls as ever, we determined to make a beginning in rented property and if possible by results impress the public with the idea that such an association as ours was a necessity to the city.</p>
                     <p>We are especially anxious to better the condition of women and girls, yet the first charitable work done by the league, and at its second meeting, was to collect money from the members to assist in sending an invalid boy to his home in the South.</p>
                     <p>A colored woman was sentenced to be hung in Kansas City in June '93; having made a very thorough investigation of the entire case we were fully persuaded that Justice to the woman and above all to the womanhood of our race demanded that the sentence should at least be commuted to life imprisonment. We drew up and circulated a petition to this effect which was signed by a large number of the most prominent men and women of both races; from these parties nearly one hundred dollars was collected to defray the expense attending such an effort. The petition was taken to the Governor of the state by a worthy representative from the U. T. C. N. and the president of our league with the result that the <sic corr="sentence">sentenct</sic> was commuted to a term of fifty years, although the death had already been set over the unfortunate woman.</p>
                     <p>Several girls who have found themselves friendless and alone in our city have been provided for in our rooms until they could obtain employment. An orphan thought the agency of our society sent to a good home out of the city.</p>
                     <p>Notice was brought to us of a blind woman whose little girls were in need of clothing. They were fitted out with gingham dresses and we intend to see that they are properly clothed for school during the winter and as much longer as is necessary.</p>
                     <p>These are a few of the things accomplished thus far. We are very far from the results we wish so earnestly to bring ,about but we hope that to some extent we occupy a niche in the community. In addition to the regular meetings we have a Junior Society composed of young girls from fourteen years on through the average school age. This forms an auxiliary to the regular league and meets monthly. A mother's meeting also forms a part of the work, at which time, practical talks upon the rearing of children, housekeeping, homemaking etc., form the basis.</p>

                     <head rend="aligncenter">WOMEN'S LOYAL UNION.</head>
                     <p>After the organization of the Women's Loyal Union, the idea of forming clubs among women began to grow in the minds of the women in other sections. Not least among them were the Women of New Bedford. Mrs. J. T. Fairfax and Mrs. Martha Webb were among those most zealous that Miss Wells should be heard in our city. They secured one hundred women to agree to labor earnestly and give Miss Wells an opportunity to lay her wrongs and those of our race before the people here. Miss Wells lectured in this city on the sixth of February and for that night's work those one hundred women pledged themselves to make what was then the Wells Circle a permanent organization. About April the Wells Circle became an established club with a membership of about twenty. Matters pertaining to our race in any way were discussed at each monthly meeting. Finally it was thought best to engage in more active work, and in July the name was changed to the Woman's Loyal Union. It was at the July meeting that each member agreed to bring as many names as she could secure toward forming a committee of one hundred or more who would pledge themselves to trade with the dry goods dealer employing a colored girl. Three or four important stores were visited. The result seemed then rather encouraging. One proprietor refused to do anything whatsoever for a colored girl, the second would give no direct answer either way but said if he had a place for an inexperienced girl, he would employ a colored girl. The third promised, after three days consideration, to employ a colored girl as soon as a place was found. That was three months ago, and yet new faces appear behind the counters of these stores. Since that time (last November), the monthly meetings have been poorly-attended, and all interest seems to have become dormant, except in the minds of eight or ten women. It is sincerely hoped that something can be done soon to arouse our women to the need of their measuring arms with the women of other sister cities.</p>

                     <head rend="aligncenter">THE WOMAN'S ERA CLUB.</head>
                     <p rend="bold">Club Motto-"Help to make the world better."</p>
                     <p>To give the general public an idea of the aim and design of this club an account of its public meeting held last Spring has been inserted. This excellent report was published by the Boston Reflector and we feel sure that it will prove interesting reading to sister clubs already formed and in embryo; remarks from so many notable club women will be read with interest, we have no doubt.</p>
                     <p>Since this meeting, the club has grown to a membership of one hundred and four and has greatly enlarged its field of work. The chief feature of the club is its division into committees. These committees are formed to include every member of the club and are as follows--Ways and Means--matters pertaining to race, Domestic Science, Civics Literature, Philanthropy, Temperance, Current Events, Moral Reform, Press and Corative.</p>
                     <p>Every other meeting of the club is in the hands of some one of these committees, which provide suitable subjects for discussion.</p>
                     <p>As will he seen, the work of the club generally is chiefly educational, though each committee carries on practical work along its own line, with or without the active co-operation of the club. The Ways and Means Committee with the assistance of the whole club has just raised a scholarship for Atlanta University and the Domestic Science Committee has under consideration the agitation of more industrial training in certain of the public schools. The Committee on Civics is also preparing for a large meeting for the discussion of the civilization of Africa.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Josephine Ruffin presided, and in a few well chosen words introduced Mrs. LAURA ORMISTON CHANT of England. She assured the audience that if there is not a soul at the back of service one becomes a mere machine to one's children. Clubs make women read and think in order that they may not sit like idiots when some bright paper is being read.</p>
                     <p>A great deal of the advice given to women about their staying at home, she said, is wrong altogether, for if a woman stays at home too much she will forget how to manage that home. At the club she will get new ideas from other women of how to live and manage her home, and great help in training her children, and to gain experience in various domestic trials. Women's clubs are educators of mothers and women who have not homes.</p>
                     <p>Not all women are intended for mothers. Some of us have not the temperament for family life. 'Tis a parody on love to try to love those near you.</p>
                     <p>Clubs will make women think seriously of their future lives, and not make girls think their only alternative is to marry. Clubs are great playgrounds for losing worry. A club teaches women to forget little cares and learn to discuss great things. Mutual admiration societies are better than scandal.</p>
                     <p>MRS. FLORIDA RIDLEY, secretary of the club, read the following report:
<lb/>
The idea of a Woman's Club, not necessarily a colored woman's club, but a club started and led by colored women had been dormant in the minds of a few women of Boston for some time. Of women's clubs there seem to be no end, and the field for women's work in this direction so completely covered as to leave little room for a new struggler. And yet with so many organizations, many of which were willing and anxious to receive colored women as members, there seem to be reason and indeed an earnest call for an organization of colored women. There are so many questions which in their application to the race, demand special treatment, so many questions which, as colored women, we are called upon to answer, more than this, there was so much danger that numbers of women would be over-looked unless some special appeal was made to them, that in February last, at the time Miss Wells was creating so much interest in her crusade against lynch-law, it was it a good time to carry out the club's idea, call the women together and organize, not for race-work alone, but for work along all the lines that make for women's progress. The result was that a club was formed with a membership of twenty, which has been more than doubled since that-time.</p>
                     <p>The actual work done by the club since its formation is small but most promising. Much of the time has been spent in getting into working order and in arousing interest. One practical effort, put forth by the club, however, has met with unexpected success. At the time of the Denmark lynching, it was thought and decided that we as colored women could not afford to overlook an event of such significance, we concluded to record a protest which should demand a little more attention than the usual form of resolutions, the result was that the leaflets were printed and sent in every direction. The responses that they have brought forth have been unexpectedly numerous and encouraging. More than one person has acknowledged that these leaflets have aroused them to a consideration of the subject, and more than one person of influence has announced their intention of doing something towards awakening public sentiment. Large demands for the leaflets have, been made, two hundred being called for at one time and a postal note being received from St. Louis calling for as many as could be spared.</p>
                     <p>This reception of the leaflets has revealed to the club a line of work which has been little used and which the club can incorporate with its other work with advantage. This is the publication and circulation of matter that refers especially to the race, not alone, but also such matter as shall be for the advancement and encouragement of the race, and to quote from our constitution "to collect all facts obtainable, showing the moral, intellectual, industrial and social growth, and attainment of our-people."</p>
                     <p>To this end the club has under c<gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/>tion the publication of the answer, <gap reason="tape repair"/>Ingalls on the Negro question by M<gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/> Deitrict and the stand taken by <gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/>College and Massachusetts legislature<gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/> Lewis affair. The receipt of leaflets<gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/>subjects such as the above among the <gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/> people generally South and West cou<gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/> but be a welcome and hope-<sic corr="inspiring">ispiring</sic> feature. "Another line of work of the club is the discussion of current topics. It is not our desire to narrow ourselves to race work, however necessary it is that such work should be done and particularly by colored women. It cannot but be admitted that we, as a race, have too frequently limited ourselves to this field with the result of contracting our vision, enfeebling our <sic corr="impulses">impluses</sic> and weakening our powers. We the women of the WOMEN'S ERA CLUB enter the field to work hand in hand with women, generally for humanity and humanity's interests, not the Negro alone but the Chinese, the Hawaiian. the Russian Jew, the oppressed everywhere as subjects for our consideration, not the needs of the colored women, but woman everywhere are our interest.</p>
                     <p>The club now numbers forty-five, it is hoped to make it three times as large and to that end we invite all eligible women, black or white who are in sympathy with our cause to unite with us.</p>
                     <p>MRS. LUCY STONE BLACKWELL spoke of the afternoon devoted to colored people, by one of the congresses at the Chicago Fair. At the congress she saw Mrs. Harper of Philadelphia, and another colored lady. It was grand to hear Mrs. Harper address that body of representatives from all parts of the world. Hon. Fred Douglass was there, and was asked to address the meeting.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Blackwell pathetically described how the venerable gentleman was <sic corr="choked">chocked</sic> with emotion to
<pb n="5 WOMAN'S ERA."/>
see that he lived to witness the day when one of his sisters could address such an august body. Mrs. Blackwell cursorily viewed the life of Hon. Fred Douglass, and said that he was a pattern.</p>
                     <p>MRS. EDNA D CHENEY, next spoke. She said she would speak especially to the ladies of the Women's Era Club.</p>
                     <p>The New England Club asked her to bring their congratulations to the members of the Women's Era Club. Mrs. Cheney thought before coming, that it would be well to bring a few ideas as to the lines which the club should follow, but having heard the report from the secretary of the Women's Era Club she thought that they could teach her in the art of managing clubs.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Cheney also complimented the new club on the broad stand which it takes, stating, that it was the way to secure union. She referred to the elm tree, how it grew until its branches finally formed an arch, a great touch of the Cathedral. Mrs. Cheney was especially pleased to find that the club set no barrier. We are to have a great composite civilization in America.</p>
                     <p>At the formation of many new clubs which Mrs. Cheney attended she was asked whether it would be right to leave politics and religion out. She replied emphatically no. It is there they are to learn and discuss such questions broadly, and they ought to find no better subjects to help them. It is such thought that is absolutely necessary, and puts one in nigh estimation, and enables one to cope with the questions of the day. Charles Sumner was able to do what he did by long training.</p>
                     <p>MRS. ABBY MORTON DIAZ ex-president of the Woman's Industrial and Educational Union, was the next lady who addressed the meeting. Mrs. Diaz spoke on the philosophy of life. She said there is no subject of more importance to the human being than the subject of humanity. The highest question of human beings is the object of humanity. It is customary with calculators to determine life by the amount of work done for the <sic corr="sustenance">sustainance</sic> of the body. But this was only animal. To enjoy thought in its highest <sic corr="ranges?">anges</sic>, music, art or any such <sic corr="thing">hing</sic> is the highest of life. Mrs. Diaz holds that men's clubs should be on such basis; thought is the ideal.</p>
                     <p>Go to these gatherings, and one will be able to get practical knowledge. She showed that in everything the feminine and masculine made the whole sphere. One without the other was incomplete. So to make the whole element was to join the two. Then people coming together is religion. The more we do this, the more religious we are. This is why Mrs. Diaz is in favor of this new club. Thought is the great leveller. When we get on the plain of intelligence, we are better together.</p>
                     <p>MRS. A. H. SPAULDING, who was the next speaker was thoroughly in sympathy with the WOMEN'S ERA CLUB. Many years ago it was with great difficulty that she could join a club. The influence that was exercised over men in their clubs was anything but what it should be; and drawing conclusions of clubs from these, she objected to them. But Mrs. Spaulding found out that women's clubs took a different line. The WOMAN'S ERA CLUB is a happy arrangement, and what they need is the consideration of great questions together. Women must learn to think independently.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Spaulding said that she was glad to welcome the club into Boston club-life; glad to hear from the secretary's report such a broad and generous platform of principles. She said that she was thoroughly indignant at the injustice done a people whose only revenge was efforts to a higher education and a better equipment for the duties and responsibilities of a higher American citizenship.</p>

                     <p>The Primrose Club consists of young women associated together under the auspices of St. Augustine's Church, Phillips street, Boston, for mutual improvement. There are at present twenty members, and classes are held for physical culture, embroidery, drawing and sketching in water colors. The teachers in each department are ladies of the greatest skill, and the club has been found to be of great service to the members. Occasional social entertaiments are given by the members in the Hall of St. Augustine's Trade Schools, where the meetings will be held in future.</p>

                     <p>On November the 5tb, 1845, a number of women formed an association for the benefit of each other. It was officered and controlled entirely by women, and emblazoned on its banner were these words: "No Gentlemen Need Apply.</p>
                     <p>The organization is carried on to-day by some of descendents of those independent women, who have long since joined the silent majority. The society is known as The United Daughters of Zion.</p>

                     <p>The Golden Rule Club is an organization composed entirely of colored women, and was organized for social and benevolent purposes in the year 1883. As an organization we believe in a modest way we have been the means of accomplishing some good. We held. monthly meetings at the residence of one of the members to transact our business.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Henry Lewis was the first president, and under her able administration the club gained in membership and finances. During the eleven years that have passed there have been some changes in the club, but the majority of the original members are still working faithfully.</p>
                     <p>The club has a strong, firm footing in Cambridge and the members intend to keep it and to live up to their motto, "The "Golden Rule."</p>

                  <p>As the homes are so will the nation be, for the nation is nothing more than a collection of what is produced in the homes. The as it is oftener called, domestic science, is thus the very key-stone of the political arch. A civilized home may be fitly compared to a greenhouse in which are to be grown the choicest products of the people and over whose management the mother<gap reason="tape repair" extent="24"/> chief g<gap reason="tape repair" extent="24"/>ducts<gap reason="tape repair" extent="24"/>be ignorant, indifferent, or incompetent in the performance of her duties. So broad is the knowledge, so varied the skill, so incessant the performances demanded of her by her office that any woman might well tremble before her responsibilities. She must not only know how to keep her own health but how to foster and preserve the health of others, and this means that she must understand what is most wholesome to eat and drink and how food and beverage may be made most appetizing. Health for the whole household also demands that the housekeeper shall know the evil effects of dust-catching carpets, draperies, and stuffed furniture in small, crowded city apartments, as the comfort of the whole household likewise depends on her not filling the dwelling with more than can be easily cared for and kept in exquisite cleanliness. She must understand what constitutes the best bedding from the standpoint of durability, comfort and healthfulness, for as a third of every human life is spent in sleep, the sleeping-place is a matter deserving profound consideration. She must understand something of plumbing, of drainage, of heating, lighting and ventilation, for the germs of fevers and diphtheria lurk in bad plumbing and bad drainage, catarrhs and consumption are born of over-heated ill-lighted, and unventilated houses and all bodily and mental weaknesses may be traced to ignorance of the science of sound living. But not yet have we come to the end of the list of the good housewife's requirements. She must comprehend not only what food should be eaten in order to have the best nourishment at the least expense, but how to buy it, and how to cook it, for she may impoverish her family by ignorant purchasing, and even should she not have to cook it herself, she can never be sure of having food well-cooked unless she herself understands what good cooking is according to scientific principles. And she must also know everything possible to know about kitchen fuel, unless<gap reason="tape repair" extent="14"/>the family earning<gap reason="tape repair" extent="104"/>in buying every article that comes into the household, that by her wise investments she shall save time that would otherwise be wasted in constant shopping, save time in making garments of durable, instead of flimsy, perishable material, and save money in buying what is really good and lasting of its kind instead of what only makes a good show for a brief season. But though the housewife starts out on her career equipped with all knowledge as to fuel, food, drink, furnishings, clothing, drainage, plumbing, heating, lighting, and ventilation, not even yet has she learned the full course requisite for wise home-making. All this is but a preparation of the soil for the plants that are to be grown in one of the nation's private gardens. The wisdom needed to tend the plants themselves--the little children, who arc to be reared not only in health, knowledge, and industry, but in happiness (for happiness in a home is as essential as any other good feature), what preparation can too well fit a mother for this branch of domestic science? The mother thoroughly trained in domestic science will have learned all that the experience of other parents has collected and recorded in those cyclopaedias of childhood known as Babyhood, the Mothers' Nursery Guide, and so on, edited by wise teachers and physicians, she will have carefully studied the principles of kindergarten culture. She will steer safely between the dangers of over-indulgence on the one hand and over-severity on the other, and until each little human plant has gained a firm start in life, a wise domestic scientist will make its welfare her highest consideration.</p>
                  <p>Now it must be apparent to a reflecting person that she is a rare woman, and rarely situated in life, who can even faithfully superintend, much less herself perform, as they should be performed, all that I have here sketched as the duties of a wife, mother and housekeeper in our modern civilization.</p>
                  <p>In our modern <gap reason="tape repair" extent="100"/> Does the <gap reason="tape repair" extent="8"/> with an independent inc<gap reason="tape repair" extent="8"/> few or no children, and <gap reason="tape repair" extent="9"/> or many servants, live, d<gap reason="tape repair" extent="9"/> and have her being thus<gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/> without considering all the cost of imitation at once the woman with no fixed income, with many children and with no servants, strives to rival the other's expenditure. O! the folly of the things bought, not because they are at all needed, or really for themselves wanted, but bought simply because Mrs. so-and-so has them. O! the misery of debts contracted, of money wasted simply and solely for the sake of doing what other people do.</p>
                  <p>The first result of a true training in domestic science is the gaining of courage to be one's own self, to live one's own life, to model one's own home in blissful independence of the rule of that social tyrant, Mrs. Grundy, the courage to have one's floors bare and serviceably painted, if one cannot afford a carpet in the first place, or the still greater expense of having a carpet properly and frequently renovated thereafter. The courage to have sleeping-rooms and kitchen well and comfortably furnished and equipped, even if the parlor has to wait long for any furniture whatever. Here the domestic scientist is strong. Honest comfort and health she will have first, luxury, if it come at all must wait her perfect convenience. The domestic scientist will begin her career by determining to sometime own her own home: for this she will plan, manage, and save, here a little, and there a little until her dream becomes a reality. National solmity demands ownership of <sic corr="individ-">indivi-</sic>

ual homes. Life under another man's roof is unstable, whether it be in a West End tenement or in a gaudy apartment on the Back Bay. There is no greater joy in material possession than the joy of the home built as a result of one's own saving and planning.</p>
                  <p>But while so large a part of the population have to live close together in apartments, high and low, a great field lies before the domestic <gap reason="tape repair"/>avor <gap reason="tape repair" extent="30"/> this <gap reason="tape repair" extent="30"/> good I believe to be some form of cooperation, by which a dozen housewives living under the same roof may be spared the necessity of carrying on, separately, the same branch of labor. It may not be practicable to have one stove do the work which it could do just as well as the dozen separate stoves, to have one cook with one or two; assistants, do the work which she could do just as well as twelve separate cooks; for there would be great difficulty in suiting the tastes of twelve families and in serving the food hot in twelve separate dining-rooms, and without a separate dining-room for each family the best feature of home-life is gone. But I do not see why it is not perfectly practicable among any group of friends in a neighborhood to have the laundry-work in co-operation. There are many ways in which this might be done, but when it is remembered that one fire will heat as many irons as three separate fires, that two women working together can do nearly three times the work of one woman working separately, everyone must see the actual saving in expense, to say nothing of comfort, in even the simplest method of consolidation. Men long ago learned that better work was done by division of labor. This lesson housewives will be forced to learn if they do not want to sink beneath a mountain of toil and trouble and become mere stolid, patient drudges. It is a law of nature that there is a corresponding loss for every gain, and the gain in mental culture to the inhabitants of cities has been attended by a loss in physical strength. The complexity of city life, with its incessant drain upon the mental faculties and the sympathies, render it more and more impossible each year, for the average housewife to keep in touch even with her acquaintances, to say nothing of charities, clubs and church-work, and at the same time comfortably bear the burden of domestic life as her ancestors bore it under more primitive conditions. Wisdom dictates that women, as well as men, should make machinery do such hard drudgery as that of the laundry. The woman's club that would seize this idea and put it into practical operation would, indeed, open a new Woman's Era. As we look around us at the waste, discomfort, even misery, arising from the ignorance which prevails over the great mass of so-called homes, it is hard to think of waiting patiently, as we must wait, while the slow, <sic corr="leaven">leven</sic> of growing knowledge raises this mass to better living.</p>

                  <byline>ELLEN BATTELLE DEITRICK.</byline>
                  <p>The account of the first public meeting of the Woman's Era Club is lengthy, but will repay reading.</p>
                  <p>It is pleasant to record a number of subscriptions on the strength of the prospectus alone. May the subscribers never have reason to regret their actions. The WOMAN'S ERA hopes to succeed on its merits.</p>
                  <p>The last public speech made by Lucy Stone in Boston was given to the Woman's Era Club. The night of the meeting was an intensely hot one and Mrs. Stone's strength was then on the wane but she cheerfully left her home on the breezy heights of Pope's Hill, and came down into the hot, dusty city, to give almost her last, as were her first public services given, in the interests of the colored people.</p>
                  <p>The article on Domestic Science which appears in this number of the WOMAN'S ERA was read before the Woman's Era Club in January and led to an interesting discussion. Mrs. Dietrick is a prolific writer and an authority on the subject of household economics. It is not too much to say that the great interest in household matters which is shown by the women of to-day, was aroused by the Women's clubs which were the first to consider the subject scientifically.</p>
                  <p>The next number of the WOMAN'S ERA will contain an article on the N. E. Women's Hospital by Mrs. Eduah D. Cheney. Colored women have always been in evidence at this hospital, either as nurses or internes, and it is to the keen foresight and generous cosmopolitanism of Mrs. Cheney, who as one of the founders of the hospital insisted upon no race lines, that we owe the opening up of this trained industry to the <sic corr="colored">coloaed</sic> young women.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. W. E. Matthews (Victoria Earle) the talented president of the Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn, writes as follows: "I should be glad to have our Union represented in your forthcoming issue. I think with you that it (the paper,) is a positive necessity--for as the trend is toward organization among our women as among others, it will truly serve not only as a centralization of ideas, but will stimulate and encourage and revive the hopes of those now earnestly engrossed in the work of organization of women generally. I sincerely rejoice in any effort put forward for the advancement of our women. Such endorsement from such a source means much to us.</p>
                  <p>THE REFERENDUM.--much misunderstanding exists concerning the recent Supreme Court decision on the matter of the "referendum." Evidently it is thought by many that the decision deals a death blow to woman suffrage in this State. This is not so. The court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of three points, raised by the opponents of Woman suffrage in the Massachusetts legislature, and decided that all three forms of referendum were unconstitutional, and could not therefore be submitted to a popular vote. The matter stands now just where it did before, in the hands of the legislature, which has ample power to immediately pass a law giving full municipal suffrage to women.</p>
                  <p>It would take a paper twice the size of the WOMEN'S ERA to accommodate the matter that has come in for this issue. The publishers have been more than gratified by the hearty and ready response of our women, it is indeed gratifying to come into communion with so many fair-minded women. Should the paper receive proportionate financial encouragement the publishers will be only too ready and willing to enlarge it.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>A Congress of the colored women's leagues and clubs of the Country was suggested long ago should we not be moving in the matter now? Such a convention could not but prove a delightful as well as profitable occasion; the Washington Women's League by virtue of its superior age, size and power should be the first to move in the matter.</p>

                     <p>Of the makers of papers there be not a few, and an additional one may seem a superfluity unless a vacant spot is found in an apparently already overgrown field.</p>
                     <p>Such a void, we think, exists, and it is to help fill it that we presume to make our first bow as editors of THE WOMAN'S ERA, to a long suffering but indulgent public. The need of such a journal has long been felt as a medium of intercourse and sympathy between the women of all races and conditions; especially true is this, of the educated and refined, among the colored women, members of which class may be found in every state from Maine to Florida, but in nearly all of these places an important factor, and one that receives little or no recognition, and the one more than all others which prevents her from making the most of herself and taking her <sic corr="legitimate">legitamate</sic> place among the advanced women, is the limitation of - her surroundings and the circumscribed sphere in which she must move. The impossibility of mingling freely with people of culture and learning, and so carrying on the mental growth begun in schools and colleges, shuts her in with her books but shuts her out of physical touch with the great world of art, science and letters which is open to all other ambitious women. In fact the stumbling block in the way of even the most cultured colored woman is the narrowness of her environment. But let the fact be emph<gap reason="tape repair" extent="5"/>that in the<gap reason="tape repair" extent="100"/> a large and growing factor in the intellectual as well as industrial life of the country; and the strength of the chain of woman's advancement will be determined by the strength of this weak link. <sic corr="It">it</sic> is to help strengthen this link by hastening on the day when a keener appreciation of the hindrances of this class and a better understanding between all classes shall exist that this little venture is sent out on its mission.</p>

                     <docDate>Saturday, March 24, 1894</docDate>
                     <p>The presence in our cities of armies of unemployed, has opened the eyes of people to a serious problem and a possible danger. During the winter months many industries are always quiet and there are always many out of employment at such times, but the season that has passed has seen more than the usual number out of work for a longer time than usual; although appeals for aid have been generously met by the charitable, yet it takes more than money for such a crisis and just how such a crisis should be met or averted .)r prevented is and will be a subject for serious consideration.</p>
                     <p>Although the problem of the unemployed is occupying the minds of earnest thinkers, yet it like the "Negro problem" seems to many laymen no problem at all. They both seem to be cases when a "judicious letting alone" would prove the solution, and which, if left to natural laws, would adjust themselves. Only give the negro an equal chance and then leave him alone to improve it, and he will come out all right. Stop coddling and make work for the unemployed and they would soon <gap reason="tape repair" extent="4"/> places for themselves. It is <gap reason="tape repair" extent="29"/>his that men should <gap reason="tape repair" extent="19"/>otherhood <gap reason="tape repair" extent="7"/> their <gap reason="tape repair" extent="19"/> does mean t<gap reason="tape repair" extent="14"/> much false sentiment and <gap reason="tape repair" extent="5"/> charity chiefly called out by a love of notoriety.</p>
                     <p>Although there have been thousands of men and women dependent upon charity this winter, yet it is a fact that it has been just as difficult as ever to obtain farm and domestic help. Good farms everywhere are still being deserted because the men who should be tilling the soil are crowding into trades and factories that are already overflowing, and young housekeepers are still losing health and spirit because girls who would find good homes and wages in domestic service prefer to crowd shops and factories.</p>
                     <p>But, some say, since this is the case what can be done about it, we can't make people do what they don't want to and we can't see them starve? No we can't, but we need not encourage people to do the things it would be best for them not to do, oftentimes many of the women who are urged to work in the interests of working-girls' homes and rests and clubs, etc., are women who themselves would gladly offer in their own homes a refuge for good girls and who are worn to death trying to do the work they are willing to pay to have done, and working in the interests of those who should not need to be worked for.</p>
                     <p>Labor problems, in a large measure must be left to adjust themselves "creating work" for
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the unemployed can do no permanent good. Let the people understand the law of supply and demand be made to realize the hopelessness of any chance of prosperity in those trades which are already too full. Such education would be of much more value to them both morally and financially than any possible system of "aids."</p>
                     <p>There are cases of more than one factory girl out of work who when asked to go to service have replied that they "would starve before they became servants." There must be something wrong when such a situation is possible and if from the present distress men who should be working the earth and women who should be working in the house are led back to their proper field and are made to realize that the dignity of labor lies with the laborer entirely, the winter's suffering will not be in vain.</p>

                     <p>None but fools seriously believe that the colored people of the United States can be colonized without their consent. Their deportation would bankrupt the government. It would require one steamer carrying a thousand souls to sail every day to deport the thousand negro babies born daily. It would simply be impossible to convert the property of the colored people, amounting in round numbers to three hundred million dollars earned by them and one seventh of all the property of the government amounting to many millions more into cash, for of course any scheme of colonization which could hope to get the consent of the civilized world would have to secure to the people removed from the country their property. What kind of a commission, composed of what kind of men can be appointed by the ingenuity of human beings wise enough to determine where Ham leaves off and Japhet begins? Who is to say what men are colored and what men are white? The colored people decline to be driven from their homes and their country. Will some sage point out the part of the constitution wherein is found the law authorizing a government to deport one seventh of the people, the citizens, the makers and owners of the government? There is some authority for apprehending and exporting or punishing the blatant demagogues political or clerical, native or alien who go about the country preaching such stuff which tends to stir up the people and lead to internal dissension and sooner or later to strife and bloodshed. It is a physical and legal impossibility to deport the colored people. It is not impossible to keep out of the country the rifraff of other countries who owe no allegiance to man or God, who are opposed to any government that compels them to work for a living and to observe and not encroach upon the rights of other men. The audacity of foreigners who flee their native land and seek refuge here, many of them criminals and traitors, who are here but a day before they join in the hue and cry against the native born citizens of this land is becoming intolerable. No government upon earth would permit it but the United States, and all the signs of the times point to a time not far off where self defence and self protection will force this government to protect its own people and to teach foreigners that this land is for Americans black or white and that other men are welcome and can come here only by behaving themselves and steering clear of plots and schemes against the people and the citizens who are here by right.</p>

                  <p>A fact greatly to be deplored is the ignorance among women of contemporary history and government. Ignorance of the past may be overlooked; but ignorance of the present is inexcusable, a]though contemporary history cannot be fully understood unless there is a knowledge of the past. This lack of knowledge among women i<gap reason="tape repair" extent="24"/> read the <gap reason="tape repair" extent="24"/>,/gap&#x003E; do not read <gap reason="tape repair" extent="19"/> The average woman is content to read the sensational news, the fashion and the society columns, and pass over the more solid matter as uninteresting. The daily papers give a synopsis of the history of the world for the past twenty-four hours, and, if read understandingly, presents situations as startling and dramatic as are enacted on the stage at any time. It is not only necessary to know what to read, but it is also necessary to know what not to read. It is <sic corr="indicative">indicatative</sic> of a certain want of refinement in the mind that selects the murders, scandals divorces and such matter, to the exclusion of the larger things of life. The great attraction of French women lies in the fact that they take interest in the things in which men are interested, and keep themselves thoroughly in touch with the affairs of <sic corr="government">goveinment</sic>.</p>
                  <p>There is one room in the Boston Public Library of which very few women seem to be aware, or perhaps, wrongly suppose that it is reserved for the exclusive use of men, <corr sic="since it is resorted to almost en-"/>since it is resorted to almost entirely by the sterner sex. This is the Magazine Room at the right of the Lower Hall. Women share equally in the privileges of this room, and a table is reserved for the use of women only, by way of encouragement. It is hoped that more of our women will find how restfull it is to spend a half-hour in the Magazine Room after a shopping trip down town.</p>
                  <p>An event worthy of special attention is the publication, in one volume of the entire poetical works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This is the Cambridge Edition. The workmanship of the volume is beyond criticism; the type is large and clear, and the cover i<gap reason="tape repair" extent="8"/>ful in color and design. <gap reason="tape repair" extent="24"/> the<gap reason="tape repair" extent="30"/> n-<gap reason="tape repair" extent="30"/>g- fellow's work, and co<gap reason="tape repair" extent="6"/> a biographical sketch by the editor, Mr. Horace E. Scudder. A thorough knowledge of Longfellow's verse is part of the education of every American, and the publication of his complete poetical works in one volume is a most practical effort in the popularization of the best literature.</p>
                  <p>Harper's Magazine for March contains an interesting contribution entitled "The New England Negro," by Miss Jane DeForest Shelton. It treats of the time when slaves were owned extensively <sic corr="throughout">thoughout</sic> Massachusetts and Connecticut, and the period immediately following their emancipation.</p>
                  <p>Harper's also contains an article by Dr. T. Mitchell Prudden on "Tuberculosis and its Prevention." He makes some startling assertions in regard to the hereditary and contagious characteristics of consumption. His article will be found interesting to all who have reason to dread this disease.</p>
                  <p>Many households in which there are no children, and in which, consequently, no child's publication is taken, deprive themselves of much valuable and interesting reading matter. It is surprising how much useful information is contained in these presumably children's <sic corr="periodicals">perodicalsa</sic>. For instance, even if one has outgrown the stories of the Youth's Companion, one can never be too old to enjoy the historical sketches, or the articles on the aspects and customs of other countries. The articles on the politics of the day are written in such a clear and concise style, that they are preferable to the reading of many newspapers. And the health article is worth <gap reason="tape repair" extent="15"/>ice of the paper. <gap reason="tape repair" extent="60"/> Mr. Howells, now current in the Cosmopolitan, the same disgust at some of our institutions and customs, is  experienced that is felt after reading Bellamy's Looking Backward." It is a good thing to see ourselves as others see us" once in a while, even if it is in imagination only.</p>
                  <p>MacMillan &#x0026; Co. have recently published a new book by Mrs. Humphrey Ward, entitled "Marcella." If it contains the same strong delineation of character as does "Robert Elsmere," and "The History of David Grieve," we predict for it great popularity. Of Mrs. Ward's books, "David Grieve" has had the largest sale.</p>
                  <p>Dictionaries small enough to be attached to the watch-chain are now being sold. They are enclosed in little silver cases, and are said to contain all the words in common use. This is multum in parvo indeed!</p>
                  <p>"Negro Stars in All Ages;" is the title of a new book by W. H. Quick of North Carolina. The introduction is by Hon. W.P. Mabson of Texas.</p>
                  <p>A recent issue of "The Texas Illuminator," a race paper published in San Antonio, Texas, contains a well written article urging <sic corr="Negroes">Negoes</sic> to become share-holders in a new railroad now in process of construction in that state.</p>
                  <p>Club women will find an interesting article in "Today," for March, by Miss Sherwood, entitled, "Women and Some Other Clubs in Washington."</p>

                  <p>With the beginning of spring comes, the feeling that many other things must be begun, and this season of looking forward possesses an anxiety fully deserving of the peacefulness of retrospection. The average housewife sees before her visions of <sic corr="innumerable">innnmerable</sic> things to be done before summer, and usually, even before <gap reason="tape repair" extent="6"/>ing the first contempl<gap reason="tape repair" extent="18"/>palling di<gap reason="tape repair" extent="120"/> best suited to <gap reason="tape repair" extent="10"/>pression, must, before results can be achieved, be dispelled, and some sympathizing friend recommends a bottle of somebody's "Sarsaparilla" as the most efficient means of eradicating the ills that "flesh is heir to."</p>
                  <p>Now, while the spring bitters of our grandmothers was undoubtedly productive of wonderful results in the way of physical renovation, the average patent medicine of to-day is from nature so far removed that only in extreme cases is benefit derived. Nature is, however, kind to us, and in taking her as she is we can test her powers. Few things are so beneficial to tired and nervous dispositions as a daily draught, one hour long, of pure air and sunshine; in other words, outdoor exercise is the spring necessity. Bright, balmy mornings are in themselves an invitation to enjoy them, and opening buds, birds and scenery furnish the needed diversion-the by-path where rests is found.</p>
                  <p>Spring is a rather more favorable thus for the formation of walking clubs than fall, and an hour in the early morning say from six to seven, the most favorable time. Of course when breakfast must be prepared and household duties performed some later hour must be chosen--but the remedy has been prescribed--and the only other directions are, "Take regularly each day."</p>
                  <p>Apropos of the early walk, a cheerful disposition is worth the cultivation. You have all heard of Dr. Joy's Golden Specific for "the blues"--the little couplet thoroughly digested--
<q direct="unspecified">
                        <lg type="couplet">
                           <l>Whenever you are feeling blue,</l>
                           <l>Something for some one else go do.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"The blues," however, is now an obsolescent phrase, and, its cure hardly needs further comment.</p>
                  <p>In a recent journal I noticed after a somewhat lengthy exegesis on "Nervousness in Girls," a good doctor's suggestion for its banishment. He said the only necessity was for the child to feel that it was loved. There are few ailments productive of so great suffering and so little sympathy as unstrung nerves. Naturally a girl looks for sympathy from her mother, and it is astonishing to think how few mothers understand how to give real sympathy that can be felt. They give their time, health and means oftentimes, and while the child is blessed with external luxuries all her cares and petty grievances are kept <sic corr="to">t</sic> herself. There is but one thing necessary. Let the mothers remember that they once passed through the same experience, and that it means only a little self abnegation to put them<gap reason="tape repair" extent="17"/>thizing plane with their <gap reason="tape repair" extent="160"/>of repeated <gap reason="tape repair" extent="30"/> housemaker are still looking in this direction for the evolution of the problem of domestic service.</p>
                  <p>A scheme for cooperative laundry work has been talked about here and even if not carried out, the idea might serve for others. A lady who has a large and convenient laundry in her own home proposed to four or five friends that they send their laundry to her to be done by one laundress. This is a simple and practical scheme, one that can be carried out by any lady with a saving of time, fuel, money and annoyance.</p>
                  <p>The number of women (and women who dress well and beautifully, too) who want the matter of dress simplified, grows every year. Women live too largely and broadly in this time, to be bound down to every change of sleeve or skirt, besides this, sensible women will not long consent to give up at the command of unknown rulers, fashions which are sensible and comfortable. Dressing well, is becoming a terrible burden to women of small means. Amateur dressmaking will not do nowadays, fashions are changing continuously and dressmakers charges are growing slowly but certainly upward. Does the worry and strain which all but the very rich are forced to endure to "keep up" pay in the results? It is to be hoped however, that whatever the future brings us, it will let us keep blouse waists, loose outside garments and short skirts. These all have the true beauty, the beauty of appropriativeness.</p>

DEAR GIRLS: </salute>
                  <p>I am to have the <sic corr="privilege">privielege</sic> of talking to you from time to time, and a blessed privilege, I esteem it; for in this woman's era, as Victor Hugo prophesied, woman has broken down nearly all barriers even in remote centres of the Old World's conservatism. She is attracting attention and winning respect for her abilities everywhere so that anything that tends to widen the horizon of our girls is of inestimable benefit. I may not be able to accomplish much in this great work but if one of suggestions should prove a fruitful <sic corr="source">scource</sic> of help to even one girl I shall feel that I have not labored in vain.</p>
                  <p>This time I want to say something to you about the reading habit. Every girl likes to read more or less but not many girls have a recognized plan of reading. Now, I do not mean by that that there should be any cast iron rule which every one, irrespective of her taste and temperament should follow. If you prefer Augusta Evans' "St Elmo," to Thackeray's Pendennis (I confess to a weak ness for that much abused book) have individuality enough to say so and pray for better taste--but much of the current literature in fiction aims only to amuse and some <sic corr="positively">postively</sic> weakens and<gap reason="tape repair" extent="33"/>r future <gap reason="tape repair" extent="33"/>mpanion- <gap reason="tape repair" extent="33"/>nowledge <gap reason="tape repair" extent="33"/>rature, a <gap reason="tape repair" extent="33"/> is always <gap reason="tape repair" extent="33"/>ennobling thoughts.</p>
                  <p>It is not necessary for me to warn you against reading bad books for
<q direct="unspecified">
                        <lg type="couplet">
                           <l>"Immodest words admit of no defence,</l>
                           <l>A want of decency is want of sense."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The importance of reading the best books is self evident and perhaps Emerson's three rules may aid us in selecting the best. <sic corr="First.">Frist.</sic> "Never read any but famed books. Second. Never read a book which is not a year old. Third. Never read anything you don't like."</p>
                  <p>Three good rules but rather hard to reconcile unless the last pre-supposes each and every one to have perfect taste.</p>
                  <p>A young girl came to me a few months ago with the remark, " I want to know all about the French Revolution and the first Napoleon and I find the books I am reading on the subject so dry that I can't get interested in them."</p>
                  <p>"What you reading?" I inquired.</p>
                  <p>She had looked up some main facts in text books, had tried to read a life of Napoleon by some unknown author and had begun Carlyle's French Revolution.</p>
                  <p>"Now, my dear, " said I, "it is absolutely necessary to read Carlyle on the subject but if you find it tedious just put it aside for awhile and read something which will lead up to it." I introduced her to Clara Mundt's, historical novels of that period. They are not correct but they give many main facts, fine pictures of the manners of that time in an interesting way.</p>
                  <p>I recommended Abbott's Life of Napoleon, a very narrative of the life of that great soldier; "The Tale of Two Cities " by Charles Dickens; " "The Life of Charlotte Corday " and others. A few weeks ago she told me that she had not only read Carlyle's French Revolution with absorbing interest, but various other works that I had never attempted, and her knowledge of those times was so far superior to mine that I have been adopting some of the suggestions in my own <sic corr="course">couse</sic> of reading.</p>
                  <p>She only needed to have her mind awakened to the beauties of great works to appreciate them.</p>
                  <p>Next month, I hope to tell you of a reading class of which I am a member and what we are doing in that line.</p>

EDITORS.</byline>
                  <p>The WOMAN'S ERA extends Easter greeting to all its friends and subscribers.</p>
                  <p>The coming Easter Reception at Berkeley Hall has awakened considerable interest. We hear that some very smart costumes are to be worn. The committee composed of Messrs. Geo. S. Glover, Joseph Lee, Edward E. Brown, J. H. Lewis, U. A. Ridley, W. H. Washington, and Chas. L. Smith, guarantee that all anticipations of a good time will be fully realized.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Belle Mitchell and her daughter Miss Bessie, who came up especially for the Grand Opera, were suddenly called home in the midst of the musical season, by the sad death of Mrs. Douglass of Now Bedford.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Edward B. Jourdain has moved to New Bedford.</p>
                  <p>Invitations are out for an Easter party to be given under the auspices of the Cambridge Dancing Class. We need no further assurance that it will be an enjoyable affair, than the fact that it is given under the management of Mrs. G. W. Lewis and Miss F. M. Clary.</p>
                  <p>Miss Annie Hemmings is expected home from Vassar, Friday to spend her Easter vacation.</p>
                  <p>Miss Alice Smith of Newport, R. I., and Miss Bessie Mitchell of New Bedford are coming up for the Easter party.</p>
                  <p>Dr. J. Francis Smith of New York intends spending one or two days in Boston at Easter.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Robert Terrell of Washington gave a very charming reception last week for Mrs. Joseph Lee of Auburndale, who is paying Washington a short visit.</p>
                  <p>Miss Nina Pinchback, the daughter of ex-Gov. P. B. S. Pinchback, now residing in Washington, is to be married to Col. Toomey of Baltimore on Thursday March 29th. The wedding, is to be private, but a reception is to be given to the bride and groom.</p>
                  <p>It is whispered in and around Washington, that one of its sweetest and most popular young ladies, who by the way is a school teacher, has recently become engaged to a prosperous young druggist.</p>
                  <p>Engagements and weddings seem to be quite the order of the day; and June seems to be the favored month for the consummation of plighted troths.</p>
                  <p>It is rumored that another Washington lady is to wed a <sic corr="prominent">promient</sic> Boston lawyer in June.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Joseph Douglass, violiniut, is in town for a short time.</p>
                  <p>New York is not behind Washington or Boston in this respect. The engagement is announced of Miss Emily Ray, cousin of Mrs. O. M. Waller to Mr. Frank P. Downing.</p>
                  <p>We also hear of two engagements from Philadelphia: that of Miss Bessie Abele to Mr. Frank Cook of Washington, and her sister Miss Dottie Abele to Mr. Charles Cook.</p>
                  <p>By the way, a number of very recherche teas have been given during the winter by a club of Boston's society girls, composed of Misses Georgine Glover, Annie Hare, Maud Cuney, Libbie Watson, Louisa Lewis and Lillian A. Lewis. Thus far, they have been entertained by Misses Maud Cuney, Libbie Watson and Georgine Glover.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lillian A. Lewis, of the Boston Herald, has moved from Westminister to Myrtle Street.</p>
                  <p>Mr. J. Percy Bond, after having enjoyed town life for five or six years, is now living with his father at Readville.</p>
                  <p>Mr. W. Appo Johnson and Mr. Charles Richardson have moved from the Back Bay to the West End and are now at 11 Myrtle street.</p>
                  <p>One of Boston's popular young men whom the girls have dubbed "Lord Chumley" met with a little experience not long ago, which would have resulted rather disastrously to the perpetrators of the joke, had not the gentleman in question been of an even and tranquil temperament. "Lord Chumley" who prides -himself on his <sic corr="exuberant">exumberant</sic> growth of hair, which by the way was quite becoming, was waylaid by several of his fun-loving friends the other night, and one side of head shorn of its glossy ringlets. This tragedy was enacted in a well known gentleman's furnishing store on Dartmouth street, and the victim was firmly held in a chair by several of his friends while another deprived him of his curls despite his entreaties, struggles and threats of revenge. He is now consoling himself with the thought that it will see grow out, again, as everything comes to him who waits.</p>
                  <p>Mme. Sisseretta Jones, who sang for Mme Melda at the latter's rooms in the Hotel Savoy, New York, is going to Paris to complete her musical education. This was brought about by the advice of Mme Melba who offered to sing at a benefit to defray the expenses of a course of study in Paris.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ednorah Nahar is spending a few weeks in Boston. She contemplates going abroad in the Fall.</p>
                  <p>Mr. J. C. Benjamin of Norwich, is confined to his house by illness.</p>
                  <p>A Japanese Tea, for the benefit of St. Monica's Home for Sick Colored Women, is is to be given Easter Tuesday night in the Guild Room of the Advent. The cause is a most worthy one, and should be well attended.</p>
                  <p>Rev. O. M. Waller, rector of St. Thomas', Philadelphia, and former assistant rector of St. Phillips P. E. <sic corr="Church">Chuch</sic>, New York, assisted in services at the latter church, Bishop Potter officiated.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Oscar L. Mithell is to be ordained shortly at St. Augustine's. He is <sic corr="">at</sic> attending the <sic corr="Theological">Thelogical</sic> School at Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>At the last confirmation at Trinity Church a new and beautiful feature introduced was the giving of flowers with the confirmation certificate to each candidate. The beautiful font was filled with long-stemmed Catherine Mermet roses which, after the services were over Dr. Donald distributed to each of his new members. Mrs. J. H. Lewis, her young daughter, Mary, and her sister, Miss Melvin were members of the large class confirmed.</p>
                  <p>The amateur theatricals which were to be given during the Easter holidays are postponed to allow "center-rush" Lewis of the Harvard foot-ball team, one of the actors, time to have his nose mended. Mr. Lewis came from Amherst to Harvard covered with honors won on both athletic and intellectual fields there, and will always carry some of the distinguishing marks of a successful college career--in the athletic department. Fortunately his <sic corr="intellectual">intelectual</sic> gifts and splendid voice have made him as fine an orator as athlete.</p>
                  <p>The next annual convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association will be held in Atlanta, Ga. This is a departure and proceedings will be watched with interest. Miss Ida B. Wells speaks of it and of an incident connected with the recent convention at Washington as follows:</p>
                  <p>Of course the colored woman suffragist won't be in it at all in that prejudiced town, it's bad enough in Washington, but <sic corr="there">tthee</sic> they can speak out in meeting and <sic corr="sit in">rsitn</sic> the body of the hall with other <sic corr="delegates">deleigaes</sic>. But colored Washington is agog over treatment accorded Mrs. A. J. Cooper last week. She was sent as a committee of one to invite Rev. Anna Shaw to address the Colored Woman's League. This lady was at the Riggs House and Mrs. Cooper went to the elevator to go up to the ladies' room; the elevator boy refused to allow her to enter, stating that orders had been given to permit no colored person to go up in the elevators. Mrs. Cooper sent Rev. Shaw a note explaining the situation and that lady came flying down to see her, expressing her righteous indignation, but that did not change the rules of the house. To a Chicagoan (?) the whole thing is such a ridiculous farce. Mrs. Cooper had, less than a year ago been thrown out of a waiting room in North Carolina, but one doesn't always expect such things under the dome of the Capitol.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Dvorak, one of the greatest of living composers, and the head of the National Conservatory of America in New York, is so enthusiastic about the future of the Negro in music that in addition to having composed a symphony entitled The "New World," founded on negro melodies, he has organized a class of colored students in vocal music.</p>
                  <p>This class has been a pleasant surprise to him, as it has developed some excellent voices, and Dr. <sic corr="Dvorak">Dovarak</sic> has declared that colored people will produce great singers in the future.</p>
                  <p>A free scholarship is offered to young colored musicians of exceptional talent by the National Conservatory of America, and wherever abides budding talent of more than ordinary promise there is an eligible candidate and an application for free tuition should be made.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Opera has come and gone, leaving in its train delightful memories of enchanting music rendered by such artists as Melba, Calve, Nordica, Eames, <gap reason="tape repair" extent="1"/>chalchi, the Des Reakes, Plancon, La-<gap reason="tape repair" extent="2"/>lle and De Lucia.</p>
                  <p>Madam Melba steadily grew in favor with the Bostonians who although enthusiastic over her from the first were wildly demonstrative over her before the season ended.</p>
                  <p>Madam Melba received over twenty recalls in her final appearance in "Faust," and her admirers were only satisfied when she rendered "Home, Sweet Home" with all the simplicity of greatness.</p>
                  <p>Miss Laura Robeason, of St. Paul, Minn., Miss Hattie Dabney, of Richmond, Va., and Miss Florence Johnson, of Brooklyn, N. Y., are among the students now <sic corr="pursuing">persuing</sic> courses in music in Boston. Miss Boberson is at the Boston Training School of Music, and will graduate this year. Misses Cuney and Johnson are at the N. E. Conservatory, and Miss Dabney is a pupil of Mr. Samuel Jamieson.</p>
                  <p>The next concert of the Wage Earners series by the St. Cecilia will take place the first part of May in Music Hall.</p>
                  <p>The program will he made up of miscellaneous numbers which are always popular. The price of tickets are 15 and 25 cents. Tickets may be obtained by applying or sending mail order with cash to the Musical Department of this paper not later than ten days previous to the concert.</p>

                  <p>Our Boston women are well represented in many of the numerous avenues now open to women; we have a fairly good number of public school teachers, several professional singers and teachers of music, a small army of type-writers, a few newspaper women, besides book keepers, sales girls, compositors, dress makers manicurists and hairdresses.</p>
                  <p>The number of young people who choose music for a specialty is quite marked. When are we to reckon among us artists, architects and designers ? The two latter fields seem to be entirely untried with the necessary number of girls who have leisure and means to make a choice of professions, it is strange that none have been led in this way.</p>
                  <p>It is a recognized fact now that women should indulge and pursue special bent or cultivate a peculiar power as do the men. We now have conspicuous examples of rich women who finding themselves possessed of certain abilities have felt justified in exercising those traits for money returns. Mrs. Montgomery Sears accepts orders for portrait painting. Mrs. Apthrop superintends the decorating and furnishing of interiors.</p>
                  <p>Such women have been <sic corr="severely">severly</sic> criticised for entering the field against poor women but why should not everyone have the privilege of working? and why should we condemn a rich woman the industry that we commend in rich men?</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">A DOMESTIC SCENE.</head>
                  <byline>EVA LEWIS.</byline>
                  <p>The smallest event can sometimes jar the domestic peace and produce discords so that weeks and even months fail to restore the usual harmony in many households.</p>
                  <p>In this case the wind was to blame, not Mr. Brougham not Miss Myrtle but the wind. What business had it to blow so violently? It was but natural that Mr. Brougham having a cold should draw out that handkerchief, and how could Miss Myrtle's plants get air if she did not open the dining room window.</p>
                  <p>So at ten minutes past eight, Mr. Brougham, passing Miss Myrtle's cottage, drew out his hankerchief, as we have said before; of <sic corr="course">cousre</sic> he should have been more careful for that very morning, Mrs. Brougham had given him the handkerchief with his initials worked with her own hair, it being the anniversary of their wedding day. Though Mr. Brougham, who was never romantic and whom six years of married life had rendered less so would have preferred something more substantial, still he had thanked Mrs. Brougham and was now about to use, well, he was just taking the handkerchief from his left breast pocket, (to please Mrs. B, he had put it in his left breast pocket, although he had much rather put his cigar there because it would be handy, but as the pocket in question was right over his heart and as it was the anniversary of his wedding day, it became him to discommode himself a little, at least until he was out of sight). But we must go back to the wind. This mischievous, naughty wind seeing the handkerchief in Mr. Brougham's hand and Miss Myrtle's window open thought what fun it would be to snatch the article from its owner's hand and waft it into the window. Oh, what a mischievous wind it was! No sooner thought than done and a second later, Mr. Brougham stood looking thoughtfully in every direction while the handkerchief lay thoughtlessly on the dining room floor.</p>
                  <p>"Great Powers! what a wind," said Mr. Brougham I must confess that he used a much stronger term, but I am not versed in the orthography of it. Mr. <sic corr="Brougham">Brongham</sic> buttoned up his coat and continued his walk, and his nephew, who lived opposite and was observing him, nearly died of laughter as he afterwards said. Not contented with the mischief it had already wrought, the wind broke off a <sic corr="beautiful">beaut ul</sic> calla lily. Now when Miss Myrtle entered the room the first thing she saw was the lily. "O, my beautiful calla!" she exclaimed, "Could the cat have done it?" "Puss, puss," she called but no cat appeared. Then she spied the handkerchief. "It is not mine. I wonder where it came from," she murmured. And then she said, "Oh, the wind most likely." Tossing the handkerchief on the table, she closed the window.</p>
                  <p>At half past ten, precisely, Mrs. Grant stepped in to see Miss Myrtle. Now, Mrs. Grant had two faults--she loved to talk and she always saw the worst side of human nature. After telling Miss Myrtle that she could not take off her bonnet;  that she had only dropped in to borrow some knitting needles; that her plum preserves were probably boiling over on the stove at home; that Tom Crane had cut his hand; that Lena Smith was flirting dreadfully with the Baptist minister; that Samuel Cole's son had been robbing the Skimps' orchard and would surely be hung some day, and that if he were her boy she would manage him better, she rose to depart and as she neared the door saw the handkerchief. Now; Mrs. Grant had been at Mrs. Brougham's the <sic corr="evening">eveing</sic> before, admiring the same handkerchief and then Mrs. Brougham's hair had a peculiar color. When she was young, her admirers called it auburn, golden and other names, but her brothers (who tell the truth like relatives?) said that Maria had the queerest kind of red hair that they had ever seen.</p>
                  <p>At any rate, Mrs. Grant saw the hankerchief and recognized it at once. Hurrying home, she rescued her plum preserves from instant destruction and putting her dinner on, started for Mrs. Brougham's. She ran into the house all out of breath. "Why, what is the matter?" inquired Mrs. Brougham.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Maria Brougham, you and I have been friends so long that I think it would come better from me than a stranger," cried Mrs. Grant, which considering that they had always quarrelled when schoolgirls, and had been rivals in most things ever since, this friendship seemed remarkable.</p>
                  <p>That this speech foreshadowed some bad news to herself Mrs. Brougham, well knew.</p>
                  <p>"What is it?" she asked impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"I would say nothing about it but I think you really ought to know,</p>
                  <p>"Know what?" demanded Mrs. Brougham in a sharp tone.</p>
                  <p>"Well my dear, don't get angry. Every one has trials though I did think this would be spared you. Men will be men and even poor Grant in his lifetime--"</p>
                  <p>"Is it anything about Mr. Brougham ? " inquired his wife.</p>
                  <p>About him! Well, you see as I was saying that we can't expect men--"</p>
                  <p>"Sarah Grant, tell me what you have to say or hold your peace," screamed Mrs. Brougham.</p>
                  <p>You need not be so high and mighty about it," answered her tormentor. I saw that handkerchief you showed me last night in Miss Myrtle's house this morning, and they do say that he prefers Miss Myrtle to his own wife."</p>
                  <p>"Who says so?" <sic corr="demanded">demended</sic> Mrs. Brougham.</p>
                  <p>"Everybody, but I never believed it until now. "</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe it!" said Mrs. Brougham.</p>
                  <p>"Not believe it! You might as well tell me I am lying," screamed Mrs. Brougham.</p>
                  <p>"I mean, perhaps, you are mistaken," cried poor Mrs. Brougham, who felt no desire to quarrel at that moment.</p>
                  <p>"Mistaken! I would know Your hair anywhere, " <sic corr="replied">repled</sic> Mrs. Grant, preparing to take her departure.</p>
                  <p>(To be continued.)</p>

                  <p>The eloquent extempore speech made by Mr. Geo. T. Downing at the meeting held by the colonization society in Boston recently, has not received the notice it deserved. All the weight which Bishop Potter's utterances carry was quickly overcome by Mr. Downing who created the only enthusiasm if the meeting. Bishop Potter is not alone in thinking that colored people owe it to their self respect to "go back to Africa" and leave a country where they are not wanted. A colored lady of refinement and education who has not only a family here (small to be sure) but an ancestral home in America had these words addressed to her recently by an ignorant woman who twenty years ago came over on an emigrant ship, "you colored folks ought to go back to Africa where you belong, we don't want you here anyway"! Mr. Downing is not the only colored man who thinks there is a call for him to stay in <sic corr="his">he</sic> native land and help civilize it. <sic corr="">is</sic>
                  </p>
                  <p>Momolu Massaqui, the Prince of the Vie country, West Africa, who represented his native land at the World's Fair at Chicago last summer, is now giving his lectures and showing the products and the manufactures of his country in and around Boston.</p>
                  <p>This young man is a most satisfactory specimen of his race, refined in manner, cultivated in speech, with natural gifts, that contribute towards making him all instructive and interesting lecturer.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mary Jones, a well-to-do colored lady residing in Lexington, Ky., recently died, and among the items of her will is one bequeathing $1,000 to Lieutenant Governor M. C. Alford, of Kentucky in recognition of kindness shown to her.</p>

                  <p>In January the Woman's Era Club passed the following resolution endorsing President Cleveland's position on the Hawaiian question:--</p>
                  <p>We, members of the Woman's Era Club, feeling that all expression of opinion upon the Hawaiian question is especially fitting from us as colored women and Americans, do hereby Resolve:--</p>
                  <p>1st, That we heartily commend the moral courage and independence exhibited in the attitude of the President of the United States upon this question.</p>
                  <p>2nd, That irrespective of party affiliation we condemn those journals which blinded by prejudice and political feeling have sought to brand as unpatriotic the position of those who place truth and justice above national gain and power.</p>
                  <p>3rd, We also condemn those American citizens, who, having found in Hawaii wealth, health and homes, and who having grown greedy with all these have sought to obtain the country itself, now seek to excuse their rapacity by traducing the queen and the people who made possible this prosperity.</p>
                  <p>The meeting of the Mass. State Federation of Woman's Clubs held in Boston March 8, was rich in the discussion of subjects of interest to all club women--among the subjects which might serve also as topics for discussion in other organization were these "Which is now helpful to the individual club woman, a course of study or the discussion of general topics? and "What is the desirable limit of clubs and under what circumstances should membership be indefinitely extended?"</p>

                  <p>We read daily of the progress women are making for the elevation of their sex and we are <sic corr="proud">prouds</sic> to note noble examples among us, who follow in their train, laboring earnestly yet modestly for their sex and the upbuilding of the race. Surely we cannot know too much of their genius and merits, for the inspiration of our girls.</p>
                  <p>Among our prominent progressive women is Mrs. William E. Matthews, known in the literary world as "Victoria Earle."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Matthews, so desirous of doing what she can for her race, with a few others saw the practical need, of banding together well-thinking women with the hope that they might in their generation pave the way for the success of the futurity of the race, and organized The Woman's Loyal Union. We are favored to exist in the seed planting time.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Matthews has been the president of the Woman's Loyal Union since its organization.</p>
                  <p>Its members have found her loyal, unswerving embracing every opportunity for the accomplishment of the aims of the Union.</p>
                  <p>Realizing the wrongs perpetrated upon our race in the South, the injury occasioned by opinions that have been freely expressed in several leading magazines and newspapers, as to the retrogression of the race morally, Mrs. Matthews has been <sic corr="exceedingly">exeeedingly</sic> anxious to ascertain the truth of such statements.</p>
                  <p>With this idea in view she wrote a set of questions, submitted them to the executive board of the Union with the hope of their approval, and expressed the desire to have said questions sent to the ministers, school teachers and other representative men and women throughout the country for the purpose of eliciting from them the true statistics of our people morally.</p>
                  <p>The idea is bright, progressive. We, co-workers, appreciate her efforts, her executive ability, and shall ever give her our hearty support.</p>
                  <p>"Her great fondness for research and her splendid memory make her quite an authority on literature, art, history and philosophy. Her historical researches have led her to the determination to write a series of text books, historical primers for the youth, of the race, which will trace the history of the African and show that he and his descendants have been prominently identified with every phase of this country's history including the landing of Columbus.</p>
                  <p>She has also a number of stories and a play which is yet unpublished.</p>
                  <p>When all these shall have been given to the public, race literature will be enriched and the name of Victoria Earle become a household word."</p>

                  <p>The "Tourgee Club" composed of leading men of Chicago, upon organization set aside every Thursday afternoon from 1 to 5, as "Ladies Day." For some reason the ladies did not make use of these afternoons and the gentlemen desiring to make the day popular invited several women to read papers on Ladies' Day.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Stephen Matthews of London, England was announced to speak on Dec. 14, 1893 on "Ideal Womanhood." This was the first address. The parlors were crowded and those present were entertained for two hours on the subject. At the close of the address Miss Ida B. Wells who introduced Mrs. Matthews extended the invitation from the Tourgee Club to the ladies to meet every Thursday and make use of the parlors in any manner they desired. The ladies decided to meet the following Thursday and also to invite Mr. W. T. Stead, editor of the Review of Reviews of London to address them.</p>
                  <p>Dec. 21st, 2 p. m., fifty ladies assembled in the parlors and after some delightful music, Mr. Stead was introduced and he made an informal talk on "Friendship between the Sexes." A general discussion followed.</p>
                  <p>On Dec. 28th Miss Ida B. Wells gave a history of Clubs among Colored Women," and on Jan. 4th <sic corr="presented">presentad</sic> a paper on "Colored Woman's Work."</p>
                  <p>These series of meetings were so largely attended and created such an interest among the ladies that they decided to formally organize under the name of the "Woman's Club." <sic corr="That">Thit</sic> was done on Jan. 11th. On March 29th a constitution was adopted- The object of the club is the elevation and protection of women and the home, and much good work has been accomplished since their organization. The membership is nearly two hundred and the meetings are largely attended every Thursday afternoon in the parlors of the Tourgee Club House, 2926 Dearborn street.</p>
                  <p>The present officers are Mrs. R. R. Moore, president, Miss Ida B. Wells, vice president, Alice Harvey, secretary.</p>
                  <p>Later, Mrs. Moore, president of the Woman's Club writes as follows.</p>
                  <p>At present we have two very interesting cases on hand; we are prosecuting the policeman who killed the <sic corr="husband">husdand</sic> of Alice Adams a hard working young colored woman, with two little children. We have paid all her expenses in the trial, and the officer is bound over to the <sic corr="criminal">crimimal</sic> court, $5000 bond. We have secured four nice, comfortable rooms for the widow, furnished them and paid two months rent in advance. All of this we have done without a treasury as we charge no fee in our club; we have two hundred members in our club and whenever money is required the ladies respond cheerfully.</p>
                  <p>The second case is that of a girl of fourteen, friendless and homeless, who has reached such a pitch of desperation, that she was found carrying a revolver, living in hovels and associating with the most degraded. We have decided to take her under complete charge of the Woman's Club, send her to school until she is eighteen, educate and endeavor to train her to become a useful member of society We have numbers of other cases awaiting our attention.</p>

                  <p>The Kansas City League fittingly celebrated the first anniversary of its existence during the first week of March.</p>
                  <p>The exercises were of a public nature and the annual reports were listened to with much interest. Excellent addresses were delivered by reverend Marshall of St. Augustine's Episcopal Mission and Bishop Handy of the A. M. E Church. Cheering letters were read from the leagues of Washington, Boston, and Lawrence.</p>
                  <p>During the past year, fifteen young people were in various ways assisted to help themselves, and it is hoped that much more may be accomplished in 94-'5.</p>
                  <p>A course of lectures upon practical subjects is now in progress and judging from the first lecture of the course this will become one of the effective methods of exerting a wholesome educational influence in the community. <sic corr="&#34;"/>The Improvement of Home," by Miss Anna H. Jones was the subject of the lecture already given, and it awakened much interest in an appreciative audience.</p>
                  <p>The other, lecturers named for this course are as follows.--Prof. G. N. Grisham, Lawyer T. R. Subletts, Mrs. Frances Jackson of the American Citizen, Prof. J. U. Daniel of Lincoln High School.</p>

                  <p>The Sierra Leone Club was organized Feb. 7th, 1892, by twelve active and energetic women, who felt the need of a closer union and broader development. Its object is the intellectual and social improvement of its members We represent the "queens of the fireside," as all of us are wives and almost all mothers. Naturally our attention was at first given to home training and domestic economy. Papers were read and discussed and useful and beneficial suggestions were adopted by us. This, together with "Current Topic Talks," comprised the first year's work. Each lady felt herself so much benefited that it was thought best to double our number, therefore, twelve more ladies were invited to associate with us and we formed an institute and successfully carried out a plan of study last year, in which we succeeded fairly well. The knowledge we gained made a generous impression upon us, and it was concluded that if we could help ourselves in short talks and a few hours' study each day, that much good could be accomplished if we founded an industrial school for our women and children. On the first Tuesday in January 1894 we adopted resolutions to the effect that we would use every effort this year to get means to purchase a lot and erect a cottage for the salvation of our girls. We are moving along nicely with twenty-four willing workers and twelve who are friendly to our cause. WE hope to have $500 by next January and a home. Already we have been encouraged by the results of the entertainments. We have just begun on industrial work this month. We instituted a lecture course and the presidents of the W. C. T. U. and Equal Suf-

                  <p>I am happy to say that the Directors of the N.E.W. Club voted to subscribe for the WOMAN'S ERA, and wish me to express to you their interest in the movement of which it is the organ, and cordial good wishes for its success. There is not much in this Club that would serve as news, or perhaps be of very general interest, as the meetings are held every Monday afternoon from November to June, when a lecture is given, followed by discussion; but our secretary, Miss Lucia M. Peabody, will be very glad to respond, if at any time there should be any special points you would like to know about.</p>
                  <p>There is another matter I should speak of; about a year ago the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs was formed with Mrs. Julia Ward Howe President. Twenty-six Clubs have already joined, and we hope <sic corr="in">n</sic> time it will be a union of all the Women's Clubs in the State If at any time, your Club or any that you may know about should like to join, we shall be most happy to welcome them. We feel sure this is going to be very helpful and inspiring to all the Clubs, for meetings are held for the discussion of Club .methods and subjects of general interest, and as the members of the various Clubs meet, and know each other better, all will be helped, and by uniting in this way, they will become more and more a power in the State.</p>

                  <p>This club has just closed a carnival which, considering the hindrances in the shape of continued bad weather counter attractions, etc., was very successful. Of the four afternoons and evenings during which it was held, there was only one evening when the weather was pleasant, for the rest although the beautiful little hall was elaborately decorated and the cafe stocked with "good things" to eat, the rain snow and sleet were the obstacles which prevented the public from enjoying these features in large numbers. </p>
                  <p>In spite of the storm, however, Children's Day found the hall well filled with happy youngsters and admiring parents. Those who braved the storm were amply repaid, for there are few prettier sights than that of children dancing.</p>
                  <p>Some of the features of the Carnival was the sale of home-made bread, pies and cakes, of household articles and implements, delicious home-made tonics, hot chocolate and the exquisite cups in which it was served. Besides these there were the usual features in tables for aprons, flowers, fancy goods and an especially attractive tissue paper table. No pains were spared to make the carnival a great success and had the weather been favorable the sum cleared above the great expense would have been much larger.</p>
                  <p>Other leagues may find in this rather detailed account some suggestions which may be used to their advantage.</p>
                  <p>The club meets bi-monthly, the first meeting each month being devoted to business, the next six meetings are arranged, the literature, the temperance, and the civics committee will each provide for a meeting with appropriate speakers.</p>

                  <p>The WOMEN'S ERA believes that the time is ripe for a convention of the colored women of the country to agitate <sic corr="the subject">thesubject</sic>. It proposes to publish the views of influential women on the subject.</p>
                  <p>The letters below are in answer to the following questions.</p>
                  <p>I. Do you favor a convention of the colored women's clubs, <sic corr="leagues">eagues</sic> and societies?</p>
                  <p>2. What in your opinion is the most available place and time for such a congress?</p>
                  <p>3. State why you do or do not favor a convention.</p>

                        <body>
                           <p>Organization or military advance is the first step in nation making, the first step in any <sic corr="progressive">progessive</sic> movement; hence we hail with delight the growth of the club movement among colored women. It is a sign of mental activity and should be conducted with well defined aims and from broad platforms.</p>
                           <p>How can these aims be properly defined, <sic corr="discussed">discuseed</sic> and incorporated into a general organization which shall reach the hearts of the race, east, west, north and south, unless it is brought about by calling a congress of women of nobility of soul and of wide experience in practical affairs?</p>
                           <p>By all means let us have a congress of colored women at some time in the near future to give solidity, unity of purpose, national character, and other requisites of success necessary to a movement so broad and far reaching as a race organization should be.</p>
                           <p>As to the place of meeting, we favor Chicago because of its central location.</p>
                           <pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                           <p>Organization of the kind suited to our present needs should be national to be effective; should be national to develop harmony of ideas and unity of purpose.</p>
                           <p>The W.C.T.U. owes its value to its national character, to its thorough system of organization, to its clearly defined purposes. The same may be said of the chautauqua Circle, of the Christian Endeavor Society, and numerous other examples which might be given to illustrate the point in question,  </p>

                           <p>In answer to your question regarding the holding of a congress of the colored women's leagues I heartily approve of the suggestion. I am of the opinion that great good would result from an interchange of ideas as to how we could best accomplish the more lasting results of the Work each league is engaged in. By understanding the object of each league's work, I believe we could so harmonize our efforts that it might be uniform throughout the country and much good result therefrom. To the second question I beg to reply in favor of Chicago as the place and the month of August as the time for holding the Congress. You will pardon me for naming Chicago, however, I am convinced there is not another place in the United States that affords its good facilities for the meeting as the great convention city of America. We have a Woman's Club here with a membership of more than 200 ladies all enthusiastic in all matters pertaining to the elevation of woman and the good of the race in general. The scope Of our work is unlimited, and it would afford us great pleasure to have the opportunity of greeting and entertaining the noble women of our race in the first grand congress of colored women.</p>
                           <p>I think the ladies would gain inspiration by breathing the free air, and mingling with the broadminded women of Chicago. If our city is elected I think we will be able to give evidence of our appreciation of the honor. Trusting that my humble opinion may in it measure harmonize with the grand idea advanced by you, I am</p>

                           <p>I like the idea of a Congress of the Colored Womens' Leagues and clubs. I favor it to such extent that I would urge it among our women. My experience in association work hardly entities me to offer a suggestion as to the time and place of such a convention. I really think with the Women's Era in its opinion.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the Washington League under Mrs. Cooper's splendid leadership, so far as I know at this time, the most general opinion is that Philadelphia is centrally located, thus convenient to all.</p>
                           <p>August, in any judgment, is for several reasons the best time for holding conventions. I favor a Congress, first because I believe it would arouse the interest, and center the attention of our women in common, which will lead to not only an interest generally, but a deeply rooted local pride in the matter of organization and this practical support of the same. The interchange of the views of thoughtful women as to the needs of the home will prove not only instructive, in itself, but will lead to, or should lead to the general adoption of a broad plan or method of action, Organization among our women is, practically speaking in the experimental stage, to the average woman--conservative, refined educated woman--the formation of associations for the avowed purpose of the advancement of race interest, is handicapped by a certain lack of precedence and unfortunately enveloped in uncertainty as to method--so much so that there is a marked disposition among them to consider the movement as one embracing many difficulties, and are inclined to stand off and see to what degree of success the originators of the club movement will attain, prudence is to be commended always, but it is wise to consider the adage.</p>
                           <p>"In the absence of the best, the worst will prevail" and as the various organizations are permanently organized, it <sic corr="behooves">behoves</sic> those to whom light is given to think for the future, and assist in the matter of establishing a high standard, in the very beginning, a Congress would ventilate for good all such views--therefore if I have any voice at all I raise it to hope that the WOMEN'S ERA will agitate the matter. By all means let us have a congress.</p>

                           <p>Just at this stage of the higher activity among colored women, I knew of nothing that would prove more stimulating than a congress of their clubs. Unfortunately the beginnings of their club work are still so unimportant to any but themselves that, the great medium of intercourse, the newspapers, does not bring them to acquaintance with each other. Little bands here and there are trying each in its own way, to lift those that can reach to a higher plain. But as yet the colored women workers are missing the sympathy, the encouragement, the larger wisdom that comes from intercourse with others who are pushing on towards the same ideal. If the WOMEN'S, ERA Had expired the first issue would yet have set the ball rolling toward what seems to me the next effective move for progression, the fellowship of Colored Women's Clubs, and Boston as the place. I choose Boston for the reason that I know of no other city where the attitude of the press and that of the general public would be as respectful; nor where the impressiveness of such a gathering would receive such recognition.</p>
                           <p>May we have a congress with all its means of mental strengthening, to say nothing of the quickening influence of the hand-clasp, and a look into the faces of the women who are striving to realize the same ideals.</p>

                  <p>An interesting fact concerning the Chicago Club is that no membership fees are received; in spite of this, the club carries on work requiring money and has never yet been hampered for want of it.</p>
                  <p>Miss Baldwin, one of the vice presidents of the WOMAN'S ERA is also a member of the celebrated Cantabrigia, which numbers nearly four hundred and includes in its membership all of the many distinguished ladies of Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>Miss Baldwin has twice appeared before this club, the first time with a paper on, "The true hold of the poet on the people," this paper had the fine intellectual tone which <sic corr="characterizes">charaterizes</sic> everything Miss Baldwin writes, and was enthusiastically received by Cantabrigad.</p>
                  <p>Providence R.I. has fallen into line and announces a new woman's club.-- The WOMAN'S ERA.</p>
                  <p>Some of the topics for discussion at the Working Girls Convention to be held in Boston, May 9th, 10th, and 11th:</p>
                  <p>What are clubs doing in developing the spiritual, and moral?</p>
                  <p>Influence of clubs on the home and the neighborhood,</p>
                  <p>Clubs in relation to the community.</p>
                  <p>Relative advantages of large and small clubs.</p>
                  <p>Club finances.</p>
                  <p>Best methods of filling the treasury.</p>
                  <p>Are too many women entering business?</p>
                  <p>"Pin-money" workers.</p>
                  <p>Massachusetts is to have a Woman's Club House for the use of all women's clubs.</p>
                  <pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>What Mrs. Jennie C. Croly says of the club movement generally is applicable to the movement among our women.</p>
                  <p>Newspapers are just waking up to the importance of the woman's club movement, not only in the cities, but throughout the country, and the extent to which it is revolutionizing the social life everywhere, for men as well as for women. Heretofore an occasional paragraph was all the many newspapers thought fit to bestow upon a movement which marks a new departure in the life of women, and an enlargement in their mental horizon, such as it has never before known.</p>
                  <p>"As late as five years ago, before Sorosis held its first club convention, the woman's club was still isolated, as women had been. They knew not each other, their strength nor their weakness. They grew by simultaneous <sic corr="impulse">impluse</sic>, by <sic corr="hearsay">heresay</sic>, by club women being transferred from one soil to another, and carrying with them the seeds of the plant that had flourished in the place whence they came. Within this brief time women's dubs have multiplied ten to one.</p>
                  <p>The Richmond Charitable Union a large and flourishing society organized with the specific object of buying or building a home for Aged and infirm colored women of the city of Richmond, Va. is officered as follows: Mrs. N. M. Robinson, Pres.; Miss. P. R. Anderson, Sect.; Mrs. N. Wallace, Asst. Sect. Mrs. D. E. Moore, Tres.</p>
                  <p>It is hoped for a fuller report of the good work being done by this <sic corr="vigorous">vigorious</sic> association for our next issue.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Era Club will hold a childrens' May Festival to be followed by a dance in the evening for the older people.</p>
                  <p>The women of Norfolk and Berkeley, Va.; incited and encouraged by the published reports of the women's clubs are organizing and it is expected from the enthusiasm displayed that some of the most interesting letters in the future will be from that section.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ednorah Nahar will give a childrens' cantata at Charles <sic corr="Street">tSreet</sic> Church on Tuesday the 29th of May.</p>
                  <p>Our readers and club women will be interested in the letters from two more flourishing clubs that of the "Women's Club" of Chicago which numbers two hundred and which seems to be infused with the energy and enterprises characteristic of that city and the Sierra Leone Club of Lawrence, Kansas. This latter is comparatively small in membership but, has a reputation as a power for good far outside of its own neighborhood. The Chicago letter unfortunately came too late for our last number that, however, will not prevent it being read with interest in this issue.</p>
                  <p>In the future THE WOMAN'S ERA will be supplied to clubs, leagues and societies at the rate seven cents a copy to be sold by them for ten cents.</p>
                  <p>Only clubs taking one hundred copies will be entitled to an advertisement.</p>
                  <p>Clubs are entitled to commission on subscription sent in their name. Letters from clubs for publication and financial returns must be made on or before the 18th of each month.</p>
                  <p>Money should be made payable to THE WOMAN'S ERA and should be forwarded by registered letter, draft, check or post office order to the office, 185 Cambridge street, Boston, Mass.</p>

                  <p>The first lesson that science teaches in any department of the vast realm of wisdom is that we must begin with one thing, done thoroughly, and learn to labor long and wait patiently for even small fruition. An experiment in domestic science started, apparently, under the most highly favorable conditions, in <sic corr="Cambridge">Cambrige</sic> some years ago, came to utter grief and failure from lack of <sic corr="learning">learing</sic> this first lesson. The ambitious experimenters started a co-operative store for groceries, a co-operative bakery, and a co-operative laundry, all at the same time, and with no previous experience of such undertaking among their members. Naturally, their enterprises were soon wrecked upon the rocks of their own utter inexperience. And yet there is no reason in the world why any one of the three, adventured alone, might not have gone on to brilliant perpetuation. You are, possibly, all familiar with the history of the 28 poor weavers in England, who, just fifty years ago, clubbed together to buy their own tea and sugar at a wholesale shop in order to get a better quality at a less price than they could obtain at retail groceries. Each one saved a little out of his weekly wages until they jointly accumulated <sic corr="enough">enought</sic> cash to buy one chest of tea and one hogshead of sugar. Then each one bought from this common stock, paying cash for it and giving the same price charged at the retail groceries. When they reckoned up account before re-investing they found they had made for themselves a handsome profit, in fact they had saved the profit they had formerly given to the corner grocer, and had also had a much better quality of tea and sugar. As the news spread, the enterprise grew; other laborers joined them; as their profits accumulated they began to buy other things in the same way, bread, wheat, and clothing then others, and still others, until to-day that society, called the Rochdale Pioneers, has become a vast concern carrying on a yearly business of much over a million dollars.</p>
                  <p>The full history of the working of this wonderful enterprise is well worth careful study, for it is one of the most encouraging recitals of what may be <sic corr="accomplished">accomplised</sic> from humble beginnings to be found in human experience. There are now, altogether, 1,120 of these co-operative societies in Great Britain, with over a million of members and whose joint-stock capital, or savings, together amounts to about 35,000,000 of dollars. Is not this indeed a tall oak to grow from such a little acorn as the saving of enough to buy a little tea and sugar? Now I see no reason why the women of Boston <sic corr="should">shonld</sic> not, in some such fashion, start and build up a cooperative laundry.</p>
                  <p>It is true that <sic corr="co-operative">co-operativ</sic> labor would be more difficult than co-operative buying, but bright minds have overcome greater obstacles than that.</p>
                  <p>But, meanwhile, the domestic science department of this club may find a much-needed work ready prepared for their hands; And that is to make an organized, persistent effort to have domestic science taught to girls from ten years of age and upward, in the schools of this locality. When we reflect what careful preparation is now deemed necessary in order to teach teachers how to teach, we would not wonder that so large a number of mothers who have domestic knowledge themselves but are not trained in the art of teaching, do not know how to successfully train their own daughters. And when we reflect upon how many mothers themselves do not even have a high grade of knowledge of any kind, we need not wonder that thousands of girls are now growing up in ignorance of this most vital science. Undoubtedly, what could be taught in the schools would be but an outline and a beginning, and foundation to build on in the future, but even this foundation of domestic science would be well worth all the time and trouble that might be spent in procuring its establishment, and it would be a great credit to the WOMAN'S ERA could this be <sic corr="achieved">acheived</sic> through their endeavor. If possible it would be well to have such scientific <sic corr="training">traning</sic> given equally to boys and to girls, for such teaching would have a moral result, as well as technical value, in teaching boys to properly estimate what they are now apt to scorn as inferior work merely because they deem it women's work. To the true scientist no work is inferior work though there may be reasons why persons of great capacity should leave certain kinds to be done by those of less varied capability, but there is no question that our life is richer if we have sometime each tried our own hand at every branch of human labor within reach of our experiment. The woman who has never herself actually performed any of the duties of the household is at as great a disadvantage as the <sic corr="manufacturer">manuufacturer</sic> who has never performed any part of the labor of a manufacturing business. As I have before stated, I believe in division of labor, and I think all household labor will be better, done when women evolve some plan by which cooking may be done by a highly skilled and scientific cook, laundering by an equally <sic corr="accomplished">accomplihsed</sic> laundress and general cleaning by another expert specially trained for this branch of work, just as in a manufacturing establishment, one was a fireman, another engineer, another book-keeper, and so on. But many of the richest manufacturers in the country are now requiring their sons to begin at the bottom of the business ladder, as humble workmen in their father's or some other person's factory, learning the work of every department by actually doing the work. Just so, I think young women should begin to learn domestic science by going through every operation from cleaning stoves and building fires, to the artistic arrangement of a parlor. I have myself gone through every step of such discipline, and for no amount of money would I part with the feeling of independence, that has come from possession of <sic corr="the">thi</sic> practical knowledge concerning every branch of labor that can be carried on in a household. It seems as if every person who can hold a brush ought to know how to scrub a pine table or floor. Imagine then my astonishment when the domestic scientist who was my instructor proved to me that the way I imagined it should be done was of all others the worst way. I wonder how many present have learned that an unpainted wooden
<pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
table can only be kept in its most beautiful state of whiteness when scrubbed with cold water? It was, at any rate, a revelation to me, who had supposed grease could only be extracted by the use of the hottest of hot water. In one of the classes which I attended was a mother of a family, over 40 years of age, who had never before learned the scientific mode of building a fire. She was as delighted as a child with a new toy when she finally knew how to go successfully through every step of this process, from cleaning the grate, to properly laying the kindling, and putting on coal so there could be no failure. One housekeeper in this class discovered that $2 worth of prepared kindling wood could be saved each month in the kitchen, simply by a scientific use of kindling, to say nothing of the saving of comfort and increase of pleasure which came from having the process quickly and correctly performed.</p>
                  <p>So it is all through the various ramifications of household science. The average woman actually knows so little that she has not yet discovered how much there is that she does NOT know. To spread the divine discontent with such <sic corr="ignorance">igorance</sic>, to open up new opportunities for gaining household knowledge, to exalt the high calling of the maker of homes--such is the noble work which I hope is to receive fresh impetus from the domestic science branch of the WOMAN'S ERA.</p>

                  <p>Two important reasons exist for taking physical exercise. Health depends upon it and it strengthens body, mind and face, and beautifies them.</p>
                  <p>The person who takes no exercise, who performs no physical labor, who does not develop the muscles of the body, is, as a rule, weaker, less healthy, and more apt to contract diseases, than is the person who by physical exercise strengthens and develops the muscles.</p>
                  <p>Fortunate indeed is the girl endowed with beauty, grace and mind. She is a power, an influential centre around which constantly revolve opportunities for usefulness. These three are mutually dependent. The cultivation of one alone is done at the expense of the other two. And only by developing all does the well balanced, well proportioned and strong woman result. Very often the homeliest faced girl may obtain this proportion by regulated exercise and study. There is no royal road to a graceful, elegant body, as there is not to a cultured mind. <sic corr="?">health results.</sic>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the muscles of the back are weak and unable to keep it erect and to hinder a cramping of the abdominal organs, curvature or crookedness will result, and worse still, the spinal column will be weakened, and all or very many of the nervous diseases which come from a weak spine will follow as well as general debility, and the worse forms of nervous irritability.</p>
                  <p>Many people not born beautiful may become so by physical exercise, proper habits and mental and moral development. A beautiful face with a weak, unhealthy body is all object of pity, A strong, active mind burdened with such a body loses much of its power and usefulness. While a sound, healthy body without grace and uncontrolled by refinement and intelligence makes its owner but a little better than any other healthy animal.</p>
                  <p>If sufficient exercise is not taken, respiration, or breathing, is poor, and, as a result, the elastic wall of the chest is either not fully expanded or becomes abnormally contracted. The lungs from this cause are unable to supply the blood with oxygen, the great blood purifier, and consequently the surest means for disease of heart and lungs follow.</p>
                  <p>If the muscles of the abdomen are neglected and left undeveloped, they cannot aid in strengthening digestion and breathing. By digestion blood is formed from the food we eat, and if digestion is poor, the formation of healthy blood is hindered; and if the breathing is not strong and good, the blood is not purified, and bad<sic corr="health results."/> To acquire either requires hard, earnest work, much industry and courage.</p>
                  <p>A face was never made permanently beautiful by cosmetics. Wholesome, healthy beauty is from within. It cannot be secured by any system of veneer. Strong, sound lungs, healthy muscles and easy, graceful limbs cannot develop when confined in stays and girdles. The mind surrounded by narrow and bad influences becomes dwarfed and weakened. The soul which is broadened by contact with other souls, which feeds on noble thoughts, is quickened by noble deeds and aids in making the weak strong, and better and happier, will soften and often make beautiful the hard, unchiseled, and irregular lines of the homeliest face. Both body and soul must have room in which to grow and neither must be poisoned or weakened by drugs or evil surroundings.</p>
                  <p>Before speaking of the kind of exercise to be taken something must be said about food, ventilation of living rooms, dress and bathing.</p>
                  <p>Food makes blood and blood makes flesh and muscle. The better suited the food, the better will be the blood, the flesh and the muscle. Any food which weakens the digestive organs ought to be avoided. Too much greasy and highly spiced or very rich food is a great enemy to good digestion. Generally speaking, plain wholesome food which can be easily digested, and which contains sufficient nutriment, is the food which ought to he eaten at regular intervals.</p>
                  <p>The juices of meats contain the best nutrition, and meats, beef, veal and fish, lose their value as food in proportion to the destruction of this nutrition by boiling and salting. Milk and eggs are eas- <ref target="we1.02.30">(Continued on page 15.)</ref>

                  <p>A series of accidents which would have been ridiculous had they not been so nearly tragic, befell our last issue after going to press; our paper was consequently delayed in appearance for several days. This is deeply regretted by us and we feel that we must apologize to the many kind friends, who have received this venture with so much sympathy and enthusiasm. In spite of its late appearance and rather too frequent typographical errors, we think that we are justified in speaking of the many compliments upon the appearance of our <sic corr="paper">pape</sic> received by us. "Blowing one's own horn," vulgar as we consider it, is considered by many in this day and time, legitimate business. We have no intention, however, of indulging in this all too common pastime, but in the face of the almost eloquent silence with which our paper has been received by contemporaries, we feel that we must speak and express our gratitude for the enthusiastic personal endorsement received by us. For the rest, good work tells; we appeal to and expect to be supported by the strongest women of the country, women who will appreciate a high class paper and recognize one when seen.</p>

                  <p>The growth and development of women's clubs is little less than marvelous; thinking people who at first gave little attention to the movement, have been forced to stop and seriously consider the meaning of such an uprising. Organized woman is showing herself to be a tremendous power, and happily a power almost without exception for good.</p>
                  <p>In the general movement, the colored women of America have felt the quickening influence and are responding nobly. Washington, New York, Kansas City, Boston, Chicago, New Bedford, Providence, and Lawrence can all boast clubs of women organized for mutual improvement and for good works. The impulse and general plan of work of each of these leagues is the same, and yet, each adapts its work to the special needs of its members and its community, that this is so, shows the spontaneity and value of the movement.</p>
                  <p>This organization of colored women means much; through it our women are brought more closely in touch with the world and the great questions of the day; by organization, not only are their own minds and talents strengthened and developed, but they are enabled to give a helping hand to those less favored; through it the inspiration of congeniality is felt, besides this each organization is a strong factor for the general elevation of the race.</p>
                  <p>A certain independence of action in the leagues is admirable, but still, even here the power of organization should be recognized and used, a general interest in each other's work is not enough to gain the greatest power. To do the most good the leagues should be united to a certain degree.</p>
                  <p>The especial work of this paper, is the binding together of our women's clubs, to give a knowledge of the aims and works of each to help in every way their growth and advancement and bring the colored women together in great and powerful organization for the growth and progress of the race. To this end the WOMAN'S ERA urges the holding of a <sic corr="convention.">conventionr</sic>

                  <docDate>Tuesday, May 1, 1894</docDate>
                  <p>In his very admirable and searching address delivered in this city, April 16th, judge Albion W. Tourgee proposed as a remedy to prevent the lynching of colored people at the South, that the country where lynchings occur be compelled by law to pension the wife and children of the murdered man. This, he said would make murder costly and in self defense the local authorities would put a stop to it. At first blush, this is an attractive suggestion. But why not hang the murderers? Why make a distinction between the murderers of white men and the murderers of colored men? If the punishment for murder is hanging why hang the murderer in one case and in the other let the murderer go free and exact of the county a fine? If an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the rule in one case why should it not be the rule in the other case? No, the truth is this, nothing is to be expected from the South. The colored people must look to the general government. It has a right to their services and lives in time of war. They have a right to its protection certainly in time of peace. It is idle to say that it must leave to state governments the protection of the lives of its citizens. Why not leave to state governments the punishment

of counterfeiters? If the United States government can protect money, the property of its citizens against destruction at the hands of the counterfeiter, it can protect the owners of the property against loss of life at the hands of the murderer. It is an astounding proposition that a great nation is powerful enough to stop white <sic corr="moonshiners">moonshines</sic> from making whiskey but is unable to prevent the moonshiners or any one else from murdering its citizens. It can protect corn but cannot protect life. It can prevent the sale of tobacco unless the seller pays a revenue to the government but it cannot protect its citizens at any price. It can go to war, spend millions of dollars and sacrifice thousands of lives to avenge the death of a naturalized white citizen slain by a foreign government on foreign soil, but cannot spend a cent to protect a loyal, native-born colored American murdered without provocation by native or alien in Alabama. Shame on such a government! The administration in power is particeps criminis with the murderers. It can stop lynching, and until it does so, it has on its hands the innocent blood of its murdered citizens.</p>

                  <p>Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the manner in which the telling blows of judge Tourgee were given in his recent Boston speech, all will agree that they were effective -in stirring up healthy discussion and even warm controversy among good friends of the cause he came to advocate. It is however only the old difference of means to a desired end. The methods of the christian soldier appeal most to one side, while those of the earnest student into cause and effect impress the other. Who shall say which is doing most? All kinds of methods are needed to be tried to meet the infinite <sic corr="variety">varity</sic> of objections to the human rights of the negro in this country. In their different ways both Judge Tourgee and Wm. Loyd Garrison are conscientiously playing their parts and both are proven friends of the needy negro. In the intense earnestness for the cause that absorbs him, that courageous champion Albion Tourgee rides rough shod to his mark. He wields a free lance and cuts right and left in placing the responsibility for the continued lawlessness of the South on the people of the North, black and white, for their apathy and indifference. Individuals churches and other organization, all came in for a share of the scathing rebuke of this wounded martyr to the cause of exact justice. If the words uttered by this man with a mission blunt and forceable as they were, shall prove effective in injecting some of his self-sacrificing ardor into the young man who now contents himself with only criticism of the ways and means used by those who are doing the work and bearing the odium of this unpopular cause, then may we hope for a speedy recognition of the futility of mere talk in the vindication of his race manhood. Let him show his credentials for something contributed worthy the seriousness of the situation.</p>
                  <p>Membership in the Citizens' Rights Association should be the smallest receipt accepted of any colored person, man or woman for the privilege of <sic corr="criticizing">citisizing</sic> those who are showing their faith by their works.</p>

                  <p>The Chautauquan for October last contains an articled entitled "The Southern Negro Women," by Olive Ruth Jefferson. Although several months have <sic corr="elapsed">elasped</sic> since its publication, it is worthy of special mention in a journal devoted to the interests of <sic corr="colored women">colorod wemen</sic>.</p>
                  <p>Miss Jefferson says very truly that the soul of civilization is incarnate in womankind, and the type finally assumed by any race of people can be best prophesied by a careful <sic corr="study">stndy</sic> of its superior womanhood. She advocates that the Negroes have an unquestioned right to all the opportunities of American citizenship, and speaks of what the Negro woman has endured through unknown centuries of paganism, and more than two centuries of bondage. She states that there are certain qualities that uniformly appear in the Negro women of the better sort. Among these she names the genius of good manners, a prodigious capacity for hard work, a boundless love for childhood and homemaking, and a natural love for the beautiful. The entire article is very encouraging, and cannot help but elevate Negro womanhood in the minds of all who may read it.</p>
                  <p>The old saying that "A prophet is not without honor save in his own country," does not apply to <sic corr="Judge">Jndge</sic> Tourgee. <sic corr="Although">Althongh</sic> not a native of North Carolina, he has been so long identified with that state that it is practically his home. And that he is not without honor is evidenced by the universal esteem and veneration with which he is regarded by the colored people of Greenboro and vicinity. He is unvariably referred to as a friend and benefactor of those persons with whom he has come in contact during his residence there, and they take great pride in pointing out his home to strangers.</p>
                  <p>Judge Tourgee possesses a thorough knowledge of human nature and sees clearly the motives that actuate men, and the causes that produce effects and events. He has, moreover, a genuine <sic corr="sympathy">symphathy</sic> for the oppressed, and that deep insight into character which classifies and discriminates between the individuals of a race that, is generally treated as a whole. Many of the characters of his early volumes are still living in the vicinity of his home, and the thrilling incidents related by him, are corroborated by the participants.</p>
                  <p>George W. Cable's new novel, "John March, Southerner," which is being published in serial form in Scribner's Magazine, deals with the same period of time as does several of Judge Tourgee's novels, the period of Reconstruction. These years, immediately following the close of the war, will furnish a subject for the novelist, the historian, the philosopher and the statesman for many years to come. </p>
                  <p>There is a revival of interest in Napoleon that is phenomenal in its extent and intensity. A distinguished Frenchman has remarked that "Napoleon has again hypnotised the French people." The Century will shortly publish a history of his life which contains much new <sic corr="material">materal</sic> furnished by lately discovered manuscripts and the latest developments of research. Thus far no history has appeared in either England or France that is wholly without malice, and which conforms to the laws of historical criticism. A full statement of his <sic corr="career">carrer</sic>, and its effect on subsequent history can be best written by an American whose judgement would be uninfluenced by <sic corr="partisanship">partizanship</sic>.</p>
                  <p>Although the reading of light novels may be a frivolous waste of time, and if carried to excess positively harmful, yet a wholesome light story is both refreshing and restful, <sic corr="especially">epecially</sic> to those whose reading is in the line of study. It paints a picture that quickly fades into indistinctness, but leaves behind a pleasant impression. A few light novels wisely interposed between serious study, break the current of habitual thought and invite a return to more normal and less strained conditions of mind. They who can take the novel of the day for what it is worth and make the right use of it, have learned that the mind needs recreation as truly as the body needs exercise. But this is a good habit that can very easily become a bad one.</p>
                  <p>At a recent meeting of Sorosis the question was discussed whether fairy stories should be told to children. Many were of the opinion that they did more harm than good; yet there were many who made a strong plea for them. It seems a pity that childhood should be robbed of its fondest delusions, but the children who in this practical age really believe in <sic corr="fairies">faries</sic> are few indeed. In the case of a nervous child who would be haunted in the dark by visions of unfriendly imaginary folks, the harm might be averted if the storyteller would take pains to impress upon the mind of the little one that it was all "only make-believe."</p>
                  <p>In reading the Literary Passions of Mr. Howells, one cannot help but notice at what an early age he was reading the best literature. This seems to be true of most of the men who became eminent in afterlife. We find The Pilgrim's Progress and Fox's Book of Martyrs among the first books read by several of our leaders in <sic corr="thought; ">thouht ;g</sic> books that the youth of today find far from interesting or entertaining reading. This may be due not so much to the difference in taste, as to the fact that entertaining reading matter is much more easily obtained now than it was earlier in the century. And since the best literature can be obtained as easily as that of an inferior quality it is the duty of every one to see that young people read the best from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>The millions who reverence the name of William Lloyd Garrison will heartily welcome the story of his life as told by his children. It is published in four volumes by Houghton Mifflin &#x0026; Co.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR GIRLS: </salute>
                  <p>Last month I said a few words to you about the importance of reading, and now I will tell you of a reading club in which I <sic corr="am">om</sic> interested.</p>
                  <p>A half dozen girls formed a reading class for mutual improvement. They were not particularly interested in any one subject, but thought the hours spent in desultory reading might be made <sic corr="profitable">prufitable</sic> as well as pleasurable.</p>
                  <p>They agreed to meet once a <sic corr="fortnight">fr tnigh</sic> to discuss whatever work they <sic corr="might">migh</sic> have read in the meantime.</p>
                  <p>The first book assigned, was "The Scarlet Letter" because it is classed as one of, if not the very best, of novels. Copies of the Salem Edition of the
<pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
book were purchased for the small sum of eighteen cents and each member of the class read it before the initial meeting.</p>
                  <p>At that meeting, one read a short sketch of the life of Nathaniel Hawthorne; another, an article on Brook Farm Community; whilst others read short impressions of different characters in the story.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, at that time Richard Mansfield was playing at one of the leading, theatres, and "The Scarlet Letter" was in his <sic corr="repertoire">repertore</sic>. The girls attended the play and although the story, being the history of a <sic corr="human">hnman</sic> heart, is absolutely incapable of being adequately dramatized, still the times, in which the tale is located, are accurately portrayed by the drama in question.</p>
                  <p>When the book was discussed, we had various opinions on its merits. (I think young people are perhaps after all the truest critics. They are not apt to be biased by the opinions of this or that eminent writer, and go at once to the root of the matter for themselves.)</p>
                  <p>One girl could see no reason why it should be classed among the great novels. She thought it morbid and dull, showing, evidently, she preferred mere narrative to minute dissections of a human conscience. Another girl could find no words to equal her admiration for this really fine book and read extract after extract of the best passages.</p>
                  <p>The paper on Brook Farm led to a discussion on communities in general, and the club decided to devote some time to searching for information on that subject.</p>
                  <p>Some of the books suggested for reading were Plato's "Ideal Republic," Sir Thomas Moore's "<sic corr="Utopia">Utophia</sic>," Bulwers Lytton's "Coming Race," Bellamy' "Looking Backwards," Life of Laurence Oliphant," "The Oneida Community," and a visit was planned for the coming summer, to the Shaker settlement a few miles from our city.</p>
                  <p>The members decided to read at least one half-hour each day or pay a small fine for every day omitted. The money was to be used in purchasing new books.</p>
                  <p>At the second meeting, "Adam Bede," by George Elliot was discussed.</p>
                  <p>Each member reported not only having read the required time, but so interested had they become in the work on hand, that they had spent a great deal of time in the libraries.</p>
                  <p>One read a paper on George Elliot's two marriages; another, on George Lewes' life and works; still, another read extracts from George Elliot's "Life and Letters" by Cross, her second husband.</p>
                  <p>These papers were crude, faulty and perhaps anything but well written, but they aimed only to give information for if 'reading makes the full man' certainly 'writing makes the exact one.'</p>
                  <p>An article on "Dinah" brought up the subject of women as preachers. Much was said pro and con on the subject and finally, the club decided to subscribe to "The Woman's Column" so that they might know what women were doing everywhere.</p>
                  <p>Time nor space will not allow me to report each meeting but enough has been said to show the plan of the work in which this class is engaged.</p>
                  <p>During the winter among the works read and discussed were "Romola," "Life of Savanola," Auerbach's "On the Height," "Henry Esmond" "Life of Thackeray," and Prof. Horsford's "Norumbega."</p>
                  <p>A marked improvement was noted in the papers submitted to the club, some of them reaching the dignity of being considered well written essays and accepted as such, in their school tasks.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">SOCIAL ETIQUETTE.</head>
                  <p>Among many residents of our large cities who do not pose as or desire to be "au fait" society people and yet who take pleasure in the small enjoyments of calling and entertaining, it is often a problem just how much formality should be regarded by them towards their friends. It is often thought that the simplicity of their mode of living precludes the necessity of conformation to the rigid laws established by Dame Etequette in this particular; at least, it is so thought for a time, but eventually comes the interruption just in the midst of some important household duty too, that makes us realize that the inconvenience experienced has been self caused, the root of the evil lying at our own door and being nothing less than the thoughtless, friendly invitation to "call at any time," accentuated by a more or less added protestation against formality. Now all of us know that strict, rigid formality would mar the pleasure of any friendly call, but there are a few by-laws, the knowledge of which is essential to make any call a pleasure. So, the next time the unwelcome interruption comes, instead of having the usual behind the scene monologue, and each woman knows just how impressive a performance that can be made, suppose we reason with ourselves along the following lines, and see if the observance of a few social laws will not make life smoother.</p>
                  <p>Each woman should have a certain day or days when she is at home to visitors. This designated on the visiting card is all that is necessary.</p>
                  <p>Immediate friends who share the privilege of unlimited entree should remember that each day or some part of it, has its duties. That if dinner is served at six, the call for a chat should not come at five minutes of six. That if <sic corr="nursery">nusery</sic> duties must be attended to at seven, half past seven is a better hour to call than half past six. In fact it has long ago ceased to be the vogue for even one's intimate friends to "drop in." Wisdom, which comes with years, has taught people that no friend is so intimate that there may not be times when she is unwelcome, and one's dearest and nearest bow to the law which suggests the paying of a visit at a time when one's friend's are ready to receive.</p>
                  <p>If you have planned a certain afternoon to see your friends no announcement of their arrival is necessary. You are simply ready to see them. Be sure and dress <sic corr="neatly">ueatly</sic> on such occasions. A house dress consisting of a fancy waist and plain skirt being always in good taste. A tea gown is <sic corr="permissible">permissable</sic> but it must not have the appearance of <sic corr="negligee">negligie</sic>, and a street dress can be worn with approval.</p>
                  <p>The custom of serving refreshments is being regarded with disfavor; the at home day is arranged so that one may surely see one's friends, and these friends come not to dine, but to have a little talk, to announce that one is not forgotten, and then to depart without having caused the hostess any worry or put her to any great expense.</p>
                  <p>When calling on sick friends, it is not always well to see them; an inquiry is sufficient, or if not too ill the friend might appreciate your good wishes sent to her on your visiting card.</p>
                  <p>This is only a little talk on some of the more apparent stumbling blocks, large enough to make it worth while to remove them, and therefore gain an equal proportion of comfort and happiness.</p>

                  <p>The Easter Reception held at Berkley Hall on the evening of the 28th of March, was in every way a success. Excellent music, a good floor and a well arranged order of dances, combined, could not fail to afford a most enjoyable evening to all who participated. Pretty women in pretty <sic corr="gowns">growns</sic> and gallant men in <sic corr="conventional">conventinal</sic> evening attire, formed a most pleasing picture; and it would indeed be a difficult task to assign the belleship in a gathering where youth, beauty and fashion met the eye at every turn.</p>
                  <p>Mr. W. H. Hunt of Lawrence Academy, Groton, and Mr. John Hope of Augusta, Ga., now attending Brown University, Providence, spent their Easter vacation in Boston. Mr. Hunt will enter Harvard in the Fall as will also Mr. Frank Codoza of Washington who spent a short time in Boston last summer.</p>
                  <p>Easter week several informal affairs were given; Thursday evening impromptu dance at Mrs. U. A. Ridley's, in honor of Miss Alice Smith of Newport; Friday evening Mr. and Mrs. E. E. Brown entertained a few friends at their cozy home in the Highlands; Saturday evening, Miss Georgine Glover gave an informal reception in honor of Miss Alice Smith of Newport.</p>
                  <p>Despite the inclemency of the weather, the result of the four days' carnival held by the Woman's Era Club at Odd Fellow's Hall, on North Russell Street, was very satisfactory. The Carnival opened on Tuesday, April 10th, with a reception to the clergy, on Wednesday afternoon and evening the Rosebud Tea reception was given. A prettier sight has seldom been witnessed than the one presented on Thursday, Children's Day. The little ones, <sic corr="daintily">daintly</sic> attired, danced, marched, and played games to their hearts' content. Little Miss Leila Stubbs, a picture in red and white led the march gracefully and well. On Friday evening, the promenade concert was followed by dancing. Little Miss Florence Robinson's fancy dancing was very prettily done.</p>
                  <p>The first of the F. M's Assemblies took place in the Posse Gymnasium on the evening of April 12th, and was a most delightful affair. The Gymnasium, however was not sufficiently lighted, and the pretty gowns did not show off to their best advantage. Fred White's orchestra never played better. The dance was matronized by Mrs. P.A. Glover and Mrs. W.P. Hare; Miss Mereda Gray acted as floor directress with Misses Hare, Glover and Cuney as aids. The guests included Misses Dosia Marsh, Geraldine Pindell, Miss Libbie Watson, Carrie Patterson, Lillian A. Lewis, Hattie Dabney, and Mabel Grant, Messrs. Edward Glover, Samuel Marsh, J. Percy Bond, William P. Hare, Fred Hemmings, Chas. E. Richardson, W.A. Johnson, Eugene Johnson, P.H. Johnson, Edward Richards. Robert T. Teamoh, W.H. Jackson, George Fletcher, Thaddeus Godwin and Robert Sparrow.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lillian Lewis goes to Philadelphia May 7th, to attend the biennial congress at which the New England Woman's Press Association is to be represented. She will remain until the end of the week and will stay at the Metropole.</p>
                  <p>A new club just started in Boston among the young men, is called the Windemere. They hold weekly meetings and their membership includes, Mr. W.P. Hare, E. Glover, W. Arthur Johnson, Mr. Eugene Johnson, Mr. W. H. Jackson, Mr. Fred Hemmings, Edward Richards and Mr. George Fletcher.</p>
                  <p>The Gamlecs were to have been entertained by Miss Annie Hare, the week after Easter, but, owing to the F.M. Assembly, it was postponed until a later date.</p>
                  <p>Mr. W.H. Lewis of Harvard, having undergone a most successful operation upon his nasal member, at the City Hospital has again resumed his studies.</p>
                  <p>Mr. W.A. Johnson spent a few days in Newport last week.</p>
                  <p>Miss Rebecca M. Downing has gone to New York for several weeks, after which she will return to Boston for a few days en route to Newport.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Robert Carter of New Bedford, who has been attending the Medical College in Chicago has fully recovered from his late illness. Dr. Carter who graduated a few weeks ago, has been offered a most remunerative position to practice in the East. He is expected in Boston early next month.</p>
                  <p>Baby Constance Ridley gained the greatest number of votes in the doll contest at the Woman's Era Club carnival and was the happy recipient of a very big doll almost twice the size of the owner</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Era Club will hold a <sic corr="children's">ehildren's</sic> May festival to be followed by a dance in the evening for the older people.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ednorah Nahar will give a childrens' cantata at Charles Street Church, on Tuesday the 29th of May.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Edwin B. Jourdain, of New Bedford who was on a short visit to her mother, Mrs. Octavia Morse was suddenly called home to at tend the funeral of Mr. John Bush whose death on Thursday the 12th, and is much lamented by a host of friends.</p>
                  <p>Bostonians will hear with regret of the sudden death of Mr. Thomas P. Saunders of Hartford who passed away on Thursday April 12th with heart failure.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Williams of Chelsea are receiving congratulations on the birth of a son.</p>

                  <p>The annual concert of Mr. Samuel Jameison which was given at Steinert Hall on Wednesday evening, April l8th was the annual success it always is, both artistically and financially. These concerts, which are never widely advertised and therefore take the form of semi-private affairs, attract the most cultivated and critical music lovers; the fact that the audience was as large as usual despite the fact that on the same evening the Handel and Hayden society was giving Elijah in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the directorship of Carl Zarrahn, attests to the esteem in which Mr. Jameison is held among musical artists and students. Upon this occasion Mr. Jameison was assisted by Mr. Win. Barton Robinson, basso and Mr. J. C. Manning accompanist. The first number on the programme, concert (No. 2) by Saint Saens (two movements) with the orchestral part played by Mr. Manning opened the concert auspiciously. Mr. Jameison interpreted this number with great <sic corr="breadth">breath</sic> of style <sic corr="and">aud</sic> clean cut <sic corr="technique">techinque</sic>, the two magnificent Steinways responding to every demand made on them.</p>
                  <p>The difficulties of this composition were happily met by the artist and the individuality with which it was rendered made this eminent French composer's work most enjoyable in the hearing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jameison's other numbers consisted of a group of compositions by Edward Schutt, Rubinstein and the Rhapsodies Hongroise No. 15 by Liszt.</p>
                  <p>In all of these Mr. Jameison reflected great credit on himself, never having appeared to better advantage than on this occasion the result of his hard and constant study being always en evidence.</p>
                  <p>The audience was large and <sic corr="enthusiastic">enthusiasic</sic>, and although the colored people present were comparatively few (a fact to be regretted) they represented Boston's solid social worth and that exclusiveness which is brought out only on rare occasions.</p>
                  <p>At the Tourgee lecture the other evening Mr. Sydney Woodward sang "The Star Spangled Banner" in his usual acceptable syle, but the sentiment of the Song brought out a scathing rebuke from <sic corr="the">he</sic> courageous judge who declared that if there was anything more false and stupid than a white man calling this the land of the free and the home of the brave could be found in a black man doing it. A dead calm fell upon the audience which was suddenly broken by loud applause and laughter.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Nellie Brown Mitchell will sing at the Hon. Fred Douglaas lecture at the Peoples' Church May 10th.</p>
                  <p>It is rumored that Lucille Saunders who is making quite a hit in the "Maid of Plymouth" given by the Bostonians, is Miss Minnie Saunders daughter of the late Prince Saunders of Hartford Conn.</p>
                  <p>Mr. McAdoo's Concert Company is still touring through Australia but contemplates doing Japan and India ere long.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Maggie Porter Cole is singing with success in the Bermudes.</p>

                  <p>As soon as she had gone, Mrs Brougham sat down in the armchair to think it over.</p>
                  <p>The fire burnt low; the kettle boiled dry, and the meat burned to a cinder but still she sat there.</p>
                  <p>"I might have known it all along," she soliloquized. "Don't he always go to the office past Jane Myrtle's cottage. To be sure it is the shortest way, but John never used to mind a walk, and then he said he had to visit her school lately. Of course he is one of the school committee, still there are other schools besides the one Jane Myrtle teaches. Now,--yes, now I think of it many things prove that he is false. Didn't he say that plain bonnets were more becoming than gaudy ones, and quoted Jane Myrtle as an example. How blind I've been."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Brougham, on his way home stopped and bought his wife a set of garnets she had long admired. He entered the house intending to give his wife the ornaments and say something about their wedding day which was not long ago, either. Full of these thoughts he entered, and when he found no dinner prepared he became seriously alarmed.</p>
                  <p>"What can be the matter?" he asked himself.</p>
                  <p>"Why, Maria, what has happened?" he inquired, on finding her sitting disconsolate before the stove. He thought she had either heard of the sudden death of some of her relatives or was seriously ill.</p>
                  <p>At the sound of his voice, Mrs. Brougham started to her feet and the most casual observer would have noticed how deathly pale she was and Mr. Brougham, who was well acquainted with her, saw at once that a storm was about to burst, for what reason he knew not.</p>
                  <p>"Are you sick?" he asked helplessly.</p>
                  <p>"Sick! yes, sick at heart," she answered, "but what more had I to expect?" "Why did you take me a happy, innocent girl from my father's house to be insulted in this manner? I'm sorry I ever saw you."</p>
                  <p>"Maria, what is the meaning of this? Have you suddenly lost your senses?"</p>
                  <p>"O yes, lost my senses! Probably Jane Myrtle had not lost hers."</p>
                  <p>"What has Jane Myrtle to do with it? I cannot imagine her acting in this inexplicable manner."</p>
                  <p>"That's right. Do take her part. Just what I expected!" and Mrs. Brougham burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"I repeat that I am utterly at a loss to understand what you mean," replied Mrs. Brougham.</p>
                  <p>"O, you cruel, hard-hearted villain, nothing is too cruel for you to do or say," answered his wife.</p>
                  <p>"What have I done?" again demanded Mr. Brougham, in an angry tone.</p>
                  <p>"Done?" again replied Mrs. Brougham, as the memory of her wrongs came over her, she lost control over herself and bestowed epithet after epithet upon Mr. Brougham. He lost his temper also and a violent quarrel ensued which ended in his saying that she might return to her father as soon as she liked and apply for a divorce at once, in fact the sooner, the better. Taking up his hat, he went out and slammed the door.</p>
                  <p>So the day begun so auspiciously, bid fair to end disastrously enough, owing to the wind and a meddlesome busybody. Mrs. Brougham went to her chamber and began preparing for her departure.</p>
                  <p>"I shall return home," she kept repeating; "but first I'll let Jane Myrtle know what I think of her." Mrs. Brougham therefore, dressed herself as carefully as if she was going to make a ceremonious call and started for Miss Myrtle's cottage.</p>
                  <p>Within a few rods of the house, she met her nephew.</p>
                  <p>"Whither bound this windy day?" he inquired.</p>
                  <p>"I am going to make a call," she answered compressing her lips.</p>
                  <p>Just then a gust of wind coming around a corner nearly took them off their feet, and blowing off Mrs. Brougham's veil lodged it in the snow.</p>
                  <p>Her nephew caught it, returned it to her and remarked, "The wind seems to have a grudge against your family. You ought to have seen Uncle John this morning, the wind blew away his pocket handkerchief and he stood looking up and down just as if he could not think what had become of it."</p>
                  <p>"Where were you,?<sic corr="&#34;"/> inquired Mrs. Brougham, eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"Home," looking out of the window he answered.</p>
                  <p>Then a bright thought entered Mrs. Brougham's head that perhaps Miss Myrtle found the article the wind blew away but she rejected it instantly.</p>

                  <p>ily digested and good food, as are wheat, rice, potatoes, turnips, beets. carrots, parsnips and fruit. Chocolate or cocoa powdered and mixed with water or milk heated to the boiling point is refreshing and highly nutritious. All these foods are more or less valuable as blood and strength producers as they are properly or improperly prepared and eaten. The time of eating must be regular and the amount of food at each meal must be neither too much nor too little. As a general rule for an active person two and a half pounds of solid food and three pints of liquid food and three pints of water make a day's allowance.</p>
                  <p>The tone, the health and life of the human body are dependent upon the blood. And the health, the strength and life-giving quality of the blood depend upon the food we eat and the air we breathe. Air is mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen, four parts of the former and one part of the-latter, And when air is deprived of its oxygen it will not support human life. And each time that the same air passes through the lungs it loses a part of its oxygen. The blood starts from the heart fresh and pure and strong. It goes through the arteries to various parts of the body, deposits its nutrition or flesh making qualities, and then goes back through the veins to the heart again. On its return before reaching the heart, it passes through the lungs and exchanges the carbonic acid gas which it has gathered in going about the body, and which will not support animal life, for oxygen, which is necessary to the support of animal life.</p>
                  <p>If the blood does not exchange its carbonic acid gas for <sic corr="oxygen">orygen</sic> when it goes through the lungs on its way back to the heart, it becomes sluggish, loses its tone and health and instead of carrying nutrition and health and life to all parts of the body, it carries poison and we quickly see the result in pale faces, physical weakness, nervousness, depressed spirits, sallow complexions, weak minds and stunted growth.</p>
                  <p>How different is the result of vigorous blood, full of oxygen and life. The person who breathes fresh air, not air already breathed by himself or other persons once or many times, will grow up strong, ruddy, active, with healthy body, skin and brain; and in condition for the very best physical and mental work.</p>
                  <p>Too much emphasis cannot be put upon the necessity for an abundance of pure, fresh air in the sleeping room, the sitting room, the school room, concert hall, lecture room, sick room, and wherever time is spent. Wearing apparel, bedding, rugs, carpets, and indeed every thing that can hold disease germs ought to be thoroughly aired each day.</p>
                  <p>Dressing is a matter of taste as well as health. One of the most satisfactory evidences of the progress of women is seen in the change from a style of tight lacing and tight dressing which cause the body to grow out of natural symmetry and grace, for a style of easy, comfortable and sensible dressing which allows the limbs to have free play and gives the blood a chance to circulate and flow to all parts of the body. Lacing and tight waists compress the liver and stomach and interfere with the movements of the diaphragm; this often causes headache, dyspepsia, shortness of breath, womb disease, weak back and many, many aches and pains. Women are beginning to learn that it is better to dress for health than for style, and, that the best dressing is that which aids and does not hinder healthy growth.</p>
                  <p>When taking physical <sic corr="exercise">exereise</sic> the dress should be light and loose, and so made that the limb can have free and easy play in all directions.</p>
                  <p>Any rule regulating bathing must be elastic. Too much bathing is as dangerous as too little is bad. Frequent cold water sponge baths properly taken are among the best aids to good health because they strengthen the skin and keep it free from the impurities which the body is constantly trying to throw off through the pores. The best time for the bath is immediately after rising because the body is then rested and the circulation is at the best. Bathing immediately before or after a meal should be avoided because the rubbing removes the blood from the stomach to the surface. Care must be taken to avoid the shock to a delicate organization given by cold water. Begin with the tepid bath and gradually work up to cold water. All vigorous physical exercise should be followed by a bath to remove the impurities brought to the surface, avoiding a bath while the body is too heated. Take it after the heart has begun to beat normally and follow it with brisk rubbing with a coarse towel.</p>

                  <docDate>Friday, June 1, 1894</docDate>
                  <byline>EDNAH D. CHENEY.</byline>
                  <p>Among the most important and successful of the movements of the "Women's Era" is that for opening the Medical profession to Women. I cannot take space enough to narrate the whole history of this interesting movement, which was heralded by the brave work of a few pioneers like Harriot K. Hunt, Elizabeth Blackwell and others, and which has now spread through the civilized world, but I wish to give only a few facts in regard to an institution in our own city which has done a great work for the education of women, as well as for enlightened charity on the broadest principles.</p>
                  <p>It is not the first hospital of this kind in the country, being antedated by a few years, by the New-York Infirmary, and the Hospital connected with the medical college of Philadelphia. It has been followed by the establishment of a large number of hospitals in various parts of the Union, most of which trace their origin directly to the influence to one or other of these three institutions.</p>
                  <p>The New England Hospital grew out of a clinical department in the Old Female Medical College but was established as an entirely independent institution in 1862. This was during the civil war when the public interest was absorbed in the struggle for the preservation of the Union and the emancipation of the Slave. It started without any resources but a little furniture, its brave enthusiastic physician, Dr. M.E. Zakrzewska, and the unlimited faith of its founders in the goodness of their cause and the liberality of New England.</p>
                  <p>The Hospital was incorporated in 1863 and the three women who are named in the act of incorporation are all living, after a period of thirty one years to rejoice in its success.</p>
                  <p>Its object cannot be more briefly stated than in the words of the original By-Laws.</p>
                  <p>1st.-To provide for women medical aid of competent physicians of their own sex.</p>
                  <p>2nd.-To assist educated women in the practical study of medicine.</p>
                  <p>3d.-To train nurses for the care of the sick.</p>
                  <p>These purposes have been strictly carried out.</p>
                  <p>One great incidental good has been the lessening of the prejudice against Hospital treatment in the minds of the poor. So many of the poor women suffering from chronic maladies have found comfort and help from the care of physicians of their own sex, and the administration of the hospital has been so simple and homelike in its character, that women are ready to receive help here that they cannot have in their own homes.</p>
                  <p>I am glad to say that this feeling is not confined to women's hospitals, for the improvement in all hospitals has made them acceptable to the general public, but I still think that the woman physician has had a large influence in producing this good result.</p>
                  <p>The surgical work of the Hospital has been especially important and interesting, and many a woman has been restored to the work and enjoyment of life through the help she has received. The great modern improvements in surgery which have made life saving operations safe, which were considered "unjustifiable," thirty years ago, have made, this a most satisfactory branch of the profession.</p>
                  <p>The Maternity work has outgrown its original limits and is now carried on in a new building appropriately dedicated to two of the greatest benefactors of the cause, Sam'l E. Sewall who as a director of the old
<pb n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
college was the first to insist upon clinical instruction for Women Physicians, and the one who secured the inestimable services of Dr. Zakrzewska; and his noble daughter, Lucy E. Sewall who was first student and afterwards President and Attending Physician of the Hospital, and who served until her death as Attending and advisory Physician.</p>
                  <p>One of the great needs of the management is now that of a new surgical pavilion in which the surgeons can work with the help of all modern conveniences.</p>
                  <p>The object of training nurses was never lost sight of. This was the first effort in the United States to put this branch of education on a thorough basis, and it was mainly to the fine organizing talent of the lamented Dr Susan Dimoch, that it was indebted for its success. Since that time many similar institutions have been established throughout the country, until now almost every Hospital in the country has one connected with it. The good accomplished by these schools is very great, they give to the Physician and surgeon a trained ally who can carry out his orders intelligently, and thus often enable him to make fewer visits and yet treat the case more efficiently. The comfort to the patient is inestimable, and anxious friends have a helper whose skill and fidelity is guaranteed by those who have long watched her course.</p>
                  <p>Another incidental advantage of both the Hospital and the Training School is the instruction thus given to the families of the patients, in the care of the sick, and the principles of Hygiene.</p>
                  <p>But while joyfully recounting the admirable work done by other hospitals and training schools in our city and elsewhere, I am afraid that the New England stands alone in her honorable record of entire and equal justice to all races and colors. She has always received patients of every race, and the Negro, the Indian, the Anglo Saxon, and I believe the Malay have been seen lying side by side in their little beds receiving each the same tender and loving care.</p>
                  <p>When a colored girl applied for admission to the training school it was feared by that the existing prejudices might cause a feeling that would be injurious to the patients, but the Directors refused to take counsel of such fears and quietly carried out their own broad views. Since that time, some seventeen years ago, many colored pupils have been admitted to the school after passing the usual careful investigation into their character and attainments.</p>
                  <p>I am happy to say that these pupils have been up to the average of the school in their standing as pupils, and in one or two cases, at least, have been superior in their qualifications, and have held high positions in the school. In no instance, to my knowledge, has there been any objection made by patients to them on account of their color; on the contrary they have often been decided favorites.</p>
                  <p>While I am very anxious to extend this work among the colored people both at the North and the South, believing that it is a noble profession for which they are well adapted, I wish to add a caution that it is one that requires superior character and intelligence, and a good thorough English education. It is very desirable that candidates should be graduates of high schools.</p>
                  <p>It is especially important that colored nurses should have good education and previous training, because they will be much needed for superintendents of Training schools in the institutions at the South.</p>
                  <p>Colored pupils have also been received as internes or resident students of Medicine. All internes must have the diploma of a college in good standing. The East Indian, Dr. Joshee, was received by exceptional favor for a few months, but unfortunately her health failed and she was obliged to leave.</p>
                  <p>The Hospital is, open to visitors between two and four o'clock p.m., and the Superintendent will be happy to give full information in regard to it.</p>

                  <docDate>Friday, June 1, 1894</docDate>

                  <p>The liquor traffic in all its worst features is an especial outrage upon the decent poor. The vice of drinking is not confined to the lower order of society. It is not the working man who supports the barrooms attached to expensive hotels or the fashionable restaurants. And it is a fact that the thousands who make up
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the membership of the various temperance organizations are almost entirely of the working class.</p>
                  <p>But the sober working man is compelled to suffer from the annoying and degrading neighborhood of the saloon, with its offensive and revolting sights and sounds and odors. Writing in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> a few years since, George Frederick Parsons says:--"The prosperous taxpayer, who grumbles at the levies made upon wine, may be thankful that his bank account secures him at least partial freedom from the worst products of the saloon. The poor mechanic, whose narrow earnings compel him to accept the <hi rend="italic">life of the tenement house,</hi> cannot shelter himself in the same way. He may be a temperate man himself. He may be a Christian. He may be desirous of raising his family respectably, and of keeping them untainted. But the polluting contiguity which poverty compels makes him an involuntary witness and auditor of all the brutalities and obscenities provoked by drink in the most depraved of his neighbors, and he cannot keep from the ears of his wife or daughters sights and sounds, which in themselves constitute infection."</p>
                  <p>It is <hi rend="italic">the vote of the wealthy class</hi> which is largely responsible for the forcing of the liquor traffic upon the community. It is an acknowledged fact that at the city election of 1892 it was the vote of the Back Bay district which prevented Boston from obtaining a majority in favor of "no license." If the right of local option were extended so as to cover the wards and precincts of the city, and the citizens who vote to license the rum shops were compelled to have them in their own districts, a large proportion of the saloons would be found in the aristocratic quarters of Boston instead of as at present being crowded into the poorer localities.</p>
                  <p>It is an obvious injustice that the poor man should have the saloon forced upon him by the rich man's vote.</p>
                  <p>Another injustice to the well-doing poor, is the fact that the working class, as a whole, is very often judged by the conduct of the meanest and lowest specimen, Often <hi rend="italic">an excuse for keeping wages down</hi> is found in the fact that many men spend a large proportion of their earnings in drink.</p>
                  <p>Again, the man of dissipated habits, no matter what his skill may be, is forced, in order to retain employment at all, to accept work at any price. There are employers who are not slow to avail themselves of this fact, and too often the sober workman finds the price of his labor reduced by reason of the bad habits of his fellow craftsman.</p>
                  <p>It has become the common usage to make excuses for drinking among the lower classes on the plea that they are driven to it by their poverty. "Let him drink and forget his woe," it is said. I sometimes wonder whether a little of the sympathy given to the working man, whose hard conditions have driven him to drink, would not be better bestowed upon his wife and children, whose miseries are augmented by every dram which he takes to drown his own.</p>

                  <p>This branch of nursing is considered by nurses and doctors as very hard work. Special aptitude, as well as education is necessary, the nurse should be a good reliable woman, firm, kind and gentle, able to carry out orders with discretion, be cheerful and even tempered, having a love for her work. If she loves her work and is qualified, it would be better to have her even not trained, because often trained nurses are a failure in this branch. Appearances of disease are alike in children, and they (the children) act themselves, and we are able to tell by their actions the seat of their pain.</p>
                  <p>If the love and confidence of the child are won, it is easier
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
to manage it, and this promotes its well-being and improvement. Power not only to observe, but ability to interpret observation is very necessary. Always find out the most important symptoms and indications; the position, appearance and manner of the child are indicative, and the physician relies on the nurse for these.</p>
                  <p>The care of a spoiled child is very hard work; if it were in a hospital it would naturally do as the other children. If the child will not take the medicine or nourishment, the nurse must insist, and compel him to do so. It is better to be truthful and tell the child you are going to hurt him, rather than pretend you are not, when you know better. If the medicine is unpleasant, tell the child before giving it, under no conditions deceive him or let him lose confidence in you.</p>
                  <p>The less he is handled the better: the room where he is sick ought to be light and sunny, with good ventilation, cheerful and pretty. Everything unnecessary ought to be removed, carpets taken up, the medicines, utensils, and plenty of hot water ought to be kept in a little adjoining room. A small oil-stove is always convenient for the use of the nurse. Assume control of the room, do not allow too many to be over it, only one head is necessary. Illness is more visible in children than older people as their organism is delicate and reacts quicker. They generally become <hi rend="italic">suddenly</hi> ill, and either <hi rend="italic">suddenly</hi> improve or die. There is seldom any lingering. In the simplest trouble temperature generally rises and vomiting occurs; other children ought to be kept away. The sick child ought to be lightly fed, bowels attended to. When a medical attendant is called tell the <hi rend="italic">symptoms,</hi> order of development, severe or not, <hi rend="italic">dejections</hi> and <hi rend="italic">urine.</hi> Take temperature always by rectum; pulse and respiration when asleep; a slow pulse is more ominous than a quick one, it may possibly be caused by brain pressure.</p>
                  <p>Subjective symptoms, those which we see, crying, colic, blue color of the mouth. In lung trouble there are low, short moans, a raising of shoulders and head. Sharp screams generally indicate brain trouble. In abdominal trouble the legs are drawn up, the child generally lying on his back. In brain and spinal diseases there is stiffness of the head, muscles of the neck drawn back. Observe closely the condition of the body when undressed, in all cases, for scarlet fever or measles may-be the trouble.</p>
                  <p>If he is to be examined, have him already when the doctor comes, the clothing loosened, and a warm blanket to put the child in, also warm towels for use. Don't let him see the preparations; never let him see hot applications, leeches, etc. Cover the leech with cotton if you have occasion to use it, and when it drops off, bathe well the bitten part, and bandage.</p>
                  <p>Enemas are given for diarrhoea and constipation; also for food, in cases where the child cannot take it by mouth. Always keep a baby clean, bathe every day, have everything around it clean. A draw sheet is a great help. For a bath, put a tub of water, the right temperature, covered with a sheet, into the room where the bath is to be given, after the child has been prepared, then lower the sheet into the water with him on it. The child should be undressed before the water is gotten ready, and warmly wrapped in blankets. When a sponge bath has to be given, just turn him from side to side, in so doing you will prevent bed sores. Keep up the appetite, feed systematically; never waken unless very weak; towards morning give nourishment. An extra jacket over night shirt, and flannel shirt next the skin, keeps the patient very comfortable.</p>
                  <p>A surgical gown ought to be open all the way down. The child, after a surgical operation should be put to bed on a firm mattress, with sheets very smooth, oftentimes it is necessary to keep a rubber bed pan under him.</p>

                  <p>What Prominent Women have to say.</p>
                  <p>The WOMAN'S ERA believes that the time is ripe for a convention of the colored women of the country. To agitate the subject it proposes to publish the views of influential women.</p>
                  <p>The letters below are in answer to the following questions.</p>
                  <p>1. Do you favor a convention of the colored women's Clubs, leagues and societies?</p>
                  <p>2.- What in your -opinion is the most available place and time for such a congress?</p>
                  <p>3. State why you do or do not favor a convention.</p>

                           <p>The good women of Boston are deserving of much praise for the largeness of heart and outlook so happily shown in the creation and publication of the WOMAN'S ERA. At the very time when race interest seems at such a low ebb, when our leaders seem tongue-tied, dazed and stupidly inactive in the presence of unchecked lawlessness, and violent resistance to Negro advancement, it is especially fortunate and reassuring to see and feel the rallying spirit of our women voicing itself in words of hope, courage and high resolves in a journal that seems to spring out of the very heart and peculiar needs of our women.</p>
                           <p>I know of no publication having for its existence and possibilities such inspirations and rare opportuneness as your bright journal. The WOMAN'S ERA is the face of our colored women turned upward to the star of hope. It is the timely message of love and sympathy from colored women to women everywhere. It happily suggests that we can do so much for each other in all the most important interests of our lives, that we will have more time and reason for courage than for despair. To thousands of our women your paper will come as the first intimation of the wideness of the world about them and the stretch of human interest and sympathy. Thousands of them will discover their own strength and a certain sense of importance in this gradual coming together of our women all over the land in clubs and leagues organized for high purposes.</p>
                           <p>Referring to the proposition of holding a convention or congress of colored women's clubs, I feel like suggesting a word of caution against too much eagerness for mere spectacular demonstration of our present enthusiasm for good works. It must readily occur to the more thoughtful readers of the WOMAN'S ERA that large conferences of women inexperienced in the functions of deliberative bodies and without well defined and settled policies of action would be fraught with as many possibilities of evil as of good. We should be careful to avoid the examples of our colored men, whose innumerable Conventions, Councils and Conferences during the last twenty-five years have all begun in talk and ended in talk. We should not degrade our own high purposes into what as yet must be a mere imitation of the methods and work of long established Woman's Clubs. I believe that it is possible for us to work out, define and pursue a kind of club work that will be original, peculiarly suitable to our peculiar needs and that will distinguish our work essentially from the white women's clubs.</p>
                           <p>But I do not want to be understood as opposing a convention of colored women's clubs, or underestimating the large benefits that could certainly result from a conference of our representative women. But having in mind the many and peculiar weaknesses that have too frequently brought the meetings of some of the most intelligent women of the country into ill-repute, I believe it would be wiser for us to postpone the holding of such a conference two or three years, or until we are able to make such a conference impressive and grandly significant by a display of thoughtfulness, definiteness of purpose, and the presentation of facts and figures relative to work done and planned to be done. By extending in every direction the organization of these leagues or clubs, by bringing into them every good and capable woman, and by educating ourselves in all the more important needs of our home and social life, we shall be able in two or three years to startle the country by a surprising exhibition of good sense, intelligent self-interest and dignity of purpose.</p>

                     <p>On April 15 the women of Providence met with Mrs. Brown of John street and organized the Sojourner South Club for their mutual improvement and development. It was decided that the club should meet every second Wednesday in the month, and that every three months a public meeting should be held. Following are the officers: Mrs. Emory Turner, president; Mrs. Frank Brown and Mrs. Laura Nokar, vice presidents; Mrs. Louise V. Johnson, cor. secretary; Miss Roberta Dunbar, recording secretary; Mrs. Martha Taylor, treasurer. We shall be happy to report progress in our work to the ERA.</p>

                     <p>The last regular meeting of the Woman's Era Club was in the hands of the committee on temperance, Mrs. A. G. Brown (widow of Wm. Wells Brown) chairman. After a recitation by Mrs. Gertrude Cromwell, Miss Jessie Forsyth, the well known temperance worker, addressed the ladies informally. By her fluent, interesting manner, Miss Forsyth made her remarks what is seldom characteristic of temperance remarks, really delightful, as well as forceful. The club went into executive session after the lecture. Mrs. F. R. Ridley, cor. secretary of the club, submitted an open letter to Mrs. Chant, prepared by her for the club's endorsement. The letter was unanimously endorsed, and the club voted to forward it to the different leading pa-

                                 <salute>Dear Mrs. Ormiston Chant:</salute>
                              </opener>
                              <p>One year ago this month the members of the Woman's Era Club of Boston, Mass., were privileged to have you address them as a body. The occasion was the first public meeting of the club and besides yourself, Mrs. Lucy Stone, Mrs. Cheney, Mrs. Diaz and Mrs. Spaulding spoke. It is safe to say that of all these noble women and fine speakers, no one did more than yourself in strengthening the impulse to good works, in giving fresh inspiration towards right living. Your name and that speech has been to us refreshing memory; think then the shock it has occasioned us to hear that through your efforts, a resolution at the National Conference of the Unitarian church, denouncing lynching, was defeated.</p>
                              <p>We feel assured and do truly believe that you opposed the resolution from a high moral standpoint, but we also feel assured that your position on this subject is the result of influences entirely one-sided, and that you will it least be interested to hear the other side.</p>
                              <p>We, the members of the Women's Era Club, believe we speak for the colored women of America. We have organized, as have our women everywhere, to help in the world's work, not only by endeavoring to uplift ourselves and our race, but by giving a helping hand and an encouraging word wherever they may be called for. As colored women, we have suffered and do suffer too much to be blind to the <sic corr="sufferings">snfferings</sic> of others, but naturally, we are more keenly alive to our own sufferings than to others', and we feel that we would be false to ourselves, to our opportunities and to our race, should we keep silence in a case like this. We have endured much, and we believe with patience, we have seen our old, broken-down wanderers, their youth and strength spent in bondage. We, ourselves, are daily hindered and oppressed in the race of life; we know that every opportunity for advancement, for peace and for happiness will be denied us; we know that in most sections Christian men and women will absolutely refuse not only to live beside us, to eat with us, but also to open their church doors to us; we know that our children, no matter with what tenderness they may be reared, are considered legitimate prey for insult; we know that our young girls can at any time be thrust into foul and filthy smoking cars; no matter what their straits, refused food and shelter if sought among whites in many sections. We feel deeply the lack of opportunities, for the culture brought by the public libraries, the concert and lecture halls which are everywhere denied us at the South. We view these thing., with amazement, but realizing that prejudice can only be eliminated by time and our general progress, we have tried to bear these indignities put upon us by a professedly Christian people with the fortitude and dignity of real Christians. All this we have borne and do bear with more or less patience, but in the interest of common humanity, in the interest of justice, for the good name of our country, we solemnly raise our voices against the horrible crimes of lynch law as practised in the South, and we call upon Christians everywhere to do the same, or be branded as sympathizers with the murderers.</p>
                              <p>We here solemnly deny that the black men are the foul fiends they are pictured; we demand that until at least one crime is <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> upon them, judgment be suspended.</p>
                              <p>We know positively of case after case where innocent men have died horrible deaths; we know positively of cases that have been "made up"; we know positively of cases where black men have been lynched for white men's crimes. We know positively of black men murdered for insignificant offences. All that we ask for is justice, not mercy or palliation, simple justice, surely that is not too much for loyal citizens of a free country to demand. We do not pretend to say there are no black <sic corr="villains">villians</sic>; baseness is not confined to race; we read with horror of two different colored girls who have recently been horribly assaulted by white men in the South. We should regret any lynchings of the offenders by black men, but we shall not have occasion; should these offenders receive any punishment, it will be a marvel. We do not brand the white race because of these many atrocities committed by white men, but because lynch law is not visited upon this class of offenders, we repudiate the claim that lynching is the natural and commendable outburst of a high-spirited people.</p>
                              <p>We do not expect white women shall feel as deeply as we. We know of good and high-minded women made widows, of sweet and innocent children, fatherless, by a mob of unbridled men and boys "looking for fun." In their name we utter our solemn protest. For their sakes we call upon workers of humanity everywhere, if they can do nothing for us, in mercy's name not to raise their voices against us.</p>

                  <p>Arriving at Miss Myrtle's cottage, she bade her nephew good-bye and entered the gate. "Don't be so eager to get rid of my valuable company, Aunt Maria," he said, "I am going to see the schoolma'am myself about an unfinished sum."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Brougham replied to Miss Myrtle's friendly greeting in the coolest possible manner, and saying her business could wait until Charlie got through with his sum, seated herself with a frigid look.</p>
                  <p>The sum was soon explained and Miss Myrtle was just turning to her visitor when seeing the flower in a vase Master Charlie exclaimed: "Who
<pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
broke off your calla lily, Miss Myrtle?"</p>
                  <p>"The wind, my dear, and it also brought me a souvenir," said she, pointing to the table where lay the identical handkerchief with the monogram turned up. <sic corr="&#34;"/>I believe it is the very one Uncle John lost. Yes" he continued, taking it up, "here is his monogram. Isn't this your hair. Aunt Maria? Mother says that any one would know it if they met you in the Feejee Islands."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Brougham blushed, stammered and Charlie felt ashamed, while Miss Myrtle said, "Charlie, I don't think your mamma made that remark "Feejee Islands," it sounds very much like one of your own." Well, she said something of the sort," replied Charlie.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Brougham began to talk to Miss Myrtle about a fair in which Miss Myrtle was interested and promised to help both with time and money.</p>
                  <p>I am very glad to restore your handkerchief. The monogram is very prettily done," said Miss. Myrtle as Mrs. Brougham departed.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Brougham came slowly home at night conscience was busy at work. "What could have been the matter with Maria to-day? She is not generally unreasonable, and besides, I myself was not altogether blameless; how quickly I lost my temper." Thus he soliloquized. "I will go home instead of off to the club and see what she has got to say."</p>
                  <p>The front part of the house was all dark, and instantly a thought struck him. Suppose she had taken him at his word and returned home. Determined to know the worst, Mr. Brougham opened the door and entered the dining room. Supper was ready and Mrs. Brougham was making tea. As soon as he entered she said, "We are all liable to be mistaken. Let us forget and forgive, as the children say."</p>
                  <p>"With all my heart," replied her husband.</p>
                  <p>After tea she told her husband how matters stood. He heard her in silence until she began Charlie's part and then he exclaimed, "Ah, the rogue, he shall have a new pair of skates to-morrow." Here's a peace offering for yourself," he added. drawing out the garnets.</p>
                  <p>Just then the door bell rang. Mrs. Grant, like all other gossips came to see the effect of her work. Mrs. Brougham met her with a pleasant smile. "See these garnets, are they not lovely? My husband has just given them to me."</p>
                  <p>"Very fine indeed," replied Mrs. Grant with an envious smile, "how kind he is."</p>
                  <p>"You see," broke in Mr. Brougham, "your kind offices have come to no good and in future, my dear Mrs. Grant, always be sure when you speak.</p>
                  <p>So the day in spite of kind friends and the wind ended happily after all.</p>

                  <p>Paper No. 2.</p>
                  <p>The object aimed at in taking physical exercise is a harmonious and symmetrical development of the entire body. The arms, the legs, the neck, the trunk must be proportionately developed. The ability to lift heavy weights, or run fast, or jump high, or perform feats of strength in one direction, if acquired by developing only one set of muscles, is a dangerous power, It is obtained at the expense of other muscles, and is a one-sided development that destroys all harmony and symmetry.</p>
                  <p>The power to lift, run, or kick or jump well does not always carry with it health. Strong arms are often found with weak muscles of back and abdomen, and all the conditions for spinal, heart and lung diseases. It therefore follows that any exercise which gives a one-sided development, which weakens one set of muscles to build up another set, which pays attention to one part of the body, and neglects all other parts, is to be avoided. While the system which finds the weak spots and strengthens them, which stops the development of one set of muscles at the expense of another set, and builds up all in proportion, which does not neglect the heart, or back, or abdomen, but cares for and builds up all portions of the body so necessary to a good figure, easy, graceful carriage and a strong, healthy body is the system to be adopted.</p>
                  <p>Physical development is a thing of slow growth. Crooked limbs, weak arms and legs, weak back and abdomen, flabby muscles, and weak lungs and heart, cannot be straightened

and made strong and cured in a week. The exercises must be taken carefully, regularly and continuously. The rule that practice makes perfect will apply here as elsewhere. No permanent benefit is to be secured by taking the exercise for several days and then neglecting it for several days or a week. Practice must be systematic, at regular intervals, and it must be progressive.</p>
                  <p>Classic Greece furnishes the highest development of beauty, elegance and grace. Her orators have charmed many ages, and her philosophers have earned the intellectual leadership of the world. The Greeks were the first to learn and apply the truth that mind and hand and heart are mutually dependent; that a well rounded, healthy trained body is the greatest aid to a sound, vigorous and well-equipped mind. They began with the body and the body was trained in the open air.</p>
                  <p>The Germans and the Swedes have followed their lead and developed the idea. With them legitimate athletic sports, games and pastimes in the open air have been supplimented with systematic gymnastics, and the beneficial results may be seen in the national character. Dr. E.M. Hartwell, in a paper delivered at the "Physical Training Conference" in 1889, in developing this point said:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q direct="unspecified">"Gymnastics have been most popular and general among the most highly trained nations, such as the Greeks of old and the Germans of to-day. The most athletic, and, at the same time, one of the most ill-trained of modern nations, is the British. I mean simply this, that an Englishman believes, and acts upon the belief, that you come to do a thing right by doing it, and not by first learning to do it right, and then doing it, whereas, the Germans leave little or nothing to the rule of thumb, not even in bodily education. German gymnastics embrace three well-marked fields or departments; viz. popular gymnastics, school gymnastics and military gymnastics. The organization of the last two departments is maintained and controlled by the government for strictly educational purposes; while the Turnvereine, as the popular gymnastic societies are called, are voluntary associations of a social and semi-educational, but wholly popular and patriotic character. The fondness of the German people for gymnastics is as marked a national trait as is the liking of the British for athletic sports. The German system of gymnastics has, been most highly developed in Prussia, where not far from a fifth of the population is undergoing systematic physical training at the present time, under the combined agencies of the schools, the army, and the Turnvereine. In Switzerland and in Norway and Sweden, you will find school and military gymnastics, especially in Sweden, quite as fully developed as in Germany, and popular gymnastics not so much so."</q>

                     <p>Many of the letters upon the proposed convention have been necessarily deferred until next month; our paper was obliged to go to press much earlier than was anticipated, and much matter of interest arrived too late. However, we call attention to an able and interesting letter on the subject by Mrs. Fannie Williams of Chicago. Mrs. Williams' mind and ability are well-known in Washington and Boston, where she formerly lived, and her letter will have great weight with people of those cities as well as with those of the West, with whom she has lived of late years.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Williams advises us not to be in a hurry and the advice is timely. A lady of Boston said apropos of holding a convention: "I really do not know what to say as to time. I believe the summer to be the only proper time, but I think this summer too early and next summer too late."</p>
                     <p>Doubtless many think with her of the advantages of the great good in many ways that would result from the coming together of our women, there can be no doubt, but when and where is a question that must be considered carefully. We want it to be representative and national--we must avoid being either precipitate or careless. Our convention must be the whole-souled expression of our earnest women of all sections, and must be backed by all our women, let us agitate and prepare.</p>

                     <p>The publishers of the WOMAN'S ERA take especial pride in the advertisements found in this paper; in most cases they are of firms of young colored men. This is especially true of the last page, which represents flourishing businesses conducted by our young men, which are a standing refutation to the fallacious charge that the young colored men of the North are seldom engaged in any but menial occupations. Every little while some one with little knowledge of the situation, and filled with sectional feeling (which should never be encouraged) goes into spasm over the dark prospect before our young men. Our young men, as a general thing, have had the good sense not to fan the flame of sectional feeling, and have been content to let intelligent people judge for themselves. The WOMAN'S ERA does not pretend to advertise all the young men in business (it devoutly wishes that it could), but it has been so readily and cheerfully supported by the young men that it is glad of the opportunity to speak for them all.</p>
                     <p>The WOMAN'S ERA is a woman's paper, but it is such a true woman's paper that it is intensely interested in man and all that he does.</p>

                     <p>The attention of our readers is called to the open letter to Mrs. Chant printed in our club news. It seems to us that it is in this direction that our women find a great field of work. America stands impotent and Europe amazed at the barbarous state of affairs in the southern states of America. The protestations of black men have in most cases fallen flat and almost unnoticed. Is it not possible it has been left to black women to bring about the moral reform so urgently needed. Let our women's clubs turn their thoughts and bend their energies towards this work. The letter to Mrs. Chant has received wide consideration, and if it did no more than to call attention to the position of the colored women of the country it would not be in vain. We believe it has struck where many protests have been unnoticed.</p>

                  <p>Among the contestants for the first premium prize offered by this paper, is a young woman of New Bedford, the possessor of an exceptionally fine voice, but who as yet has been unable to begin any training or cultivation of it. The offer to her is a rare opportunity. Two children have already entered the contest for the children's prizes. There is still a chance for two more and each get the prize--a year's musical training free.</p>
                  <p>Miss Marie Louise Burgess, who contributes the notes on "The Nursing of Sick Children," is a New England girl who is now located as a professional nurse at Hampton Institute. Miss Burgess graduated from N.E. Woman's Hospital Training School for Nurses, and has entered her chosen field with enthusiasm and success. She will shortly publish a small book of short stories.</p>
                  <p>The "Pop" concerts are on the top wave of success, and are the severest form of dissipation Bostonians have ever digested. Still some do not digest even yet, but endeavor to impress the onlooker that they are wildly hilarious while drinking beer and listening to a Strauss waltz.</p>
                  <p>The annual business meeting of the Cecilia occurred May 24th, at Steinert Hall. After the meeting came a reception, music and a collation. Enough, to subdue the stoutest heart.</p>
                  <p>Miss Laura Robinson will graduate from the Boston Training School of Music this spring. Without doubt Miss Robinson has the "divine afflatus"; this has been supplemented by fine training and there is a future before her.</p>
                  <p>Every month brings news of more women roused by the account of what other women are doing through organization to form a club of their own. The newest club to be represented by a letter to the ERA, is the "Soujourner Truth," of Providence, R. I. An account of its formation is given elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Miss Gould, of the Woman's Era Club, brought before the members, at a recent meeting, a letter received from one of the sufferers of the Sea Islands flood. By this letter it is shown that in the distribution of money, food and clothes which had been sent the sufferers, Clara Barton's agents required that all colored people should work for rations, while nothing was required from white people in exchange. Miss Gould was requested by the President to make full inquiries in the hope of getting accurate and definite replies. This was done, and in the answer received the facts were reiterated, with names, dates and places. An investigation is being made at this end among workers for the sufferers, and it has been found that the Citizens Relief Association of Boston (colored, Mrs. Hannah Smith, secretary,) has now in hand quite a large sum which they have withheld because of the report that much sent by them has not been justly distributed. From Mrs. Christiansen, the wife of one of the leading merchants of Beaufort, and who has been instrumental in raising large sums in Boston and vicinity, it was found that while contributions sent through them had been distributed freely, without asking anything in return, other agents had and do require work from colored people and not from white.</p>
                  <p>The Club still has the matter under consideration and also some method of aiding the suffering who are still sadly in need of help.</p>
                  <p>Ladies of Norfolk and Berkeley, Va., are planning a Carnival <sic corr="modeled">modelled</sic> after that given by the Boston Club.</p>
                  <p>Hampton is planning a woman's club. It is safe to say that such an organization there would be carried on with Intelligence and enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>Doubtless there were colored delegates to the Working Girls Convention recently held in Boston. Two young ladies of Philadelphia, school teachers, were reported as possible delegates. Whether or not they were present has not been ascertained. It is very easy for colored people to be "lost" in Boston as they can be in no other city.</p>

                  <p>During this month of "perfect days," probably no poet will be called to mind more often than Lowell, who, in his Vision of Sir Launfal, has so well expressed what everyone feels but few can say. It is strange how trite and commonplace our most extravagant phrases sound in attempt to describe these incomparable June mornings.</p>
                  <p>Miss E.F. Andrews in the Chautauquan for May, calls attention to the fact that throughout all fiction, aside <sic corr="from">ftom</sic> five ideal characters of Shakespeare, there is not a mother who is an admirable character. This, she says, is the fault of the women themselves, who were content with too low a standard, and who did not claim the culture which men looked upon as their exclusive right. Formerly women were educated with a view to marriage only, and having become married, made no further effort in the line of self-culture. It was also fashionable and a sign of good breathing to have ill-health and to be very dependent. The women of the new school, she continues, hold a different view of life, believing it the duty of the wife and mother to keep in touch with the world about her, and to represent the <sic corr="highest">hightest</sic> 
culture attainable. They hold that daughters should be educated more with the idea of making good wives and mothers; that they should be taught to value health; should know something of business, and be able to earn their own living, even if not obliged to do so.</p>
                  <p>Just at present considerable interest is manifested in the events immediately preceding the Civil War. So many of those who took part in the great struggle are passing away, or, still living, are giving to the public their reminiscences of the thrilling scenes through which they have passed. Thomas Ewing, in the Cosmopolitan for May, tells his story of the struggle for freedom in Kansas, giving sketches of the leaders on both sides, and <sic corr="the">fhe</sic> plans and purposes of John Brown.</p>
                  <p>An amusing little anecdote is told of the poet Tennyson, who, it will be remembered, gloried in his disregard for the minor conventionalities of life, quite the contrary to the exquisite courtesy and high breeding of Longfellow. 0n one occasion, at a dinner-party, he rested his feet on the table, and maintained his position in spite of the indignant protests of his friends. At length someone remarked jocularly, that he might be taken for Longfellow. Down came the feet instantly, nor did they again resume the position supposed to be characteristic of Americans.</p>
                  <p>It is pleasant to note that many of our old authors are still at work. It is so long since they became famous that we are apt to think of them as having ceased their labors. Oliver Wendall Holmes, although eighty-five years of age, still writes, and shows no sign of failing powers. Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, at the age of eighty-one, sits for hours at her desk daily. Edward Everett Hale, at seventy-two, does much more work than many a young man. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, at seventy-five, works hard and steadily. William Wetmore Story, at seventy-five, is in Rome, writing a series of magazine articles. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, also seventy-five, not only writes, but travels, and delivers lectures at intervals.</p>
                  <p>Although many years have passed since the assassination of President Lincoln, it was an event of so great importance, that it is worthy of the closest study. Of late there has been a revival of efforts to prove one of the guilty parties innocent; therefore it seemed a fitting time to Mr. T.M. Harris, a member of the military commission who tried the conspirators, to give to the public a concise history of the great event, founded upon the evidence produced in the trial. This he has done in a volume entitled "The Assassination of Lincoln, a History of the Great Conspiracy." The matter is arranged in the form of an interesting narrative, and fills a good sized and handsomely bound volume. It is published by the American Citizen Company.</p>
                  <p>The American Citizen Company also publishes a book by J. Robert Love, M.D., of Port Au Prince, Hayti, called "The Indictment, the Testimony, and Verdict, or Proofs, that Romanism is not Christianity."</p>
                  <p>Mr. W.D. Howells begins in Harper's for May, an account of his first visit to New England. He gives a sketch of his acquaintance with Bayard Taylor, whom he met on this trip, and tells of his disappointment in seeing the ocean for the first time while at Portland, which he visited on account of its being the birthplace of Longfellow. We will all he glad to know his impressions of Boston.</p>
                  <p>Captain King, who, in "Between the Lines," is said to have given the best description of a battle that has ever been given in the English language, has written a book called "Cadet Days," which all young men with military inclinations will find interesting. In his previous books he has shown us what soldiers are and what they can do, and he now tells us how soldiers are made. Captain King is a graduate of West Point, and although not the hero of his tale, is part of it.</p>
                  <p>Of the making of dictionaries there seems to be no end; and since all of the new ones are equally up to date and replete with information, there is little choice among them. Yet the "Standard," published by Funk and Wagnalls, New York, has one especial feature which recommends it to everyone. The definition is placed immediately after the word, and the eye is saved the trouble of looking through the derivations and authorities.</p>

                  <p>The Calanthe Whist Club of Cambridge celebrated their first anniversary on May 11 by a dance. A very enjoyable evening was spent, and supper was served at Young's. The prize winners were, ladies prizes: first, Mrs. G.W. Lewis; second, Mrs. J.B. Young; booby, Miss Evelyn Coburn. Gentlemen's prizes: first, Mr. G.W. Lewis; second, Mr. G.B. Saturn: booby, Mr. J.T. Lewis. The officers of the club are Mr. J.R. Young, Mr. W.W. Taylor, Mr. N.G. Mitchell, Miss E.M. Clary, Miss M.E. Johnson, Mrs. G.N. Lewis.</p>
                  <p>It is said that the next three months will witness many weddings among well-known people.

                  <p>I was the recipient of the following letter last week:</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>I read your 'chat with girls' every month, but I don't like the books you suggest. Can't you tell about some books for little girls? All your books are for big ones. I am twelve years old and I like to read very much. Yours truly,</p>

                        <body>
                           <p>So this letter will be to little girls, and although many of the older ones may find something to interest them in it.</p>
                           <p>First, every girl knows Louise M. Alcott and her works, for "Little Women, "Old Fashioned Girl," and "Little Men" are household words among girls, but possibly they do not know that "Work," "Hospital Sketches," and others are just as interesting, and add to that "Louise Alcott's Life," a record of a thoroughly unselfish, helpful one. One little incident of her kindness and thoughtfulness was never published, I think.</p>
                           <p>Once a woman happened to be sitting side of her in a crowded car, reading a novel. Accidentally she dropped it. and Miss Alcott returned it to her and entered into conversation with her on the merits of novel reading. The woman said she read novels for amusement, finding, as she grew older that she did not care for books that made her think. Miss Alcott rather agreed with her, but thought that books might be read that would combine both instruction and amusement. A few days later this woman's heart was made glad by a box of old magazines and books, accompanied by a note signed "Louise M. Alcott."</p>
                           <p>"Three Generations," by Janet Rose, is a fine story of colonial days, and Mary Mapes Dodge has written a number of stories for children. One, "Hans Brinker," is a pretty story of child life in Holland. I wonder if any of my girls read Vancy's books. They were quite popular some.Tears ago, and I think no girl could help feeling better, and that she could lead a more unselfish life and do some good to others after perusing these books. Mrs. A. D. Whitney's "Real Folks" is worth reading, so is Mrs. Burnett's "Louisiana," and scores of others I might mention.</p>
                           <p>Charlotte Yonge, an English writer, has written many books for young girls. "The Chaplet of Pearls" gives a quaint description of the times of the French revolution; "The Queen's Four Maries" tells of the stormy days of Scottish history; "The Pupils of St. John" is a narrative of the early Christian church; "Pigeon Pie" is a child's account of Charles I's reign.</p>
                           <p>William Ware's "Zenobia" would perhaps interest older readers. Girls, read the Arabian Nights now, for a few years hence, you will not be able to enjoy it.</p>

                  <p>Through the large-hearted courtesy of Rev. W.B. Derrick, the Woman's Loyal Union of Now York and Brooklyn have as a permanent place of meeting his cheerful rooms in the Bible house, New York, free of charge. This is a decided step forward for the Union, and its members and well wishers are greatly encouraged, for like most experimental associations, the W.L.U. began its existence minus a treasury, and though they have the nucleus of one, yet the chief effort of the newly-revised constitution is in the direction of creating a treasury they began work on the principle that each member be taxed pro rata for all expenses incurred, but, experience has proven beyond a doubt the utter fallacy of such a system, for rarely does it happen that more than one-quarter of the members attend, generally, consequently a faithful few bear the burden that would be but a trifle if every member thoughtfully bore her part. It is expected that quite a nice showing will be made by the W.L.U. Relief Fund, formed during the severe stringency of the early winter. Under the guidance of Mrs. J.E. Garned and Miss S.E. Frazier a number of children have been provided with warm, neatly repaired garments; the Union also subscribed the sum of ten dollars in aid of the Chyenne sufferers in South Carolina.</p>
                  <p>A number of ladies are agitating the question of the employment of our girls in stores and various commercial establishments, etc., which led to the question, are young girls of the race at this present time truly anxious and ambitious for such a crusade?--If anxious, are they ready?--in their accomplishments do they consider Commercial requirements? Those and many questions of like nature deluge the mind when the subject is broached. There is a determination among the members of the W. L. U. to push this matter, providing, of course, the young women give the needed impetus. Without reliable material the most zealous efforts will fail, because no business man will employ a girl just because she is colored, and ought to have a chance. She must be able to fill the position desired. Among other needed reforms, there is one connected with the colored home which has been brought before the W. L. U. and steps taken preliminary to action in the matter.</p>
                  <p>The women here like the WOMAN'S ERA, and when 'tis generally circulated will become a decided favorite. The very fact that 'tis a woman's paper all the way through will after a little time form a striking plea for the sympathy of thoughtful women. We certainly need a common medium for the exchange of ideas and could not hope for one more dignified in matter or elegant in appearance than the WOMANS' ERA.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Sidney Woodward presented the Cantata of Belshazzar at the People's church on the evening of May 16. A good sized audience was in attendance, and gave generous evidence of their appreciation by applauding. The cantata was under the direction of Mr. Woodward, who obtained excellent results from the assisting artists. Mr. Harry Burleigh of New York came on especially to take one of the roles, but was not up to his best form. We have heard him achieve better results. Mr. Woodward made a particularly painstaking effort, and met with his usual success. The other local artists gave their best effort to make the cantata a very pleasing evening's entertainment.</p>

                  <docDate>Friday, June 1, 1894</docDate>
                  <p>The murderers of colored men at the South, who lynch their victims without giving them an opportunity to be heard, denying a trial in the courts presided over by the friends and sympathizers of the murderers, begin to feel the force of public opinion, and find it necessary to give an excuse for shooting down men at sight without a warning, for hanging boys and riddling their dead bodies with bullets, and for burning men and women at the stake.</p>
                  <p>"No Negro domination," was the only excuse offered by the preachers, teachers, judges, law officers and "best blood of the South," who composed the Ku Klux Klans. When this was worn thread-bare, it was followed by "This is a white man's government, and the white man will rule it, right or wrong." Election after election was carried with this slogan. The ballot box was a sham and a delusion. One by one the Negro saw the promises of the government to protect him and secure to him his rights as a citizen broken. He has appealed without avail for the right to live. His record as a gallant soldier in defence of the Union, his record as a law-abiding citizen have counted for naught. He was enslaved for more than two hundred years and robbed of his labor, beaten and bruised, his wife and children sold away from him, his women robbed of virtue and honor by the enslavers, and now that the English press, aroused by a Negro woman fleeing from the hand of the lyncher, dares speak out and denounce murder and the murderers, these lynchers, who have never spared the honor and virtue of Negro women, whose hands are dripping with Blood of their own illegitimate children, confident of protection from American public opinion, feel it necessary to offer a new excuse for their crimes when called to book by public opinion abroad. Up to their ears in guilt against Negro women, they offer as their excuse for murdering Negro men, Negro women and Negro children, that white women are not safe from the Negro rapist. And for these murderers, lynchers and burners, for these latter-day saints, who preyed for two and a half centuries on their helpless slave women, we are told that Francis Willard of America. and Laura Ormiston Chant of England, have entered the list as apologists. These two fearless defenders of the right would let no liquor dealer escape, but would apologize for the white criminal, if the victim be Negro man, woman or child. The man, white or black, who assaults women, should be apprehended and punished by imprisonment or death, if such be the decree of the law. For such men no excuse is to be made. But it is the duty of the law, and not of the mob to inflict this punishment. And every man, of whatever crime charged, has the right of a fair trial in the courts. All that is asked is that the law reign, and not the mob.</p>
                  <p>In ten years 800 Negroes have been murdered by mobs at the South. Of these 800 only 269, about one-third have even been charged with the crime of outrage. Investigation has proven many of these 269 groundless charges, and in those with some show of truth, the women have been proven to be as bad as the Negro men, and that they made the charges only after being detected in living improperly with the men. If this charge is true, if Negro men are given to assaults upon white women, why do not they attempt the crime in the North where the courts would give them a fair trial? Why do they confine the attempt to the South, where the mere charge is sure death, and no opportunity is given for a trial? Why did not the slaves, when their masters were away trying to shoot the Union to death and keep them forever slaves, outrage the wives and daughters of these traitors confided to their care?</p>
                  <p>No! the charge is not true. It is no justification. It is an infamous crime against the only law-abiding people at the South. The lynchers are Murderers. Their apologists must share their condemnation, and if by influencing public opinion against stopping lynching, they must share the odium of abbettors of murder.</p>

                  <p>The announcement of the coming to Boston of Frederick Douglass was the signal that called together once more about all that remains of the old anti-slavery party. From all parts of New England they came to his lecture at the People's Church on May 10, to have their old-time enthusiasm aroused by his still fiery eloquence in the cause of humanity. And when at the close he turned and took each old friend and co-worker by the hand, and tremulously told of their fidelity to principle when it cost something to advocate the cause of the oppressed, it was grandly pathetic and seemed like a benediction. On the afternoon of thu day preceding the lecture, a reception was tendered Mr. Douglass, by the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, and the "remnant" was all there. Mrs. Mary A. Livermore stood to receive with Mr. Douglass a lively throng of Boston's best in literature, art and philanthropy. Among them there were the venerable Dr. Bartol and his artist daughter, Col. Higginson, the Garrison brothers, the Allen families of West Newton and Cambridge, Lieut. and Mrs. Charles L. Mitchell, Hon. Henry C. and Miss Blackwell. Miss Maria S. Porter, Mr. Charles Lenox, and a host of others. On the morning of his last day in Boston Mr. Douglass, on invitation of Representative Teamoh, visited the Mass. State Legislature; both branches of that body adjourned while he was introduced to and addressed the members. Several attempts to entertain the distinguished guest by private parties were frustrated by his early departure from the city.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. R.E. Moore, President of Woman's Club, Chicago, was born in Missouri. At an early age she was brought by relatives to Chicago. Having finished the prescribed course of the grammar schools of this city, the same old story was whispered into willing ears and she became Mrs. Richard E. Moore. When a school-girl she was noted for her quiet unassuming manners and sympathetic nature which, as she grew older, became more marked, and has preeminently fitted her for the various positions she has been called upon to occupy. Her husband being one of the most prominent "Masons" in the country, she has taken an active part in the O. E. S.; its high intellectual and moral teachings finding in her a staunch supporter. When Mrs. Frances E. Harper was in Chicago during the "Worlds Fair," seeing the wide field for work, at her suggestion a meeting of the representative women of the city was called to consider the possibilities of concerted action for influence in elevating and assisting in Race-Work throughout the country, which call was met with universal approval, out of which was evolved the "Woman's Club of Chicago," with Mrs. John Jones, Pres., Miss Ida B. Wells, Vice-Pres. Upon Mrs. Jones resigning Miss Wells still continued the meetings, acting as President. Miss Wells being called upon to fill an engagement in England whereupon Mrs. Moore was unanimously Chosen to be acting President until the return of Miss Wells. When Mrs. Moore assumed the Office of President, the "Club" had only a preamble, setting forth a general statement of the purposes of the Club but no rules for government, and as the Club had passed into permanent organization, Mrs. Moore immediately began setting about getting the workings of the Club into a systematic condition; the result was a Constitution and By-laws, also a petition to the State to be incorporated which was granted; the Constitution and by-laws although brief are Concise in their character. On the return of Miss Wells from England Mrs. Moore will resign the Presidency of the Club, but will still continue to assist in any capacity which will be most beneficial. By her sympathies for the oppressed, pride of race, and zeal in work for all that is elevating she has won the lasting admiration of The Woman's Club of Chicago.</p>

                     <docDate>July 1894</docDate>
                     <p>This interesting little city is nearly half way between Topeka and the two Kansas Cities, having all the advantages of a suburban town, and has gained for itself the title "Athens of the West." To be in Lawrence at once means to be in the midst of comforts, pleasure and intelligence. We may truly say that what Boston is to the East, Lawrence is to the West. Being the scene of much bloodshed during the early days of Kansas, the history of Lawrence is really the history of Kansas. It is the seat of the Kansas State University and has it splendid School system, with a high school that prepares pupils for the University. We have very fine churches, --visitors have jocularly remarked that every other house was either a Church or Schoolhouse. While that is not quite true, we can boast of more schools and Churches than is customary for a place so small.</p>
                     <p>From this fact, one Can see that Club life would be one of the prominent features of social life in this city. For a long time the "Progressive Club", composed of graduates from High School and University students, was the only club. It meets the first Thursday in every month and is entirely literary in its work; at its meetings light refreshments are served and during this time many of the problems of the time are discussed. Its members are chiefly young people, married and single, male and female. Next follows the "Eureka"--the fortnightly club. It is a social Club; it aims to give its
<pb n="2 THE WOMANS ERA."/>
member's recreation--an impromptu programme being rendered every other meeting. This club is for married people. "A. V. C." is our young ladies' club; and "Sierra Leone" for mothers. These are the outgrowth of the "Progressive." In all of these clubs women play a conspicuous part. The "Eureka" Club serves refreshments once a month--the last Monday night. After reading the article written on "Social Etiquette" in your Women at Home Department, it might be interesting to other women to know that we members of the "Sierra Leone" felt the need of a social reform in the matter of calls and could see the utter impracticability of persons "dropping in" at any time; we have set aside Thursday afternoon of each week as our receiving day. Each lady then expects calls and is prepared to receive them. Many are the little afternoon teas and luncheons and picnics and dainty breakfasts given in our town--all of which help to make Lawrence a pleasant place to visit.</p>
                     <p>During Commencement Week all the clubs contribute and have a grand banquet for our High School graduates and visitors.</p>
                     <p>I have tried to make our sisters acquainted with our <hi rend="italic">social</hi> life and will say that Mrs. W. W. Johnson opened the social season June 2 by an entertainment given in honor of her friend, Mrs. C. H. J. Taylor, and her daughter, Mrs. Judge I. T. Bradley--both from Kansas City, Kansas.</p>

                     <p>This Union has been organized for about six years, with Mrs. A. Dawley as its president. During all this time our meetings have not been well attended as regularly as they might have been. One of our disadvantages was our inability for quite a while to get an hour and day which would be convenient to all. We are glad to state that we have at last succeeded. We tried some afternoon in the week, and met with comparatively no success. We changed from that to Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock. We are gratified with the results of this change. Our meetings are now well attended by both ladies and gentlemen. Our motto is: "For God and home and native land." We have some one make an address on some <hi rend="italic">temperance topic</hi> each Sabbath afternoon and then a general discussion follows, interspersed with good singing.

                     <p>Actuated by a desire to promote the work of the Young Men's Christian Association, and having been requested to do so by the Board of Directors, a number of earnest, Christian young women met Feb. 7, 1888, and organized the "Ladies' Auxiliary" of the (Colored) Young Men's Christian Association of Norfolk, Va.</p>
                     <p>No member of the Auxiliary is allowed to entertain young men at her home while any important meeting of the Association is being held, or any public entertainment for its benefit is in progress.</p>
                     <p>This has led many young men to connect themselves with the organization and to materially assist in carrying on the good work.</p>
                     <p>Literary and social entertainments are given by the Auxiliary every month. These are attended by the young men, who are made to feel that the ladies are interested in them, socially, morally, mentally and spiritually.</p>
                     <p>Every Christmas a "Children's Dinner" is given by the Auxiliary, the members of which donate the necessaries, or secure them, and the many little ones, who ordinarily have no Christmas joys, are made glad by the good cheer provided.</p>
                     <p>The Auxiliary has given to the Young Men's Christian Association a library Containing five hundred volumes, all within the past two years, and has rendered other assistance of a practical character to the work among the Colored people of this City.</p>
                     <p>The Auxiliary meets twice each month and at each meeting a Bible reading is given by the general secretary of the Y. M. C. A after which general business is transacted.</p>
                     <p>The Auxiliary is non-sectarian and thoroughly represents the Christian young women of this city. Its work is noble and elevating and the results attained within the past six years have been highly gratifying to all concerned.</p>

                     <p>The Women's Working Club of Berkley, Va., held a six days' carnival the latter part of May which was successful in every way. Mrs. R. G. L. Paige, president of
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the club, using the Women's Era carnival as it model, carried out the project with enthusiasm and energy. The carnival opened with a reception to the clergy; on Tuesday Mrs. Jarley's Wax Works were given; Wednesday was devoted to literary exercises and a spelling match; Thursday a necktie and apron party; Friday a promenade; Saturday an auction of the fancy articles on sale was held.</p>
                     <p>Nothing of the kind has ever been given at Berkley before and its success was instantaneous and complete.</p>
                     <p>Anything concerning Hampton Institute is always in demand. The following interesting account of the exercises of Commencement Week is written by our correspondent and agent, Mrs. Lottie Davis, wife of Mr. Geo. J. Davis, a teacher at Hampton:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Wednesday afternoon the graduating class held their exercises on the piazza of the Mansion House, consisting of class song, addresses by its members, and also an address by Dr. Parkhurst.</p>
                     <p>The audience, led by the class, marched to our Memorial Chapel, where they adopted a maple tree which grows near it.</p>
                     <p>At 7.30 P. M. the whole school, officers, teachers and guests, were entertained in gymnasium by the speeches from Trustees and other guests. We were proud to note among the Hon. J. R.  Durham of Philadelphia, ex-minister to Hayti, Rev. V. Tunnell, Dean of King Hall, Washington, D. C., and Mr. Tanner, the son of Bishop Tanner. The speeches were all good and very instructive.</p>
                     <p>Thursday, 24 ; Anniversary day. Inspection of boys in ranks, 8.30 A. M., and regular class exercises in Academic and Science buildings from 9 to 12 A. M. The marching of girls and boys from Academic to Virginia Hall, 12.15 P. M., is always a pleasing sight -- girls dressed in their light prints and boys in their dark blue uniforms. All of the Industrial Exhibits, showing products of farm and shop were in the Stone Memorial Building. Luncheon was over at 1 o'clock.</p>
                     <p>1.30 P. M., students, teachers, officers and guests were seated in gymnasium and heard some original essays and addresses by members of the graduating class, and also from graduates of other years.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Booker T. Washington, president of Tuskegee Normal School, made a rousing speech.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Logan, treasurer of the same institution also delivered an able address. An excellent speech was delivered M. Mead of Boston, editor of the New England Magazine. The plantation songs were sung with the usual enthusiasm by the students. The president of the board of trustees, Mr. Ogden made appropriate address to the graduating class and awarded the diplomas. Perfect order prevailed during all the exercises.</p>
                     <p>The young ladies who graduated in the class were Estelle Pennington, from Baltimore, Md., Bessie Flowers, from Penn., Florence Price, Evelyn Winn, Matilda Taylor, Eliza Baytop, Lizzie Rainey, Edmonia Anderson, Richetta Chappell, Mary Fleming, Kate Mosely, Maggie Crowley, Sallie Anderson and Martha Yung from Virginia, Selina Printop from New York State.</p>
                     <p>Friday, 25. A conference of graduates and others was held both morning and afternoon to discuss methods by which graduates of Hampton can best promote the welfare of their race. This is a new feature added to the Anniversary Week, and it is hoped that some good will be gleaned from it. The discussion of the forenoon was that of land-buying and farming, and what the percent was of negro landowners, compared with his white brother. It was discussed very intelligently.</p>
                     <p>Saturday evening, May 26. A very pretty May-party was given by the Whittier School children in the gymnasium under the management of Miss Laura Miller, Miss, Mary A. Tucker, Miss Marie Louise Burgese, and Mrs. Geo. J. Davis.</p>

                  <p>The closing meetings of the Boston Woman's Ear Club have been full of interest: among other things the club undertook to investigate the case of the colored girl said to have been held in slavery in Boston for four years. The report of the case will be found in another column.</p>
                  <p>At the meeting held on the 30th of may a large number of leading men were invited to a conference with the club. Among those who responded were lawyers Walker, Wilson, Morgan and Plummer. Mr. Emory Morris, Chas. Alexander, Dr. Callaway and Representative Teamoh. It was hoped to bring out the clergy, but not one responded. The conference considered the matter of lynching and what practical steps might be taken in the work against it. Many good suggestions were made and at last a committee composed of Messrs. Morris, Morgan and Wil-

                              <salute>Dear Mrs. Ridley,--</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>Your open letter just reached me. Thank you a thousand times for so strengthening my hands for it is the first word of support which has come to me from across the Atlantic from my own race and it helps the cause so much. It is especially needed because Mrs. Chant has chosen to ignore me and the movement ever since she has been proven wrong. I called twice at her house here in London to convince her of the great need of her help, but she was out, and her daughter couldn't tell when at any time she would be in. Then I left my card and address asking that she would send me word when I could see her. That was more than three weeks ago. She has utterly ignored the whole matter. I shall have this published in the <hi rend="italic">Inquirer</hi>, the Unitarian paper, and it will reach many. Also others as it may occur to me.</p>
                           <p>I wish I had time to write a long letter, but I must stop now if I wish this to go out in the mail which goes to America tomorrow.</p>
                           <p>I have received both copies of the WOMAN'S ERA and would have written something for you before now, but I have simply not had time. I never was so hard worked in my life.</p>
                           <p>I am so glad of the opportunity to tell the story that I have spoken, wrote and been interviewed incessantly until I have overtasked my strength. For the past three days, I have had to succumb and take absolute rest by the orders of a great London doctor. I am the guest of the wife of the great London <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, and have no words to express their care of me. I speak tonight and shall be in London ten days longer. I have already been here five weeks, then I spend the month of June at other places, hoping to sail July 1. If I can spare a moment between now and then I shall be glad to send to the WOMAN'S ERA. Meanwhile if you wish to write, please address me at the following place.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Matthews of the Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn has sent a circular to the leading newspapers and men of the south inquiring into the condition and prospects of the people; the circular is comprehensive and pointed. Its design is to gather from the most reliable sources facts as to the mental, moral and financial position of our people, their relation to their white neighbors, and conclusion as to their probable future, and the possibility of forming Loyal Union among the women. The circular is an intelligent step in the right direction' the Loyal Union evidently intends gaining a clear understanding of the situation, and without doubt that is the way to undertake any broad work.</p>
                  <p>At, the meeting of the Massachusetts State Federation of Clubs held at Marlboro, Mass., June 7, the Woman's Era Club was admitted to membership.</p>
                  <p>The warm weather makes active club work out of the question; most large clubs will take a vacation. The prospects for a profitable winters work for our clubs are great. Everywhere our women are feeling fresh inspiration for organized work, not only is this true of the clubs already formed, but many new organizations are being formed.</p>
                  <p>Many letters of inquiry have been received inquiring into the methods of forming leagues. The published reports upon the leagues are the best answers that can be given.</p>
                  <p>A committee composed of the Secretaries of the Woman's Era Club together with Miss Eliza Gardner, Mrs. Agnes Adams and Messrs. Wilson, Morgan and Morris met at Miss Eliza Gardner's, 20 N. Anderson Street, on Monday evening, June 18, to devise ways and means with which to arouse public sentiment in regards to the lynching of the colored people. The men and women of Boston have long deplored the condition of things in the south and elsewhere, and feel that something ought to be done at the very earliest opportunity. After much discussion the committee organized with Mr. Butler R. Wilson as Chairman and Mrs. Hannah Smith as Secretary. The Chairman then laid out a very effective plan of the work to be done which was accepted by the committee, which committee was augmented by the addition of the names, Mrs. Ariana Sparrow, Mrs. Mary Howard. The Chairman then appointed the sub-committees which resulted in the following:--</p>

                     <p>As usual in New England the closing days of May and the whole month of June have been filled with profit and pleasure for workers in all fields of human progress. Closing meetings with social attachments have followed each other in quick succession, and kept the average society woman on the hop skip and jump to keep up with the procession of hall banquets, literary high teas, charity receptions and garden parties with feasting, music and dancing, and of course yearly reports and literary papers thrown in to hold down the balance and keep the New England women from becoming too frivolous, and so casting reproach upon her severe and sober ancestry. This year the <hi rend="italic">woman suffragists</hi> led with their annual reunion and banquet in Music Hall; six hundred men and women sat at the supper tables and afterwards listened to some of the best and brightest speeches and music ever given at this always bright festival; and through it all the spirit of the pioneer, Lucy Stone, pervaded and incited the large gathering to greater enthushism than ever for the cause she loved.</p>

                     <p>Then followed the feast of reason only of the M. E. A. This annual is always held in the morning and lives in the memory as fragrant of spring blooms--brought by the members--and cultured and helpful words said by the speakers. The opening address this year by the president, Mrs. Abba Goold Woolson, was a literary high feast, and proved that the most delicate subjects may be so skilfully handled as to be both pleasureable and profitable to listen to. The objects of this society are to endeavor to educate the moral sense of the community; to disseminate a knowledge of the laws that should govern human life in all its relations; and, when occasion demands, to ask of legislative and executive bodies the enactment of such statutes as are needful and the enforcement of such as exist, for the prevention of social vice, and the promotion of social purity.</p>

                     <p>The closing meetings of this, the mother of all woman's clubs with its reports of committees, felicitous speakers, and closing luncheon at the Vendome Hotel, would make an interesting volume of reading, as will be believed when it is remembered that Julia Ward Howe is president of the club, and nearly all the brightest and best in New England are members.</p>
                     <p>Then after the Charity Club with its two hundred and fifty members, the Woman's Industrial Union, the Young Woman's Christian Association and that convention of the clubs with the largest possibilities of them all, known as the Working Girls Clubs had met, reported on the past and promised for the future, the busy season was fitly sounded out by the meeting of the State Federation of Clubs at Marlboro, Mass., on June 20th, and the garden party of the New England Woman's Press Association on Wednesday, June 20th, of which the "Post" woman thus <sic corr="felicitously">filicitously</sic> writes:</p>
                     <p>"The New England Women's Press Association had its annual outing yesterday.</p>
                     <p>Miss Alice Stone Blackwell was hostess, and her beautiful home at Pope's Hill, with its breezy views, broad <sic corr="piazzas">paizzas</sic>, green lawns and shady gardens, was thrown open to the members, of the association.</p>
                     <p>It is only once a year that the newspaper women eschew the monthly literary meeting at Parker's and the intellectual pabulum thereof, to hold a "field day" somewhere out of the dusty city and the daily grind, where the programme consists chiefly of "loafing and inviting one's soul."</p>
                     <p>This year Miss Blackwell extended the invitation to the association, and upward of fifty guests spent a delightful afternoon in  the fine old colonial mansion, whose every room holds tender memories of the beloved woman and dear housemother, Lucy Stone.</p>
                     <p>Guests of honor were M. Ohannes Chatschumian of the University of Leipsic, Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Gregg, and unlike the poor boy who peeped at the festivities of the rich and decided that there were good times in this world and he was not in it, we peeped at it all and were a part of most of it.</p>

                  <p>A convention of colored women's clubs and leagues would be in my judgment one of the greatest movements of the race. The great idea is that of unity--the lack of which is so marked among us. We know so little of one another, a convention would be a broad avenue by which we could learn more. We would be enabled to exchange thoughts, sympathy, gain helps and hints, learn where our work is most needed, in short, such a meeting would benefit us a thousand-fold.</p>
                  <p>Where there is union, success is insured. It is the basis of society and has ever been. Organization is not advocated enough; it should be our watchword. Women's clubs, whose purpose is to better the condition of the race morally, intellectually and socially, should be established in every state in the Union. You have but to introduce the work and the inspiration is caught at once. Here in our city there are many noble workers ready to enter the field at once, when a fortnight ago they were ignorant of the fact that such a field lay before them. I admire the purpose of these clubs, protection for our women is so much needed, especially for the yournger ones everywhere, but particularly in the south. There are hundreds of germs that might develop into virtuous and noble womanhood that are crushed and buried in ignorance and degradation for the want of a little encouragement, a kind word, one ray of hope. Here in the southland hopes have so long proved vain that the natural result is despair. Here in the southland, in the midst of dire oppression, is a large field for labor, and I appeal to the several clubs already formed to lose no time in spreading this work throughout the south. In case you know no one you might introduce it among the female students of some college. You have but to manifest a heartfelt interest to succeed and there is no better way than to call a woman's national convention.</p>
                  <p>This convention movement is the greatest in the history of the race. In the history of all nations women have played a prominent part, and the time has arrived for the daughters of Ethiopia to fall into line.</p>
                  <p>One of the main objects of the convention should be to create sentiment against mob violence, and to recommend bills before the legislatures of the several states where it is indulged in. Such bills as Hon. H.C. Smith introduced before the Ohio legislature. Especial attention should be given to minor evils that tend in any way to retard the progress of the race. I suggest that the convention be held at Boston. It is the most appropriate place in my judgment, and aside from its excellent accommodations there are many places of historic note that would afford entertainment no other city could furnish, and although Boston is by no means the central city there is but little difference in the rates, as a passenger getting a season ticket south can go to Boston at nearly the same rates as to Chicago. I hope that such a movement will not be thwarted, but that the month of August, 1894, will ever stand out in history as one of the grandest and noblest in the last quarter of a century, and the promoters of the convention movement should never be forgotten.</p>

                     <p>In ten years (1882-1891) eight hundred negroes were lynched in the southern states. If the claim of the southern people and their northern apologizers is true that the lynchings at the south are because negroes are given to assaults upon women, then the eight hundred instances of lynching must have been because of this crime. What is the fact?</p>

                     <p>By this table published in the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Tribune</hi>, January, 1892, it will be seen that only three more than one third of the persons lynched were even charged with this crime, behind which southern murderers and their northern apologists shield themselves.</p>
                     <p>Governor Stone of Mississippi attempts to excuse the south by attacking the character of the one woman, Ida B. Wells, driven from the south by the lynchers who is arousing the indignation of the old world against wholesale murder in the United States. Gov. Stone is a coward. He attacks a woman in her absence. He is a party to the murder of negroes in his state because he makes no attempt to punish the murderers. These figures support the claim of Miss Wells that no excuse exists for murder by lynching, and they condemn the south where this murder is done and demonstrate the falsity of the charge against the negroes of the south, and convict their slanderers of a crime against a race almost as wicked and horrible as their slanderous charge.</p>

                     <p>The hearty good wishes of the people of West End of Boston will attend the Rev. C. N. Field, rector of St. John's Church and St. Augustine Church, in his voyage across the Atlantic. He will be greatly missed and his return will be anxiously watched for. Several years ago he came to Boston but slightly known, at a time when a crisis hung over the field to which he came and when he was indifferently received. Today he is welcomed in every work of charity. No movement in the interest of the poor goes without his earnest and active support. The rum shop recognizes in him a never tiring, intelligent and forceful opponent. His plan is to make people better by making them more intelligent and by giving them healthy  occupation, innocent amusement, and by opening to them all means of education. and the people have been quick to recognize his services in securing from landlords leaner, warmer and healthier tenements for the poor. They have appreciated his efforts to secure in congested districts of the city branches of the public library. At the West and North Ends of the city he is know as the friend of the children, the poor and the sick, and they will miss him most.</p>
                     <p>His public spirit, fearless advocacy of the right and his ability to unite all classes of men in his work made him a great and successful power. It would be difficult to fill his place, and it would be a long, long time before the people for whom he has labored day and night, would become reconciled to his absence.</p>

                     <p>Miss Frances Willard has made a short visit to Boston. A reception by representative people was tendered her at the Vendome. Miss Willard has placed herself on the list of apologists for lynching; 
<pb n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
a marked copy of this paper containing the article on Apologists for Lynching was sent to Miss Willard, and we would suggest to any one who has the report of Mr. Douglass lecture on Lessons of the Hour with the pertinent remarks on Miss Willard's course that they kindly furnish her with a copy. It is well to give due recognition to Miss Willard's splendid work for temperance; it is also well that she should understand that there are several million women in this country who are bitterly disappointed in her.</p>

                     <p>June weddings have been unusually numerous; none among them have attracted more interest and attention than that of Miss Mary Evans, of Washington, D. C., and Butler R. Wilson Esq., of Boston, which took place Wednesday, June 27, at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Murray, the home of the bride's mother.</p>
                     <p>The beautiful home on S St., Washington, is almost an ideal place for a home wedding. Its artistic interior, with the rich frescoing and tiling and stained lass effects, needed little decoration to bring out their beauty. Miss Evans who, with her tall, slender figure, dark complexion and rich, black hair is always spoken of as a "particularly striking-looking girl," looked a picture in her white bengaline gown; she was attended by two bridesmaids, Miss Marion Shadd and Miss Elizabeth Cook, both of Washington, and the ceremony was performed by Rev. Francis J. Grinke. The large number of guests present included almost all the representative people of Washington--the Bruces, Shadds, Purvises, Frasers, Cooks, etc., etc., etc. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson left immediately for New York and Newport; at the latter place they will be the guests of the Smith's at their delightful home on Mary St.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Wilson, as Miss Evans, was one of the leading girls of Washington. After graduating from Oberlin College she was appointed superintendent of physical culture in the Washington public schools. Miss Evans entered upon her profession with enthusiasm, spending her vacations in well-known schools in New England; she is an accomplished musician, and Boston society congratulates itself upon this acquisition to its ranks.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wilson is not a native Bostonian, he was born in Georgia, and after graduating from Atlanta University came to Boston, when a boy of about twenty, to study law. He entered Boston University, graduated in the well-remembered year when "Bob" Terrell took his degree it Harvard, and Miss Consuelo Clark left the Boston University Medical School with first honors. Mr. Wilson entered the law-office of Judge Ruffin, and after the latter's death was associated with his son H. S. Ruffin; he at once entered, and has done faithful, intelligent service for the Republican party as a ready, interesting speaker. Mr. Wilson has recently been appointed by Gov. Greenhalge Commissioner of Emigration and Pauperism.</p>
                     <p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Wilson have been closely identified with the WOMAN'S ERA--Mrs. Wilson, as Miss Evans, as the author of the "Health and Beauty" papers and Mr. Wilson as an editorial contributor.</p>

                     <p>The greatest social event of<sic corr=""> of</sic> years in Fall River was the marriage of Miss Julia Jackson of that city to R. T. Teamoh of Boston, member of the House of Representatives. The bride who is well known in this vicinity for graceful and refined manners, as well as her prepossessing face was attended by her sister Miss Annie Jackson as bridesmaid; Mr. W. P. Hare went down from Boston to officiate as best man, also did Messrs E. S. Glover and N. Appo Johnson who acted as ushers.</p>
                     <p>The ceremony was performed by Rev. M. Hascall of the First Baptist Church of Fall River, who read the services from a white and gold book which also contained the marriage certificate and which was afterwards presented to the bride. A large reception followed the services during which Mr. and Mrs. Teamoh left on their wedding trip which will be spent among friends in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Long Island, N.Y.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and -Mrs. Teamoh will be -it home at 65 West Cedar Street, Boston, Sunday, July 15.</p>

                     <p>Miss Isadora Christiana Church of Chelsea was married to Mr. Edwin Butler Freeman of Hartford, on Monday, June l8th noon, in St. Luke's Episcopal Church Chelsea. The natural beauty of the bride was enhanced by the simple bridal robe of white with tulle and orange blossoms. Congratulations were

                     <p>Mrs. J. R. Lynch, of Washington, accompanied by her daughter Alice, has sailed for Europe. It is Mrs. Lynch's intention to make a permanent home abroad. The proscriptions, hindrances and lack of opportunity which surround the colored people of this country have always been particularly trying to Mrs. Lynch, who is a woman of great Spirit, fine mind and wide culture. For the present she will place her daughter in a pension, and will herself begin a course of study in one of the German Universities.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Cook (Miss Abele, of Philadelphia) have left for Scotland on their wedding tour.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Foster, of Cambridge, projected and carried out a very successful reception and tea for the benefit, of St. Monica's Home. It was held at Odd Fellow's Hall, Cambridgeport, the afternoon and evening of June 17. The hall is a perfect one for dancing, and because of its lofty ceiling and large windows was very comfortable, even on that intensely hot day. The arrangements were perfect; glasses of delicious Russian tea were served with crackers by girls of the "smart" set in summer dress. Miss Baldwin, of the receiving party, carried a beautiful basket of roses. The music was good, the crowd large, and it is hoped a goodly sum was realized for the charity.</p>
                     <p>Among the graduates of the Boston University this year was one representative of the race, Mr. Edgar P. Benjamin from the law department. Mr. Benjamin, who received the degree of LL.B., attained such a high standard in his studies that he was awarded the honor of "Cum laude," being the first colored young man who ever received it from the Boston University. Mr. Benjamin is a Boston young man. He graduated from the Sherwin Grammar School at the head of a class of fifty, next entered the English High School, where he won several prizes; after graduating from there and taking an advanced course he entered the University, where he has won scholarships each year.</p>
                     <p>With such a record we believe that his success in his future legal career is assured, and he has the well wishes of all his friends.</p>
                     <p>R.H. Terrell, Esq. of Washington came to town on the 21st of June for a week's stay and participation in the Harvard Commencement festivities. This is the tenth anniversary of Mr. Terrell's graduation, and he enjoyed it to the full.</p>
                     <p>The Grant-Bailey wedding was a morning one and the costumes corresponded to the time of day. Miss Grant wore it very pretty and appropriate gown of white swivel silk trimmed with lavender moire; with this she wore a large white hat.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Estev Mars officiated as best man and Misses Helen Stevens and Kate Smith as bridesmaids; the ushers were Messrs. Jas. T. Bradford, Jr., Frank Downing and Chas. Moore.</p>
                     <p>The wedding took place at the elegant home of Mr. John S. Trower the uncle of the bride, which was profusely decorated with flowers.</p>
                     <p>The bride's gown was of white watered silk, and the maids were dressed in pink china silk.</p>
                     <p>A large number of society people of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington were present. After the marriage Dr. and Mrs. Smith left on a wedding tour the destination of which is of course, a secret.</p>

                     <p>The marriage of Dr. George F. Grant to Fannie Bailey on the Wednesday the 27th of June was an event of great social interest, because of the popularity of the bride and the wide reputation of the bridegroom. The wedding was very quiet, occurring at the home of the bride's mother on Walden St., No. Cambridge, the only guests being the immediate members of the family. The bride wore her travelling dress--a handsome English covert cloth suit. It was a morning wedding, Dr. and Mrs. Grant starting upon their wedding tour immediately after the ceremony. Their destination is at present a secret, but they will spend most of the summer travelling, and their handsome residence on Charles St. will not be open to friends until the fall.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Grant is the only sister of Mr. Henry Bailey, a Harvard graduate and principal of the Washington High School. As Miss Bailey she had a large acquaintance and because of her brightness and amiability was one of the "popular" girls.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Grant is one of the best known dentists of the U. S. After his graduation from Harvard he was for many years an instructor of the Dental School; his specialty

is mechanical dentistry, and he has made himself famous by his invention of an artificial palate.

This is his second marriage; his first wife and the mother of his two daughters was Miss Georgiana Smith, daughter of John J. Smith. The first Mrs. Grant died a few years ago.</p>

                  <p>LUCRETIA L. LENOX--NANCY PRINCE.</p>
                  <p>BY AN OLD BOSTONIAN,</p>
                  <p>The death of Mrs. L. L. Lenox, wife of Mr. John M. Lenox, removes another branch of one of the oldest colored families in New England. Her grandfather, Prince Ames, was a soldier in the 27th regiment of Penn., Washington's army, and served from Bunker Hill to the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, and on one occasion was personally commended by Washington himself, who was trying the faithfulness of the guard for true soldierly conduct. His widow, whom many now living will remember, drew a pension till her death, which took place at Jamaica Plain in 1864, at the advanced age of ninety-seven. Mrs. Lenox's father, John T. Hilton, was born in Pennsylvania, but came to Boston at the age of seventeen, and until his death, in 1864, was one of the most prominent colored men in the country. In the early days of the antislavery movement he was called Mr. Garrison's right hand man by the colored people, and was afterwards, 1854, vice-president of the antislavery society. Her mother, who died in Cambridge, November 2, 1882, was a member of the female antislavery society; both being members of the African Baptist Church, Belknap (now Joy) St., where she (Mrs. Lenox) was at one time a member of the choir. Mrs. Lenox obtained her education partly at the Exclusive School on Belknap St. and at the Alumni Grammar School in Cambridge, and was esteemed by the committee as one of the two best readers in the Cambridge schools at that time. After her graduation she obtained a situation in a daguerrotype case-making establishment in Boston, where she was employed for several years. She was always one of the most active in every measure in which she was connected for the improvement of her people condition. Whe was among the young ladies that was always ready to co-operate with the Young Men's Literary society on occasions when their assistance was solicited, as it often was. (For this society not only did much to foster mental culture and improvement among the colored people of Boston and vicinity, but was also practical in many ways). She was also often seen going around carrying a number of bills given her by her father to be placed in special places, having the heading, so familiar to our people in those days, " To the Rescue! ------- Fugitives, about to be arrested," sent forth by order of the vigilant committee when some brave fellows, who had succeeded in making their escape from slavery, seemed in danger of apprehension and arrest. Many, now living, will remember her presiding at the tables of the antislavery fairs, and how much her cheerful ways contributed to enliven those occasions. She also was a member of the "Fourier Club", a society consisting of both white and colored persons, find was very influential in alleviating the conditions of the colored people.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lenox, after her marriage, was for many years a resident of Waltham, Mass, where she was always characterized by her devotion to her down-trodden people, and never ceased to speak or act in their behalf, when opportunity presented itself. It was through her personal influence and recommendation that that author and philanthropist, Nancy Prince, was introduced and became popular with the people of that town and the places adjacent; and the lectures she delivered from time to time in the former place may still be remembered by some of the older residents. Many an one in the old days gave testimony to the light they received from that entertaining speaker by her <sic corr="rehearsal">rehersal</sic> of her experience and labors in Russia and West India, for Mrs. Lenox was among the first of the many colored workers to embark for the W. I. after emancipation, where her labors with others that went from the U. S. were of great service, and her co-operation in antislavery work and in special works of philanthropy. It may not be known to many that Mrs. Prince was the founder of the first orphan asylum for colored children in New England and was its firs matron. Her book, "Life of Nancy Prince," published in 1849, may still be found in the houses of many of the old residents of Boston, as well as other places all over Massachusetts.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lenox was highly esteemed in Waltham, where she and her husband did much to dispel prejudice in that place, and to increase the antislavery sentiment there existing. She was also noted for her charitable disposition and her many acts in this direction will be remembered by not a few. Mrs. Lenox never forgot the lessons of Christianity, which were early inculcated in her by noble, high- minded parents.</p>

                  <p>Paper No.3,</p>
                  <p>The German system of gymnastics, almost a century old and built up by men of great culture and experience,--physicians, physiologists, and pedagogues--embraces exercises with apparatus, calisthenics, outdoor sports, such a jumping, running, leaping, throwing the weight, wards, dumb bells and clubs and military gymnastics. In this system specialism is discouraged. the aim is general physical culture. Another feature is class work, which produces endless pleasure and refreshment of mind, and to secure this result the instruction begins with the simple and works up to the more complicated movements.</p>
                  <p>The Swedish or Ling system of gymnastics is founded upon the laws of nature and the human organism, and the exercises are selected only when proved to be needed by the body. It aims to correct faulty growth and bad posture. This system starts with the functions of the heart and lungs, as the fundamental functions, with the welfare of all the other functions dependent upon them. Starting with the heart and lungs right, the progress is steady and systematic.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the best system to be pursued is a combination of the Ling and German systems under careful supervision of experienced instructors. In these two systems and the outdoor games and exercises in the reach of most of us may be found the means of bringing the body into harmony with the will, of attaining the grace of body, the growth of muscle,--the proportion so often lost sight of--the health of body and brain, and the dexterity of limbs and control of nerves of such inestimable value.</p>
                  <p>Faithful, earnest and painstaking physical exercise, such as has been indicated under intelligent direction, rewards the girl who keeps it up with health, youth and beauty. It keeps the body in the best condition for throwing off disease. It enables you to keep in the best condition for work with the hands or with the brain. It is a wholesome and powerful preventive of morbid, sickly and injurious brooding and thinking. It helps you to see things, to know people, and to judge them in a broad instead of a narrow spirit. It prepares you to meet disappointment, sorrow, ill treatment and great suffering as the strong, courageous and splendid woman meets them. It is a great aid to clear, quick and right thinking.</p>
                  <p>Physical beauty, strength, health and youth are priceless treasures, but they cannot take the place of mind and heart. The physically perfect woman is not full grown unless heart and mind have been also developed, trained and refined. Indeed, one aids the other, and neither can be fully developed without the other. "An open heart, and an <sic corr="honest">honsst</sic> mind are as essential to youth and health as breathing is." The face, the eyes, the mouth reflect the sentiments, the thought of heart and mind. The mind and heart that feed on diseased ideas, that live in impurity instead of in the fresh, inspiring, healthy atmosphere of right living and right acting, will take from the face all refinement, all beauty, and mark it with hard lines.</p>

                  <p>England is enjoying a monopoly on the novelists of the hour and is taking great pride in furnishing America with its fiction, as most of the books that have attracted universal attention in this country lately have been written by English authors.</p>
                  <p>No one is more fit to head the list of the popular English writers of the present day than is Thomas N. Hardy, who has been enjoying a reputation for years and has received the enthusiastic support of the best of the literary people of England. Of his books "Tess" in which lie depicts the recuperative power of a fallen woman, has been most widely discussed. He says that he takes his characters from the lower classes because he finds in them more sentiment and romance.</p>
                  <p>Walter Besant also depicts the lower classes.-- His characters in "All Sorts and Conditions of Men" are from studies carefully made by him while wandering through the slums of London. This book was written for a purpose and, strange to say, accomplished it. In it he showed that in all London there was not a place where a respectable poor man could go for recreation; and from the discussion which it caused, Queen Victoria opened the People's Palace, a great, hall where the poorest may find the best and purest amusement.</p>
                  <p>An adventurer who was able to turn his adventures into literature, and his literature into fame and money is H. Rider Haggard. And all before he had reached his thirty-fifth year! His first book was a failure, his second brought him fifty dollars; but from "She" he realized fifty thousand. He is now living quietly in a beautiful home with his wife and children and is the lion of all London.</p>
                  <p>Rudyard Kipling, who is now making his home in Vermont, is said to have brought India nearer to England than did the Suez Canal.
<pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
He has written nothing of New England worthy of his genius, but he says that he has a hundred stories of India unwritten.</p>
                  <p>Another adventurer who can send his imagination back into history and forward into the unknown, and who call chill the blood of and send horror to the heart of his readers is Robert Louis Stevenson. "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"and "David Balfour" are good examples of his style, but possibly his best is yet to come. He is now in Samoa.</p>
                  <p>Clarke Russell writes spirited tales of adventure of which he was himself a part. His tales are of the sea, treating of storm rather than sunshine. "The Wreck of the Grosvenor" is the most popular in this country.</p>
                  <p>Grant Allen, born in Canada, educated at Oxford, widely known as it writer on botany and physiology, and as exponent of the Darwinian Theory, made his first debut as a novelist, in "Strange Stories." Since then he has continued to write novels which deal with odd phases of life.</p>
                  <p>Conan Doyle is a London physician who is so entertaining as a writer that he is no longer allowed to heal the sick. His first success "Micah Clark," and his latest "The Refugees;" but the most popular of all his books are those on "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes." These are wonderfully clever detective stories, and the original of "Sherlock Holmes" is a doctor in Edinburgh, a former instructor of Dr. Doyle. So clamorous had the public become for more of the adventures, that the author was <sic corr="obliged">oblige</sic> to kill his hero, and <sic corr="profiting">profitting</sic> by the example of Bret Harte and Rider Haggard, refuses to resuscitate him.</p>
                  <p>Jas. Matthew Barrie is a Scotchman, a graduate of Edinburgh University, but who now makes his home in London. He is something of a humorist, and has lately been writing plays. "A Little Minister" and "A Window in Thrums" are his most popular books.</p>
                  <p>The most widely read and widely discussed novel upon religion is "Robert Elsmere" by Mrs. Humphrey Ward, on whom it is conceded that George Eliot's mantle has fallen. Her next book was "The History of David Grieve," which was read and discussed still more widely. Her latest novel is "Marcella", which is published in two volumes in this country, and in England three. It is selling well, but is not being talked about to any great extent.</p>
                  <p>Madame Sarah Grand, the author of "The Heavenly Twins" was born in Ireland of English parentage. She was married at sixteen and became the step-mother of two boys. She is said to be a very womanly woman, although she holds her opinions with a man-like firmness. She believes in absolute equality between husband and wife, and believes in the emancipation of woman from shallowness and ignorance, but not from domesticity. "The Heavenly Twins" is better liked in America than in England, though it is widely read in both countries.</p>
                  <p>William E. Norris, the author of "Matrimony," "No New Thing" and other well-known novels writes a sort of story that introduces his readers to good company. He lives in a beautiful country home supplied with everything that makes life delightful, and spends three hours of each day writing.</p>
                  <p>William Black is an author who excels in the description of natural scenery, but whose stories have nearly all a tragic ending, and leave an impression of sadness on the mind. "The Princess of Thule" and "Macleod of Dare" are romances of the Hebrides Islands.</p>
                  <p>Miss Beatrice Harraden, the author of, "Ships that Pass in the Night," is seeking rest in a little village not far from Yonkers, N. Y. She is a very slight little woman about thirty years of age and is afflicted with paralysis. Part of her writing is done with her left hand. She had no title for her book when she carried it to the publisher, and it was he who suggested that the book be called by its present name which was the heading of one of her chapters. She is now at work upon another novel which she does not expect to complete for eight or nine months.</p>

                  <p>NOTES ON NURSING</p>
                  <p>Paper No. II.</p>
                  <p>The care of the sick room forms a very important part of the nursing, the old saying "Cleanliness is next to Godliness" is nowhere more applicable than here. The nurse herself should be neat to a fault; she should have her hair neatly combed, clean calico or plain blue gingham dresses with deep wide cuffs and large aprons. Caps are not worn by all, but a nurse who has served her time and received her diploma fully realizes that to wear her uniform is an honor and is the proper garb for a nurse on duty, and belongs only to the trained nurse.</p>
                  <p>The teeth should be kept in good order, the nails well trimmed and sensible soft shoes worn to prevent noise when moving around the sick room.</p>
                  <p>The first thing to be noticed
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
about a sick room is the air. Some people are afraid of air, but if more people ventilated the rooms properly there would be less <hi rend="italic">tuberculosis</hi> in the world and especially among our own race. The more fresh air the better. The temperature of a sick room ought to be 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is well, if possible, to put the patient into the most pleasant room in the house where plenty of sunlight may come in. Watch the temperature, do not let it get chilly, never allow a patient, (no matter how warm it may be) to lie without a blanket over him. Oftentimes it is very hard to make them understand that this is necessary, but a chill would be liable to terminate fatally when one has a fever.</p>
                  <p>In order to ventilate carefully it is well to open the windows from top and bottom, the air which comes into the room from the lower part of the window is better, it circulates better through the rooms; and often it is found necessary to put a screen in front of the window. Avoid draughts.</p>
                  <p>Next to be considered is the condition of the patient's bed, notice carefully that all sheets are smooth and carefully tucked into the bottom of the bed, the pillows smooth, and comfortably placed under the head. Notice the wearing apparel, see that every article is smooth, nothing is more disagreeable than wrinkles to lie on. In my experience I find that different people are to be treated differently; some patients like one thing, others another, and it is wise to try to please the patient if possible, provided it will not conflict with the doctors orders. Always carry out the physicians orders to the letter, never try to question an order, give the medicine exactly when ordered, let the patient be your first thought. Nothing is more essential to the recovery of a patient, than cleanliness and careful bathing. The patient perspires very freely and has to be bathed very often. Bathe every day if possible, and if convenient change the top sheet every morning. The best time to give a bath is at 10 A. M., between breakfast and dinner. Frequent bathing keeps the pores of the skin open and  a great deal of waste matter is carried off by the skin.</p>
                  <p>For the benefit, of those who do not know how to give a sponge bath I will tell you in this paper.</p>
                  <p>Have plenty of towels and soap, two pitchers of water, one hot and the other cold, a large wash bowl and foot tub. Have the water about 98 degrees Fahrenheit, two wash cloths and a slop jar. Two extra blankets, brush and comb, tooth brush, etc. Place everything by the side of the bed and think before beginning to undress your patient so as to have nothing to leave the room for during the bath. Place the patient between two blankets, then remove the clothing and bathe carefully only one portion of the body at a time. Change water often and bathe only one side at a time then gently turn the patient and bathe the other side. Wash the feet the last thing. Put on the night dress very carefully by putting one arm in first, then the head and other arm. Next, comes the patient's hair, one side at a time, and lastly change the bed linen. Take the clean sheet lengthwise, fold it in very small folds or roll it towards the middle, placed the rolled part against the patient's back, smooth out the part not folded then gently turn your patient towards the smooth part of the bed and draw the rolled sheet over to the back part, tuck in both sides. Thus you put on the under sheet, a draw sheet is folded in the middle by the two hems and put on in the same manner under the back and hips. The top sheet is put on in an entire different manner. Lift the clothes up at the foot, take the clean top sheet which has previously been rolled halfway from the top hem and place the smooth part over the patient's feet, tuck in at the bottom with the rest of the bed clothing and draw the rolled part up, smooth carefully and your patient is sweet and clean. It takes from one hour to an hour and a half to do this carefully, but the comfort of the patient is assured when the bath is over. Alcohol may be rubbed on the patient, but it is not absolutely necessary. Some light nourishment may be given immediately after the bath, a glass of milk or cup of beef tea to prevent exhaustion.</p>

                  <p>It has been often charged that the Negro is dull and uninteresting; that he has no racial characteristics that are "sui generis" ; no native impulses to deeds and achievements that leave an impress in human history, and no place but that of subserviency in the strife of nations. There may be a degree of truth in all this depressing estimate of his worth, yet we need not seek far to find refutations more or less complete. There are so many things that contradict and make ridiculous the old stereotyped conclusion concerning the Negro's mental and moral worth that it is not worth while to argue against them. It is much more agreeable and reassuring to make note of some of the evidences that there is a soulfulness and power of captivation every where amongst us that now and then. surprise and confound our enemies.</p>
                  <p>We have recently been again reminded that we owe much to the people of England for their gracious recognition of the manhood and womanhood of the American Negro.</p>
                  <p>Twenty years ago when the American people were still unaccustomed to regard-their colored fellow citizens as others than serfs, with no status of respectability in America the British people heard with rapturous delight the sweet singing students from Fish University. These unaffected students so won the hearts of all Britain that chivalry could scarcely go further than in the spontaneous attentions and compliments paid to them. The charm of Negro minstrelsy was not more pleasing to the sturdy Englishmen than the unexpected refinement of these women. Our character as women worthy of womanly recognition was then firmly established in England.</p>
                  <p>The extraordinary interest aroused throughout England by Miss Ida B. Wells' thrilling recitals of American savagery is the further evidence of how British chivalry still regards the colored American woman. If the present manifestation of British sentiment in our behalf is higher pitched and more definite in its influence on American public opinion, it is because Miss Wells represents more intellectuality and a purpose that lifts her into the ranks of reformers. The unstinted social attentions paid to Miss Wells is a pleasing proof that British people are great hearted enough to pay just tribute both publicly and socially to those of our women who deserve it. What Miss Wells has accomplished in England strongly suggests the importance of a greater sense of conscious dignity and self respect among colored women.</p>
                  <p>If the compliment paid to our womanhood in England means anything, it means that worthy women of the colored race will find more appreciation than they have dreamed of, if when they deserve such recognition they will but expect and demand it. It cannot be denied that our own prejudices are largely responsible for many of the disadvantages that are charged to the prejudice of the other race. There is a largeness and warmth of heart here in America that have not yet been discovered to us. These pleasant surprises that are constantly coming to us both at home and abroad, as an offset to race <sic corr="resistance">resistence</sic> which seems every where to confront us, should inspire us with renewed courage and conviction that there is a sense of justice, a philosophic calm of thoughtfulness all about us, that we can convert to our own use and uplifting, if we will but seek it heroically and in good temper.</p>

                  <p>This admirable Association has now nearly reached its twenty-second year of work, and it would be difficult to estimate the influence it has exerted, and the amount of good it has done.</p>
                  <p>Its object has been exactly what its name expresses; viz. to help women forward in every line of progress moral, intellectual, political, social, and industrial. Its plan of work has been, to hold a congress of women at some central city in the autumn of each year, at which may be discussed any subject affecting women's welfare.</p>
                  <p>Such meetings have been held at such distant points as St. Paul Minnesota, Memphis Tennessee, Louisville Kentucky, Denver Colorado, as well as in Chicago, Buffalo, Baltimore, Philadelphia and other Eastern cities.</p>
                  <p>In every city visited, but most notably in the Western and Southern cities, the Congress has left the traces of its presence, and many an important institutions such as the Women's Exchange, and the Woman's Club may be traced to its influence. Everything we have we can trace to the Congress has been said in more than one city, and the Association has often been urged to repeat its visit.</p>
                  <p>The fee for membership is only two dollars a year, and besides the privileges of attending the Congress and taking part in its private discussions, the members even if not present at the meeting receive the printed reports of all that is done there.</p>
                  <p>A.A.W. does not exclusively advocate any one reform, but is anxious to present with perfect fairness all sides of important questions. The Woman Sufferage question has not of course been neglected, and among its members may be found ardent advocates for it, and remonstrants against it. They frequently therefore hold a symposium in which all aspects of the case tire presented., often bringing out a lively discussion. It is interesting to see how wide-spread is the interest in this movement. In a city where is was supposed that other topics would be more desirable, the directors found to their surprise that so much disappointment was felt when it was found that this was not included in the programme, that they were obliged to arrange for an extemporaneous symposium which proved to be one of the most brilliant features of the session.</p>
                  <p>The morning meetings which are confined to members only, are very interesting, as the Vice-Presidents report from each state, and bring out many important facts and much interesting discussion.</p>
                  <p>As it is a great object to unite all the women of the country, not in an iron-clad organization, but in cordial union of mutual interest and good feeling, the association has desired for some years to extend its work among the Southern states, where there is much new life thought among the women. Their reception at Memphis was very cordial and the meeting most successful. It was delightful to hear the noble "Hymn of the Republic" read by its author and responded to by the whole audience, in the city which had always been associated in our minds with gunboats, and shot and shell between the opposing armies in the civil war.</p>
                  <p>This year it is proposed to visit Knoxville in Tennessee, and afterwards to extend the journey to Atlanta, Ga., to visit the well known University which is doing so much to provide a higher education for the people of Georgia, and also the admirable industrial school at Tuskegee, Ala.</p>
                  <p>While the Association does not take up as a special work the defence of any one race or class of people, it does feel very strongly that in just and harmonious relations between all the various races and people who help make up the American nation, rests the only hope of firm and substantial well-being for all, and it is therefore earnest in its desire to promote good feeling between all sections of the country, and all classes of the people.</p>
                  <p>The welfare of the colored people is not forgotten, and while trying to emphasize distinctions of color as little as possible, they feel that the women who have come out from such deep experience of suffering have important lessons to teach, and that both for them and for all, their education and advancement is of great importance.</p>
                  <p>One measure which was suggested and urged at the Congress at Louisville, Ky., the training of colored women as nurses, is rapidly spreading through many states, and young women are seeking opportunity for the best training at the North, that they may be fitted to take charge of the classes which are established at Hampton and several other schools in the South. The letters in the ERA by Miss Burgess shows how well these pupils have profited by their opportunities. It would be very interesting to have reports from other schools lately established.</p>
                  <pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>The great object of the Association is to awaken thought among women and lead them to a just appreciation of the duties and meaning of life wherever their lot may be cast, feeling sure that in this way they cannot fail to promote "The Advancement of Women."</p>

                  <p rend="aligncenter">Paper No. 1.</p>
                  <p>In one of Hamlin Garland's short stories "Up the Coule," he puts into the mouth of a woman the following words : "It's nothing but fret, fret and work the whole time, never going any place, never seeing anybody but a lot of neighbors just as big fools as you are. I spend my time fighting flies and washing dishes and cleaning. I'm sick of it all."</p>
                  <p>The pathetic words of that poor housewife on a miserable western farm express in spirit, if not in form, the feelings of thousands of men and women all over our land.</p>
                  <p>All about us are human beings struggling not alone for existence, but for <hi rend="italic">life</hi>. A life enriched and made endurable by enjoyment of some of the countless advantages offered by the civilization of these last years of the nineteenth century. How drearily futile seem their efforts, needs not the pen of Hamlin Garland nor General Booth to depict. We have only to go, with our eyes and hearts open, into the great metropolitan poor districts of our American cities, and into the southern and western farm regions to learn for ourselves "how the other half lives," and to discover that there are more things in the life immediately about us than are dreamed of in our history, economics, or even in our philosophy.</p>
                  <p>And yet, though our investigation may reveal much sin, misery and suffering, we may also find that the outlook is not so dark as it may sometimes seem but that both theoretical and practical reformers are forwarding numerous general movements, political, economic, educational and religious for the purpose of bringing about greater harmony between those who ride upon and those who draw the industrial coach described by Bellamy in "Looking Backward."</p>
                  <p>But though the law, public and private charities, benevolent societies and institutions, and the churches have accomplished much in their particular lines of work, yet there are avenues of life into which they have never entered, and great masses of our country and large city populations which they have never effectively reached.</p>
                  <p>It is in the homes and lives of these people where tort and suffering are the common inheritance, and where there is almost total ignorance of what peace and love are that we find the objective need for the social organizations conducted for the most part by college and university bred men and women and known as College Settlements.</p>
                  <p>The settlements are not missions; they are not charitable institutions; but to quote the churchman of Nov. 19, 1892, "The settlement is simply a houseful of open hearted and intelligent men or women who approach the poor, not as visitants from another world, but as dwellers in the same block or ward, as finding a pleasure (and it is a real pleasure and not a fictitious one) in the acquaintance of their fellow-inhabitants and as claiming a share in the life of that quarter of the town, and a right to contribute whatever they may have in the way of books, or music, or pictures, or general information, or meeting rooms and acquaintances to the well being of the community to which they belong. This establishes the relation of the settlement to its environment as natural instead of artificial; it leaves no room for patronage on the one side or servility on the other."</p>
                  <p>The men and women residents have learned in a measure how to live the higher life themselves, and they believe in the utilization and saving power of every influence which tends to bring men and women closer to the human ideal.</p>
                  <p>The lines of work along which they labor are varied, intricate and well defined. Indeed, perhaps the most striking characteristic of the settlement movement is its flexibility. All details of the development of the worker's ideas of social intercourse are left to the neighborhood to determine, and every department of work grows out of some discovery made by means of natural and reciprocal social relations.</p>
                  <p>The wider knowledge and liberal training of the settlement workers enable them to take a scientific as well as philanthropic interest in the problems of life around them, and to see how factors from other forms of life may be introduced to aid in their solution and how the scope and influence of agencies that are already working toward social and economic unity may be enlarged.</p>
                  <p>They work all the more effectively because they recognize in the colleges and universities themselves, and in the society of the rich, cultured and
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
refined a subjective need for the settlements almost as great as the objective need. They have begun to realize that if their cherished educational and social institutions are to last, they must share the higher life for which they stand, with the great masses of working people and not be satisfied until the best influence of our civilization have penetrated all the ramifications of society.</p>
                  <p>The benefit to the residents themselves are not only negative, but positive, for as the Secretary of the editorial board of the American College Settlement Association expresses it, "Those who come to us expecting to give all and receive nothing soon find their mistake, for the help is mutual, and both we and our neighbors are richer for the new friendship and new outlook."</p>

                  <p rend="aligncenter">WOODFORK AND NANCY PRINCE.</p>
                  <p>The allusion to that heroic Christian worker and philanthropist above mentioned among the reminiscences contained in your last publication calls to mind the following incident of which some now living were eye-witnesses, an account of which may be interesting to many of your readers.</p>
                  <p>Most of the old residents of Boston had either seen or heard of Woodfork. In fact throughout the entire north no slaveholder's name was more familiar and no name more dreaded by those residents who had escaped from southern bondage than this inhuman cowardly kidnapper. Many a poor fugitive had been tracked by him and sent back to his so-called master. And he seemed to get along in his nefarious work unharmed.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1847 Woodfork visited Boston. And his presence here was evidence that he was on the track of some one that had fled from slavery and who was known, or supposed to be, in this vicinity, which proved to be literally true, for he had not been in Boston many hours before his form was seen in that section of the city where the great body of the colored people were known to reside. Although but few recognized him it seemed to be circulated about that a slave holder was hovering around. This information, which our people in those times were so accustomed to hear, was enough to keep their eyes and ears on the alert. One day between eleven and twelve o'clock A. M., there was a ripple of excitement in the rear of Smith's Court off Belknap Street. It seemed that some children had come out of the court and reported that a slave holder was in Mrs. Dorsey's, a woman who, by some means, had succeeded in shaking off oppressions yoke and reaching Boston. This news, which was always enough to make our people drop everything and go to the rescue, was verified in this instance.</p>
                  <p>It being working hours scarcely a colored man was seen in the vicinity; but, as it proved, there were those around that showed themselves equal to the occasion. Among these was Mrs. Nancy Prince (widow of Nero Prince), a colored woman of prominence in Boston who, with several others, learning that it was indeed true and that the slave holder was none other than the notorious Woodfork, hurried to the scene. Mrs. Prince had seen this kidnapper before and therefore knew him by sight; and they all started with the determination to thwart him at all hazards. It looked as if the cunning rascal had purposely selected an opportunity when he knew she was alone and no one seemingly around to enter her house. The woman was dumfounded at the sight of her so-called master and scarcely knew what to do or say, and he seeing her <sic corr="dilemma">dilema</sic> quickly announced to her that she was apprehended and would soon be in the hands of an officer, but that she could escape this trouble by going immediately with him. It was while this palaver was going on, which was all on one side, for his very presence had seem to paralyze the woman, for be stood with arms and hands outstretched and moving like the wings of a vampire. It was while this was in progress that the friends arrived, who immediately and without ceremony entered the house.</p>
                  <p>Only for an instant did the fiery eyes of Mrs. Prince rest upon the form of the <sic corr="villain">villian</sic>, as if to be fully assured that it was he, for the next moment she had grappled with him, and before he could fully realize his position she, with the assistance of the colored women that had accompanied her, had dragged him to the door, and thrust him out of the house. By this time quite a number, mostly women and children had gathered near by (Mrs. Chloe Cabot Thomas of the old ladies' home on <sic corr="Myrtle">Mrytle</sic> Street, Boston, being one of the number), whom Mrs. Prince commanded to come to the rescue, telling them to "pelt him with stones and any thing you can get a hold of," which order they proceeded to obey with alacrity. And the slave holder, in whose countenance surprise and alarm seemed clearly depicted and evidently con-

vinced that he had lost the opportunity of securing his victim, started to retreat, and with his assailants close upon him ran out of the court into Belknap street.</p>

                  <p>Only once did the man turn in his head-long flight when, seeing them streaming after him terribly in earnest, their numbers constantly increasing and hearing in his ears their exultant cries and shouts of derision he redoubled his speed and, turning the corner into Cambridge street was soon lost to view.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dorsey did not leave Boston, but by the advice of friends changed her abiding place to where she would be less likely to be surprised or retaken. But she was never afterwards molested. Nor was Woodfork again seen in this vicinity until 1850 when, in attempting to arrest a fugitive in Old Cambridge he was again put to flight in a similar manner; an account of which may be given hereafter.</p>

In June, 1891, the Dixie Hospital was first opened to receive intelligent colored women for training as nurses. It was thought that intelligent nursing ought to take the place of the granny nursing which for so many years has been the main nursing of the southern people. The Dixie Hospital was the avenue by which Hampton and the surrounding country was to receive nurses who were to be trained, and like others of their profession to stand side by side with the physician in caring for the sick and the afflicted.</p>
                  <p>In the first class there were only two nurses, but by the end of the year there were five. During that time there had been thirty seven patients cared for in the hospital wards. These five nurses above mentioned were Anna De Costa, Rosa Dunstan, seniors; Alberta Boyd, Susie J. Rix, Eliza Blackman, juniors, they were Hampton graduates, excepting Rosa Dunstan who had been promoted to the senior class, and took her year out in the training school. All of these were bright intelligent young women, and a better class of nurses could not be found elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>This Hospital was incorporated in March, 1892, although started before the Provident training school in Chicago, the latter by being incorporated first, is counted the older.</p>
                  <p>The thought of starting this noble work, came from Miss Alice M. Bacon, one of Hampton's earnest workers and teachers, one who believes sincerely in a bright future for the negro girl. The hospital is a neat frame building, painted light yellow, has two good sized wards, one male, the other female; and private rooms where private patients are accommodated; adjoining this building is the nurse's home, with all the conveniences of home life so that no nurse can be lonely.</p>
                  <p>The lecture and operating rooms are in this building.  The Supt. Miss Sarah Connacher is a graduate of the Waltham Training School, for nurses at Waltham, Mass. She is a very able instructor and matron. The nurses wear the usual blue and white seersucker dresses so popular in training schools of this country, the dainty white cap, cuffs and aprons.</p>
                  <p>The first class of nurses, did not have the comforts of a nurses home, but like true missionaries put up with the best that was given them and saw only the work which wits before them, during their senior year they were able to enjoy the Home.</p>
                  <p>The amount of charity work done by these nurses cannot be realized, but the cheerfulness with which the work is performed would lead one to believe that nothing unpleasant ever came into their lives. They go from case to case caring for suffering humanity, walking sometimes miles to their cases and back again in the evening. Every one who knows the Dixie nurses, loves and respects them. The guests of the Hygeia Hotel have employed a great many and the best doctors in the neighborhood demand their service. Some have been to New York, others to Norfolk and cities near Hampton.</p>
                  <p>During the past year a maternity building has been added.</p>
                  <p>This institution is supported by subscriptions, and donations.</p>
                  <p>Lectures are given daily for one hour to the juniors during the term in anatomy, obstetrics, medicines, and their administration, massage, 
bandaging and general training, special subjects connected with nursing, and special surgical cases, physiology, cholera and surgery.</p>
                  <pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>The instructors are physicians in the <sic corr="neighborhood">neigborhood</sic>.</p>
                  <p>Applicants for admission must be between twenty-one and thirty-five, have a good common school education be sound mentally, morally and physically. The term is two years, although a certificate is given to those who satisfactorily complete a fifteen month's course.</p>
                  <p>This is an excellent opportunity for young women who wish to grasp it. What an excellent thing it would be if the race would become interested in this Hospital; show some appreciation of the work, there is much that could be done if only the effort were made.</p>
                  <p>As a race I fear we are thoughtless, we grasp every opportunity but give little thought to the origin and growth of it. Let us think seriously and see what we are doing for the race; if we are doing nothing, let us try and begin to do something.</p>

                  <p>So much has already been published in the daily and weekly papers concerning the Wells Endorsement Meetings held in many places, in quick response to the call of President T. T. Fortune of the Afro-American League, that nothing remains for us to say that has not already been said, except to thank the Boston League for their hearty co-operation in the matter. The assistance of ex-president Walker was sought and the result was a dignified meeting managed by the League, which plainly indicated Boston's feelings on the subject. Eloquent manly speeches were made by President Emory Morris, E. G. Walker, Esq., E. E. Brown, Esq., Revs. Scott and Kirke, and Dr. Roberts, and the Woman's Era Club was in it from the start, and through one of the members had the last word at it.</p>

Oxford, England.</p>
                           <p>Dear Mrs. Ruffin,</p>
                           <p>Thank you for the copy of the WOMAN'S ERA just received.</p>
                           <p>Upon my arrival in Liverpool I began at once to fulfil my promise to you and to others that I would tell the people in England of the injustice done to the colored citizens of the United States. I found the greatest sympathy from the clergy and laity, and an anxiety to hear the truth from an impartial witness.</p>
                           <p>It was a matter of great regret to me that Miss Ida B. Wells had left England before I arrived as I should have been only too glad to have met her on the platform and endorsed her statements. She has won a great many friends for herself and for the cause which we have at heart. England knows enough to sympathize with the colored people in the states in their efforts to obtain justice. and to improve themselves. The <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi> have had splendid articles upon the subject. These represent the daily, the weekly and the monthly press, but in spite of the information which these have given the English people have comparatively little knowledge of the state of affairs.</p>
                           <p>I have spoken to many of the clergy in London and Oxford and asked them to raise their voice at every opportunity on behalf justice to the colored people. The English people love justice and have no prejudice and hear with the greatest interest of the efforts which colored people are making to improve their position. Many persons have been surprised to hear of the talent which has been shown by some in literature and art, and of the refinement and culture of many of the men and women vastly superior to many of a fairer complexion. The imprudence of some has done the cause harm even here, but the more visits England can have from people like Miss Wells the more they will be welcomed. I am sure that the WOMAN'S ERA may be a useful means of communication between the women on both sides.</p>
                           <p>Yesterday I saw the Bishops of Lincoln and of Reading, and in a few days I hope to see the Bishops of London and of Ripon, and to all of them I hope to explain impartially the position of affairs in America.</p>
                           <p>You may be sure that I shall lose no opportunity of speaking a word to obtain sympathy for those whom I have learned to love and work for in Christ's Holy Church.</p>
                           <p>May God bless your work, and especially the WOMAN'S ERA.</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>The letters that came to us from South Carolina describe a sad state of affairs there.</p>
                           <p>The spring <sic corr="drought">drouth</sic> has been followed by deluges of rain which threaten destruction to the crops. A letter that came to me yesterday begs that something more may be done and laments the unintentional cruelty of the <hi rend="italic">Red Cross</hi> in printing false reports that the sufferers are provided for. The truth is that famine is at the door. Many of the people are sick from eating the unripe corn all are at their wits end to know what to do next. The seed being different from usual and the planting late, besides the delays from first <sic corr="drought">drouth</sic> and then excessive rain, all conspire to hinder the crops and belate them, so that it is likely they will he late by five weeks at least.</p>
                           <p>Mr. C. gave out rations till he came away and since then two other merchants, one after another have carried on the work, but funds are now exhausted. Accounts of the use of twenty-five dollars show over seven hundred people fed for two weeks with grits from it. A little does a great deal. The trouble is there are so many destitute. Do you think a contribution at Trinity could be taken for them? I don't know what can be done. The "Lend a Hand" has sent the last they could get about two weeks back.</p>
                           <p>I wish I were a good beggar. But I'm not well at all--have had a week's illness that has left me quite weak.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Fortune has again demonstrated himself as a man of courage and energy in the calling of the meetings for the support of Miss Wells and her work. Such men as Mr. Fortune is, are natural leaders; they should take such a position and hold it in the face of opposition. The race puts itself in it pitiable position by refusing to support capable leaders; it seems to us that the only solution for us is for leaders to lead. Men of ability and brains stand back waiting for the whole-souled support that does not come or grow discouraged at the hindrances thrown in the way by the jealous and ignorant. So called high-handedness is justifiable in some instances, and it would be laudable if practised by some of our capable ones.

                     <p>At the time of the publication of the open letter to Mrs. Chant there were some of her friends who felt so confident that there had been some mistake that she (Mrs. Chant) was not capable of taking the position ascribed her, that they protested against our letter and expressed the opinion that we should soon have an emphatic denial from her.</p>
                     <p>That was two months ago; as yet there is the first word to be heard from Mrs. Chant. Her silence may mean many things, so as it is the virtual acknowledgement of her position as a sympathizer with lynchers and a contemptuous indifference to those who espouse the cause of the lynched. To the many colored women who have been enthusiastic listeners to Mrs. Chant's talks, this will come as a blow, but it is not the first of the kind we have received. It shows the great and pressing need of uniting.</p>

                     <p>This month we begin a fine series of articles on College Settlements by Miss Ella Smith, Newport and Howard University of Washington. College Settlements are hardly out of the experimental stage and their motive, methods and success up to this time are subjects of great interest to students of economics and charitable workers. Miss Smith is a graduate of Wellesley College taking the B. A. degree in 1888, and that of M. A. in 1892.

No such rivalry exists. Each one of the "leaders " mentioned in that article are trying to play their little part in the scheme of life with dignity and honor, and without rancor of rivalry.

                     <p>The July ERA, as predicted, was an unusually good number, full of interesting facts and of the good deeds of our sister leagues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <text>
                           <body>
                              <p>We were pleased to read from the pen of that brave little woman, Miss Ida B. Wells, and to learn from her letter from the copy of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Budget</hi> which she sent to the Kansas City League and from other reliable sources that her work is leaving an impression upon the public mind which must in the near future be productive of far reaching results. The more agitators and propagandists along the line the better for our cause, and the formation of Women's League devoted to the improvement of colored women and the promotion of their interests will, if properly conducted, become a potent factor in developing and disseminating those ideas which must form the bed-rock of any argument for equal rights in America; while the possession of such a magazine as the ERA will give force to the movement and contribute largely toward welding the various organizations into one complete whole, thus rendering work for the race more effective.</p>
                              <p>The ERA is at all times on sale at 1027 Charlotte Street, and the number of subscribers increases monthly. Dr. Scrugg's book, "Women of Distinction," is also on sale at the some place, and the league is hopeful of disposing of a large number of copies of this work which the doctor has compiled in so creditable a manner, and which, like many other literary productions of our race, should find a welcome place in every home.</p>
                              <p>During the month of May, Madame Cora Watson-Griffin gave a very successful concert for the benefit of the league. At the weekly meetings several interesting papers and talks have been given; we may especially mention those by Miss Worthem, Mesdames, Mallory, Handy and Allen.</p>
                              <p>A series of Demorest Medal Contests will soon be given by the Temperance Section.</p>
                              <p>A children's sewing class is held every Wednesday at 3 P.M. Parents are urged to send their little ones to this class where they may learn plain sewing, fancy stitches and the elements of dressmaking, free of charge. A good home in a Christian family has been secured for one of the girls from the sewing school, and she is now making her own living and assisting a disabled parent.</p>
                              <p>Aprons, wrappers, underwear, etc., are constantly on sale at the room, and ice-cream is served daily, Sunday excepted.</p>
                              <p>We look forward with pleasure to the August ERA, believing that new ideas are gained and possible difficulties avoided by this <hi rend="italic">personal contact</hi>, as it were with our co-laborers.</p>

                     <docDate>August 1894</docDate>
                     <p>Last month a letter from Miss Ghant from Birmingham, Ala., was published. This month we publish extracts from one from Mrs. J. R. England, one of the leading and active ladies of that city. The letter showing something of the work of the women of that city will be interesting to our readers.</p>

                              <p>Just about the time your letter was received we were preparing for a Woman's Convention in our city; this kept me quite busy. We had a large number of delegates from all over the state and a grand time. The women were deeply interested and among other things raised the sum of two hundred and thirty-three dollars for the Baptist school at Selma. I myself gave a talk on the work of the women in the north and east and many subjects concerning women and the home were discussed. I think the ERA is just what we need and is indeed worth the cost. The women here are doing good work, although mostly in charitable and literary lines. We expect soon to join you in forming it league.</p>
                              <p>I think a convention for the interchange of thoughts, for the planning of ways and means a splendid idea, not the least among its benefits is the inspiration it would give our women; but we should not be in a hurry, we should prepare well and carefully. I should like to see this section well represented and have the subject thoroughly agitated here. It seems to me that '95 is soon enough to think of holding the convention.</p>

                     <p>The Woman's Era Club held their last regular meeting for the season on Thursday evening, June 20, in the Sunday school room of St. Augustine Church to meet again for work on the third Thursday in September. Important business was transacted, Article III of the Constitution was amended, "to read all names presented for membership shall be balloted for and will be elected if receiving the votes of two-thirds of the members present. This plan to go into operation at the opening of the fall meeting of the club. The list of names offered for membership was laid over for the first fall meeting. A committee consisting of the treasurer, Mrs. T. Taylor, Mrs. M. L. Richards, Mrs. C. Hall and Mrs. S. Johnson were appointed to bank all the money now in the treasury, reserving enough for necessary expenses. The Woman's Era Club has now joined the grand army of clubs, having received the report through their president that they are now one with the "Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs," having complied with the rules and paid the annual fee. The Woman's Era Club closes the year with hopes of a future that will be filled with good works; they are ambitious and indulge in dreams that have been fully realized by some of our sister clubs.</p>

                     <p>The Woman's Loyal Union held a special meeting Monday afternoon, September 23, at room 61, Bible House. There was not even standing room, ladies having to stand in the hall without. Mrs. Victoria Mathews, president, presided. The meeting was called to protest against Southern mob violence, and to endorse Miss Ida B. Wells as a public agitator for the rights of our people everywhere. Among the speakers was Mrs. E. Stephen Mathews, a distinguished English lady, a temperance union organizer, delegate from Great Britain to the World's Columbian Fair; Prof. Scarborough of Wilberforce, T.T. Fortune, and our Canon Wilberforce, Dr. W.B. Derrick. The meeting was splendidly enthusiastic. Bishop Turner was also commended for his quick and courageous defence of Miss Wells when the associated press despatches chronicled condemnatory words alleged to have been uttered by a prominent lawyer of Washington, D.C., which bas since been denied. The Woman's Loyal Union recognize manly courage and the fearless exercise of the same, even though environed by Southern intimidation, as Bishop Turner ever is, hence they authorized Dr. W.B. Herrick to acquaint him with a resolution of appreciation.</p>

Mrs. Wilson honored the occasion by appearing in her wedding dress, an exceedingly rich affair of bengaline silk and chiffon. Two immense bride and groom cakes were among the ornaments of the sumptuous table. Toasts were responded to by the bride; the groom, Mr. Alphonso Stafford of Washington, and by Miss Smith. The table decorations were in red.</p>

                     <p>Sea Island city air seems drawing to Philadelphia clergymen particularly. Rev. 0.M. Waller of St. Thomas Church and Rev. H. L. Phillips of the Church of the Crucifixion have purchased homes there and are most comfortably, established. The Rev. W. V. Tunnell Dean of King Hall, Washington, D. C., and family will spend August there, as will also Rev. George J. Bragg of St. James Church, Baltimore, Md.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and Mrs. Andrew F. Stevens and family have opened their Cape May Cottage and are entertaining a large number of friends. This popular resort will be gayer this year than usual. Mr. and Mrs. George Dickey have taken a cottage there. It is expected that Mr. and Mrs.. Terrell and Mr. and Mrs. Church will also add to the cottage life. Many Philadelphians will, as usual, summer there.</p>
                     <p>The many Boston friends of Miss Maria Jones will be glad to know that she has recovered from a tedious illness which has confined her to the house for several weeks.</p>
                     <p>The basket picnic of St. Thomas Church was such a success that it encouraged the Guild to give a lawn party on the l9th at Sweet Brier. Quite a number of strangers were in attendance.</p>

                     <p>Boston and Boston only will be "home" to many of our best girls and boys who, on the completion of their schooling here, go out into various parts of the country carrying their gifts and graces to contribute towards the world good work while making their own living at practicing the professions of medicine, law, preaching, teaching, and nursing.</p>
                     <p>The love of Boston and the intense desire of the cultivated colored people to spend as much time as possible therein is pathetic. The agility shown by the Boston worker in southern. fields in getting home when school closes is only equaled by that shown by the clerks and sales people in a big dry goods establishment in getting out when the gong sounds. This is a great compliment to Boston atmosphere.</p>
                     <p>The presence of many strangers in the city has, as usual, started the annual summer festivities. Of course a harbor party had to come, first one occurred on Thursday, July the 19th, and was followed by a reception on the next (Friday) evening given by Mrs. E. E. Brown at her home in Boston Highlands to her guests the Misses Wilson of Indianapolis, Ind. The Browns, a young married couple, are already noted for their abundant hospitality and whole heartedness, and the invitations for Friday evening were extended with their usual lavish hand, result, a crush of sweet girls in lovely summer dresses and fine boys in unlovely dress suits. All who were brave enough to face the rigors of that intensely hot night and don party clothes and gloves were made as comfortable and happy as congenial company, delicate viands, iced

drinks and sweet music (by an orchestra in the alcove off the parlor), could make them. Mrs. Mitchel and Mr. Geo. Ruffin sang, and the more courageous among the young people danced a little. All made the acquaintance of the stranger guests. These ladies are the sisters of that distinguished lady the wife of ex-senator Blanche K. Bruce, also ex-recorder of deeds at Washington, D. C.; however, they are not dependent for consideration on any reflected honor from their sister, having a charming and winning personality of their own of which dignified simplicity of manner is the most conspicuous feature. The Misses Wilson were born and begun life in Cleveland, Ohio, as public school teachers, later when it was determined to make the public school system of Indianapolis the best in the country by employing the best teachers tit the largest salaries, these young ladies among others were sent for to help carry out the scheme. They are hard working teachers with an intense love for their work. They have built a lovely home in the city of Indianapolis to which they have removed their loved and honored parents, Dr. and Mrs. Wilson. Their father was for years a successful dentist of Cleveland, Ohio. Doubtless many courtesies will be extended these ladies who are making their first visit to Boston. The strangers at the party were, besides the guests of honor, the Misses Howard, Miss Benjamin, Miss Florence Smith, Miss Hare of Cleveland, Ohio, Mrs. John Downing of Brooklyn, N. Y., Mr. R. G. L. Paige of Virginia, and Mr. Wibican of New York, Mr. W. H. Hackley of Chicago, Mr. Wm. H. Hunt of Groton, and Mr. Charles Moon of New York.</p>
                     <p>Mr. R.G.L. Paige who has been in the city n for the past six weeks left Sunday night for his present home in Berkley, Va. "Dick" Paige, who early in life was compelled by his delicate health to leave Boston and seek relief from asthma in his native air, has grown rich and robust in Berkley. He came in June to Boston, his former home, to look for place and opportunity for some of his many sons, and reluctantly left the loved scenes of his school-boy days only on the repeated requests of his wife and eight children for,, "papa" to come home.</p>

                     <p>The Warick-Smith wedding was a very brilliant affair. It was said that more than four hundred presents were received; they were arranged on tables placed completely around a large room, leaving barely space enough for anyone to pass through. The fortunate couple departed under the fairest auspices for their future home, Germantown. New York's loss in this instance is the quaker city's gain, though this marriage bids fair to link New York, Brooklyn and Philadelphia socially closer than anything that has happened in recent years. All eyes are turned upon the whim-full, but winsome sister, Miss Kate Smith.</p>
                     <p>Half of the town went down to spend the fourth at Asbury Park, White Head House. Among them were Miss Kate White, Brooklyn's leading young lady, chaperoned by Mrs. T. B. Frances; they will end the season at Saratoga its will also Mr. and Mrs. J. Pegram Williams and a host of popular young men.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Joseph Attwell of Newark, N. J., is summering at Atlantic Highlands. Mr. Attwell has just returned after spending his vacation with his charming wife of only a few months.</p>
                     <p>The many friends of Mrs. Jerome B. Peterson (nee White), will be pleased to learn that she is fast regaining her health. It was exceedingly sad that the joy over the advent of a beautiful son was so soon shrouded with gloom. It was a painful blow to the whole family.</p>
                     <p>The King's Daughters "Willing Workers," Mrs. Dr. White, President, gave their annual afternoon and evening picnic which, despite the threatening weather, proved a most enjoyable affair.</p>
                     <p>St. Philips P. E. Church Sabbath School excursion followed closely the King's Daughters affair, a success in every way. Among those who attended were Mrs. Dr. Warick, who came on from Philadelphia for the occasion. Mrs. Wm. C. Green, Mr. Potter, whose wedding occurred a week or so prior to the Warick-Smith. This happy young couple have chosen Brooklyn as their future residence.</p>
                     <p>Miss J. Imogen Howard and sister have journeyed to Boston to enjoy a part of their vacation. They propose visiting a number of resorts before fall. Dame rumor has it that a certain foreign gentleman becoming disconsolate, owing to the fact that everybody was either out of town or going, acted on quick resolve and took the palatial steamer Puritan en route for Boston. Its interesting just why Boston.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and Mrs. James E. Garner and daughter, the beautiful Miss Evangeline Walker of Brooklyn, left Saturday for Pittsfield, Mass., Mrs. Garners home.</p>
                     <p>The Misses Florence and Cordelia Ray, school teachers, have decided to spend their much needed vacation in Stockbridge, Mass., at Mrs. Crispells' ideal homestead.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Dr. White in company with her daughter's fiancee, Mr. Chas. H. Lansing, left Saturday for Asbury Park.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Baker, mother-in-law to Rev. Hutchins C. Bishop, rector of St. Philips, is the guest of Mrs. C. A. Attwell of Putnam Avenue, Brooklyn.</p>
                     <p>Dame rumor is responsible for whispering a most brilliant surprise in store for some of the intimate associates of Mrs. Harry T. Mars--Anon.</p>
                     <p>The young and pretty bride of Dr. J. Frances Smith is slightly indisposed, suffering from the intense heat.</p>
                     <p>Mr. S.M. Tucker, brother-in-law to Rev. H. C. Bishop, is in town in search of a matron for a school for young girls in the far south. Miss Marcelius Munday, a normal school graduate, was offered the position.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn <sic corr="inaugurated">inaugerated</sic> the movement of indorsing Miss Wells by a special meeting held Monday afternoon, July 16, after which they co-operated with the evening meeting held at Zion's Church. The Union deserves unstinted praise for the courageous attitude it has taken, even though subjected to some mistaken judgment, it stands for principles not persons. Irrespective of personalities it firmly looks forward to the day when our people will discriminate between public and private matters with a truer discernment than is now shown.</p>

                  <p>The first break has come in the W.E.C. in the death of Mrs. Louisa Wilson, which occurred July 18th. The Woman's Era Club has lost one of its earnest and most interested members. She was a member of the Domestic Science Committee of the Club, and was as active in the work as her delicate health would permit. She was also an old and respected member of the Female Benevolent Firm. She was buried from the Union Baptist Church, Cambridge, Sunday the 22nd, with the badges of both societies on her breast and her casket covered with floral tokens of esteem. The W.E.C. carried a large and beautiful token in the shape of a leaf made up of full blown white and pink roses. A husband and sweet mannered little girl are bereaved by this loss.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1894</docDate>

                  <p>"Never in the history of civilization have women been so honored, loved, privileged and trusted as at the present time," writes Mary A. Livermore in an article on the American Girl, published in a recent number of the <hi rend="italic">Youth's Companion</hi>. What they do and what they are is to tell as never before on the national character. Therefore she appeals to the American girl to discard absurd and harmful fashions, and to cultivate a strong, healthy physique. To cease being superficial, inaccurate and unthorough. To embrace the ample opportunities offered for a higher education. The changed condition of life she says, which confront the girl of today, compel a larger education than has heretofore been deemed necessary. Women are to be weighted with larger duties and heavier responsibilities. The doors of colleges, universities and professional schools are open to them. They can pursue the same courses of study as their brothers and graduate with the same diplomas. She would, if possible, change the public sentiment so that every girl, no matter what her position in society, should not be considered thoroughly educated until she had learned a trade, business or profession and was self-supporting.</p>
                  <p>"Pembroke" is the title of a new novel by Mary E. Wilkins. It is, of course, a story of New England, and indicates that the success the author has attained in short stories is possible to her in a wider field. The story is a homely romance laid in a New England village, whose characters have a narrow range of life and a paucity of ideal incentives. It illustrates the power of a stubborn wilfulness, a family trait that in one person takes the form of a bigoted piety, and in another a blind perversity whose extreme exactings are amusing. In still another person the stubborn nature cherishes an injury until both mind and body are ruined.</p>
                  <p>"Kerrigan's Quality" is the title of a most interesting story by Jane Barlow, at young Irish authoress whose home is near Dublin. The emerald slopes, the rough sea and the quaint villages are all described as they could only be by one who has lived among them. While the pathetic, shrewd and humorous elements of her characters are presented with a realism true to life.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin is a young widow who took up writing seriously after the death of her husband. She writes charming stories for young girls which are by some considered to surpass Miss Alcott's. Her "Polly Oliver" is a delightful story containing the most lovable of girl heroines.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that Henry James is coming home to America to edit a magazine, and that Rudyard Kipling returns to England for the same purpose.</p>
                  <p>In regard to the magazine which Mr. James is about to edit, it is possible that it will be too characteristic of its editor to appeal to a large class of readers. The later novels of Mr. James can be appreciated only by those whose reading is extensive and whose knowledge of the world is such that they can reflect on the underlying causes of events.</p>
                  <p>An attractive little volume is that entitled "Aunt Lindy." Its author is Victoria Earle, the nom de plume assumed by Mrs. Wm. E. Matthews, the President of the Woman's Loyal Union of New York. The scene of the interesting little story is laid in the south, and the narrative is a pathetic illustration of 'Coals of fire.' The heroine is a typical woman of the negro race, well advanced in years, whose heart is warm, whose hand is skillful and whose life is devoted to the service of her Maker. The book contains four original illustrations by Mary L. Payne.</p>
                  <p>Mr. S.R. Crockett, the author of an interesting story of adventure called "The Raiders," is a friend of Robert Louis Stevenson from whom he is said to have learned the art of successful storytelling. He is a Free Church minister and has a charge near Edinburgh. An editor once requested him to write an article on a minister's duties. He wrote it in the form of a story of one day and received a telegram asking for more. Since then he has continued to write. "A Stickit Minister" is his most successful book. The scene of "The Raiders" is laid in Galloway, and the time is the early part of the eighteenth century. It is charming for vigor, breadth, adventure, landscape and character.</p>

Miss Blanche D. Washington.</p>
                  <p>Miss Blanche D. Washington is another example of what the race is doing in the world's advancement. She is one of the plucky, patient and persistent workers in the world of music, and notwithstanding the many drawbacks that beset her early pathway, chief of which was ill health, still, standing today as model teacher her fame is second to none.</p>
                  <p>Miss Washington resides at home with her mother, who is a successful business woman, being a celebrated manicurist. They are charmingly domiciled at 120 West and 26th Streets, New York, in handsome luxuriously furnished apartments which bear every appearance of refined and cultivated tastes.</p>
                  <p>While Miss Washington would not be considered a beautiful women, still, she has an intense personal charm, which has been the means of drawing about her an immediate circle of friends. At the age of thirteen, she commenced the study of the piano under some of the most prominent professors of New York City, Her progress was so rapid that all who knew her prophesied for her a great future. At fifteen she began teaching some little friends of hers and from that time on her life has been passed chiefly in teaching music And in order to give her pupils the best possible instructions, she is continually studying up methods of teaching from the best masters. Last year she attended Scharwenka Conservatory of Music, entering the class for teachers. This year she is studying harmony and composition in the National Conservatory of Music. She is also the composer of several pieces of music, her most recent and successful being a military schottische entitled "Friendship's Greeting."</p>
                  <p>Miss Washington claims that no true musician can expect to advance with the times without continual study. In addition to her regular teaching she has formed a class of all her pupils which meet for the inculcation of a thorough knowledge of the theory of music. That she also cherishes an ideal, is found in the fact that she is endeavoring to establish a Conservatory of Music, where for a nominal sum the best of instruction in all the branches can be obtained, for, as she says, while the White Conservatory offers till advantages and is open to all, the charges are beyond the means of the majority of colored-Americans. In this brief sketch it is impossible for the writer to say all that might be said in reference to the work of this charming woman, but still, I am glad of an opportunity to introduce, even through an inadequate description, one more of the clever women of the race to the many readers of the Woman's Era.</p>
                  <p>The above is the first of a series of pen-portraits of "Women Worth Knowing," which will appear in this journal</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">A Night Watch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One evening during the latter part of the Civil War the town of Bainbridge was filled with suppressed excitement. News had been brought from a neighboring city that the mob which a few days before had fallen upon New York, burning houses, killing helpless women and children--the mob that had left New York streets one mass of trampled human bodies--was coming to Bainbridge to continue its murderous work. Men gathered in groups on the street and talked in grave low tones then separated to make ready their guns and pistols. A neighbor came in to tell my mother the worst that was expected. For answer she gave him a look pitiable in its helplessness; then she stretched out her hand toward us children and looked about wildly as if for some way of escape.</p>
                  <p>Nothing happened that night, and with returning day hearts grow stronger. But at evening the men came home again with faces full of foreboding and that night no man in the town slept. The twilight deepened, darkness settled down unrelieved by it single gleam of light from the houses. A dreadful stillness pervaded the streets, and in the window of each of these darkened homes sat a silent watcher.</p>
                  <p>My mother tremblingly put together a few things in a bundle; I closely followed her. I think my child's heart recognized that her fright was as great as my own. Our house was surrounded by a low paling fence over which any school-boy might easily have vaulted, but the little gate of this fence my mother tied with yards of clothes line. Against the front door she pulled our heavy mahogany sofa. But, after all, how defenceless we were. Oh the happy children who were protected by a "big man with a gun."</p>
                  <p>When everything was done, my mother laid us children, fully dressed, upon the bed and sat down beside it at the open window. I took fast hold of her dress and lay straining my eyes in the darkness to keep her outlines. I was in an agony of fear lest somehow I should lose her, and kept fastening my slipping fingers nearer to the gathers of her dress. I think I must have fallen asleep and then wakened--wakened to the awful darkness--wakened to find that I had lost her. I [scream]ed in terror. I felt her almost spring upon m[e to sil]ence me; then she gathered me close up t[o her an]d again took up her watch.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly the stillness became full of a commotion that I felt, rather than saw or heard. My mother grasped the bundle beside her, dragged us both to our feet, then stood listening.</p>
                  <p>From the direction in which the men had been watching came a sound like that of horses' feet. There was noiseless running and husky whispering in the streets. The clattering noise grew clearer. I was leaning from the window now beside my mother, and in a moment more we saw the twinkle of lights carried by men on horseback with tall plumes upon their heads. Then men came tearing through the streets, the frantic joy of their voices breaking the terrible silence. "The soldiers! The soldiers! They've come to protect us!"</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Typhoid Fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fever has a combination of symptoms, as inflammation of lungs, bowels, joints, etc. Patients in such instances become emaciated. Good knowledge <sic corr="of fever">off ever</sic> is necessary. One can tell by the temperature and pulse; flushing of face; dry skin and coated tongue; rise of temperature when it rises to a certain height and lasts a certain time. The temperature is taken in five minutes. The Hicks thermometer is the very best and all families should possess at least one. The pulse is caused by the systole and diastole, contraction and expansion of the heart; it may be felt at the radial and temporal arteries. The adult pulse is taken at the radial artery in the wrist and should average 72 beats in a minute; in a babe it is best taken at the temporal artery and averages from 100 to 120 beats in a minute. Motion, exercises, dancing, etc., cause quicker pulse, and also eating. It beats from 60 to 70 in men, 72 to 84 in women. In cases of fever a pulse of 120 and a temperature of 102 degrees are dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The most important symptoms of typhoid fever are languor, headache and backache, nervousness, pain in the limbs, chills, feverish in the evening, temperature low in the morning, but rises to 103 or 104 at night; constipation, oftentimes diarrhea. Typhoid fever is supposed to come from some poisonous germ entering the bowels either through the water we drink <gap agent="tape repair" extent="10"/> be caused by bad drainage, etc. Th<gap agent="tape repair" extent="12"/>lly lasts
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
twenty-one days, rising gradually morning and evening until it reaches its climax, then turns and gradually drops. During the time the patient is usually very ill, requiring the greatest care in nursing. Oftentimes he is delirious and very hard to manage. Milk diet should be given at regular intervals and no solid food until the doctor orders it. Oftentimes the patient has to be fed in small quantities, every hour or even half hour in a day that the proper amount of nourishment be taken in twenty-four hours. The bowels are in such a condition that if a piece of solid food were given before they are able to receive it, they would become punctured and death would be the result. The diet of a typhoid patient is his principal treatment while convalescing and a nurse has to be very careful.</p>
                  <p>When the patient is first taken and has a chill, he should be put to bed in a large, airy, well ventilated room with not too many bed clothes, but warm and light. Eider-down puffs are objectionable. If the patient remains chilly, hot water bottles should be applied to feet and back and the skin may be rubbed with warm flannel cloths. A little hot water and brandy may be drunk.</p>
                  <p>Generally heat follows chills, then sponge with cold or tepid water. Give plenty of water to drink and cracked ice. Compresses and ice bags may be applied externally. During the perspiring time wipe body with warm flannel ; after perspiring is done change bed cloths and the patients, if possible, move into another bed. During this do not let the patient sit up, as some part of the intestines is inflamed. Give milk, gruel and stimulants, nothing but liquids; only give as much milk as is easily digested, in very small quantities.</p>
                  <p>Never waken unless sleep is too long and then raise the head gently and, administer the food. Give plenty of water, lemonade, barley water or toast water during the fever. Bed sores often come in acute diseases. Sponge baths ought to be given once or twice -daily during the fever. Symptoms of bed sores are redness, swelling and rawness. Sheets should be changed often and kept smooth, and the sacrum, hips, heels and elbows bathed with alcohol or brandy and water. Brandy and Bi-Chloride of Mercury 1-500, Oxide of Zinc powder used also. If skin is broken, air pillows should he used, zinc ointment or collodion and caster oil: When a black spot appears, wash with carbolic and apply poultices of flax-seed meal.</p>
                  <p>A good nurse will never have a bed sore on her patient; it is considered the most disgraceful thing and reflects very badly upon the nursing. Always wash the patient's mouth before and after each feeding; a fever patient's mouth tastes badly from the condition of the stomach. Every dejection should be disinfected and immediately disposed of, for in typhoid fever the contagion is in the dejections. The temperature of the room should be 68 degrees and carefully watched.</p>

                     <p>The Peabody State Normal Institute was held at the Hamilton Normal and Agricultural Institute from July 12th to Aug. 8th, 1894.</p>
                     <p rend="aligncenter">HAMPTON, VA.</p>
                     <p>One is truly thrilled with pride and admiration viewing the picturesque grounds of Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute from any contiguous point, and we, the teachers who are assembled here attending the State Peabody Summer Normal Institute, are highly favored and grateful for such a delightful place, breeze, baths, views, sails and practical instruction.</p>
                     <p>Prof. Edwards of Richmond, as principal, is ably assisted by Miss F. S. Bruce of Washington, D. C., Messrs. George Stephens of Lynchburg, B. A. Graves of Richmond and John A. Williams of Hampton, Va.</p>
                     <p>The instruction given by them from 9 A. M. to 1.30 P. M. in periods of thirty minutes shows thorough preparation in the different studies, and many of the methods are new and suited to this progressive age in which we live. The most fastidious would hardly fail to appreciate an object lesson given this morning of the river basin.</p>
                     <p>A glance into the well equipped recitation rooms, where about 140 teachers are seated, zealous, energetic and attentive, demonstrates the interest in education, moral, intellectual and physical. You are not surprised to know that over a hundred of these are women.</p>
                     <p>We are in debt to President Johnson for one of his most instructive and entertaining addresses, subject, "Practical Education." He is the proficient president of the Virginia Hard C. Institute, Petersburg.</p>
                     <p>The women of Hampton are also playing an important part. They have a flourishing teachers' institute and are not behind in any good work for the upbuilding of our race and humanity. I am reminded substantially of their thoughtfulness, that our stay may not be all work and no play.

The beautiful and enjoyable sails will linger fresh in the minds of all. They were incentives to the morning hours of study.</p>
                     <p>Receptions were given by prominent citizens at intervals, at which a brilliant company of invited guests assembled.</p>
                     <p>At the Soldiers' Home, one of the most beautiful places to be found anywhere, we were tendered a picnic, on which occasion the committee spared no pains to amuse and entertain, and well did they succeed.</p>
                     <p>The music was inspiring and "Forward " the word. Among the many present other than those in attendance at the Normal were Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Douglass, Miss Annie Simms of Washington, D.C., Mrs. Daggs, Mrs. Pinkett, Messrs. Joseph Waters, J. H. Robinson, F. D. Wheelock, Rev. Weeden and Capt. Washington.</p>
                     <p>The regret was general that the hour arrived so soon to turn our faces homeward.</p>
                     <p>A ball was given Aug. 3rd at the beautiful <sic corr="pavilion">pavillion</sic>, Soldiers' Home, which occasion was one of great beauty and enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Great preparations are being made at the beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Peake for the Green-Peake marriage. It will be the event of the season, so they who are in a position to know say.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Harris Barrette conducted a lawn party in the lovely grounds of her home on the 30th as she only knows how, and with much success. I have only one regret, and that is, I must return home tomorrow and leave these pleasures behind.</p>

                     <p>Every man, woman and child of the negro race should read, or learn to rend Frederick Douglass' article "Lessons of the Hour," in the July number of the A. M. E. Church Review. It should also be carefully read by any one who is not able to bring to any discussion of the southern lynching calm, unprejudiced and unbiassed thought. Logical, full of thoughtful lessons and carefully made statements which friend and foe would do well to make their own, the "Sage of Anacosta" makes here one of his noblest and clearest arguments.</p>
                     <p>We hope that marked copies of this Review will be sent to Miss Willard, Mrs. Chant and others who apparently need a convincing argument upon a matter of vital importance to a large number of America's <hi rend="italic">most loyal citizens</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Among the questions recently propounded by Mrs. Matthews, one is as follows: "Believing that one great stumbling block as a race has been a deplorable lack of race pride, we are led to ask, what is the present outlook on this line?" We wish that this question might be figuratively and literally impressed upon the mind of each of our young people, and that they would so diligently seek for the answer that it also would come, whether in the "still small voice" or in the "rushing mighty wind," so clearly and definitely that no possible mistake could be made in its significance.</p>
                     <p>A conversation recently took place between a party of white persons as to which race or nationality each one would prefer to be a member of. Having disposed of the Irish, Germans and Chinese, greatly to the disadvantage of these people, one remarked, "But I would be ashamed to be colored!" Ah, thought I, upon overhearing the remark, is not this the cause of much of our race trouble? Are we not, generally speaking, <hi rend="italic">ashamed to be colored?</hi> Carrying this shamefacedness about with us in direct proportion to the amount of pigment distributed to us, instead of rising superior to the conditions which confront us and forcing the world by means of RESULTS ATTAINED to admit that "A man is a man for all that," we tacitly proclaim ourselves to be objects of pity and disgust, and receive exactly the wages we ask for--contempt and pity.</p>
                     <p>At a meeting of the Kansas City League, July 30th, the work of Miss Ida Wells in England and this country was formally endorsed and the hope expressed that she might continue in the good work so well begun.</p>
                     <p>August 13th Lawyer T.F. Sublette delivered a very noble address before the League upon the following subject: "The legal status of woman in the state of Missouri." Notwithstanding the heat, a good sized audience was in attendance, listened very attentively, and enthusiastically urged the necessity of a course of lectures upon kindred subjects during the coming fall and winter.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Lucinda Day, one of the most enterprising members of the community, has opened a grocery store. We wish that more of our numbers would engage in some of the various lines of business.</p>
                     <p>During the last month the League has been called upon quite frequently to do missionary and charitable work, and in each case haas responded cheerfully to the full extent of its ability.

                     <p>The vacation months, July and August, have found nearly all of the clubs resting from active work as clubs, while yet individual members have gone on planning and preparing for the next season's work.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Era Club followed the vacation fashion and consequently has no achievements to recount this month. The president of the W.E.C. conceived the idea of using her vacation in visiting other clubs, and prominent club women in their summer houses or wherever they might be found, started out simply with the expectation of coming home filled with ideas and enthusiasm for the inspiration of her own club family. But physical infirmity sometimes gets the better of even the strongest will, and so it happened that days that were expected to be spent in congenial work were, instead, spent on an invalid's couch.</p>

                     <p>In spite of the drawbacks of a wholly tired and half sick condition, on the urgent invitation of the president of the Women's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn to come over and help her and at the same time present the claims of the club paper, a visit was made by the Era's president which cannot fail of being fruitful of good results all round. Of course at this season only a very small part of the membership the W. L. L. were in town, but enough intelligent enthusiasm remained with that small fraction to project and carry on a large meeting of both sexes at Dr. Derrick's old church on Sunday evening, August 12th, at which both club presidents spoke, preceded and followed in glowing oratory, by the present pastor and Dr. Derrick. Many complimentary and encouraging words were said of women and their present activity, and Mrs. Matthews' plan of forming chapters of the W. L. L. in all the large churches of New York and Brooklyn was unfolded and heartily approved. After August, these Sunday evening meetings will be continued and the plan more definitely detailed. If Mrs. Matthews' plan is carried out as she outlines it, New York will be the home of a powerful organization for good works, and the class of women Mrs. Matthews has gathered around her as helpers assures the stability and efficiency of the work. In the metropolis, as might be expected, there are a large number of women of means and a larger number of women with brains, who give the support of their intelligent sympathy and money to work laid out for them by their energetic leader, and in the hands of such well known and capable ladies its Mrs. H. H. Garnet, Mrs. Attwel, Miss Imogen Howard, Mrs. Carman, Mrs. Phillip White, Dr. S. S. McKinney and a long list of others equally as active but too numerous to mention, the cause of educating women up to the 20th century demands on them, is safe and sure in New York.</p>

                  <p>Miss Annie Fisher, the New Bedford young lady who is working hard for the first premium offered by the WOMAN'S ERA,-- a year's tuition at the Boston Training School of Music,--is said to be the possessor of a phenomenal voice, and for years she has sought an opportunity to cultivate it. But this young girl's life has been an unusually sad and pathetic one. Being early left an orphan and the sole support of a crippled grandfather, she saw no way to carry out the cherished desire of her heart, cultivate her voice, until her attention was called to the offer made in the, ERA. Now, through the kind sympathy of friends who know her talent and worthiness and the liberality of the publishers of the ERA, a way has been opened for Miss Fisher to acquire a profession by which it is hoped she may he enabled to more easily carry the burdens heaped upon her young shoulders. A few more subscribers secured and the scholarship is hers. A liberal percentage will also he allowed her for expenses in coming to Boston and returning to her charge in New Bedford, and, with the supervision the publishers of this paper have pledged themselves to have over her while studying in Boston, they feel that they are carrying out their settled policy of helping women to help themselves. The third premium, offered to children obtaining 25 subscribers, is still open, and through it an unusual opportunity is given to parents to immediately place their little beginners in music under the careful training of first-class teachers. The Boston Training School of Music is one of the best in New England, and a year's tuition in such a school for only a little energetic canvassing on the part of a child, is a lasting benefit received for comparatively nothing. When this offer is withdrawn such an opportunity is not likely to be offered again.</p>

                  <docDate>September 1894</docDate>
                  <p>Although it comparatively recent idea, stamp saving has become so popular that there are now few large cities in the United States which have not a Stamp Saving Society. The benefits of such societies are so large, and the trouble and expense so comparatively slight, it is not strange that they have multiplied so rapidly. Such societies can easily be started in tiny school or community.</p>
                  <p>The object is to encourage small savings, either by children or adults. No sum is too small to be received. It is expected that the deposits will be mainly of pennies, and when a deposit reaches the sum of five dollars the depositor is expected to transfer it to a savings bank.</p>
                  <p>The plan is very simple. In exchange for one cent, three cents, or any like sum, the depositor receives a stamp of the denomination of the sum deposited. This stamp is pasted in a book bearing depositor's name and address, When the book is full of stamps, a new one is received and also an account book. At any time books can be redeemed simply by presentation.</p>
                  <p>The outfit for a society costs but little. The book-keeping is almost nothing, as each book keeps itself. In large cities, there is usually a central station where books are issued and stamps sold in bulk; besides which there are branch stations where money is received and stamps sold by retail.</p>
                  <p>By such an institution it is an easy matter to teach children to save. Poor children spend many more pennies than rich and get into habits which are ruinous to thrift. Some one tells a story about a family set out of doors for nonpayment of rent, and while their poor old rickety furniture blocked the streets, their children were constantly running to and fro spending pennies for all kinds of foolishness. For every stamp deposited a child receives something tangible--a bright pretty stamp, and pastes it into his own book. Then, too, he becomes ambitious to fill up his book and denies himself to do it. Besides encouraging the saving habit, it is a great material help, many children being often enabled to get a new dress or pair of shoes with money that would otherwise have been worse than wasted.</p>

                  <p>Their method is to work quietly to effect their object and only to report to the public results accomplished.</p>

Women who, like Mrs. Harper, have spent their time in cultivating their heads and hearts for unselfish usefulness, are not old at sixty-seven.

                     <p>It does seem sometimes that the best weapon to use against those who are so alarmed at the thought of woman losing her womanliness and sphere in the near future, is absolute silence; so few of the arguments of these people are worth answering and in so many cases does it seem beneath one's dignity to answer.</p>
                     <p>The Virginia Baptist recently published a series of two elaborate articles which claim to prove through Bible authority that the only place for woman in the church is that of a singer and prayer, and that in teaching and preaching she (woman) is acting contrary to divine authority and that the exercise of the right of suffrage would be it deplorable climax to these transgressions.</p>
                     <p>The writer of this article is evidently in earnest but sadly in need of enlightenment, and although it is almost useless to hope that he can be reached by any kind of argument, yet it might not be amiss to ask him a few questions and to present to his consideration a few suggestions.</p>
                     <p>In the first place why do such people as he hold strictly to Bible text in one case and when it suits them, and not in another when does not suit them?</p>
                     <p>We seldom hear of them following literally the injunction "Take no thought of what ye shall eat, etc., and wherewithal ye shall be clothed.." In fact it is the brethren who are most anxious about their meat and drink and who see in women, possibly rivals, who are most concerned about woman's place in the church, and that it shall not be such as shall rob them of any honor or <hi rend="italic">profit</hi>. Such men tell us that common sense must be used in the interpretation of the Scriptures in a passage like the above. They acknowledge that changed conditions of living necessitate a liberal translation, and yet are so narrow as not to see that while the women of the year A. D. 32 were probably not prepared by training or opportunity to either teach or preach, that it is no argument that the woman of A. D. 1900, after years of culture and study may not be able to interpret the Scriptures as lucidly as "Guardian" at least; because Paul told woman what, with their limited opportunities they might do, it is an insult to his and their intelligence to conclude that they must not develop and use future opportunities. It is according to law, gospel, history and common sense that woman's place is where she is needed and where she fits in and to say that the place will affect her womanliness is bosh; womanliness is an attribute not a condition, it is not supplied or withdrawn by surroundings, it may be lacking in the most feeble and protected woman, and strong in her who is the sole support of her little ones and has to fight the flesh, the devil and the world too, in their behalf. It is spurious womanliness that only manifests itself in certain surroundings.</p>
                     <p>The Illustrated American has been publishing a series of prize papers for and against Woman Suffrage. As an argument for suffrage it is the best thing that has been devised lately.  The weak effusive arguments against suffrage can have but one effect on the indifferent, and that is to turn them into suffragists so that by no mistake they may be counted among these remonstrants. The thing that strikes the readers more than anything else is the constantly repeated argument and fear that through suffrage woman will lose her womanliness, this is the strength of the opposition and it means only one of two things, either the opposition is weak or it is blind, in either case it merits little attention.</p>
                     <p>It is as impossible for woman to turn back as for time--they are bound to march on. Only let them be patient and calm--not unduly excited and aggressive over these small attacks; let them treat them as the strong womanly woman treat all pin pricks.</p>

                     <docDate>September 1894</docDate>
                     <p>In discussing his own question, "Are we brave men or cowards?" T. Thomas Fortune in the August Monthly Review makes a severe arraignment of both the white and black races in this country, from the point of view of one who has hoped much from both and been disappointed. He puts his case strongly, and supports it with undeniable facts, facts so, self-evident as to call for no emphasis here, except to draw attention to some phases of the question--the responsibility or the negro himself for allowing a continuance of existing conditions because of his inability to organize for the general welfare, because of his utter lack of veneration for, and support of worthy and capable leaders, and the dwarfing effect of vast charity bestowed and willingly accepted by him. These are some of the causes, Mr. Fortune claims that are having the effect of keeping the race in its own, and the estimation of others, but "As children of larger growth." Of course the usual number will rise up to berate the asker of the question and make the usual charge of traducing and discouraging the race, because like a true healer Mr. Fortune seeks first to locate the cause of the trouble; if in doing so the sensitive wound is hurt, all the more evident is it that an unhealthy condition exists; true progress is not possible until a healthy, manly condition is obtained. Time was when the exigences of the case compelled the largest allowance of charity for the short-comings of a race just graduated into manhood, but after a quarter century or opportunity, though limited, failure to strengthen the belittling weaknesses which so hinder and retract us in the fight for existence, is inexcusable and in the present critical condition of things, fatal. Timid men and ignorant men should stand aside, they and the mendicant who stands always with <sic corr="outstretched">outsretched</sic> hand for alms possess not the spirit for leadership. All too long has the way been blocked by bold incompetents who misrepresent, by burlesquing the colored people of the country. The time is come when they must stand aside for others more capable and more independent. Now also the whole race should realize the importance of doing its share of giving, as well as taking in more ways than one.</p>

                     <docDate>September 1894</docDate>
                     <p>One of the interesting institutions at Hampton is the society for the study of Negro Folk-Lore and Ethnology. A few years ago a similar society was formed in Boston among the colored people, which was the first of its kind in the country. Although there were a few enthusiasts the society died from lack or interest.</p>
                     <p>There have been and are two strong sides as to the value of such work. There are those who believe firmly that the sooner the colored man loses and <hi rend="italic">forgets</hi> his characteristics, the better it be for himself and other Americans. In a lecture delivered in Boston some time ago, George W. Cable advised the colored people to make all haste to drop those marks distinctly negroid, to strive to write like a white man, dress, act, and talk like one, and so hasten on the day when they will be distinguished only as "Americans." Others believe just as firmly that the best good of the race is served by preserving all characteristics that are worth preserving; that we have attributes, of mind and characteristics of expression that might rather be copied by the other race rather than dropped by us. At any rate, it can but help to dignify the race to preserve its anecdotes and songs, the work that is being done by the Folk-Lore Society.</p>

                     <p>Over forty years have passed since Lenard A. Grimes, of revered memory, came to Boston with his wife and four little children. He had just been released from a second imprisonment in a southern jail for persistently aiding and abetting slaves to escape from bondage. He was converted to Christianity in prison, and on reaching Boston immediately threw himself with ardor into evangelistic work. A ripe field he found for his zeal at the West End of the city, and having attracted to himself some of the best people of Boston and vicinity, he founded a church, and by almost superhuman effort, built and paid for an edifice for his people to worship in. He ably planned, and lived to help execute the plans for the most beneficent of all charities, the "Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women" an institution conceived, started and carried off for a while by him, with but little aid or encouragement from any source. He died in the fulness of the activities of a loving minister to people of all creeds, colors and condition. His title of "Father" grew out of the paternal, loving interest he showed in the affairs of his parishioners, and he was commonly called so by all citizens. For long years after the death of Father Grimes his place remained vacant.

Although many were tried, none were found able to take up the work where the Rev. Mr. Grimes left it twenty years ago until the Rev. Father Field stepped in, and today in his successful work for the closing up of the liquor saloons, in cleaning up the homes of the poor of the neighborhood, in his trade schools and in his latest and most significant achievement, the securing of a branch of the public library for the West End with all that that implies, he is unconsciously, perhaps, making realities of some of Father Grimes most cherished dreams.</p>

                     <p>That disgusting mountebank, Sam Jones, the evangelist, should find no place among real Christians. With his foul and irreverent talk, he does nothing but harm to the cause he pretends to be called to represent. His talk generally, and his latest harangue at Round Lake Camp meeting grounds particularly, should convince colored people that no message of grace will be sent to them through such an instrument.</p>

                  <p>In the August Cosmopolitan is a sketch of a Home Culture Club that was started by an enterprising woman in a most unneighborly neighborhood. It explains in the form of a sroty the need of clubs for women and the good they accomplish. A great many women who are outside of the club movement are of the opinion that they are only for the highly educated, or are composed of strong minded women who, oblivious of home duties, spend their time discussing woman suffrage and social reform in the loudest of voices. To such as are of that opinion, this "Story of a Club" can but be a revelation. Even if a club as a body does not do anything for the outside world in the way of charity that will reflect credit on itself, it will accomplish untold good by raising its members individually from the ruts of their daily lives, and giving them an insight into the lives and purposes of others. But work a club must have of some sort, as an excuse for being.</p>
                  <p>"A Superfluous Woman" adds one more to the sensational books that have been so widely read of late. We might well ask, "Whither are we tending?" when so many ennobling, edifying and interesting books are allowed to remain on the library shelves uncalled for and unread. It is we women who are responsible for the present trend in literature, for it is the women who do the novel reading. Is there not something wrong in our education when we prefer the sensational and dramatic phases of life to life as it really is, as is found in history? Mr. Howells says that the American girl is not educated; that she reads nothing but novels, and those according to fashion and not on their merits. Mr. Howells has spent much of his time in Italy and is enthusiastic in regard to the attainments of the Italian girl. The educated girl of Italy speaks several languages fluently and well, and is conversant with the customs, history and literature of other countries besides her own.</p>
                  <p>When the summer with all its frivolous pursuits is of the past, and we settle down to improve the shining hours of the long winter evenings and our minds at the same time, we can ponder "Man's Place in Nature" with Thomas Huxley, or over "The Ascent of Man" with Prof. Drummond.</p>
                  <p>"A Friend of the Queen," by Paul Gaulot, and which has been translated into English by Mrs. Cashel Hoey, is a work that throws much light on the French Revolution and the events immediately preceding it. It begins with an account of France during the latter part of the reign of Louis XV, and gives a complete history of Marie Antoinette, presenting her character without partiality and her various experiences with historical accuracy.</p>
                  <p>Agnes Repplier, whose monthly letters add so much to the attractiveness of the Cosmopolitan, has written a book of essays which display great originality of thought, and places her in the front rank as it writer. She has a deep and varied knowledge of literature, and uses quotations and gems of verse with a facility that adds much to her fine and polished style.</p>
                  <p>The August Cosmopolitan concludes the charming Spanish story, "The Origin of Thought," begun in the February number. This is a story of real people whose ordinary doings are told in a most interesting manner. The illustrations are particularly fine.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. E.D.E.N. Southworth, who has written volumes and volumes of entertaining fiction, is still living. Between thirty and forty years ago her books were eagerly read, but they are now no

longer in demand. She was the originator of the continued story in this country. Her first one was called "Retribution," and was published in a Washington newspaper. She preserves with great care a letter which she received from the poet Whittier, in which he says that "Retribution" is the finest piece of fiction he ever read.</p>
                  <p>The book upon which Ex-Congressman John M. Langston has been at work for several years is soon to be published.</p>
                  <p>Those who have read Sarah Grand's "Heavenly Twins," and, aside from the high purpose of the story, found it uninteresting, will find the author at her best in "Our Manifold Natures," a collection of short stories which were written previous to the production of her long story.</p>
                  <p>W. Clark Russell, who writes such thrilling tales of the sea, has given to his readers another romance aboard ship. It is called "The Emigrant Ship."</p>
                  <p>J. Stanley Weyman's novel, "Under the Red Robe," treats of <sic corr="France at">Franceat</sic> the time of Cardinal Richlieu, when life was all romance, and honor, love and murder seemed to reign pre-eminent. It is a spirited tale of adventure and just escapes sensationalism by the noble qualities of its women characters.</p>
                  <p>Rudyard Kipling has written a book called The Jungle Book," in which the animals hold conversations and appear good or bad according to their various characteristics, as in the days of Aesop. It will take its place as it favorite with children.</p>
                  <p>Amelie Rives Chanler, whose name was on everybody's tongue when "The Quick or the Dead" was first produced, is now among the dead, so far as literary fame is concerned. She has become a settled matron, her figure having lost all its girlish grace. And her once blonde hair has returned to its original brown.</p>

                     <p>The town is not only deserted, but looks deserted, the majority of our people being about equally divided between Saratoga and Asbury Park. Until this year, Atlantic City and Newport have to all appearances been the magnet, attracting searchers for health and seekers after pleasure.
<pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
This year Asbury Park takes the lead with Saratoga a close second.</p>
                     <p>The centre of attraction at Asbury Park from our city is, of course, Miss Katie White. She and her tall distinguished looking fiancee attract no little interest while walking, boating and driving; the young man, by the way, is not only on the road to an enviable financial position, but is one of the most popular young men in Brooklyn. A great many people liken him to Hon. Chauncy M. Depew. I believe in features they are somewhat alike, noticeably so. They differ politically. Mr. Lansing, well every one knows 'tis Mr. Lansing, is a follower of the child of lucky destiny Grover C. I have seen Depew, and when be looks at you makes you think he's not acquainted with anyone else in the world but you; while Mr. Lansing impresses one with the thought that for some cause or other he desires to laugh, and out of politeness is striving to suppress it. I know one fair damsel that looked away up into his face with the most innocent expression imaginable and said coyly, "Do laugh real hearty, I don't mind." Well, he did laugh. After 'twas over he looked just the same as before. Strange, but of course when one thinks a little he can't be blamed for looking so irritatingly delighted with himself and the world. We congratulate him; why should not he congratulate himself?</p>
                     <p>Mrs. White still tarries at the Park. Mrs. T.B. Francis has departed from its fascinations and joined the brilliant company in Saratoga.</p>
                     <p>Gotham misses the one personality that in some indefinable way arouses a lively picture of South American beauties and belles--Mrs. J. Pegram Williams--there's no one here that possesses more "chic" than this same lady. Her millinery is positively sentimental creations, thrown in splendid relief by her beautiful black eyes and midnight tresses. Speaking of her, one instinctively thinks of her sweet little chum whom a tall, Saratogian will lead to Hymen's altar in the near future. It is positively distresing to think of the many bright girls who will in the fall add to the already over-crowded ranks of fascinating matrons.</p>
                     <p>Miss V. Adele Montgomery, Gotham's charming pianist, will journey to Saratoga to spend the closing days of this season.</p>
                     <p>One of our most charming widows, it is said, will this fall journey to France, Paris. I know somebody wishes it were Hayti, but then, that brings the thought of another widow, a magnificent one, too, from every point of view; perhaps No. 1 had better go to France.</p>
                     <p>There have been meetings and meetings. It is amazing to sit and listen to the woman talk. I understand that perfect type of a Colonial Dame, Mrs. J. St. P. Ruffin, visited our city in the interest of the ERA, and addressed a large meeting at Bethel church in conjunction with the Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn. Somebody was selfish, because very little was seen of this cultured woman suffragist, though I did see a party conducting her from Macy's Lunch Room.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Frances E. W. Harper passed through our city en route for New London, Conn.</p>
                     <p>There is, I am sorry to say, a real anarchist of African descent in our midst--of course this is a rumor, but based on pretty solid fact--a past college professor, well versed in chemistry and an able linguist. He was one of the most prominent at an anarchistic demonstration a short while ago. As his ancestry has left so light a trace of its individualizing touch on complexion, feature or manner, strange things and revelations may be in store for those who are so sure that the colored man is the symbol of prayer and peace. The gentleman in question is about to make an extensive tour through the south, after which be rests in--Illinois.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">THE SLAVERY CASE IN BOSTON.</head>
                  <docDate>September 1894</docDate>
                  <p>Some little while ago the people of Boston were startled by the newspaper accounts of the case of a colored girl held in virtual slavery in Boston. The story was a most startling one and aroused the interest and attention of everybody. The Woman's Era Club through its president at once began an investigation in which it was very much aided by Sawyer Plummer of this city.</p>
                  <p>The girl when interviewed at the home of Dr. Crocker presented a very interesting personality; about sixteen years of age. She was exceedingly well-grown with the very noble features which often accompany a dark skin; she appeared modest and reticent and suffering at the time with an aggravated case of heart disease, she excited the interest and sympathy of all her visitors; her story was most startling.</p>
                  <p>She claimed to have been born in Beaufort, S. C., and lived there with her parents until ten or twelve years of age. At that time a northern lady, Mrs. Hanson, who was visiting the south with an invalid friend, saw her and attracted by her had persuaded her mother to let her take the child north; Mrs. Hanson drew such an attractive picture of the life the child would lead, of the advantages she would have that the mother sent the girl willingly. After reaching Boston, according to Mary's story, they were driven to a street in South Boston, and entered it house which Mary never left for four years. In telling the tale of her life in this prison Mary went into the minutest detail. She was confined to a back-kitchen and wood shed during the day and an attic at night.. She was obliged to rise before daylight, was only allowed a fire in the kitchen stove while cooking, was fed on the scraps front the table and went bare foot all the time; she was never allowed in the front of the house and the window in the wood shed was barred and locked.</p>
                  <p>The story of her escape was in keeping with the rest. A colored woman who worked for a married daughter of the family heard of her, managed to see her and to give her a quarter of dollar and an address and advised her to escape. One summer night Mary secreted the key of the wood shed, and after the family went to bed unlocked the door and escaped. It was very near midnight, however, before she had succeeded in getting free; she was then barefooted and dressed in a ragged gown which only reached her knees. She had not left the house long before a terrible thunder storm arose and she sought refuge in the car house where she waited for the early morning car to Boston. She succeeded in finding the people whose address had been given to her, was put to bed from which she did not rise for many months. After a partial recovery she sought another service place, but from impaired health was unable to do much work. She went from place to place and finally landed with Dr. Crocker of Huntington Avenue to whom she told the tale and who at once took steps to circulate, it to seek out Mr. and Mrs. Hanson, and to interest people in behalf of the girl whose health had reached such a stage that an early death was expected. The story caused a sensation and steps were taken to find and prosecute the slave holder. Money and gifts were offered the girl who received every attention with quiet dignity.</p>
                  <p>After much trouble the Hanson family were located and interviewed. From letters front the girl's mother and former teacher in the possession of Mrs. Hanson it was found that almost every thing told by the girl was pure fabrication. The girl had left the south when about the age of fourteen in company with other girls and women seeking service places in the north. She had gone to Mrs. Hanson to take care of children and had lived with her two months only, during which time she had been out nearly every day with the children and at the time she was in very poor health.</p>
                  <p>When the truth was discovered the girl was immediately <sic corr="dispatched">despatched</sic> to a hospital for treatment, and when last heard from had not been discharged.</p>
                  <p>To those who saw the girl and heard the piteous tale she told, interrupted by the painfully drawn breath, who followed the details told so graphically it seemed almost impossible that the story should be a fabrication; and yet, without doubt, it is, and it is only repeated here in answer to many requests and for the benefit of many interested people who have learned the sequel for the first time.</p>
                  <p>Whether the girl is mentally unbalanced is not known; in any case she is an interesting study to the psychologist.</p>

                  <p>CHICAGO, ILL., Aug. 20, 1894.</p>
                  <p>In the July number of the WOMAN'S ERA, in the biography of Mrs. R.E. Moore, written by Francis A. Lewis, the following statement occurred: "The Woman's Club of Chicago evolved from a meeting called by Mrs. Francis E. Harper while visiting Chicago during the World's Fair, etc." That portion of the statement referring particularly to our club I wish to correct. The I. B. W. Woman's Club of Chicago owes its existence solely to the zealous efforts of Miss Ida B. Wells. Will you kindly print the correction in the September ERA.</p>

                  <p>All loyal club women will patronize our advertisers, and so help to make our paper a valuable advertising medium. We are happy to be able to personally endorse nearly all the advertisers. In this connection, we would like to call especial attention to some of our advertisements.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Casneau makes and furnishes materials for a walking or visiting dress for $23.00. This hardly needs comment. A stylish, well-made cloth dress at $23.00 is a bargain, as the average woman must know.</p>
                  <p>Harvey, on Temple Place, trims hats and bonnets for 50 cents; makes and trims for $1.00. This is something for the economical woman, who wishes to dress well, to know.</p>
                  <p>Libby's millinery rooms, on Temple Place, are well known, as is also the beauty and style of the bonnets and hats which come from there. A unique department of the business is the making of bonnets through mail orders. If a description of hair, eyes and complexion is furnished, satisfactory head wear is guaranteed.</p>
                  <p>At Roberts', 578 Washington street, can be had fifty kinds of candy for 12 cents per pound. This is something for women who get up sales, fairs, etc., to remember.</p>
                  <p>Ray, on Chatham Row, sells a prepared icing which is so good it is called "Perfect Icing." What an advantage to have an icing which does not spoil or foment, all prepared for use. Ray also has a splendid complexion soap, "Mealine," which we can personally recommend. It is what few perfumed soaps seem to be--pure and efficacious.</p>
                  <p>H.W. Berry, 646 Washington street, is agent for all the first-class pianos, Steinways, Chickerings, Kranich &#x0026; Bach, H.F. Miller, etc., which he sells on easy terms; and if slightly used, at great reduction. Choosing a piano is an important matter, and it is well to know of a place to go where you can make no mistake.</p>
                  <p>Baldwin &#x0026; Dorsey, real estate agents, 555 Main street, Cambridge, are doing a business of which we ought to be proud. They have a well-equipped office, command all kinds of property in this city and suburbs, place mortgages, loan money, and build houses. They are young men of good business ability. It is an advantage which we hope our readers will embrace, to have the use of such an office as this.</p>
                  <p>West End day at the World's Food Fair was one of the most successful of the month. The demonstrative lecture in the Home Department was by Mrs. Carrie Dearborn on "Chafing Dish Dainties." Nearly four hundred ladies were in attendance, closely following the preparations of devilled chestnuts, cheese <sic corr="fondu">foudu</sic>, and that last <hi rend="italic">piece de resistance</hi> oyster rare-bit. The hygienic lunch, which followed the lecture, had been prepared in an Aladdin oven. The banquet table display was that for a bachelor's dinner.</p>
                  <p>Why cannot the Domestic Science committee get up a course of lectures for the W. E. C.? Old methods in cooking, which considered only the palate, are becoming obsolete; nowadays, no cook is a cook unless she knows how to cook economically and healthfully, as well as palatably.</p>

                     <p>In entering upon the work of associate editor of the ERA, I do so with a firm faith in the power, responsibility and unlimited scope of woman's work, and its ennobling influence, when rightly placed and practically supported. I am proud to be associated with the splendid array of womanly women who will labor in the future for the success of this woman's venture, THE ERA, and with deep emotions of anxiety and hope, look to the women of my section to stand by me and hold up my hands. I beg their interest; I desire their support and sympathy. With it lies success; without it, failure and all its attendant humiliation. There is a great work to be done, but no one woman, or no ten women can carry the weight of this great undertaking--the successful establishment of a woman's high-class paper--without <gap agent="tape repair" extent="6"/>ressive masses with them. My experi-<gap agent="tape repair" extent="6"/> the past has taught me that women can<gap agent="tape repair" extent="6"/>together, when drawn together by something pure and noble, and I know that the one demand of the women of my section journalistically, is matter that shall appeal to the noblest sentiments and the most exalted ideals. I pledge my pen to all such as will aid in making this column the forum of discussion for all that shall interest, encourage and develop the highest type woman and the purest class of matter.</p>

                     <p>A Sketch of Frederick Douglass in his Home.</p>
                     <p>After a pleasant drive through the Capitol grounds, and through the wide, tree-bordered streets and avenues of the city, we crossed a bridge spanning the eastern portion of the Potomac, and threaded our way through the modest village of Anacostia,--historic, as containing "Cedar Hill," the "House of the Hon. Frederick Douglass." Long before the wide, hospitable portals were reached the house could be seen nestling, as it were, in slumberous quiet 'neath great sighing trees.</p>
                     <p>It sets north and south, planned after the typical southern fashion of more than a generation ago; a two-story and garret brick house painted white, green window blinds, a bay-window in the centre of the second story, two more at the eastern side of the large drawing-room. A wide, old-fashioned piazza runs the entire length of the front, the centre of which is decorated by open latticework, and the whole supported by four large white columns; wide steps running the limit of the piazza, which is fitted up with hammock, rustic seat and rockers - the very picture of repose, comfort, and all that is peaceful. The trees about seem to mark and emphasize the most attractive individuality of the place--retirement 'mid soft, shadowy <sic corr="loveliness">lovliness</sic>, the silent dispenser of rest,--"rest to the weary." So irresistible is this soothing atmosphere that one instinctively feels the charm of silence and meditative environment ere he has passed beyond the wide entrance of the spacious old mansion; but when in the imposing presence of its white-haired master everything seems absorbed by the stirring, fiery personality of a most wonderful man; not only wonderful among a class of people, but all men of the earth regardless of creed or condition -- he stands a living monument of the possibilities of man, a monument to the cause and principles that strong men have died for. The earth holds no nobler, no more truly great, none more worthy universal love and venerated esteem than this gentle-voiced, kindly-mannered, uncrowned king, whose reign and kingdom is the hearts of millions of men!</p>
                     <p>There's a splendid slope on the western side of the house where he delights in standing, and well he might, for it has no equal in all the district. It commands an uninterrupted view of the city of Washington from an altitude of 133 feet, the gleaming waters of the placid Potomac shimmering between. From this point the great white dome of the Capitol can be seen and, close by, the beautiful structure, designed and now in course of building for the Congressional Library, of pure white marble in strong contrast to the Capitol. It is crowned with a massive golden dome --like the sun and silver of youth and age together they stand surrounded by every condition of human life and progress; and still, beyond to the west, the great Washington monument towers over 550 feet mid-air. A clear morning, the scene unfolds before the observers on Cedar Hill like a dream city born of inspiration, and established by enchantment; and peculiarly impressive it all is when Frederick Douglass stands there with uncovered bead, his fine white hair blowing with the breeze, his massive form erect, standing out in bold relief with his beloved trees as a back-

Marvelous changes of time and state, time-honored gradations of earthly power, inspired touch of Poesy and Romance, when compared with the meed of his experience, pale into feebleness, for no character known to authentic history has encompassed more of the extremes of life than his, and will in time prove, if it has not already proven, the beautiful source of inspiration to not only the emotional muse of poetry, but the fiery realms of heroic tragedy as, well. His course from the beginning stands forth to the world as America's great epic. Who has conquered and vanquished greater foes and obstacles, single-handed, than he? Nobly he wears the weight of three-score and ten years of active usefulness, his vision clear, and his step as active as most men twenty years younger, The great parts he has played in the most tragic scenes of American life have not, as one might have supposed, left him shorn of the faculty of enjoying quiet; not so; he has emerged from the din of battle grateful for the quiet meditative silence of his beloved home.</p>
                     <p>His home life is simple and altogether free from restraint. The world of good people is made welcome at his portals, character and worth being the passports required. No distinctions are made socially ; it is man and woman, regardless of color, past condition or inheritance, and daily there are pictures seen and enacted here rarely met with beyond the limits of a grand stage.</p>
                     <p>I call to mind one gem-like evening when, in the ordinary course of neighbors dropping in, a beautiful golden-haired maiden presided at the piano; and among the company were two elderly gentlemen, father and son, the latter an artist of great merit, -- Messer, I think, is the name -- the elder, like Mr. Douglass, is a performer on the violin. After considerable music, vocal and instrumental, with a kindly twinkle in his eyes, the elder Mr. Messer passed to Mr. Douglass' side with his mellow-toned instrument, and awakened the familiar strains of "Auld Lang Syne." Bending low, with his eyes fixed upon the "Sage of Anacostia," his whitened hair in picturesque harmony  with Mr. Douglass' snowy locks, as the sweet familiar tones vibratedon the air, about the works were sung with thrilling effect by "Our Douglass," the picture they made was worthy a painter's brush. Few eyes in that room were undimmed with tears when the music ceased; but such is of ordinary occurrence at Cedar Hill. I have said his home life is simple; well, it is. He rises very early, and before breakfast it is his habit to stroll about his grounds, which consist in all about sixteen acres of undulating land, partly under cultivation, raising sufficient fruit and vegetables for the family use, and flowers for the dainty decoration of table and parlors. I felt very proud, on my first morning stroll, to be rewarded by a cluster of white southern lilies culled and presented me by my honored and revered host, whose mind and heart has caused lilies of thought and resolution to spring into rich growth in every clime where'er civilization extends. He breakfasts with the family at 7 A. M., after which he retires to a quaint retreat in the rear of the mansion, a tiny structure looking more like a fine "mi lady " doll house than anything else; it is Mr. Douglass' "sanctum sanctorum," however, known as the "Growlery " (from Dickens). It is almost covered with vines and embowered by tall lilac shrubs. The Growlery is sufficiently removed from the house to insure absolute quiet; it contains, besides a comfortable lounge, a brick hearth and modern grate for winter use, a tall desk, where Mr. Douglass does his writing standing there's just room enough for the books and papers of immediate necessity, and himself, and, what is dearer to him than strangers can at first understand, his <hi rend="italic">croquet set</hi>. To say that he is an ardent admirer of the game is to express it mildly--he is more--an enthusiast, and as everyone is aware who knows, even slightly, the domestic side of his nature, that he is an expert player. After spending the morning in his Growlery (as if he ever needed a place in which to growl !)he emerges in answer to the midday dinner-bell, after which he watches the sun gradually recede from his croquet lawn, and so soon as it is sufficiently shady, and the work dress of blue is replaced by it fine white flannel, he is ready for his game. The ladies of the house are all good players, Mrs. Douglass and Miss Fog particularly so. Frequently such men as the Hon. John R. Lynch, Mr. Bailey, president of the Capitol Savings Bank, Mr. Robt. Terrell and many others, find relaxation from business cares in this absorbing diversion. Mr. Douglass' grandson, Joselph Douglass, the gifted violinist, is spoken of as a most excellent shot; Mrs. Robt. Terrell and Mrs. Lewis Douglass are particularly noted not only for thier skill, but for certain charming qualities, which tend to enliven and make wonderfully entertaining the game, even for losers. It is very amusing to watch a contest between Mr. Douglass and the above mentioned gentlemen, they are all so
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
serious. They do not regard their bost's career in their contests; they play seriously to win. But Mr. Douglass rarely misses an aim, and his superior skill is best evidenced by his unerring field shots. To watch his lively interest in following the game and the course of a ball, his field being large, one could easily fancy him a score younger than his own figures testify; his vitality is a constant source of happy amazement to all who enjoy the privilege of either taking sides with or against him. As a rule the tea-bell ends the contests, and after a light repast the evening is given over to the most pleasurable diversion offering itself--sometimes quiet chat, in which reminiscences take the lead, a game of checkers or music. Just before retiring, after "good night " has been said to guests in general, 'tis his regular custom to smoke one segar, sitting in a big rocker on the piazza, listening to the murmuring sound of insect life, or wandering up and down the grounds watching with quiet interest the myriads of twinkling lights, that mark the pathway of the gently gliding Potomac and' stretching around and through the city beyond ; and now that skill and science has succeeded in illuminating the headdress of the Goddess of Liberty on the Capitol, it is indeed an uplifting picture.</p>
                     <p>The family habits are about the same day after day; the most notable changes being the guests that journey over long distances to stand in the presence of Frederick Douglass; and the tide is largely like that one, known to poesy, that goes on forever.</p>
                     <p>Men of affairs, women too, come for guidance; and minds, restless with the fires of ambition, journey here for inspiration, and to all he is, in the purest sense, sire, brother, and Pythian friend. Though his voice may not often be heard from the public rostrum, yet, watchful and alert, he dwells upon his beloved Hill living the theory of manhood he advocated in the very beginning of his struggles for freedom -- that manhood, womanhood, in its truest sense is not, cannot be, confined to caste, race or nation.</p>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Prospectus.</p>
                  <p>The news found on the page devoted to the Nation's Capital will be social, literary, philosophical and otherwise, particularly the latter, when the others fail. Not so much social as to make those of a literary turn of mind wish there was no such thing as society; not so much literary as to make those of a social nature sigh, with Solomon that "Of making many books there is no end;" and much study is a weariness of the flesh; not so much philosophy as to impress the reader with the hopeless ignorance of the writer. So much for good intentions, which pave the way to success, as well as to other places of which we have all heard.</p>
                  <p>We shall not be slaves to the grammar of the English language--what there is of it. We shall say "we," when it suits our purpose, and "I" when occasion requires, rules for the agreement of the pronoun to the contrary, notwithstanding. The fashion to ruthlessly ignore rules and principles of English Grammar was inaugurated by a certain Saxon Gamaliel, prominent in school circles here, when he boldly declared "It is me " to be both correct and elegant. It is natural, then, that we lesser lights, following in the light of the leader, feel encouraged to commit manifold infractions of grammatical rules, not sanctioned outside of our progressive literary circles.</p>
                  <p>Washington schemes reserve the right to be as impracticable as they are illogical. Living in a city whose atmosphere is surcharged with 
<pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the virulent germs of congressional theory, we object to having any plan or project that may hereafter appear subjected to the cold, hard test of logic or common sense.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ida A. Gibbs, a graduate of the classical course of Oberlin College, has recently been appointed teacher in the High School here.</p>
                  <p>The first colored woman who received the degree of A.B. in the United States was Mary J. Patterson, who graduated from Oberlin College in '62. The schools of the district have sustained an irreparable loss in the death of Miss Patterson, who, for twenty-five years, rendered valuable service as a teacher. When Oberlin College opened its doors to women, she was courageous, indeed, who dared to brave public opinion by taking what was commonly called the gentleman's course, on the principle that it belonged exclusively to the lords of creation, and no women need apply. only 3-oan 'g women of the loftiest ambition and the keenest thirst, for knowledge presented themselves -,is candidates for the degree of A. B. Miss Patterson was among the first to prove to the world that Greek and the higher mathematics could be mastered not only by young women of the favored race, but by their sisters of the oppressed race as well. Nothing better reveals the fine spirit, the resolute will, and the strong intellectuality of Miss Patterson than her decision to take and complete the classical course at that period.</p>
                  <p>The Colored Woman's League has been invited to send delegates to the National Council of Women of the United States, to convene them from Feb. 17 to March 2, 1895. One spokesman will be elected to bring greetings from the League to the Council. Only national Organizations are invited to participate in the meetings, on account of the large number of societies of which the Council is composed. Such an invitation from such an important body as the Council furnishes another proof of the advantage of a national organization of colored women. If they are to become an important factor in solving the knotty problems of race and sex, they must get a hearing, and play a conspicuous part in the deliberations which look toward that end. Let them unite themselves into one grand national organization which shall extend from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and from Maine to the Gulf.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. A.J. Cooper, Mrs. Grimke and Mr. John Wesley Cromwell read papers on Negro Folk Music at the last meeting of the Washington Folk Lore Society. This organization has not allied itself to the American Folk Lore Society, although it has been cordially invited to do so, because it sees fit to work alone. While they plod alone, they will also profit alone, when the results of their researches are given to the public. This is by no means a bad idea. With Rev. Alex. Crummell as president, Mrs. A. J. Cooper as corresponding secretary, and Miss Clara Smith its recording secretary, the success of the society is assured.</p>
                  <p>The reception given by the Misses Welsh to Miss Blanche Songo of Philadelphia and Miss McKinley of Columbia, S. C. , was a brilliant success from all points of view. Nothing, could have been daintier and sweeter than the ladies who graced the occasion, and nothing more courtly and chivalrous than the gentlemen in attendance.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Gerrett S. Wormley, Jr., grandson of Wormley of hotel fame, recently wedded Miss Rebecca Webster. By the way, speaking of brides and grooms, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Downing, recently married in Brooklyn, are spending part of their honeymoon in our city, and are the recipients of much social attention.</p>
                  <p>A mending bureau has been started here with every prospect of success. Mending of all kinds is done with neatness and dispatch. What a boon such a bureau must be to our friends, the bachelors! But -- will it encourage them to prolong their single blessedness? If so, can the mending bureau really be encouraged and countenanced by benevolent beings? Verily, there's no rose without some thorn on this mundane sphere.</p>
                  <p>"What do you think our Washington men admire most and can tolerate least in a woman?" asked a young lady of an inquiring turn of mind, not long since. "Now, that's hard to tell," said a wise sister some years her Senior. "I believe beauty is the surest road to success," said a friend who overheard the conversation. "By no means," said the wiseacre to whom the first question was propounded; "there are more exceptions to the rule of beauty than can be found in an English spelling-book." "Is it intelligence?" persisted
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the young lady, more anxious and more interrogative than ever. "Just the faintest suspicion of that; just enough to be a bit witty and able to see the point of a stray joke which the hero of the hour sees fit to perpetrate," continued the Minerva of the group. "The young men seem to forgive a lack of brain more easily than they can the absence of other qualities," she continued; "no, no, child, don't give too much time to the cultivation of the brain, if you want to be a reigning belle here. Spend your extra time and money in adorning the person, and let your mind take care of itself, if you want the men to admire you. Be known as a power in the world of fashion. Always be <hi rend="italic">fin de siecle</hi> in the matter of hats, gowns and all the appointments of dress, and the victory is yours. There are several cases to prove the point. There was Miss"-- But here the interesting conversation on the peculiarities of the Washington beaux was interrupted by one of the very species upon whom so much philosophy and logic had been brought to bear. This conversation set me to thinking. I wonder what Washington men really admire most and can tolerate least in a woman? Will someone answer this weighty question?</p>
                  <p>"How can young women enjoy foot-ball so much?" queried it friend of a college graduate, not long since. "To me it seems a brutal sport, in spite of the sanction given it by English and American universities. It gives me a chill to hear a young woman rhapsodize over the game, for it seems incongruous with womanly delicacy. Yes, I know some very fine women enthuse over the game, but if they are sound on other points, I explain this little weakness by ascribing it to a mental obliquity in the first stage of development!" "It is it fad to rave over foot-ball," explained a young co-ed in a tone of horror and disgust. "If you can not thrill over center-rushes, halfbacks and touch-downs, you label yourself a relic of the candle and bird-cage crinoline period." "It is a brutal sport," persisted the first speaker, just as firm and as far from conversion to the new regime as ever. "Harvard is to be congratulated upon having a sensible president, who discourages foot-ball, as it is now played, and is doing his utmost to have the brutality and barbarity eliminated from it."</p>

                  <p>After many years of waiting, the colored women of New Orleans have at last organized a Woman's Club. New Orleans has her Portia Club, her Quarantes and Geographic, but their doors are opened only to the more favored sisters. For a long while there were faint hints of it following in this line, but it was not until the 6th of October that nineteen women, old and young, met in the basement of the Tulane Ave. Baptist church to discuss the plans for a woman's club. The gathering, as a whole, seemed ripe for the movement, and without further parley, the organization was effected, and officers elected as follows: Mrs. Sylvanie F. Williams, president; Mrs. Odalie Morse-Jackson, vice-president; Mrs. Hattie Jackson-Moore secretary ; Miss H. V. Feger, treasurer.</p>
                  <p>A committee composed of Mrs. M. A. Williams, Miss Arabella Kennedy, Miss Clara J. Isabelle, and Miss Alice Ruth Moore, was appointed to draw up a constitution. The club met on the 17th again, with a much increased membership, and adopted the name of the Phyllis Wheatley Club, adopted the constitution, and declared the WOMAN'S ERA its official organ.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Williams outlined the work of the club as follows: It should be divided into a certain number of committees on different subjects, each committee to be devoted exclusively to its line of work, the general work to be arranged and outlined by the executive committee. As they now stand, the committees are:</p>

                  <p>The Colored Teachers' League of New Orleans is not a woman's affair, by any means. No, it is redeemed from the flatness and general unprofitableness of a gathering in petticoats by three real, live, flesh and blood, healthy men, principals in the public schools. After a three months' vacation, the League began its winter session on the 20th, and held the annual election of officers, Mrs. S.A. Gates being elected president; vice-president, Miss Emma V. Lopez; secretary, Miss Sarah Allen ; assistant-secretary, Miss Clara M. Holland; treasurer, Mrs. F. E. Chester.</p>
                  <p>There is growing up in this city a musical circle as interesting and as absorbing as any that ever clustered about the confines of a rare old town, with a conservatory in the distance, and the melodious chime of cathedral bells, and violin tones quivering in the fragrant air. While music has always found its home here, music of the sweetest and rarest kind, yet it is only lately that a real atmosphere of the scientific study of the art has found its way among us; and now it has progressed so rapidly and so completely that for many of the gayest votaries of society, there is nothing so supremely important as the alternation of lesson and study. Orchestras and quartettes and trios, violins, cornets, violas, violoncellos, mandolins, men and women, boys and girls, enthusiastically push our city forward as one of the great musical centres of the south.</p>
                  <p>For two months it hasn't rained here, and New Orleans is very warm and thirsty. Her clothes look gray and her linen is yellow from being washed in bad and insufficient water. Her face is breaking out in pimples from drinking and bathing in unaccustomed river water. The big cisterns stand dry and empty and cracked. The heated, stifling air chokes with its blinding, suffocating whirls and eddies of smoke. The sky hangs blue, brightly, dazzlingly blue overhead, and the sun, as he sinks to rest, is buried in clouds of dust vapors, and New Orleans chokes and coughs and gasps, and execrates the Public Works Commissioner. Houses are barred tightly, dungeon-like, to keep out the insidious dust. The teeth grit upon mouthfuls of it. The universal prayer and cry is rain, rain!</p>
                  <p>Down in Frenchtown, pilgrimages and nouvenas are made to St. Avegne, and candles burned at the altar of the gracious saint. The children kill spiders and drown many a hapless snail in order to induce rain, and even tie the old red rag around the cistern faucet and dance the rain-song, but in vain.</p>
                  <p>In school, the 9.30 bell has rung, and three or four boys struggle in, warm from running to school, tired and listless-looking. But how can one reprimand them for tardiness, when the invariable answer will be:</p>
                  <p>"Well, teacher, wha' fo' I come to school late? Wha' I go do? Ma mere, she wash and de cistern empty. Den I got tote water, eh? I run fast, but no use. You call me up."</p>

                  <p>A short time ago it came to the knowledge of the Woman's Era Club that the institute at Claremont, Va., Rev. John J. Smallwood, president, needed assistance. With the view of giving what aid it could, the Club instituted inquiries as to the condition of this school. At its last regular meeting, the Club decided that, unless some very damaging disclosures recently made, as to the moral conduct of the school, are explained away, they can neither aid nor endorse that, nor any other educational work projected and carried on by John J. Smallwood.</p>

                     <p>The A.A.W. (Association for the Advancement, of Women) holds its twenty-second congress October 31st, November 1st and 2nd, at Knoxville, Tenn.</p>
                     <p>The deliberations of this body are always of great importance to women. With Julia Ward Howe as its president, and the representative women of America composing its body, it has grown to be one of the greatest factors of the day in the development. and progress of woman.</p>
                     <p>The association stands now in an enviable position; it sees its labors crowned with much success, and very little standing in the way of future efforts; it sees--as we all see--the almost boundless possibilities of the American white woman; it sees the especial consideration which she enjoys in this country, anything being possible to her except the act of voting, and her growing influence now almost unlimited.</p>
                     <p>Realizing, as it must, all this, we want to say a word to the A.A.W. on the responsibility of the white women for the wrongs and outrages done the black race in this country. Most of these have been and are of a nature that little more than a word from a white woman would have effectually stopped numberless acts of annoyance, injustice, and even outrage. Think of the refined, sensitive colored girls who have been literally thrown out of first-class cars in the south without it protest, when a protest would have been so effectual; think of the ambitious, noble-minded women of the south who are shut out from every elevating influence in the shape of lectures, libraries, etc.; think of the lynchings incited by white women, and <hi rend="italic">not one</hi> ever prevented by them.</p>
                     <p>Policy and expediency are supposed to be unknown to bodies of women in their deliberations, and from this man has raised one of his chief arguments against woman suffrage. In spite of this, it has been one of woman's strong points that she has put right before expediency, and we would suggest to the A. A. W. that they cast aside policy and expediency, and boldly face this race question. It is it question which they can not longer evade. We thoroughly believe that it is the women of America--black and white--who are to solve this race problem, and we do not ignore the duty of the black women in the matter. They must arouse, educate and advance themselves; they are to exert that influence through the homes, the schools and the churches that will build up an intelligent, industrious and moral people. Their duty is plain and must be done. But the white woman has a duty in the matter also; she must see to it that no obstructions are placed in the way of a weak, struggling people; She must no longer consent to be passive. We call upon her to take her stand.</p>

                     <p>The National Council of Women, which convenes in Washington, D.C., in February, has invited the Colored Women's League of Washington to be represented at the Convention. The Washington League, with broad-minded courtesy, has made its committee so large as to be able to include delegates front other colored women's leagues, and has invited such leagues to send delegates.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately, a majority of the members of the Woman's Era Club of Boston did not see the advantages of being so represented, and voted not to send a delegate. In spite of this fact, which we regret very much, we hope to see the colored women of all sections represented at the coming council. In any event, Washington is prepared to ably represent the race.</p>

                     <p>With our new departure, we again bring forward our suggestion of a convention. We hope our readers will open the matter again with renewed interest, and that the summer of '95 will see a great congress of the colored women of America.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Leagues are opening the season with new enthusiasm and energy. They are inaugurating their work along their own especial lines, and the year is full of promise. It is hoped that the clubs will not fail of a coming together at the close or the season, with all that means of helpfulness, inspiration and broadening. Let us all work together to bring it about.</p>
                     <p>We as a race, have been so cramped that we women have unavoidably grown narrow and selfish to an extent. It is for this reason we pray for a convention, with its widening effect on the  mental, moral and physical vision.</p>

                     <docDate>November 1894</docDate>
                     <p>The centennial celebration of St. Thomas P. E. church, in Philadelphia, in October, was an event of great importance. After one hundred years, the church is still in a most flourishing condition. A celebration of this kind stamps us completely American. Think of this, and the talk of naturalized foreigners of sending us back to Africa "where we belong!"</p>
                     <p>As the editor of this paper has been unable to attend the Congress of the A. A. W., now in session al Knoxville, Tenn., as was her intention, she has sent, as a substitute, a large number of ERAs to be distributed among the delegates.</p>
                     <p>The Association of Educators of Colored Youth will hold their next congress in London, Eng., and will arrange tours on the continent, of Europe.</p>
                     <p>This is an excellent idea, and we have no doubt that it will be a brilliant success.</p>
                     <p>Aside from the value of having so fine a body of colored People conduct their deliberations among the friendly English, there will be many colored people to take advantage of this opportunity of a European tour with congenial company. It is a splendid thing in every way.</p>
                     <p>In introducing our associates to our readers, we need hardly to say a word. They speak for themselves. We are proud to present to our people such an array of fine women and writers. With such a force, the possibilities of the ERA are unlimited in the way of intellectual tone and strength, and only limited to the extent that people are willing to support the paper. There is yet to be found the person who will not acknowledge that the ERA is a necessity, and a necessity well met; there is yet to be found the person who, knowing of it, is not anxious to read it, even if she does not buy it, The ERA should he twice its present size--everything warrants it--except its financial returns. A thousand new subscribers--two hundred front each of the cities directly represented in the paper would warrant a larger paper. Only this number in a country where a million women read the paper! We believe our women are loyal; when individually appealed to, they have given us enthusiastic support; but they need to be aroused. No other paper in America does for our women just what the ERA does; no other paper is so entirely their medium. Let them realize this and do their duty like, no, not like men, but like women. Do not be content to subscribe yourself, but urge your friends to subscribe.</p>
                     <p>Miss Baldwin, whose offer of a home for a girl while studying, was made through these columns last month, has received and is still receiving numbers of letters from worthy girls. It is Miss Baldwin's desire to secure a girl of more than ordinary promise, one who would be especially responsive to the especial advantages to be obtained here in New England; for such a girl as this, Miss Baldwin would so use her influence that nothing need stand in the way of her protegee's intellectual advancement, not even the doors of Radcliffe College. While choosing, Miss Baldwin receives many eloquent letters. It has occurred to us, while reading letters from girls well-endorsed as to character, capability and industriousness, that there might be many families in the north who would be glad to receive in their midst such girls, and who, in exchange for the companionship and services such a girl could give, would give her a good home while going to school. It is quite as well to state in this connection that the offer made by Miss Baldwin is entirely one-sided; all she asks or desires in return is the intellectual progress of her protegee.</p>

                     <p>"Do you? You poor thing! Where do you go?"</p>
                     <p>"Everywhere, anywhere," the most tired-looking "poor thing," wearily drawled on a car making for 14th st. I am sure I wish we didn't have to wear hats."</p>
                     <p>"Why don't you let Leon buy and make them?"</p>
                     <p>"Leon--make--my hats!" she gasped.</p>
                     <p>"Mine are specimens," she gurgled.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, how lovely! A dream thought! Oh, you sweet! I am younger immediately."</p>
                     <p>The car stopped and the "poor thing" and the "sweet" disappeared. Match1ess woman! who'd ever have thought of calling a hat a "dream thought?" Splendid woman! As they passed from my gaze I could see billowy lace lightly resting on raven tresses, held in place by a gleaming comblet. Ah, my masters, strange things go to make up dreams.</p>
                     <p>A bright ray of light has fallen aslant the great Downing patronymic, and all society is busily engaged in <hi rend="italic">recherche</hi> anticipations of the event. The bride that is to be is one of the sweetest little maidens in all the "city of churches," and "gallant Frank," as the hoys call him at times, is a prime favorite. When the 17th arrives, brilliants will flash and sparkle and soft silks will lend elegance to a scene that happy hearts and beautiful faces will make one to be long remembered. 'Tis a real love match.</p>
                     <p>Judging by thoughts culled from many sources, the school question is still reckoned among explosives.</p>
                     <p>Speaking of the school question, according to the Brooklyn member of the board, our young girls will have to be cooks and scullions in the future, unless colored schools are nurtured.</p>
                     <p>It is understood on good authority that the schools known as Mrs. Garnet's and Mr. Reason's are to be consolidated on one count. It is a pity, for Mrs. Garnet tried so hard to get Miss Eato made principal as successor to the late Charles L. Reason.</p>
                     <p>There is not a teacher in Our midst more deserving of such promotion than Miss Eato, from many points of view. She is one whom New Yorkers --Knickerbockers-- are truly proud of; she is

the essence of cultured constancy and a most unswerving adherent to duty. Her presence, while strong and reliant, is one of the most restful known to me.</p>
                     <p>Counsellor Stewart wore rather a concerned expression when Mr. Braxton finally concluded the transactions that made him counsellor for St. Philips corporation. It's a good move. Mr. Stewart has demonstrated many times that he possesses the ability that St. Philips needs, and the vestrymen have proved their race royalty by securing his services. Such procedure will inevitably vanquish the so-called race problem.</p>

                     <p>St. Philips Guild is by far the most dignified body of men in the public gaze just now. Its ever genial master, J. J. Atwell, has been sent as a delegate to the Episcopal convention sitting in Philadelphia, having the courtly vice-Guild Master, F. H. Carmand, to preside and deliver the address on the 18th.</p>
                     <p>The Centennial celebration at St. Thomas P. E. church in Philadelphia bids fair to assume most interesting proportions. All Gotham is waiting to hear all about St. Philips' choir; the boys are working hard and Mr. Kenney looks a little "oldish," but of course they'll do finely. A special car will take them over. Among those who will accompany them will be Messrs. Mars, Braxton, Smith, Barrows, Ray, Anthony, Attwell, Burleigh, Gray, Mrs. Annie Dias, Mesdames Francis Attwell, Hymen Dorsey, Miss Imogen Howard, Mrs. F. H. Carmand and son Frankie. Victoria Earle also journeyed to the Quaker City.</p>
                     <p>The venerable-looking Frederick Barbadoes passed through Gotham a few days ago, looking as frisky as ever, on his way in search of matter for a book. This column will endeavor to secure a first volume.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Loyal Union seem to be up and doing; they are not only flooding New York and Brooklyn with petitions for the enactment of the Blair Joint Resolution, but will manage for the benefit of their treasury a large reception on the 13th of November, at Lyric Hall, at which ex-minister John Durham and Mrs. Fanny Jackson Coppin will make -addresses. They deserve the patronage of the people.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Loyal Union have succeeded in stirring up the preachers of this city and were the inspiration that led to the organization of a preachers' meeting. They will manage a grand union meeting for the purpose of endorsing the Woman's Loyal Union's efforts in arousing the people to the necessity of acting at once on the Blair Joint Resolution.</p>
                     <p>The pastor of Bethel Church is one of the brainiest men in town. In a quiet way he is talking and some of the biggest men in his church are quaking. Truly the breath of reform is abroad.</p>

Among the attractive ladies here because of the convention, were Mrs. Van Dusen (who accompanied her husband) and Miss Dickson of Erie, Pa. These ladies were taken in charge by Mrs. E. E. Brown and Mrs. J. H. Lewis, who devoted themselves to showing the people and sights of Boston to the visitors.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">Women in Politics.</head>
                  <p>American women are beginning to see the end of their years of struggle for equality of suffrage. The arguments are nearly all in and the signs of a favorable verdict are every where apparent to those who understand the trend of things.</p>
                  <p>Fragmentary suffrage, now possessed by women in nearly all the states of the union, carries with it the triumph of the principal contended for, and its extension to complete and national suffrage is as logically certain as any thing can be. Just how soon the complete enfranchisement of women will be realized depends largely upon the use we make of our present gains. The false reasoning of the opposition having been overcome, we have now to fight only the prejudices in opposition. When the opposing man sees women actually voting, and looks in vain for the evils predicted, his prejudices will yield and he will gladly join the forces that are fast making for their complete emancipation.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in the whole social progress of humanity is more interesting and more suggestive of the persistency of rightness than the steady gain of womankind in those larger relationships of human life and civilization, in which the stronger, as well as the gentler virtues, are tending to increase her importance.</p>
                  <p>Are women ready to assume the of this new recognition of their worth? This question is of immense importance to colored women. For the first time in our history we are to receive public attention and have our womanly worth tested by the high standards of important public duties.</p>
                  <p>Must we begin our political duties with no better or higher conceptions of our citizenship than that shown by our men when they were first enfranchised? Are we to bring any refinement of individuality to the ballot box? Shall we learn our politics from spoilsmen and bigoted partisans, or shall we learn it from the school of patriotism and an enlightened self-interest? If our enfranchisement means only a few more votes added to the republican and democratic sides, respectively, of political issues, there certainly has been no gain for the cause of principle in American politics. If our enfranchisement is to contribute nothing to the corrective forces of independence in American
<pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
politics, there will be much disappointment among those who believed that the cause of temperance, municipal reform and better education would be more surely advanced when the finer virtues of women became a part of the political forces of the country.</p>
                  <p>Our women in Chicago are now, for the first time, getting a taste of politics. By virtue of a recent act of wholesome generosity of our legislators, women are permitted to vote for trustees of the state university. Two women have been duly nominated on the republican and democratic tickets respectively for this office. Fortunately, the nominees are equally meritorious candidates. Although the offices to be filled are purely nonpartisan, our newly fledged suffragists are ranging themselves eagerly in the democratic and republican camps and are campaigning for their respective sides on purely party grounds. So far the campaign speeches and methods have not been elevated in the least degree above the dead level of partisanship. Our own women, too, have gone into the fight with a party zeal that would be satisfactory to the most exacting "boss." Without wishing to discredit the good motives of our women, or to criticise captiously their conduct in the campaign, I believe this new opportunity for self-help and advancement ought, not to be lost sight of in our thirst for public favors, or in our eagerness to help any grand old "party." We ought not to put ourselves in the humiliating position of being loved only for the votes we have. The sincerity of white women, who have heretofore so scorned our ambitions and held themselves aloof from us in all our struggles for advancement, should be, to a degree, questioned. It would be much more to our credit if we would seek, by all possible uses of our franchise, to force these ambitious women candidates and women party managers to relent their cruel opposition to our girls and women in the matter of employment and the enjoyment of civil privileges. We should never forget that the exclusion of colored women and girls from nearly all places of respectable employment is due mostly to the meanness of American women, and in every way that we can check this unkindness by the force of our franchise should be religiously done. If, however, we burden our hearts and minds solely with the anxiety for the success of a party ticket for party reasons, we shall be guilty of the same folly and neglect of self-interest that have made colored men for the past twenty years vote persistently more for the special interests of white men than for the peculiar interests of the colored race.</p>
                  <p>There is no good reason why our women should not be made to feel sufficiently independent not only to make their peculiar interests a motive in the exercise of the franchise, but also to array themselves, when possible, on the side of the best, whether that best be inside or outside of party lines. Much more ought to be expected of colored women in 1894 in the exercise of their suffrage than was expected of the colored men who first voted under the 15th Amendment.</p>
                  <p>It is now a good time in woman's clubs and organizations of all kinds for women to prepare themselves, by the best lessons of citizenship, to exert a wholesome influence in the politics of the future. The importance of the suffrage, as a means to complete emancipation from the impositions of prejudice should be eagerly taught, and brought home to the conscience of our women everywhere. It is more than probable that issues of immeasurable importance to the weal of our country, and requiring for their adjustment a larger amount of intelligent patriotism than has yet been exacted from the American conscience, will make demands on us by the time universal suffrage becomes one of the organic laws of the land.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">What Equal Suffrage has done for Colorado.</head>
                  <p>Among the many objections met with during our suffrage campaign, were that the best women would not vote, only the bad would exercise the right, and that women would not purify politics.</p>
                  <p>None of these arguments have proven true. The best women have been the ones most interested. They have formed themselves into different clubs and are the indefatigable workers in the political party with which they affiliate.</p>
                  <p>During the special canvas for registration it was found that only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> out of twenty immoral women was willing to register. Since then they have been waited upon by our most corrupt politicians and urged to register and vote in order to defeat the <sic corr="better">bettter</sic> class of voters. This call have no effect. The good women are in the majority.</p>
                  <p>Before the opening, of the present political campaign the Equal Suffrage Association formed a Campaign for Good Government Committee with
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
auxiliaries throughout the state. This committee is composed of six women from each of the four political parties. They were divided into three committees; one, a press committee of sixteen to furnish articles relating to their work for every paper in the state; the other two consist of four members each, one for primaries, the other for conventions. The duty of the former was to urge all women to attend the primaries; that of the latter, to see that important resolutions were introduced into the conventions of all the parties.</p>
                  <p>The first work of this committee was to draw up resolutions demanding that the age of consent be raised front sixteen to eighteen years, favoring the Initiative and Referendum, so successful in Switzerland, and that, resolving themselves into a committee of the whole, they use every effort to arouse public sentiment to the great need of civil service reform.</p>
                  <p>These resolutions were passed by the E. S. A., and endorsed by all labor organizations, as well as by the women's clubs.</p>
                  <p>The first successful result attained in the interest of good government will benefit a large number of people.</p>
                  <p>Our city charter is a most intricate one. Some of the officials are appointed by the governor, some by the mayor, while others are elected by popular vote. Thus state, and therefore party politics, are brought into our city government.</p>
                  <p>The present board of public works is composed of men of one party, while the boards of aldermen and supervisors are of two other parties.</p>
                  <p>According to the charter the board of public works has the authority to employ labor for public improvements.</p>
                  <p>During the great financial depression, when so many men were out of employment, it was suggested to the board of public works that it much needed sewer be built, thus giving work to hundreds of men having families dependent upon them--especially since three hundred thousand dollars of the city improvement appropriation remained in the bank.</p>
                  <p>Those men began work late in August, but did not receive a cent, of money due them until the 16th of October, owing to the fact that the supervisors and aldermen refused to allow the warrants tendered the men to be cashed. They declared that the city charter did not sustain the board of public works in the carrying on of public improvements. This, too, in direct defiance of the decision rendered by the courts.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the campaign for good government committee received an intimation of the existing state of affairs, a committee was appointed to wait upon the board of public works and ascertain the exact truth of the matter. From what the ladies learned, they believed the action to be dictated by a wholly partisan spirit, and therefore to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>A mass indignation meeting was called. Our largest hall was packed. The women pleaded eloquently for the wronged, and a resolution was adopted providing for the payment of the Delgany Street sewer employees. After that the supervisors readily adopted the resolution. Only the concurrent vote of the aldermen was now needed to enable the treasurer to cash the warrants. A special meeting was called for that purpose at which the resolution was unanimously adopted. When the women crowded around the city clerk to get his approval many of the men to whom the money was due awaited in the lobby. It was a touching sight to witness their joy as they surrounded the women on their way out. They felt that it was all owing to the influence of these good women that their pay was not longer withheld from them.</p>
                  <p>The women are among the most effective of the campaign speakers. All the political parties have acknowledged their worth and ability by nominating them on the several tickets as representatives to the legislature, superintendent of public instruction, and even as lieutenant governor. An ardent suffragist, whose work during the campaign brought her much in contact with the city officials, says that, in contrasting the deference paid to women now with the indifference then shown, she is constrained to exclaim: "Look here upon this picture, and on this."</p>

                     <docDate>November 1894</docDate>
                     <p>Three stages of intellectual development swept along with the reformation and were coincident with its progress.</p>
                     <p>Humanism, grounded upon the study of the classics, came first as a natural result of the revival of learning; realism, or the education of the mind through the eye and hand, succeeded; while naturalism, or an attempt to develop first the body, then the character; lastly, the mind grew out of realism, and modern education is tacitly understood to be all unconscious compromise of these three aims.</p>
                     <p>Humanism had gained something of a foothold in German universities by the middle of the fifteenth century, but the professors, although they waged continual war with the more ignorant and intolerant of the clergy, failed to see the greatness of the mother tongue as an instrument of culture; like the schoolmen they wrote solely in Latin, making no effort to fix the German language by unifying its dialects, and giving little or no attention to popular literature.</p>
                     <p>The literature of an age expressed quite accurately the high-water mark of its education, and a glance at the history of this art in Germany, during the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries inclusive, is sufficient to reveal a great literary depression, the causes of which were numerous. It was it period of transitions in language, of religious disturbance, of discontent, among the masses, yet in a low stage of development.</p>
                     <p>There was, however, a bright side to this dark picture,--a mental activity which was preparing the way for a higher development, not only of the entire German nation, but of all the nations influenced by its civilization; and while Luther was kindling the fires of the reformation by the publication of theses, sermons and tracts, the scholarly Erasmus and Von Hutten were writing, polished satires exposing the abuses of the Church, the vices of the clergy and the greed of monastic orders.</p>
                     <p>Albert Durer, the greatest German painter of his time, was publishing treatises on art which have stood the test of the centuries; Paracelsus, in the German language, was lecturing on chemistry and medicine; later, Gerhardt and Fleming were writing poems which placed them in the front rank among lyrists.</p>
                     <p>Dramatic art, encouraged both by Luther and the Jesuists, made considerable progress during the period of the reformation, although the plays were still coarse and offensive at a time when English audiences were appreciating the beauties of Shakespeare's masterpieces.</p>
                     <p>Maximillian I. interested himself in popular literature to a certain extent, but his tastes inclined him more especially toward the court romances of early medieval days. In the teaching profession the humanists were still overshadowed by the schoolmen, the leading educators of the period, and they (the schoolmen) devoted themselves and their pupils to the most unprofitable questions of metaphysics and theology.</p>
                     <p>The seven years' course of study, which represented the high aims of the best part of the middle ages, was a noble plan of education, but the church considered no form of knowledge as worthy of recognition which did not directly contribute to its aggrandizement, hence the course had been limited and formalized until only the husk remained. Methods of teaching had been corrupted, memory was substituted for thought. The renaissance, however, which appeared in Europe as the forerunner and a leading cause of the reformation, wrought a change in both subject and method. Pupils were now brought face to face
<pb n="16 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
with Virgil and Horace, Plato and Cicero, and with classic models from all departments of art; but this great intellectual revival was not fully developed in Germany, when that religious movement invaded northern Europe which separated the culture of the reformation from that of the church; and we who are accustomed to look upon Protestantism as the key to independence and originality of thought, as an expression itself of the highest intelligence, can hardly realize the primary results of the separation, the loss in philosophic and artistic culture which the iconoclastic and insurrectionary spirit, attending the reformation in the early years of its development, occasioned in those countries most deeply affected by its onward march.</p>
                     <p>Those who broke with the church had to create a philosophy, educational forms, and a culture of their own. As the mind, no longer in thraldom, for the church had assumed absolute control of the intellect, began to assert itself, the loss was more than sustained,--by the principles of Bacon, Des Cartes and Kant, by the discoveries of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, and by the hosts of brilliant thinkers who, in spite of the warfare so long and so bitterly waged between science and religion, did originate and establish a new philosophy, a new education, a new culture.</p>
                     <p>The instruction which Luther received in the Latin school at Mansfield, in the Francisan school at Madgeburg, the High School of Erfurt and lastly, in the Augustinian convent of Erfurt, was identical with the training of the age; Aristotelian philosophy, classics and theology forming the bulk of the course, and these subjects taught in a narrow and spiritless manner; but with this knowledge as a foundation Luther became the commanding spirit, no less in literature and education than in religion.</p>
                     <p>The composition or poetry and music was a recreation in which he indulged during moments of leisure, yet who questions whether the soul of a poet ran through the thrilling lines of--</p>

                     <p>Luther, generally speaking, cared little for the form of his composition as compared with the effect it produced, although his greatest literary achievement, the translation of the Bible into German, was attended by such simplicity of style and perfect comprehension of the numerous German dialects, that for the first time in the history of the Germanic people they possessed a common speech and to this Augustinian monk Germany owes the most essential of all the conditions of a truly national life and literature--a common vehicle of thought, intelligent and commanding.</p>
                     <p>Education, previous to the reformation as conducted by Luther, was entirely under the control of the church; the church trained its children to fill the ranks of Catholicism, and Lather soon recognized that the success of his religious reforms depended largely upon the organization of schools for the people, in which the principles underlying his position might be taught, and thus popularized; and the study of the mother tongue through the German Bible, which, published in complete form in 1541, represented the work of the best years of his life, accompanied by the singing of those stirring hymns, contributed by Gerhardt, Luther, Fleming and others, was in itself a new education, and created a mutual interest in instruction and religion, in knowledge and faith.</p>
                     <p>The reformer especially emphasized the value of the primary school, and so influenced the genius of modern education, by the methods which he advocated in that direction, that for three hundred years Protestant nations have moulded universal opinion in matters of primary instruction. He severely criticized the schools of the period, which were mainly designed for the favored few; complains of the brutality of the teachers, who, he says, "Behaved toward their pupils as if they were thieves." According to Luther's testimony, he, himself, was beaten fifteen times in one afternoon.</p>
                     <p>Aiming at a practical solution of the difficulties surrounding the cause of popular education, in 1524, he addressed a forcible manifesto to the municipal authorities of all the German towns, appealing to the highest considerations of virtue and religion in behalf of public instruction. He would have the state support its schools on the same principle that it supports a standing army; he would make education compulsory, since military service is such, and for the former, the reasons are higher and stronger.</p>
                     <p>The divorcement of education from the control of the church, and the public work, he found an able assistant in Melanchthon, who was a brilliant humanist, an influential teacher, and a successful writer of school books. Melanchthon's appointment in 1518 as professor of Greek in the University of Wittenberg marks an epoch of German university education. Scholastic methods of teaching were summarily dropped, Wittenberg became the national school, and from this time, the revival of letters, as influenced by the reformation, began to assert itself on German soil.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">Another Splendid Premium Offer!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first premium offered last March having been won the publishers of the ERA take pleasure in announcing another which, if possible, surpasses the first.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">READ!<lb/>
FIRST PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>For the boy or girl, man or woman who in the next 3 months brings in the largest number of paid up subscribers (over one hundred in number) we will give a course in Mr. Eastman's School of Carving and Modelling.</p>
                  <p>N.B.--This course taken at its full value is worth two hundred dollars; it extends over a term of nine months, and at the end of that time pupils are prepared to become teachers of the art. No more valuable premium could be offered; in return for a little energy a splendid trade is given and a position to teach almost assured, or if teaching is not preferred, and the premium winner prefers actual work, good and paying positions are assured.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">SECOND PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>To the one bringing in the next largest number of subscribers, half a term at the above school will be given.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">THIRD PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>To the one bringing in the third largest number of subscribers a New World Type-writer will be given.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">FOURTH PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>To the four boys or girls (beginners in music) bringing in each ten subscribers in the next three months, a year's course in the Boston Training School of Music will be given.</p>
                  <p>Do not pass this over lightly. The WOMAN'S ERA makes a specialty of preparing openings for young colored people; it realizes the difficulties they encounter in obtaining such openings and is prepared to do well by ambitious, earnest and determined young people. Don't complain of lack of chances if you let such as these pass you by.</p>
                  <p>All contestants not receiving premiums will be allowed twenty-five per cent on all paid yearly subscriptions received.</p>
                  <p>The time allowed is short, but people who are in earnest act at once.</p>

                  <p>An apology is due Miss Smith, and our readers that regular installment of "College Settlements" did not appear in the last issue. The matter, although set up and corrected, was left out for some of the peculiar reasons printers always have ready.</p>
                  <p>What do you think of the ERA; is it not worth a dollar a year to you? Read what Mrs. Maples of Tennessee says about it. Oh, for ten thousand women like her! There are several million of us who really cannot afford to be without the paper, but if ten thousand would send its in it dollar apiece in the next twelve months we would he willing to send the paper gratis to a few of the many who are anxious to read it, but <hi rend="italic">hesitate to subscribe for fear somebody will grow rich in consequence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are pained to learn that there is a possibility of a discontinuance of Anno Domini's social notes after the opening of the new year. Anno Domini is a shy young thing who under the attention he has attracted to himself, begins to quail. If subscribers are of our mind, they will refuse to accept a resignation. Let us hear from you, friends. Shall Anno Domini be allowed to withdraw ? Address letters to this office.</p>
                  <p>"From the Virginia Plantation to the National Capitol," the autobiography of Hon. John M. Langston, superbly illustrated as it is, will make a significant and acceptable holiday gift. Read the announcement in these columns.</p>
                  <p>So much of our paper is now given up to news from different sections, that much of local interest is crowded out. It is for want of space that we give so short a notice of the placing of a memorial tablet to Wendell Phillips on the building on Essex street, erected on the site of the house for forty years occupied by him.</p>
                  <p>At the opening exercises of the Suffrage Fair, Monday evening, Dec. 3, (a full account of which is crowded out of this issue) after Miss Frances Willard's eloquent plea for the recognition of the rights of all human beings, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, who presided, took occasion to call attention to the gross violation of the principles of rights, which are supposed to govern all women's clubs, as exemplified in the action of the Chicago Women's Club in rejecting, a name offered for membership solely on account of color. Miss Willard replied that she was a member of the Chicago Women's Club, but as yet knew nothing about the matter complained of, but if, upon investigation, she finds that her club has, as reported, "rejected an able, refined, highly cultured woman solely on account of her color," then she, Miss Willard, will place her light face beside that darker one and walk out of the club with her. And the typical Boston audience applauded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> compliments Mrs. Mary Church Terrell and the ERA by publishing that lady's tribute to Miss Patterson in the November issue.</p>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Christian Educator</hi> publishes letters from different colleges on the mental ability and moral standing of colored students attending the same. The only really hearty letter comes from Wellesley College, in which the only two colored grad-
<pb n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
uates are spoken of as young women of more than average ability and high moral character. By these two Miss Ella Smith and Dr. Rice are meant. Where does Miss Lowther come in? Statistics of this kind are of no earthly value. In this day and time no one is absolutely sure as to who is white. Color is a matter of chance, and what of the accuracy of statistics which put one child with one race and the other child of the same parents with another race!</p>
                  <p>Among the new inventions that are destined to help make housekeeping easier and safer, is that of Fiber Carpet, made from a vegetable substance. It easily takes the most beautiful coloring, and while it resembles straw matting in looks, it has a compactness and it resistant quality, that, added to it freedom from odor, makes it far superior to that old-time favorite; tough, cleanly and pleasing to the eye, it fills a long-felt want for a sanitary carpet. Read the advertisement, and when you go down to see the tablet set into the building erected on the site of the old home of Wendell Phillips, go inside and see these beautiful floor coverings.</p>

                  <p>BOSTON.</p>
                  <p>Boston is anticipating a small whirl of pleasure at Christmas time. Miss Marion Shadd of Washington will spend the holidays with Mr. and Mrs. B. R. Wilson of Rutland Square. Miss Ella Smith will be accompanied on a visit to her home at Newport by Messrs. George W. Cook and Wyatt Archer and possibly Miss Bessie Cook. After the Mary Street reunion, the whole party will probably take it trip to Boston.</p>
                  <p>Miss Bessie Mitchell and Anna Wilson came up from New Bedford the latter part of October and made a flutter in the younger set. A Saturday night party at Mrs. J. H. Lewis', several theater parties and a host of callers combined towards giving the young ladies a "large" time.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. U.A. Ridley will be at home informally Sunday afternoons in December at 131 Kent St., Brookline.</p>
                  <p>Miss Emma Ruffin, of Grove street, is recovering from her last and most serious attack of illness. She is now able to go out and will accompany her sister, Mrs. Paige, when the latter returns to Virginia.</p>
                  <p>Although Mrs. Paige's call to Boston was a sudden and serious one, since the improvement in her sister's health she has been enabled to visit many of her old friends. Mrs. Paige is accompanied by her eldest son, Clifton.</p>
                  <p>Miss Maud Cuney is travelling in Mexico. When last heard from she was at the Hotel Iturbide, Monterey, and enthusiastic over the beauties of the place, climate, etc. The party, which consists of Mrs. Cuney, Miss Cuney, Mr. Stephen Cuney and Mr. Ellis, are travelling especially for the health of Mrs. Cuney. They intend visiting most of the cities of Mexico, and as Mrs. Cuney's health is steadily improving, they are thoroughly enjoying every moment of the time.</p>
                  <p>Theo, the youngest daughter of Dr. Grant, is most happily placed at boarding school. She is now an inmate of Mr. Allen's famous school at Newton. There is no training quite equal to that of a first class borading-school and the child who has the advantage of if is indeed fortunate. While Mr. Allen has always maintained the highest standard in his school and has been patronized by the first people of this and other countries, he has never made any sacrifices of principles to do this. From the first he has accepted colored pupils, has brought them into the home department, where they have associated on the closest terms with children of wealth and highest standing. The result has been that his school has prospered, and proved that it is best to do the right thing and the rest will take care of itself.</p>

                  <p>Everybody, that was approached directly concerning the November issue of the ERA, was enthusiastic in its praise. "A splendid number!" was echoed and re-echoed. A gentleman of large experience and fairly cultivated mind said, "Really, it is the finest thing in the way of a paper or journal the race has ever put forth, and should meet with instant Success. For my part, I am ready to say that if the women can do such things as that, the men ought to sell out, transfer their books, etc., over to the women, and a great change would come over us. Why the excellence of this edition will have its effect; it will stir the men to either shut up shop, or do better generally than they have done for the past twenty y<gap agent="tape repair" extent="4"/>"
<gap agent="tape repair" extent="6"/> say, "When the new year comes in I

will subscribe." These things are very encouraging, but "A fair exchange is no robbery." If the masses want a good, clean, wholesome sheet, one that can be fittingly laid where it shall be available to every member of the family, from the youngest to the oldest, can be with pride placed on the circulating files in our libraries, can be offered, as exchanges, with the most favored journals, let them reflect over a few homely facts, that the burden of this venture makes justifiable and necessary.</p>
                  <p>The women who edit this paper, without a single exception, do their work gratuitously. Because the people admire, but do not subscribe promptly--and in a cold, matter-of-fact, business manner, business principles should govern the subscribing for a paper, just the same as anything else worthy of support--the mental life of our people is not placed in a favorable light by a single strong annalist of today, and the only reason for a certain backwardness is the lack of that kind of support which would naturally lead to the fuller and more perfect development of our literary productions. Owing to the reputation that woman has for talking plain, particularly when there's none to talk hack, I confess I am taking the advantage, but a consciousness steals over me, imparting the thought that the ends sought after will constitute my apology.</p>
                  <p>Beginning with the January issue, this column will be assisted by a splendid array of talent, among which may be mentioned with pride our sweet-voiced poetess, H. Cordelia Ray, whose gentle, retiring nature has kept her like a sweet little rivulet, ministering to those nearest, and dreading, with ever increasing strength, the gaze of this hurly-burly world of ours; whose one rule of living and judging is, I sometimes think, the one given in our school books for addition and subtraction.</p>
                  <p>Another gentle woman, whose life is a synonym for the pure and wholesome; in literature, her writings teem with a love for the beautiful, a reverence for the good, and sympathetic encouragement for the struggles of all developing minds, a writer who instinctively lives the theory that while environment has much to do with mind cultivation, yet the individual holds the supreme power. It is the will to do, the will to be, that rules in the realm of mind culture. To know her teaches that there is such a thing as smiling, when a smile will uplift or cheer a fainting companion, even though a sepulchre is hidden deep down within the heart, sacred to the memory of joys of long ago, accounted sorrows now. I speak of her whose writings have long been a pleasure to a large circle here, known to the world as "Petite Reine."</p>
                  <p>The versatile "Reintals," the grave and experienced "Watchman," and, as time goes on, others will contribute. I speak advisedly, for even now there is it movement on foot to establish a club, or circle of anonymous writers, which shall consist of a few choice spirits who will have as their object the success of real merit, unaided by accidental popularity, etc.--a good move. We can afford to rejoice over such a departure, because too much "noblesse oblige" is likely to sap originality and deferential independence of thought as well as speech.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Loyal Union was greatly encouraged by the news contained in last issue, as to the attitude of New England on the Blair Joint Resolution. If every section would take hold as the good New Englanders are doing, a petition would go to congress that would amaze not only ourselves, but the whole country. In the next issue of the ERA we will give a history of the movement from the beginning. Some people are inclined to see nothing practical in this petition the same people saw nothing practical in the petition for an investigation into the slums of large cities, nor the one calling for light as to tenement house construction, and the one which resulted in the exposure of the thousands of petty gambling dives. The results of these investigations have silenced all pessimists concerning them, and we predict the same conclusion when the Blair Joint Resolution shall be enacted and the committee regularly appointed, as was the illustrious Klu Klux Klan committee, before whom all facts concerning mob law shall be laid, and thereby given to the country at large. Then we will all see, as Mr. Blair has said, "The people having the unbiased facts, public opinion will see a remedy and enforce it." We rejoice to know that New England will send an independent petition to Congress. We wish other sections would do likwise, until every part of this great country shall have been heard from. The W. L. U. have in hand now returns from 14 states, and three hundred and fifty names from the Dominion of Canada.</p>

                  <docDate>December 1894</docDate>
                  <p>NEW YORK.</p>
                  <p>It is now quite decided that Mr. Charles Lansing will lead Miss Kate White to the altar on Christmas day. All society is looking forward to the event with a pleasant flutter of anticipation. It is expected that the affair will be a most elaborate one from every point of view. As the leading lady of Brooklyn, much is expected of her, so far as the wedding gown is concerned. I have it on good authority that it will be simply perfect. As usual, the church will be exquisitely festooned in honor of the Christmas celebration; that of itself will make it an ideal time for a marriage ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Lansing owns a number of dwellings, but will take his bride to his homestead, to dwell with his father and mother, and it is said that the preparations going on there for the future mistress are elegant, bordering upon luxury.</p>
                  <p>Leadership falls now to the winsome--but, oh, so whim-ful--Miss Katie Smith; or that delightful elf, Miss Mena Downing.  Strange how these things go. A little while back, and everything pointed to Miss Evangeline Walker, so far as leadership is concerned, but she is now tremendously interested in experimenting in the housewifely arts. Ah, well, such is life.</p>
                  <p>Front all outward appearances, this season bids fair to be a most brilliant one, and it would be a delight to contemplate these things but for the decadence of old time manners and customs. Years ago, maidens were not considered stupid or dull who were shy and what some people call prim. They possessed a sweet prudishness that made one really feel that they were made up of tender blossoms and sparkling dewdrops. Oh, they were so bewitchingly dainty, so delightfully "skeery." I remember offering my arm to a delicate little creature once, during a lull in the music, and with the utmost nonchalance piloting her to an obscure corner. Never will I forget the indignant question that sprang into her eyes, as she divined--or thought she did--my meaning. But I came out ahead, as we always do. "Oh," I said, "I fancied I observed a door here leading to--supper!" See the point? The dear girls of today would prefer the quiet tete-a-tete to even the dance. Watch the floor and you'll find more married people dancing than any one else. And now that I come to think of it, that is the secret of the girls knowing how stupid the chappies are. They expect too much of them, because a fellow does not dare talk to more than one in a set--for the other girls will hear every word. It's hard, but the boys all have to play dude, and lisp: "Ah! I weally cawn't say, you know!" "Deah me! I've staid with you quite a twelfth, you know; perfectly ill bred, you know."</p>
                  <p>It is rumored that Rob's chum, young Jackson, is fairly deluged with "Sunny-side" and "Climax," and the worst of it is, it is charged to poor Anno Domini. Come to think of it, there was something in last issue about the boy "eating his weed," or something like it. It's all in a lifetime.</p>
                  <p>There's a most amusing story that savors a little of the old time "pig in the bag" series. One of the vestrymen introduced a minister as a lecturer to St. Philips Guild and he spent the hour admitting that Afro-Americans were much in the dark as to the employment of pure air, etc, To say that the house stood aghast, is to say but little.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Loyal Union started out to see if women stand by women any better than men do, or to put it more plainly, to see which is the most successful, the ones that depend upon man for a following, or the ones that count upon women first, last and always. I think the latter came in losers. I don't know for sure. At any rate, the W. L. U. gave an entertainment, and, while the most exclusive of New York and Brooklyn society life patronized the affair, yet there was room for many more.</p>
                  <p>The hall was beautifully decorated with flags and potted plants, palms and fresh-cut chrysanthemums being most noticeable. Counsellor Stuart, in his usual hearty, brilliant manner, said a great many bright and sound things on that occasion that New Yorkers ought to remember. "These, women are aiming to accomplish a splendid work, a practical work--one that deserves the individual support of every man and woman anxious for genuine race development. The measure they are working for has within its scope the refutation of the vile slanders against its as a humane moral people."</p>
                  <p>The Hon. John S. Durham followed, and made a strong point by asking, "Will the people sympathize with so grave an undertaking?" He complimented the women by saying their methods appealed to reason, and not sentiment mainly, and were bound to succeed in the end."</p>
                  <pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>The leader of this courageous body, the sad-eyed "Victoria Earle," was called "Anno Domini, '94," in my presence, too. Thanks awfully for the compliment. Speaking of the president of the powerful W. L. U., several have noticed that she wears invariably a pair of hearts at her throat, and a tiny blue one on the index finger of the left hand. I wonder why.</p>
                  <p>As usual, Harry Burleigh was the lion of the occasion. He sang, in the absence of a member, with the Guild Quartette, and later charmed the house with two of his favorite numbers. And while such as "our Rob and his chums," Messrs. Attwell, Day, Peterson, Charleton, Durham, Grazette, Thomas, and such old veterans as W. Russell Johnson, Tom McKeel, Dorsey Webster, and a whole host were dancing, Harry B. was chatting with one of the sweetest girls in the lot--and there were so many lovely creatures out that night! One, a very interesting looking widow, was the cynosure of all eyes.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Matthews, our "Victoria Earle," upon whom I shall, in all probability, make an ERA New Year's call, possibly confess, etc., etc., has the reputation of being one of the most enthusiastic women in town, earnest, and to a remarkable degree, a believer in her own sex, and a woman destined to succeed in what she sets out to do. She's a credit to her sex, and the Queen Bee in our town. She has stirred our best women as no other woman has done, in my time, at least. It was a fitting compliment to her as a woman that such women as Mrs. S. J. S. Garnet, Mrs. C. A. Attwell, Mrs. F. H. Carmand, Mrs. J. Pegram Williams, Mrs. Jerome B. Peterson, Miss Annie L. Dias, Mrs. E. Dorsey, Mrs. Broughton, Miss Edie Braxton, Miss Katie White, Mrs. A. D. Lee, Mrs. Beauvere, Mrs. Richards, Mrs. Jarrot, Mrs. J. E. Garner, Mrs. J. S. Poline, Mrs. Maxwell and Mrs. A. Rich gathered around her.</p>
                  <p>The King's Daughter's "Willing Workers" Circle, Mrs. White, president, are practising a drama, to be given some time before Easter. To this circle belongs the honor, I understand, of placing the first colored woman in the management of Brooklyn Colored Home. Mrs. Anna Rich, a sister of "Victoria Earle."</p>
                  <p>The St. Mark boys are planning a great surprise for the Guild lads. They are secretly drilling a quartette to throw into the shade Messrs. Attwell, Jackson, Williams and Medocer. Harry Burleigh has been mentioned as a possible instructor.</p>
                  <p>His charming little pupil, Miss Lavinia Jones, was in splendid voice at the W. L. U. concert. She did very well--looked real cute standing 'mid the palms; so did bewitching Miss Sadie Evans, all bedecked in rare old lace and cream white satin. She is the merriest girl I know. She was very saucy to</p>

                  <p>Miss Jennie Hilyer, sister of Mr. A. F. Hilyer, one of the most useful and popular citizens with whom Washington is blessed, has been called from Provident Hospital, Chicago, to take charge of the nurses in the surgical department of Freedman's Hospital.</p>
                  <p>Musical Washington now carols paeans of rejoicing  because Mrs. Alice Strange Davis has returned to her former home and has again taken up her residence among us. Baltimore has our heartfelt sympathy at the loss of such an artist as Mrs. Davis.</p>
                  <p>The social festivities of the season were inaugurated by a reception recently given by Mrs. A. F. Hilyer, whose assistants were Mesdames Lawson, Davis, Williams, Terrell, and Misses Mickie Cook, Bessie Cook, Essie Tucker and Annie Wilder. The costumes of the ladies, the delicacies served by such charming young women, and the amiability of the hostess, all went to make the occasion enjoyable in the extreme.</p>
                  <p>About thirty young women are availing themselves of a course in nursing which Freedman's Hospital now offers. They are obliged to remain in the hospital eighteen months before receiving a diploma. Two hours a day they are off duty and about once in two weeks have a whole afternoon to themselves. Besides enjoying the benefit received from actual experience in nursing the sick, they are permitted to assist at the clinics, where much valuable information is acquired. In addition to giving instruction free of charge, the authorities pay the nurses a small sum monthly for their services. With such an opportunity and with such encouragement, it is no wonder that so many of our women are choosing the avocation for which they are by nature so admirably fitted. In deciding to become a professional nurse a young

woman not only selects a calling which is both dignified and lucrative, but one which calls forth all those virtues essential to the highest and best womanhood.</p>
                  <p>"Why do the Washington schoolmarms look so young?" asked a gentleman from a neighboring city not many moons ago. It would have been impossible to reply had a suitable answer been on the tongue's end. Without waiting for any solution of this interesting problem in ethnological physiognomy, our friend went into one series of paroxysms after another over the youthful appearance, the charming manners, the amiable disposition and the fetching costumes of the typical Washington schoolmarm. He insisted that the older they grow, the younger and more charming they become, and he was a man of good judgment and excellent taste.</p>
                  <p>When it was possible to get a word in edgewise, a thoughtful friend, noted for his penetration, ventured to solve the mystery of our schoolmarm's eternal youth and beauty as follows: "Our teacher's work is lighter than anywhere else in the country, thanks to our school system, which is about as near perfection as a human institution can hope to be. Outside the schoolroom the teacher is not overburdened with work, although nowhere in the country are teachers more solicitous for their pupils' welfare and more punctilious about their duties to them. The Washington schoolmarm is not harassed by the divers vexations of spirit to which many of her unfortunate sisters are elsewhere subjected. For instance, her position in the schools is secure as long as she deports herself properly, and she knows it. She is, therefore, not obliged to pull wires and 'crook the pregnant hinges of the knee' to retain it, a rule which, I regret to state, does not pertain everywhere. When there is the inclination, she can attend a lecture, hear an opera, go to the theatre, or divert herself in the variety of ways for which the Nation's Capital is famous. Besides, our teachers are well paid; can, therefore, afford to take good care of themselves and dress well. No wonder we have the most charming schoolmarms in the world," said their able champion and logician. Drawing himself up with pride and glowing with enthusiasm, as though he were individually responsible for the delightful condition of affairs on which he had expatiated with such evident satisfaction and knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The Colorado women came nobly to the rescue of the republican party in the last election. This is a fair sample of what women will do for the country when they are no longer put on the level with idiots and criminals. Wyoming and Colorado are the only states advanced, and just enough to permit all of her citizens to vote at state elections without regard to sex.</p>
                  <p>It is safe to predict that a few years hence it will be difficult for colored women to find employment here as cooks or housekeepers. Public sentiment is waxing so strong against them that unless a change sets in their favor, comparatively few will be able in the future to find employment as servants. A glance at the advertising columns of the daily papers, in which the demand for white help is so explicit and great, is sufficient to convince one that the situation here for women laborers of the race is becoming very serious. It is the fad now for the wealthier classes to employ skilled cooks, to whom they pay large prices, and these skilled cooks are almost without exception white. In the south, where colored help has always been preferred, even when white help was just as available and serviceable, it is growing quite common to employ white servants to the exclusion of the colored.</p>
                  <p>There is constant friction between the employed and the employer all over the country and along all lines, regardless of race or sex, but the loudest complaint here at present is directed against colored domestics. This is one of the most, serious problems that confronts us, since the women wage-earners of the race contribute as much at least to its support as the men, and when the women fail to find employment in domestic service many a family will suffer and much of the revenue enjoyed will be cut off.</p>
                  <p>In view of the fact that white help is supplanting the colored, is it not sensible and charitable for the thoughtful men and women of the race to attempt to devise ways and means of improving this alarming condition of affairs? Since clubs and societies are formed to further all sorts of interests and projects, why not organize a society, the duty of whose members will be to meet the laboring classes, and impress upon them the necessity of making themselves skilled workmen in every sense of the word? There is a society here, headed by Mrs. Logan and other prominent women, whose object is the improvement of do-

mestics. They teach the girls and women bow to perform their duties skilfully and systematically, so as to lighten their labor and make their services more desirable and indispensable to those who employ them. Is it not possible for the thinking women among us to establish schools in which our girls may be educated to be first-class servants? It is a work in which those who have the welfare of the laboring classes at heart must soon engage. Obliged to combat a bitter, unreasonable prejudice, the working colored women of the future must be well equipped and reliable indeed to stem the tide of disfavor which has set against them, here at least.</p>
                  <p>"What are you doing with yourself these days?" asked one well-known woman of another. "Well, I'm taking a course in English literature and dabbling a little into the history of Russia. Since the death of the czar has turned the attention of the world to his interesting country, it has suddenly dawned upon me that I am absolutely ignorant of its present government, the habits of its people, and its past history." "Taking a course in English literature and studying Russian history!" exclaimed her friend in amazement. "What becomes of your house, your children and your sewing? I've neither chick nor child, and I haven't one minute to spare after the monotonous household affairs have been dispatched. From morning till night I am equipped with a kitchen utensil, a broom or a dust-cloth, and if, by some lucky chance, I can conscientiously lay them aside, in comes a friend or an acquaintance, and away go plans and time for mental improvement. I am just like everyone else and find it impossible to get good help, so that I have about as much time to study when I do my own work as I do when I have a hindering assistant. There is no one in the house except my husband and myself, the work is light, but by the time the little things have been attended to I am either too tired or too worried to study. Now you have a house full of children, do most of your sewing, and are a perfect model of a housekeeper, with no better help than I have. How in the world do you find time for English literature and Russian history?</p>
                  <p>"How I manage to save a few minutes for mental improvement is not difficult to explain," replied the friend. "I have a certain time in which to do my various duties. In other words, I systematize my work, for in the long run it is much more satisfactory to map out a schedule of work and go by it, though the heavens fall, than to attack things 'a la haphazard.' It may secin a. little like self-imposed servitude and self-tyranny at first, but the good results soon justify its adoption. Just try a schedule once, and then revert to the old go-as-you-please method of doing a duty today, if you feel like it, leaving it alone if you don't, consuming one hour to accomplish something today which will require three hours tomorrow, and thus getting yourself wound up in a knot of unfinished duties tangled with those that are to come, and you will soon see the folly of this desultory, slip-shod way of doing business. But you asked me how I found time to meddle with the affairs of the Russians and attend to my own business as well. I simply arrange my work so as to leave a certain amount of time for study, and whether I feel like it or not I go at it religiously, unless I am positively ill."</p>
                  <p>"What do you do if you are interrupted by visitors? " "That is the most serious difficulty which confronts me and the only kind of interruption against which I can make no provision. In the first place, I usually set apart for study that time in the morning or afternoon when visitors rarely come, but if they do I accept the inevitable and promise to make up for lost time as soon as possible."</p>
                  <p>"By the way, did you ever think how much time would be saved if we did not run in upon our friends at all sorts of unseasonable hours, just because it suited our convenience? Men will not entertain callers in business hours. If a friend comes in whom they are really glad to see, they greet him cordially, pass the time of day, and excuse themselves on the plea of pressing business matters. No offence is meant and none is taken. What a blessing it would be if we women could understand each other so thoroughly. So often have I heard my friends bemoaning their fate, because the day set apart for doing some special work was hopelessly destroyed by unreasonable though not unwelcome visitors."</p>
                  <p>"Don't you enjoy the visits of your friends?" asked her companion, considerably piqued and disconcerted by the conversation on unreasonable visits. "Certainly I do," was the reply. "No one enjoys visiting and being visited by friends more than I do; I only plead for seasonable visits and a little insight or tact to discern when it is right to consume a friend's time and when it is kind to leave her alone. Personally, I have noth-

ing to complain of, as I am rarely prevented from doing my duty by visitors, and expect to find in the future, as I have in the past, time to brush the cobwebs from my brain if I cannot luxuriously furnish it with a multitude and variety of facts."</p>

                     <p>There are many now living that distinctly remember Constable Reed, and also remember him as a man of good courage, but a little inclined to be too officious and domineering. It was Reed who was selected to go to California and bring back a noted desperado, in which case he showed it great deal of intrepidity and bravery.  It was Reed who came to arrest Big Dick, but the latter took him and carried him to the Court House, much to his mortification, at the same time surrendering himself. Reed, however, in his later years, has been heard to refer good-naturedly to this episode.</p>
                     <p>It, was generally conceded that whatever he set out to do was generally done, even to the capture of a poor fugitive slave. It has been said, however, by those who knew him best, that he was not prejudiced against the colored people, and that, under the same circumstances, he would capture a white man equally as quick.</p>
                     <p>But it was an attempt on his part to capture one of the former that we are about to relate.</p>
                     <p>On the very spot where the Twelfth Baptist Church now stands, and the adjacent territory, extending in a northeasterly direction and bounded on three sides by the rear walls of brick houses, was a settlement consisting of dingy, shabby looking houses, most of which were known as "ten-footers," that were scattered promiscuously over the entire area. There was no recognized passage through this region, but a way known as "Black Dog Alley " (a name given it on account of the numerous curs, in reality of all colors, that infested the place, and by which the stranger, whom they seemed to instinctively know, was sure to be beset upon entrance and determinedly followed till his return and exit), which windings were understood only by those familiar with the locality, was the sole avenue. Neither was this habitation lighted by night, and one having occasion to be within its borders after nightfall might imagine himself in some part of Pluto's dark realm. In fact, the whole appearance of the place was as uninviting as it was irregular, and one in which people generally never cared to venture too far, either by day or night.</p>
                     <p>It was in one of those dark, sunburnt-looking hovels that the incident occurred to which we are about to allude.</p>
                     <p>It seemed to be suspected by Reed's movements that he was after a fugitive slave who had come to Boston and was known to be stopping somewhere in that part of the West End to which reference has been made; and their surmises proved to be well founded, for the fugitive had been tracked to Boston, and it was given into Reed's hands to find and arrest him. He seemed to have been successful in gaining a knowledge of his whereabouts and no doubt thought he was sure of securing his victim.</p>
                     <p>One day that officer appeared before one of those hovels before described and demanded admission. But a voice from within demanded the immediate withdrawal of the officer, as he could rest assured that the door would not be opened. This only incensed the latter, who threatened to burst open the door if his demand was not immediately complied with; but in turn was warned by the same voice that if his threat was carried out he would be sure to regret it. This only increased the anger of the intruding officer, who, sure enough, commenced to use his legs and feet as battering rams, and being stout and rugged it was not long before the wood-work around the lock began to weaken, and soon breaking away, the door swung upon its hinges, and Reed started to enter, but suddenly halted, for before him stood a ferocious-looking colored man armed with an ax, which he poised in his hands, who, in fierce tones told the officer that if he stepped his foot inside the door his head would be severed from his body. As we have said, Reed hesitated , for the look of unmistakable meaning in the eyes of the colored man seemed to bring him to his senses and to a realizing sense of the situation. He felt in his heart that there was danger, but he had come there to arrest a fugitive slave that had there found a shelter, and yet he shrank from the undertaking. But should he retreat? It was no doubt when this thought came to his mind that Reed's courage and determination came back. Such a thing should never be said, for if so, his reputation was gone forever. And seeming either to determine within himself that he would not believe that the man would dare after all to carry out his threat, or that he might successfully cope with him (for Reed was no coward), he made a move-
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ment to take the forbidden step. But if this was his reasoning, and such it evidently seemed to be, it proved a poor reed to lean upon; for, quick as lightning, the ax was swung aloft, flashed as it turned in air, and came down. The head was gone; but not by decapitation, for Reed saw the movement and dodged quick enough to save his head and his life also. But he was not to go unscathed, for the keen blade of the ax struck the fleshy part of the arm near the shoulder, which he had raised for protection, inflicting a severe flesh wound, and found a lodgment in the frame of the door. As quick as before, the ax was again uplifted, as if this time to make sure his aim. But Reed had had enough of such experience, and with a quickness for which he had never been accredited, he had eluded the descending blow and was well outside of the door, and standing at a respectful distance began to vow vengeance on his would be headsman; he finally went away declaring that he would return and arrest them both. In due time, a warrant was indeed served upon the colored man who, now that the fugitive had made his escape (who, while the scene at the door was being enacted, had, with the aid of the defender's wife got out of the house by a back window and been conducted to a place of safety) readily and without resistance gave himself up, and the next morning was arraigned before the court. But upon examination it was found that Reed had unlawfully proceeded without a warrant, and the Judge, taking the ground that a man's house was his castle and that the colored man was justified in doing as he did under the circumstances, and considering, perhaps, that Reed needed a lesson on the unlawful exercise of authority, the man was acquitted.</p>
                     <p>The circumstances and trial of this case were published in the Boston newspapers and are still remembered by a number among us. One old gentleman, doing business in Boston some years ago, told the writer that he knew of the affair soon after its occurrence, and distinctly remembers reading the account of the trial in his paper, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, the next day.</p>

                     <p>We have received the enlarged edition of the WOMAN'S ERA, a monthly published at Boston, Mass., with Josephine St. P. Ruffin and Florida R. Ridley, editors. It is certainly a magnificent publication. It has 20 pages of excellently printed and splendid reading matter on good book paper. Several new departments have been added, conducted by Mrs. W. E. Matthews, New York; Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, Washington; Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, Chicago; Mrs. J. Silome Yates, Kansas City, Mo.; Elizabeth P. Ensley, Denver, Col., and Alice Ruth Moore, New Orleans. It is devoted to the interest of the women's clubs, leagues and societies throughout the country. The present number contains an article on "Cedar Hill and Its Master," which is indeed a masterpiece of word-painting. It is signed "Victoria Earle." It is certainly a magnificent sheet. Only one thing, fair editresses, give us a Virginia page, with Mrs. Rosa D. Dowser of this city in charge."</p>
                     <p>We would gladly have a Virginia page. Hampton, Norfolk and surrounding towns were among the first to send in subscriptions and endorsements in any number. The ERA owes much to the intelligent interest of Mrs. R. G. L. Paige, Mrs. Geo. J. Davis and other ladies of eastern Virginia.</p>

                     <p>Few places in America have more history connected with them than Boston. More than this, history is continually being made here. Unfortunately, the growth of the city demands the demolition, partial or total, of many of the landmarks and historical spots, and in many instances the changes are such that tablets are the only things that mark the spots.</p>
                     <p>It is a pity that, with the new Boston spreading in all directions, old Boston cannot be left intact. The old house on Essex street, in which Wendell Phillips lived for forty years, has succumbed to the business demands of the city, and that the associations connected with the Spot might not wholly be forgotten, and as a memorial to Boston's famous son and great orator, a tablet to the memory of Wendell Phillips was placed upon the building, with fitting exercises, on Nov. 20. Among those who spoke were William Lloyd Garrison, Rev. C. G. Ames, Ex-mayor Green, Clement G. Morgan and Julius C. Chappelle.</p>
                     <p>Owing to the threatening weather and the understanding that the exercises would take place in the open air, few ladies were present. So when Mr. Garrison called for some woman to speak, unfortunately there was no response, and this opportunity for the women to pay tribute to the staunch friend and advocate of the rights of both sexes and all races was lost.</p>

                  <p>Two candidates for school committee were presented by the colored people of Boston for nomination by the Republican party, neither one of whom was accepted, --Dr. George F. Grant and Mr. G. W. Forbes. The failure is to be regretted. An able, wide-awake representative on the school board is our due and means more than appears at first blush. In presenting a candidate colored men should not be indifferent to the women voters; they hold it tremendous power over school matters. By the way, the papers, in referring to Dr. Grant, speak of him as having been born in the South; according to our understanding Dr. Grant was born in New York State, where the home of his father was one of the well-known stations of the under-ground railway.</p>
                  <p>It is enough to make one's blood boil and to keep one in it perpetual fighting mood to see not only how law and justice are violated, but rules of honor and courtesy perverted by Caucasians in dealing with the negro. "You call yourself a Christian, and sell a house in a first-class neighborhood to colored people." This is the reproach of an estimable Brooklyn lady!</p>
                  <p>"You a Harvard graduate and an instructor and do a thing like this!" said an indignant white man to a fellow when he found that his house had been sold to colored people.</p>
                  <p>Not only are colored people to be kept out of all desirable trades, employments, homes and business places, but anyone who assists the poor wretch to anything desirable is to be denounced.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty which colored people experience in obtaining property in Boston is an astonishing revelation to outsiders. Houses are put upon the market with the almost universal instruction, "Under no consideration to be sold to darkies." Occasionally there are individuals anxious to realize money who will sell at a great advance to colored people; then, too, when nobody else will buy colored people will be welcomed.</p>
                  <p>The position is absurd. No other class of venders say who shall and shall not buy their wares. A real estate agent advertises for a purchaser, does not intimate that anything is necessary but the requisite amount of cash and then reserves to himself the right to refuse and perhaps insult a colored man if he chance to apply. However, people get what they want, a fact which sellers of houses will begin to realize by-and-by; in the meantime, don't let them in their blind anger put things in a wrong light. A Christian and a gentleman, a Harvard graduate and instructor can do such a thing as sell a house to colored people without any loss to honor or discredit to their standing. On the contrary, the discredit is with any Christian or gentleman or Harvard graduate who draws the line simply because of color.</p>
                  <p>Hon. Robert Treat Paine has recently been reading a paper on the causes and preventatives of poverty and pauperism. This gentleman has made a reputation of his own for charitable work. He looks at charitable work <sic corr="philosophically">philosopically</sic> and gives it much thought and time. He is deeply interested in the prevention of pauperism, believes in the elevation of the home life, providing clean, cheap and healthy tenements for the poor. He is prime mover in building associations by which poor men are enabled to get in possession of comfortable and pretty homes by easy payments. In his work the honorable gentleman talks much about "the poor," but do not be misled, he means the "white poor" or the "poor whites." He builds hundreds of houses, which are intended as godsends for poor men, and then closes them irrevocably to any poor colored men who may apply. The poor white working men
<pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
must have their prejudices catered to. They are poor, it is true, but they must not be made to suffer the humiliation of living beside a colored man, even though he be respectable.</p>
                  <p>Treat Paine stands high in the church, high in charitable works, and yet he likes such a position as this, a position which is both cowardly and dishonorable.</p>
                  <p>Public men must be prepared for public criticism, and if there be followers of this gentleman who think he is making a record as a beneficent Christian, it is just as well for them to know there are others who think differently.</p>
                  <p>Colored people get much abuse because they take much. It is time for them to strike back and use their journals for that purpose. If we must "kick" let us kick to some purpose and where it will be felt.</p>

                  <p rend="aligncenter">CONCLUDED.</p>
                  <p>Although Luther placed such stress upon a German translation of the Bible, he did not think it wise at that time to take the more aggressive step of introducing German into the new schools. He recommends mathematics and the study of nature, while he does not consider either as all-essential. His mission is for history and the historians, and for music, which he considers a civilizing influence and conducive to that joyousness, and abundance of which he so much approves in the school room.</p>
                  <p>We find the germ of the graded school in his divisions, and of the normal school in his plan of keeping the best of the pupils for a longer time at school. To them he gives special instructors, and opens libraries for their use. Favorably inclined toward the higher education of women and the co-education of the sexes, Luther apparently anticipated at least two of the snags and scarecrows of modern education, and disposed of them with a liberality of sentiment which would have done credit to a reformer of the nineteenth century.</p>
                  <p>The influence of his favorite master, the humanist, Trutivettie, and of Tauler, the mystic, are trace able in his educational and religious beliefs. His own efforts toward the materialization of ideals rapidly gained the attention of the public, but the interruption occasioned by the Thirty Years' War, his own death in 1546, and other events before and after, incident to the Reformation, made it impossible for him to directly impress his personality upon the schools of his time.</p>
                  <p>Luther, Melanchthon and Erasmus formulated theories for Protestant education, while others, as the brilliant Sturm of Strasburg, put them to practical use.</p>
                  <p>Living between the years 1550 and 1589, all enthusiastic humanist, Sturm's work was especially along the line of higher education. In his course of ten, or at the least, nine years, seven were to be spent in acquiring pure idiomatic Latin, and the remainder in the acquisition of an elegant Latin style. As rector of the Strasburg high school for a period of forty-five years, during which time thousands of pupils passed under his instruction, and from nearly every European country, he, more than Luther or Melanchthon, moulded the form of Protestant schools, directed the educational thought of the times, and developed the scheme upon which the great classical schools of England and other Protestant countries were based. Thus it was that Cicero to such an extent moulded the character and conduct of an English statesman, who felt that "A false quantity in a Latin quotation was really a greater crime than a slip in logical argument."</p>
                  <p>Erasmus, the scholar of the Reformation, exerted a most salutory effect upon the educational spirit of the age by calling the attention of teachers to the amenities of polite society, and to attractive methods of producing culture in the pupil.</p>
                  <p>Take in its entirely, humanism, as taught in the Protestant schools, if narrow, was not a poor equipment for active life. William Pitt, at twenty-two chancellor of the exchequer, at twenty-four prime minister of England, was a product of this method of training; but it is said of Pitt upon authority, that he was not only a first-rate humanist, but also "An excellent mathematician, a keen observer, an admirable orator, a close reasoner, a profound student or history, and a political economist far in advance of his times.</p>
                  <p>In the history of popular education, as influenced by the Reformation, it is important to realize the existence of two parallel streams of thought, the religious idea, or Hebraism, as embodied in Luther, the purely educational, or Hellenism, as fairly represented by Erasmus. The
<pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
religious feature, as imposed by Luther, we still find, to a greater or less extent, in our denominational schools and in such public schools as still retain some form of religious exercise. If there are but two great elements in our modern civilization, Hebraism and Hellenism, it is safe to state that the Reformation has indelibly stamped the general principles of the former upon our educational systems; while the whole tendency of modern civilization toward Hellenism is so overmastering that there is little danger of its being over-shadowed.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the influence of the early Protestant schools be accurately estimated without sounding the depths of that great counter-current, which was rapidly thrown into prominence and used by the opponents of the reform measures to serve the double purpose of stemming the tide of the Revolution, either by the conquest of new provinces for the church, through missions, or by preserving the old through the control of the church.</p>
                  <p>Organized by Loyola, the Society of Jesus was formally consecrated by Paul IV. in 1540, and grew with such rapidity that by 1710, the Jesuits controlled 612 colleges and it large number of universities. Upon its roll of honor were found some of the most illustrious names of the period--Bossuet, Des Cartes and Moliere. Voltaire received his training from the Jesuits, but he says of them, "They taught me nothing but Latin and nonsense."</p>
                  <p>Authorities differ as to the educational value of the Jesuit schools. Bacon and Des Cartes sincerely believed in their superiority. Leibuitz regarded them as below mediocrity, but in spite of adverse opinion, they maintained an educational supremacy until the end of the eighteenth century, and according to the Brittanica, represent in America today a large percentage of the whole number of educational institutions, both in the United States and Canada.</p>
                  <p>Unlike the Protestant reformers, the Jesuits ignored primary instruction, and thus far no exposition of the principles underlying their method of instruction have been found. Like the humanists, and to a still greater extent, they reverenced the study of Latin, and covered their districts with Latin schools. They appealed to the memory as the basis upon which to found their system; and the sole merit of their teachers, as seen through the experience of the centuries, seems to have been the stamp of aestheticism which they fixed upon modern education and their ingenious attempts, for whatever purpose, to individualize their pupils. In our own system, we have not yet decided whether it is better to turn out job-lot mediocrity or to individualize or specialize.</p>
                  <p>The Jansenists, rivals of the Jesuits, possessed whatever of merit there may have been in the latter, and, in addition, sought to introduce the study of the mother tongue, the training of the reason and judgment. Looked upon with disfavor, their schools were soon suppressed by the Jesuits; but the contest for supremacy, which, from the initial point, began to be waged in those countries where Catholicism and Protestantism co-exist, still continues, assuming various phases, according to the political and religious character of the country in question, and universally affecting civilization to a far greater extent than can be estimated by the casual observer.</p>
                  <p>Thus has the humanistic system of Protestant education, as originated by Luther, been limited in extent, and otherwise changed by the influence of the streams that have impregnated it. Humanism itself, training the pupil more especially for school than for life, gradually gave place to that realism and naturalism that necessarily follow in the wake of utilitarian ideas and today form the most important features of our educational system.</p>
                  <p>Naturalism in Germany was ably fostered by Ratich and Comenius, and both were largely influenced by the Lutheran movement. Ratich defined a few valuable pedagogical laws and endeavored to establish the mother tongue as a part of the curriculum; but it was Comenius who determined that gradation of schools which forms the basis of modern instruction, who not only defined laws in the art of teaching which are still in use, but also substituted the knowledge of things for the study of Greek and Latin roots, and thus produced a race of original investigators. The mother-school of Comenius prepared the way for Frbel and the kindergarten, while from his plan of nature study, we develop the science lessons of primary and elementary schools. Thus at every step we find modern education linked with the genius of the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Compayre writes in his "History of Pedagogy," "Every system of philosophy contains in germ a special system of education." Yes, and it is no less true that the destiny of the human race is controlled by educational forces extending backward to the creation of the universe, onward
<pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
and onward in ever-widening circles, through unknown evolutions, into infinity. Environed today more closely by the philosophic circles of Bacon, Des Cartes and Kant than by the principles of Luther's methods, we feel the force of at greater scope of horizon and call it the "new education," but the unprejudiced mind will freely admit that its data were made possible of conception, of interpretation, of realization because of that spirit of absolute intellectual freedom which the processes of the Reformation contributed to modern civilization.</p>
                  <p>Volume I., No. 8, of the WOMAN'S ERA has reached our office. We were particularly struck with its admirable makeup and scholarly articles and trust that it has come to stay. The editors are ladies of culture and refinement worthy representatives of their race. The ERA should meet with great success among our people.--<hi rend="italic">Kansas City Messenger.</hi>

                  <p>Christmas and all its joys is upon us. Many happy returns of the day.</p>
                  <p>In the November Ladies' Home Journal there is a symposium of noted women on the question of the best age for women. As it local critic caustically remarks, "all being over thirty, the opinion is unanimous on the average of twenty-five to forty."</p>
                  <p>Leaving aside the dry, hackneyed statistics which show us that Cleopatra was in her prime at forty, that Elizabeth and the Russian Catherine charmed all beholders at forty-five, that Helen of Troy was well advanced in age when the famous siege began, still, reason compels almost anyone to admit that only after the touch of years has pressed woman's forehead is she of any solid, sound, practical opinions; for with the fire of genius, which burns all unchecked and untended in youth, there should be united the tenderness and forbearance and patience, which come from sorrows borne; the grave wisdom, which comes from years; the gentle dignity, which comes from mingling in the world; the complete realization of one's own power and failings, which comes from

measuring and comparing other intellects with one's own; then there is, indeed, "a perfect woman, nobly planned."</p>
                  <p>Miss Neal Gertrude Hawkins, the pretty songbird from Kentucky, with Miss Eva Frazier, a gifted reader, and Prof. Morris, the musician of the company, delighted New Orleans one night. But now the public is all on the <hi rend="italic">qui vive</hi>, eagerly, anxiously awaiting Flora Batson, who is so well liked here. Her advance agent is now in the city perfecting arrangements.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of nervous prostration, and the almost universal grip it has upon the women of America, Rebecca Harding Davis suggests that most of the fatigue and worry and prostration of women is caused, not by the amount of work they do, or the crowding of their lives but by the fuss they make about it. The continually recurring cry, "I have not the time," which besets us at every fresh allusion to any plan, is raised, if you will notice, by those who have the least to do, for should you visit their homes you will often find them sitting for hours with idle hands folded in their laps. Depend upon it, it is only the lazy ones who "haven't the time" to do little ends of favors.</p>
                  <p>The churches are in the lead now. On the 26th of November the Masonic lodge held forth in an entertainment at Union Chapel on Brenville St. The students' Orchestra played, of course; how could it have been a successful entertainment if Prof. Nickerson had not stood before his earnest girls and waved his baton as they made "those little stringed wooden things" speak the heart's language?</p>
                  <p>And then on the 19th the ladies of St. Luke held a cute little "Brownie" social, which gave everyone lots of fun and netted some dollars for the church fund.</p>
                  <p>It was left for Central Church to celebrate Thanksgiving, holding a two nights' feast under the auspices of the Christian Endeavor societies. Now for the Christmas trees!</p>
                  <p>Wordsworth's idea, "Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting," which has long been considered as the ultra development of an unconventional intellect, can be put to shame by some of childhood's theories. Very few little people will realize or will believe that the soul "knows its haunts no more." No, they think, not clearly and concisely, nor perhaps knowing what it is they do think, that somehow, someway they will return. As a little one expressed it, "All the men that died in the war, they comed back and be'd other people;" and no amount of coaxing or threatening or cross-questioning could make her say aught of her idea save that "she always thought so." Like Topsy, "it jest growed."</p>
                  <p>Here is a theme for Darwinian theorists, for psychological investigators. Do our every-day ideas come to us the result of study, of association, of inspiration, or of pre-natal impressions? Do the unformed thoughts of childhood remain with us, growing more complete with years, or do they vanish and are replaced by the newer and grosser ones of the world as it comes when we are old? Debating societies, take up your weapons!</p>

                  <p>PHILADELPHIA.</p>
                  <p>An interesting and noteworthy organization is the Educational Club of this city. It has been in existence for three years. It is composed of about thirty young women and girls who meet for real earnest study. Miss Fanny Somerville deserves the credit of inaugurating the club and keeping the thorough and practical work in smooth running order. Two comfortable parlors are rented for the use of the girls and evening classes are held.</p>
                  <p>There is instruction given in the English branches, bookkeeping, German and literature. This winter a class in current topics has been started. The girls are encouraged to talk land ask questions about events of interest that are going on all the time. History-making events we call them. Great interest is shown in this class and the girls eagerly listen and show an intelligent appreciation of their leader's efforts to interest them in the best of current news.</p>
                  <p>An interesting sermon, book, or magazine article often furnishes the topic. Miss M. G. Jones last winter conducted a successful course in literature. Dr. Rebecca Cole has taught the German class for two years. The services of the teachers are gratuitous, thus making it possible for the club to pay the rent and buy necessary books at a comparatively small cost to each member. This is the kind of work that helps make our women ready for the opportunities that are opening for them. This is the "woman's century," it is said, and although colored women come last in the American scheme of life, it behooves the girls of our race to equip themselves so as to act their parts worthily.</p>
                  <p>In lighter vein we turn to listen to the joy bells ringing for the marriage of a sweet Philadelphia

maiden. Mr. Jno. F. Cook, Jr., of Washington, was wed with Miss Elizabeth Abele on Dec. 4, 1894. The happy pair are to live in Idaho, where the groom is at present engaged in business. With truth it may be exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q direct="unspecified">"A sweeter creature ne'er drew breath<lb/>
Than my son's wife" -- Elizabeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After several year's work and thought, the labors or Mrs. Fanny Jackson Coppin have taken practical shape in the outward visible sign of a Woman's Exchange, which opened about Dec. 1.</p>
                  <p>A house has been secured and furnished, where samples of millinery, dressmaking, art needlework and cooking will be shown. There will be classes taught in each of the above branches by colored women, graduates of the Industrial school already established and connected with Mrs. Coppin's school, the Institute for Colored Youth.</p>
                  <p>The upper rooms of the house are to be used its dormitories for pupils who come from a distance to study in these schools. Philadelphia owes much to the energy and ability of this accomplished woman. She is always planning and spending herself and her means to improve the condition of her race.</p>
                  <p>We feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that the papers of two of our townswomen, at the recent Conference of Colored Workers held in that city, were so good and showed so comprehensive a knowledge of church work, that these ladies were sent as delegates to the National Missionary Council which met in Hartford, Conn. Bishop Coleman, of Delaware, was at St. Thomas' Church when these papers were read, and he considered them of such special excellence that he proposed that the ladies be sent to Hartford to read their contributions there. Dr. Matlack, Who was also present, seconded the suggestion, and both gentlemen showed their interest by Offering to defray the expenses of the trip.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lucretia Miller, of St. Thomas, wrote on "Woman's Work in the Parish."</p>
                  <p>Miss Ella Shepherd, of the Church of the Crucifixion, took for her theme, "Woman as a Teacher in the Sunday School."</p>
                  <p>These ladies were the only colored delegates.</p>
                  <p>Have you just a little more space to hear about a musical and Shakesperian recital held recently? The occasion was very much enjoyed by a select and appreciative audience. Mr. R. Henri Strange showed his versatility in widely contrasted selections from Shakespeare, being especially happy in his rendition of scenes from Hamlet. Miss Scudder of Newark, N. J., is a pianist of great merit. She is young, and a brilliant future may be predicted for her.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Henry Jackson of Brooklyn evoked much enthusiasm by his sympathetic and mellow voice, which, by the way, is in the lower register, very similar to the delightful quality of Boston's favorite, Mr. George Ruffin.</p>
                  <p>But the real interest of the occasion to many of the beaux and belles who were present was the appearance of Mr. Leon Ashleigh Gray, the Beau Brummel of New York society. The sweet and clear tenor voice, the immaculate toilet, the tasteful--bouquet, I must say, for boutonniere is too small--were altogether too much for some of the ladies, for I heard one little dear exclaim, "Oh, isn't he just too lovely!"</p>

                  <p>A few years ago the Prudence Crandall Club of this city undertook to awaken interest in the study of the abolition heroes. The club was so far successful that memorial services in honor of the great prophets of forty years ago have been regularly held on the first Sunday in January each year. The character of these services has been of an unusually high order, and have from year to year been looked forward to as an occasion of inspiration and reconsecration to the high ideals of the men and women who have glorified American history.</p>
                  <p>This year the John Brown League is making large preparations to commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the execution of our sainted hero.</p>
                  <p>Three winter's ago, Mrs. John Jones of this city called to the attention of the younger generation that John Brown was pre-eminently deserving of a day of affectionate remembrance and tributes of honor in our calendar of celebrities. The Service held in her hospitable home was one of the most notable of meetings in the inspirations felt by all present. It was the rare privilege of herself and her late estimable husband to have furnished home and shelter and succor to the indomitable hero whenever he was in Chicago. The memories of that meeting, held at the hearth-stone where John Brown was so abundantly and gratefully welcomed by the gentle graciousness of his surviving friend and helper, have suggested the memorial services now being arranged for.</p>
                  <pb n="16 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>In view of these suggestions and memories I cannot refrain from adding my word or tribute to the hero of Ossawatomie.</p>
                  <p>This day, hallowed by John Brown's triumphant death, is a fitting occasion for all lovers of liberty in America to renew their vows of devotion on the altars of praise and thanksgiving.</p>
                  <p>John Brown was only a man. He was without honor or any of the trappings of greatness, yet to understand and fully know the significance of that homely name requires the perspective of a century of history and a study of all the open and secret forces of American civilization. The soul of John Brown was the magnet that drew all the forces of opposing interests to the stupendous crisis of 1861.</p>
                  <p>It is Emerson who says that God offers to each mind the choice between repose and truth. If your choice is repose then you are satisfied with the first religious creed, the first philosophy or the first politics that comes your way. Your pleasures and griefs are all conventional. To be comfortable and let alone is the motive of your life. The great demands of truth, of liberty and justice annoy you. You stand for the dead weight of inertia in all human progress. On the other hand, you who desire truth from the free and bountiful hand of the Almighty become a part of the dynamics of progress in humanity. Truth means restlessness and an uncompromising hate of wrong. It means reformation and the force of virtue in human affairs. He who chooses truth as a life motive is always and at all places a candidate for truth at whatever cost.</p>
                  <p>To such an one nothing is sacred or holy that is not illumined by the pure white light of truth.</p>
                  <p>The sum total of all our religion and our faith in God and man and government is our unyielding loyalty to all revelations of truth.</p>
                  <p>The supremacy in human history of such names as Savanarola, Luther, Cromwell, Washington and Lincoln are but so many evidences of truth exalted in human character.</p>
                  <p>It was the heroic Search to realize his own conception of truth that guided Columbus through mists of doubt and the perils or untried waters to the blessed haven of it new continent. The same thing made Dante magnificent in exile and the black hero, Toussaint L'Overteur, greater than Napoleon.</p>
                  <p>The choice of truth means the choice of conflict, of sacrifice, and perchance of death, for it has been decreed from the beginning of man that there shall be no greatness for mankind except by heroic effort and endurance for truth's sake.</p>
                  <p>By right of the extraordinary strength of his personality and by virtue of what he himself did and caused a whole nation to do, John Brown is for all time an eminent example of those who become strong and great by choice of truth.</p>
                  <p>John Brown came into the world at a period that became illustrious for its unequalled number of great men. While his contemporaries became eminent in literature, statesmanship and oratory, John Brown was still a man of the woods and unknown and unheeded. He literally walked through these states of the Union seeing many things and pondering them in his heart. He saw the glory of his country reflected from the majesty of its mountains and from the peace and beauty of its valleys. He communed with the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and felt proud of them all its a part of the heritage of freedom. But, alas! there was to all of his senses a discordant element. There was a shadow of evil over all that was fair and bright and promising. He saw his countrymen everywhere serving the cause of liberty with one hand and the cause of oppression with the other. Everywhere he heard his countrymen exulting in liberty, yet justifying bondage. He heard the statesman of his day equally eloquent on the theme of the Declaration of Independence and the codes of slavery. He saw the arrogant power of slavery defying all that was hallowed in religion, precious in democracy, and authoritative in law. He saw the nation's supreme oracle of justice sink to the lowest depths of injustice in the Dred Scot decision. His soul was heavy with grief because of the unutterable shame of his country as written in the fugitive slave law. He saw the Missouri Compromise swept away by the same fiendish spirit of Slavery. In fact, he saw freedom as a progressive force in the republic "banished to brutish beasts," and the opposite of all that was nobly fought for and nobly writ in law and the nation's heart aggressive, ascendant and triumphant. But what could John Brown do to stay this full tide of evil? Was he not poor, uneducated and unrelated to the men and women of power, and far removed from the forces that make and unmake governments?</p>
                  <p>And then again were not such men as Whittier, Phillips, Douglass, Garrison and Sumner doing all that was possible to be done? Everywhere the righteous were praying for abolition, and was it not written by the hand of God that the power of the righteous always prevailed?</p>
                  <p>John Brown may have asked himself all of these questions, but to every such question was the answer--Courage! He felt the exulted precept of Phillips, that in the cause of right the terms minority and majority were meaningless. He did not deprecate the gentle forces of prayer, eloquence and literature that were so powerfully arrayed against slavery, yet he saw that all these things were like casting pearls before swine in their inefficiency to overthrow the power of slavery. With marvellous insight John Brown saw that American slavery in its violent subversion of all laws and rights, and in its aggressive sovereignty over all the forces of government, was nothing less than a state of open war against the Union.</p>
                  <pb n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA"/>
                  <p>If the American people could but see this and feel this as he did, the path of duty would be easy.</p>
                  <p>The need of the hour was not the spirit of peace and conciliation, but rather the spirit militant to dare and do the bloody work of war.</p>
                  <p>"To arms, to arms," for the rescue of American liberty, was the one call needed as a fitting challenge to the leagured forces of oppression. It is to the undying glory of John Brown that he gave this first alarm and with superlative heroism first led the forces of warfare in Kansas and Virginia against the invasions or slavery. With the military eye of a great general John Brown saw that Kansas was the picket-line of freedom. The fell purpose of slavery, to trample into the dust the letter and spirit of the Missouri Compromise, and to invade the virgin soil of liberty and to extend its foul conquest over every inch of territory in the Northwest covered by the American flag, was to John Brown and his followers the very culmination of treasonable aggression against the republic. Who now could hesitate to unsheath the sword of war? Alas, for the cause of freedom! Alas, for the prophecies of Plymouth Rock and of '76 if now, in its hour or peril on the free soil of Kansas, liberty could find no champion to flash the sword of resistance against the dire encroachments of the slave power I will not attempt to retell the oft repeated stories of the eventful tragedies enacted oil the soil of Kansas. If you were not a part of it, or have never read it, you have missed one of the most instructive and dramatic chapters of American history. Here was the storm-center of the nation's first alarm. In the history of it all John Brown's righteous soul breathes in every chapter. Take the name of John Brown out of the history of "Bloody Kansas" and the grand meaning of it all shrinks into a mere guerilla warfare. John Brown's warfare for loyalty and freedom in Kansas was a profound object-lesson for all America. It furnished to all christendom in a most dramatic way the dire meaning of American slavery. It brought into startling contrast the two civilizations of America and bondage under the name of Union. What an awful absurdity was this from 1856 to 1859! How all history now rings with praises to John Brown for <sic corr="emphasizing">empasizing</sic> that absurdity in Kansas and Virginia.</p>
                  <p>Men of great piety and unerring grasp of the deeper meaning of things begin now to speak more and more confidently of the suggestive kinship between Calvary and the hills of Virginia. Can the souls of men be freed by a single death? Can the limbs of man be unchained and his soul take the wings of liberty by a single death? Call the great universe of mankind catch glimpses of immortality in the hallowed glow of all that is pure, beautiful and good, in a single death? Thanks to the human soul and its capacity for infinite goodness, Calvary and Virginia can give an answering "yes" to these exalted questionings of the human heart.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Election Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, it ever, came perfect day.</p>
                  <p>The clear atmosphere brought the mountains into bold relief. A glance at their strong outline, striking fearlessly against the cloudless sky, would fill any soul with inspiration. What wonder, then, that the women of Colorado stepped forth on the morning of the 6th of November, with enthusiasm unbounded, to exercise for the first time the crowning act of citizenship.</p>
                  <p>Conscious of being critically watched by forty-two states, they were especially anxious that the result of this experiment should prove conclusively that women would vote.</p>
                  <p>At seven o'clock, when the polls opened, half of those in line were women. It was interesting to note the different voters; young girls who looked to be scarcely twenty-one standing in line with white-haired matrons. All nationalities were represented.</p>
                  <p>It is said that such rapid voting was never before witnessed in Denver. It was also the most quiet.</p>
                  <p>In nearly all the precincts the heaviest vote was polled during the morning. In one of the largest precincts, at two o'clock, P. M., 550 out of 675 votes which belonged to that department, had been polled.</p>
                  <p>At one of the polling places a woman was on hand at half past five o'clock, declaring that she was there to cast the first ballot.</p>
                  <p>The women not only voted, but they worked zealously and untiringly, many of them beginning before daylight. Women of all parties took an active part, but the Republican women seemed rather the most enthusiastic. They were most systematically organized and had worked the field thoroughly. All voted, those who had protested against having the ballot thrust upon them and those who had hitherto taken no interest in politics. They electioneered, they drove from house to house bringing voters to the polls.</p>
                  <p>The women generally followed the instructions of the party leaders and voted the prepared slate, through fear of losing their votes if they scratched their tickets. The credulity of woman was played upon to the utmost. It is known, however, that some women were independent enough not to mark the party emblem.</p>
                  <p>The Republicans were triumphant; they won by a handsome majority. In Arapahoe county no other party could claim anything. This was probably due to the determination to defeat Gov. Waite, against whom there is a strong sentiment, not only among the opposing factious, but in his own party. Voters from all ranks were induced to join the Republicans in order to elect Mr. McIntire over Gov. Waite.</p>
                  <p>Lessons learned from the election and campaign preceding it:</p>
                  <p>1. Women will study politics. Proven by the great number of political study clubs formed during the past year. A populist woman, who stumped the state, says, "Politics was the theme of discussion morning, noon and night. The women talked politics over their sewing, their dish-washing, and during their social calls. Politics has made them read and think more, and in new and different lines. Some of the women are getting these economic questions drilled into their heads in a way that would astonish you, and when the mothers understand these things it is going to make a
<pb n="18 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
vast difference, for they will teach them to the children."</p>
                  <p>2. Women will vote. The women of Colorado have demonstrated that conclusively.</p>
                  <p>3. They will generally vote straight. This fact was shown by the Republican women, though it may be that in this instance they believed it necessary to do so in the interest of law and order.</p>
                  <p>4. There should be thorough and systematic organization of the women of all parties.</p>
                  <p>The good government committee will now take steps to strengthen its force and organize more thoroughly for the municipal election in the spring.</p>
                  <p>The first important work of the women will be to see that the party emblem in the Australian ballot is done away with, thus insuring a truly secret ballot, find therefore more independent voting.</p>
                  <p>The readers of the ERA will be interested to know what special part the colored women have taken in the election. Most of them have done admirable work in the interest of the Republican party. They also formed clubs of their own and heroically helped their brothers to elect a representative to the legislature, although the majority of those brothers voted against woman's enfranchisement.</p>
                  <p>They made good campaign speeches.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Olden is deserving of especial mention. She was one of fourteen delegates sent from the colored Republican club to the county convention held last summer. She suggested that they ask for representation in the state convention, but was discouraged by her too-timid brothers, on the ground that there was no use asking for what they would not get. But this courageous little woman persisted. The outcome of it all was that Mrs. Olden was unanimously elected third Vice-President of the Republican State League of Colorado. She has done most excellent work for the party.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Olden is a graduate of Fisk University. On the eve of election in November, '93, she came to Denver from Tennessee at the head of a small colony of people who longed for the free air of the mountains. They sought a dwelling place where free speech would not be denied them.</p>
                  <p>The colored women of Denver have recognized the worth of Mrs. Olden by making her president of their league lately organized, and about which I will tell you later.</p>

                  <p>Other American Settlements include the one in Philadelphia opened in April, 1892, in connection with work already begun by the St. Mary Street Library Association; Denison House, Boston, opened Jan. 1, 1893; Andover House, Boston, opened in fall, 1892; the Neighborhood Guild, founded by Dr. Stanton Coit in New York City, and opened in 1887; the University Settlement in Philadelphia, opened in Jan., 1893; East Side House, New York, opened early in 1891; the Epworth League Settlement, Boston, founded in 1892, and Hull House, Chicago, opened in Sept., 1889.</p>
                  <p>Of the Philadelphia Settlement Miss Hannah Fox said, in the Third Annual Report of the College Settlement Association, "The situation offered differed from the New York situation, in being off a side street in a shiftless neighborhood, among a less provident class of people, most of them being colored. ... The comfort of the house is greatly enhanced by the Starr Garden, which adjoins it. This garden is now owned by the City Park Association, and is opened daily under the care of a guardian, for the free use of the people, and is always placed at our disposal. ... There is an admission fee to all classes where anything like a trade is taught, as it is not felt advisable to give, all things involving a sacrifice being more truly valued. What the young boys and girls in the St. Mary's street neighborhood need most of all is work--good, steady, intelligent work. It is not lack of money which is the poverty we most deplore, but lack of self-hood, that self-hood which comes from work and makes it a blessing even though it be a bitter struggle for existence."</p>
                  <p>Denison House, Boston, named for Edward Denison, whose pioneer work in London has already been noticed, is in a neighborhood largely Irish, though Jews, Italians, Poles, Hungarians, and Armenians are also to be found there. Drunkenness with its attendant evils abounds, and the young people have but few quiet and respectable meeting places.</p>
                  <p>Already, however, in the short time that the house has been opened, the residents have gained the confidence and sympathy of many of their neighbors, and have come to understand, in some measure, the forces at work in the community for good and for evil. The work of Denison House will probably be especially along the lines of University and College Extension, and the organization of labor, and though but little that is definite can now be said, yet much is hoped for the future, because of the good foundation already laid.</p>

                  <p>Among the many beautiful lessons to he drawn from the life of our beloved poet, is none of more prominence than that of the economy of time. For it will he remembered, that that by which he has endeared himself to countless numbers was accomplished in his spare moments.</p>
                  <p>Although Dr. Holmes was undoubtedly a great and gifted poet, as well as an entertaining story-teller in his prose writings, it seems as if both of these gifts are subordinate to his own charming personality. It is neither the poet nor the prose writer that we have grown to love, or whom we mourn for now, but it is the man himself. In the "Autocrat" he has portrayed himself so faithfully that we can almost claim a personal acquaintance with him, and in his death feel the loss of a beloved friend.</p>
                  <p>A convenient reference book on American literature, designed either for young people, or those whose school days are past, is "American Authors," by Mildred Rutherford. It contain numerous half-tone portraits, and a special feature is the test questions at the end of each chapter.</p>
                  <p>"The Aim of Life" by Philip Moxom is a volume of addresses designed as an aid to young people in the development of noble characters.</p>
                  <p>A book that is interesting as well all instructive is Dr. Trumbull's "Studies in Oriental Social Life." It is particularly valuable as an aid in the Bible, for many of the things that are difficult to understand in Bible history can be readily comprehended when we have some knowledge of the social customs and inner life of the people. It is written of the Orient as it is today, but that part of the world has changed very little since the Bible was written.</p>
                  <p>"In the King's Country" is a delightfully entertaining story for girls. It is a story of Christian Endeavor and decidedly elevating and inspiring. "The Sherburne Cousins" is a still later book from her pen.</p>
                  <p>Miss Finley, the author of the charming "Elsie" books, has written another, which is a story of the Worlds Fair as it appeared to Elsie.</p>
                  <p>"The Work of the Afro-American Woman" is a daintily bound volume whose author is Mrs. N. F. Mosell, the wife of Dr. Mosell of Philadelphia. Mrs. Mosell's very commendable object in writing this book was to do for the women of her own race what had already been done for other women more favorably circumstanced. She has gathered together much valuable information and presents it to her readers in a clear, bright and entertaining manner, and no one can read the little volume without feeling a deeper interest in the progress of his race, and gaining much inspiration for nobler and better work in the future.</p>
                  <p>The plan of the book is quite comprehensive, containing reference the to work of our women in whatever lines in which they have achieved success, and is interspersed with interesting personal notes. Considerable space is devoted to the great works in which Miss Ida B. Wells is engaged.</p>
                  <p>It is a pleasure to note that Mrs. Mosell has not omitted to mention that great army of women workers, the home-makers, whom it would be impossible to call by name, but to whom a race we owe far more for our advancement and improvement than we do to a few teachers and scribblers here and there. It is to the mothers, to those wives and mothers, who, by their refinement and influence for upright living elevate the character of the homes, that the race owes its real progress and advancement.</p>
                  <p>Hall Caine, the author of "The Deemster," "The Bondman," and <sic corr="other equally">othere qually</sic> engrossing novels, has
<pb n="20 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
written another called "The Mahdi," which lovers of this most admirable writer will eagerly welcome. It promises to be a tale of love and heroism. "The Manxman" is considered by deep thinkers to be by far the best novel published recently, in spite of the popularity of "Trilby" and others. In fact, it is declared by some to be the best book we have had since the publication of "Adam Bede." <sic corr="Caine">Paine</sic> is at his best in the delineation of his masculine characters, and one's sympathy for the misfortune of his heroes is mingled with a deep admiration for their manliness and nobleness of soul.</p>
                  <p>The sale of Du Maurier's "Trilby " is said to have reached one hundred thousand copies.</p>
                  <p>It is rumored that F. Marion Crawford is to make his home in America, possibly either at New York or Washington. We can look forward to some rare stories of American life, if he treats us as well when with us as he has done other people when among them.</p>

                  <docDate>December 1894</docDate>
                  <p>At the urgent solicitation of friends--members of the Woman's Club of Chicago--Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams allowed her name to be offered for membership to that organization. For three years Mrs. Williams filled nearly all the offices, including that of vice-president and secretary of the Illinois Woman's Alliance, a central body composed of all the women's clubs. She is chairman of the committee on state schools for dependent children.</p>
                  <p>She held a representative position on the World's Fair Board and took a prominent part in the parliament of religions. Her paper read at the gathering on "What can Religion do to advance the condition of the Negro?" together with her portrait, appears in the Rev. Dr. Barrow's work, "The World's Parliament of Religion." As a lecturer, Mrs. Williams is in great demand. And yet, although thus well equipped to help on the work the Woman's clubs are formed to do, the modicum of negro blood in her veins out-weighed her eminent fitness, and club principle made a weak surrender to personal prejudice, and her name was rejected.</p>
                  <p>However, Mrs. Williams is philosophical and brave, and after the first sting of the affront put upon her is over, will recall with amused contempt the hysterical antics of her former associates in work, in their efforts to prevent the club giving legitimate recognition to the helpful work she had long been doing as an individual. Mrs. Williams can wait; there are greater things in store for her than mere membership in a club of narrow-minded women--and even that will come to her soon. There is no limit now to the possibilities of a woman endowed like Fannie Barrier Williams, and soon there will be no hindrance.</p>

                  <p>The first doll exhibition ever given in Boston was held in the parlors of the Brunswick Hotel, Wednesday, Nov. 21st, for St. Monica's home for sick women. Every country that has a characteristic costume was represented. The tiniest dolls in the exhibit were a pair of Japanese twins, perfect dolls, not over two inches long. The affair was a great success in every way.</p>
                  <p>One of the best preparations of its kind is the Witch Hazel Velvet Cream, for which W. F. and J. I. Kingsbury, Randolph, Mass., are agents. Anyone who received a sample at the World's Food Fair can testify as to its efficacy in whitening and softening the skin. Besides this, it is recommended as containing no lead, arsenic, mercury or any other poison, and can be applied in cases of abrasion or skin disease. It is for sale by all druggists.</p>
                  <p>How the seasons glide by! Only a little while ago and 'twas summer; then golden autumn, with its wreath of red and russet tones, passed as in review; now the season of general rejoicing and family reunion--Thanksgiving--has come and gone, bringing rich memories, many tinged with sadness of other days. Of all days in the year there's none upon which we notice more naturally "an empty chair," ofttimes through a film of tears, or with more cordial welcome add another to the board. To one and all we wish a merry and bountiful feast, flavored by all that is generous and kind, graced by acts as well as word divine.</p>

Another Splendid Premium Offer!</p>
                  <p>The first premium offered last March having been won the publishers of the ERA take pleasure in announcing another which, if possible, surpasses the first.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">READ!<lb/>
FIRST PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>For the boy or girl, man or woman who in the next 3 months brings in the largest number of paid up subscribers (over one hundred in number) we will give a course in Mr. Eastman's School of Carving and Modelling.</p>
                  <p>N.B.--This course taken at its full value is worth two hundred dollars; it extends over a term of nine months, and at the end of that time pupils are prepared to become teachers of the art. No more valuable premium could be offered; in return for a little energy a splendid trade is given and a position to teach almost assured, or if teaching is not preferred, and the premium winner prefers actual work, good and paying positions are assured.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">SECOND PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>To the one bringing in the next largest number of subscribers, half a term at the above school will be given.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">THIRD PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>To the one bringing in the third largest number of subscribers a New World Type-writer will be given.</p>
                  <p rend="aligncenter">FOURTH PREMIUM.</p>
                  <p>To the four boys or girls (beginners in music) bringing in each ten subscribers in the next three months, a year's course in the Boston Training School of Music will be given.</p>
                  <p>Do not pass this over lightly. The WOMAN'S ERA makes a specialty of preparing openings for young colored people; it realizes the difficulties they encounter in obtaining such openings and is prepared to do well by ambitious, earnest and determined young people. Don't complain of lack of chances if you let such as these pass you by.</p>
                  <p>All contestants not receiving premiums will be allowed twenty-five per cent on all paid yearly subscriptions received.</p>
                  <p>The time allowed is short, but people who are in earnest act at once.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Abby Morton Diaz gave the first in her series of talks on the "Science of Human Beings" before the Era Club Tuesday evening, March 28, at the Charles St. Church vestry. At a time and in a community where people are talked to, and at, and about until they are more inclined to run from rather than to lectures, it is gratifying to note that, so novel in scheme and so inspiring in result was this talk, that the enthusiasm created by it is likely to run and spread and create a wide interest to hear the remainder of the course. These lectures are given at the Club's expense and are free to the public. The next one will be given April 11. </p>
                  <p>Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, editor of the Illinois department of the WOMAN'S ERA and secretary of the Illinois Woman's Alliance, is expected to deliver a series of lectures in New England in April. </p>
                  <p>The March literary meeting of the Woman's Era Club was in charge of the Committee on Manners and Morals, Miss Eliza Gardner, chairman. </p>

                  <p>Two well prepared papers were read, one by Mrs. Agnes Adams on "Our Needs," and the other by Mrs. Alice Casneau on "Morals and Manners."  As a result of suggestions made by Mrs. Casneau, the following resolution was adopted by the Club:</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, The Woman's Era Club having had their attention called to the very common practice of putting tickets in the hands of children to be sold for the benefit of different objects, do herewith </p>
                  <p>RESOLVE, That inasmuch as the custom of permitting young girls to solicit men to buy tickets from them is damaging to modesty and a menace to morality, we do set the seal of our condemnation upon it, and call upon the church people especially to help us abolish the custom.</p>
                  <p>The Club then listened to an interesting narration by its president, who went as a delegate to the Triennial Council of Women at Washington, and then farther south on a visit to Women's clubs in that section. The president reported that she had returned with h<gap agent="tape" extent="6 characters"/>th and enthusiasm in and for our women burning more brightly than ever. Her stay was short, <gap agent="tape" extent="3 characters"/> long enough to show her that the women of the south-land are as active in trying to "help make the world bet-

ter" as their sister-women elsewhere; and proving that, wherever she may be, north or south, in friendly or unfriendly surroundings, the woman who is determined to do and be makes her own conditions.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mary S. Ransome, vice president, and Mrs. Hannah Smith, financial secretary of the Era Club, represented their Club at the last reception given by the Cantibridgia of Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>The Club membership grows steadily, showing that the feeling among women, that they cannot afford to miss the opportunity this organization gives to help and be helped, is increasing.</p>
                  <p>The regular literary meeting and high tea of the New England Women's Press Association was held at the Parker House Wednesday, March 20, at four o'clock. Mrs. Kate Tannatt Wood of Salem gave her new lecture, "War Days in and out of Camp." Mrs. Elizabeth M. Goss contributed most interesting reminiscences of days spent in Fort Warren. Miss Ednorah Nahar recited "Bivouac Fires," and Miss Laura Frances Eaton of Detroit sang in the afternoon programme. The after-supper programme included speeches on different topics by Mrs. Sara White Lee, Regent of Daughters of Revolution, Mrs. D. H. Crain and Marie Robinson Wright, of Georgia, and music.</p>

                  <p>Publicly parading the faults of the negro may be good policy for our leading journalists to adopt, but the benefit to be derived from it is not clear to me. Mr. T. Thomas Fortune, who easily heads the list of our newspaper men, has recently criticized the race with which he is identified for whining. This tendency to <hi rend="italic"> whine </hi> and not seize the opportunity within reach is cited as a special weakness of the colored people of this country. Of course, this criticism, made by so intelligent a representative as Mr. Fortune, has been widely copied by white newspapers, which have rolled it like a sweet morsel under their tongues, and have indulged in a perfect love feast of praise of the <hi rend="italic"> Age's </hi> editor. They have shaken their wise but guilty heads, declaring, "We told you so. You don't need any more rights and opportunities. You don't use those already in your possession. You consume too much time whining, for one of your own, who ought to know, says so." But the negro is by no means a chronic whiner, and his record in this country will prove that he is not. His progress in the face of all but insurmountable obstacles, of which he has hardly complained at all, has been a miracle from the day he was freed, without a place to lay his head and a penny to buy bread, till the present moment. If he has had one fault more glaring than another, it has been his long-suffering patience with an injustice and a barbarity which should bring a blush of shame to the cheek of even the unspeakable Turk. The trouble is, he does not complain enough to show how the iron has entered his soul. Everything, and I had almost said everybody, has opposed the progress of the negro in this country, the very heavens have been brass above him, and yet he has poured forth no loud lamentations bemoaning his fate, as Mr. Fortune would have us believe. Occasionally some of the more intelligent of the race have lifted their voices manfully against the injustice everywhere prevalent, but the rank and file have patiently toiled and silently suffered. If Mr. Fortune found many opportunities in the South of which the negro doesn't avail himself, he should put them on the market immediately. My observation in and of the South teaches me that opportunities for the negro do not run loose for any great length of time before they are captured and utilized. The prosperity of the average colored Southerner who has had any chance at all proves this beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p>
                  <p>Considering how great the injustice practiced by Americans against the negro, and recalling how he has patiently plodded along, with scarcely a word of complaint or reproach for his oppressors, a fair-minded person must conclude that the charge of chronic whining brought by Mr. Fortune against him seems as cruel as it is unwarranted.</p>
                  <p>But even if the negro were a constitutional whiner or had an organic weakness of any other nature, what possible good accrues from the merci-

less fault finding and sweeping accusations in which some of our leading journalists indulge? If one member of a family have a little more of the old Adam in him than his share, is it not almost treacherous for his relatives to talk about his peccadilloes where they will reach the greatest number of ears? Let us say more about the good qualities of the negro, particularly where it is likely to be heard by those who are only too willing to believe the evil reports of us. The majority of white Americans have an eye single to the vices of the negro and are hopelessly blind to his many virtues. No sane person would advocate wholesale eulogies of the negro, but before making sweeping denunciations of him in print, it might be well to reflect upon the trials and tribulations to which a dog with a bad name is always subjected.</p>
                  <p>The author of the article on whining negros has produced much that is better and worthier of him, but I doubt that he has received so many encomiums for any of his other contributions, or has been so affectionately patted on the back by his white confreres as he has for this criticism. Such attacks upon the negro are just what the average Anglo-Saxon editor likes, and he considers them great finds, over which he gloats in the most ghoulish glee.</p>

                  <p>Though somewhat late, I cannot refrain from wanting to join the universal chorus of praise and sorrow uttered over the life and death of our greatest man and friend, Frederick Douglass. Like so many readers of the ERA, I sustained a personal relationship to Mr. Douglass that will remain always as an inspiration and grateful remembrance. But without intruding myself and my own personal emotions, I feel like blessing Mr. Douglass' name forever because of his always honorable and chivalric regard for womankind. His belief in women was never qualified by a disparaging "if." His own love of liberty was so full and cordial that he could tolerate no limitations based  on sex lines. Liberty to be all that poor human nature can be in its aspirations for perfection was one of Mr. Douglass' cardinal sentiments. But this sentiment could have no value or inspiration from him if it stopped short of womankind. In this largeness of spirit and thought, Mr. Douglass was always as ardent in his plea for suffrage for women as he was in his mighty pleadings for manhood suffrage.</p>
                  <p>No eminent American commanding the forces of public opinion had a better opportunity of knowing the worth of women by the exacting tests of great principles and high sentiments than Mr. Douglass.  In his magnificent struggle to emancipate himself and others from all the degrading forces of a hated past, Mr. Douglass trusted the friendship and honored the counsels of women. In all of his romantic experiences he found the women steadfast to the cause of justice, beautifully sensitive to honor, and resistless in their hold upon the heartstrings of public opinion. The singular purity of his motives meant always the exaltation of women, and their soulful sympathy and love or justice meant to him a deeper sense of honor and courage.</p>
                  <p>But in his high regard for women, there was in Mr. Douglass no lack of susceptibility to the mystic charms and gaiety of feminine nature. His was a poetic spirit, and the poetry of womankind was to him as joyous and inspiring as it was to the soul of the impressionable Goethe. Woman's beauty, woman's affection, woman's piquancy and charm were to him the very soul and music of life, and in his capacity for enjoyment of women's society he found continuous youthfulness. Thus it was that Mr. Douglass breathed and lived in a purer social atmosphere than most of his associates in the stern cause of freedom.</p>
                  <p>He so lived not only that men might be free and equal and exalted, but that women, too, by the same emancipating forces, might come equally into the estate of freedom. His life was a compliment to women. His eloquence in behalf of women's rights to the equalities of citizenship is a lasting justification of women's claims and contentions for perfect liberty.</p>
                  <p>By right of his manly confidence in woman, by right of his contribution to the forces that tend to the greater freedom and equality of men and women, by right of his high conceptions of honor in the relationships of men and women, Mr. Douglass was easily the strongest and best friend American women ever had among the great men of the republic.</p>

                  <p>The history of progressive women in this country cannot be written without grateful acknowledgement to the helpful and inspiring influences of the incomparable friend of all humanity, Frederick Douglass.</p>

                  <p>We are glad to note in the Methodist Conference, now in session in our city, a disposition to recognize the claims of the women of the church. The right has been conceded them to vote for delegates to represent
the several churches, and it will be only a question of time before women will take their places as lay delegates to the conference.</p>
                  <p>In days of yore it was decided that "taxation without representation was tyranny;" yet, although women are the major part of every congregation, and are the figurative, nay <hi rend="italic"> literal </hi> right-hand men of the clergy, although they are more conscientious about their religious obligations and more helpful in adding to the revenues of the church. When the crucial time comes, when there is a question as to legislation or expenditure, then the men arise in their majesty and relegate the women to the task of remembering what St. Paul said, "Let the women keep silence."  In his Epistle to the Corinthians, St. Paul goes on to instruct the women, "If they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home."  The most active and efficient women in our churches are widows and single women. These women have the leisure to be Sunday school teachers, Bible readers, missionary and church guild workers.</p>
                  <p>The mere fact of sex decides nothing as to mental power. We are all acquainted with families where all the masculine attributes of invention, energy and execution have been absorbed by the girls. The sons have been weak, ineffective, and without ambition. Put those strong women in a church or any organization, and they stand out in strong relief against the background of mediocre men and women. Able, strong, original, highly individualized people do not form the majority in any community. In school, in church, in club life, in society they are easily discerned. They create an atmosphere which environs us. We absorb it, it becomes a part of us, and inspiration and expansion enough are given us to make practical the ideas that genius is often too impatient to elaborate. Let good gray matter rule in whatever shape it is found, and let the women write their declaration of independence.</p>
                  <p>You will be glad to know that our city has in its employ about ten successful colored kindergarteners. The kindergarten is regularly incorporated in our public school system as a sub-primary division. Conspicuous ability has been shown by these trained women, and they have often been commended  by the superintendent.</p>
                  <p>Miss Malinda Amos of the O.V. Catto School was selected to give an illustration of her methods with a class of children, at a general exhibition of school work from every section of our city.</p>
                  <p>Miss M. Inez Cassey has had remarkable success in a quarter of the city where great difficulties had to be overcome. Her kindergarten is an <hi rend="italic"> omnium gatherum </hi> of negroes, Russian Jews, Italians, etc., etc. Her musical knowledge, her sunny and sympathetic temperament make her particularly suited for the work. In conjunction with Miss Cassey is Miss Florence Cozzins, a very able and successful teacher.</p>
                  <p>I would like to tell you in detail of the work of each of these teachers, for each has something distinctive and meritorious, but space forbids.</p>
                  <p>One thing I must observe in passing. In each of these child gardens little white snowdrops bloom in profusion. I mean that there seems to be no objection to a colored woman teaching white infants; but in no case has a colored woman been appointed to teach in a mixed school of higher grade.</p>
                  <p>It is my pleasant duty to tell the publishers of the ERA of the many expressions of commendation  for the paper that have reached  me.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Reuben Armstrong, wife of' a prominent clergyman of Harrisburg, writes that she feels the paper is doing a noble work for women, and that she intends to do all in her power to extend its circulation in Harrisburg. That is showing her appreciation in a very practical way. A well-established paper, with a year's successful work behind it, is a good hostage for the future. If all the fond hopes are realized it is cheering to think of the vistas of usefulness that open up before it.</p>

                  <p>"Daring is a wondrous thing." Perhaps if I were a preacher I would call that a text; but this is not a sermon, so it can be but a headline. Daring is not only a wondrous, but a beauteous thing; and to behold an element of this sort of beauty in one is enough to inspire the onlooker with a sort of awe, not unmixed with a wholesale determination to do noble deeds. Perhaps that is why the American people can do so many unheard-of things that require especial strength and keenness and perception. They have always before them the example of a down-stamped people, daring to rise and rise again, to emulate and strive and be something. It's a superb sight, this magnificent abandonment of all lesser interests, or merging them into one; these strong, straight, swift-from-the-shoulder blows that this scarce-tamed animal front the dusky region gives, magnificent, even if he is made to bite the dust often.  He dares.</p>
                  <p>The memorial services, held in honor of the grandest of grand men, Frederick Douglass, by the Phyllis Wheatley Woman's Club, will long be remembered. Of course there had been memorial services and memorial services piled up in honor of the champion of our people , but there had been none like this, where everything, even down to the pumping of the organ and the ushering of the audience, was done by women. On the 20th of February, when the club was in session, Frederick Douglass died; and just one month later, on the 20th of March, the club met once more, but to commemorate that death, in Central Church. Mrs. Gates' invocation, some asserted, wickedly, perhaps, was far ahead of the praying of some of our best divines. The choir was composed entirely of women, members of the club, accompanied on the organ by Mrs. Alice Clark, and on the violins by Miss Julia Lewis and Emma Rose Williams. Miss A. R. Moore read a poem  "In Memoriam" on Douglass' death, and there were other things. A selection from one of his books by Miss Valena McArthur, a contralto solo by Miss Leontine Vignes, a soprano solo, "Calvary," by Miss Julia Lewis, the resolutions, drawn up by Miss Kennedy, and read by Miss Rosa Fleming, a solo by Miss Arabella B. Kennedy, and the doxology. All were especially good, and no one could have failed to be impressed with the general excellence of all. But--the gem, the masterpiece of the evening was the magnificent eulogy by Miss Bibb. From the moment she stepped upon the pulpit, and with her clear, ringing, sonorous voice began her opening sentence, to the climax of "The Greeks had their Alexander, the Romans their Caesar, the French their Napoleon, the English their Cromwell, the Americans their Washington--and the Negroes their Douglass!" when the enthusiasm of the assembly broke loose, Miss Bibb held her audience enthralled. And when she had finished, everyone felt that, with one oratorical bound, she had leaped into great distinction.</p>
                  <p>The case of Lent Brown, the young negro who shot two white fellows lately in self-defence, is attracting considerable attention.  Lists are being circulated to collect money to fight his case, to put in a strong plea in his behalf. It seems hard, incredible, cruel, to be tried, convicted and perhaps hung or imprisoned, because one was quick enough  to prevent being shot or stabbed.  So the women have taken the matter in their hands and are working earnestly.</p>
                  <p>Lent is nearly over, and the season of enforced rest turned out to be not such a rest after all, for the busy ones found they had more than enough to do in catching up with things left undone in the hurry and skurry of the season's busy time. So the rush continues, and there is only the two months' rest in the summer to look forward to for anything like "surfeit from daily cares."</p>

                     <p>Our teachers, in many cases, have to be both parent and instructor.  The children they deal with must be taught that order is necessary to success in any walk in life. They must have explained to them, for the first time, their duty to themselves and their neighbor.  They must be made to know when they merit praise and when they deserve censure.</p>
                     <p>A pretty fair conception of the relation between right and wrong will enable the wrong-doers among the pupils to bear punishment with becom-
<pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ing grace, and to respect the teacher all the more, because she is just.</p>
                     <p>In all our dealing with children, let us be just; let us be earnest. They are quick to see and quick to appreciate. All of us know that the teacher whom the bad boy remembers with his highest regard, is the one who tried to have him do right for the sake of right, and who, in all her trying, was just and firm. The teacher who did her whole duty was the one who made the greatest impression upon him, and whose advice recurs to him when temptations come and trials invade.</p>
                     <p>Hundreds of opportunities to build character present themselves in the schoolroom. Do not say no, because it is easier than to say yes. I once heard the venerable Dr. Crummell of Washington D. C., say that it often strengthens a man to say <hi rend="italic">no</hi> to him. This came to my mind one day in the classroom, when a young man of twenty made a request. To have granted the request would not have done him any particular harm, but it would have set a bad precedent  for fifty other students in the room.  My reply was, "No." The young man was startled. He attempted to argue the case.  I only shook my head and said more firmly, "It cannot be." He went to his seat in a fit of anger. A quick temper was one of his weaknesses. Several times I was on the point of relenting, but my good angel came to my rescue.</p>
                     <p>Several weeks after that, when the class was reciting, some one remarked that it is often hard for one to do his duty and that it is even harder sometimes to say <hi rend="italic">no</hi>.  I gave them Dr. Crummell's opinion. The young man whose request had been denied, turned his head quickly from side to side several times, threw one leg over the other, and with a smile, said in an earnest tone,  "That is a fact, Mrs. Williams.  It helped me once, and not very long ago either." His very manner told what the occasion was, and I was glad that I had been firm.</p>
                     <p>But let us turn to the inattention that gives so much annoyance!  Having, in his measure, quieted the noise and obtained the co-operation and obedience of our pupils, how are we to prevent the absent-mindedness that takes possession of a child, now and again, when most unexpected and least desired?</p>
                     <p>The end so desirable must be a matter of time. Interest in work and cheeriness of spirit pave the way for it. Steady application to work maintained from time to time, will, at least, grow into habit, and "Habit", you know, "is second nature."</p>
                     <p>All this seems easy to do, but knowing and doing are two different things. The teacher finds boys and girls saucy and quarrelsome, noisy and idle. She has been told that she must be kind and gentle, that she must appeal to the higher natures of her pupils. She attempts to be kind and is laughed at. She appeals to their higher natures only to find herself like the people of old who cried unto Baal.</p>
                     <p>Still the noise goes on. How can she conduct a class in arithmetic, meanwhile ejaculating, "John, put up that knife. Willie, stop whistling. Mary, it is not polite to kick anybody. Get up from the floor, Bobbie. Ella, how can you expect to get a lesson and sing at the same time? Who threw those matches on the floor?" From the back of the room a voice cries out "O-u-c-h !" followed by "Make Jim Brown stop pinching me!  If you don't I'll hurt him!"  Then Jim Brown attempts to tell his side of the case, while sixty other grinning little mortals swing their feet and make confusion worse confounded.</p>
                     <p>Some say that the teacher should call upon the parents and let them know how their children act.  This certainly would be a capital way to shift the responsibility, if one only was sure that the parents were able and willing to administer correction the result of which would reach the schoolroom.</p>

                  <p>The lower branch of the Colorado Legislature has passed the bill for raising the age of protection for girls to twenty-one. This was done at the instance of Representative Carrie Clyde Holly. The bill now waits the action of the Senate to become a law. There is no woman member of Senate.</p>
                  <p>The Boston <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> pays this tribute to the Colorado Legislature: "A review of the services rendered by the three women members of the Colorado Legislature leads to the conclusion that they have proved themselves level-headed, not too  self-assertive, not cranky or over-emotional, and altogether creditable representatives of the people.  Moreover, their demeanor throughout the session was marked by the utmost propriety, and they were treated with uniform courtesy by their fellow-members. Whatever may be thought of woman suffrage, the woman legislator appears to be a success in Colorado."</p>

                  <p>The recent visit of the Massachusetts Legislative Committee  to the southern states seems to have been unfortunate in its disclosures of the innate smallness of those chiefly concerned.   From the beginning, when the probabilities were "all talked over," to the contemptible ending, it is a record of hypocrisy on the one side, servility on the other. That which we all hope is the closing act in the nauseating affair, discloses the governor of Virginia appeasing an enraged constituency by affirming on the honor of a southern gentleman his embarrassment and disgust at having been forced to play the host to a colored guest; and affirming also that the northern committee openly expressed its annoyance at the presence of its colored associate.</p>
                  <p>In Massachusetts that same committee is trying to satisfy the better element of the state by declaring, in suave resolutions, that it found the company of the colored member more than acceptable--positively agreeable--a sentiment in which the member himself seems to have concurred. And Mr. Teamoh himself, fresh from the insult to his state, to his race, to his manhood, declares himself perfectly satisfied.</p>
                  <p>So contemptible does the whole thing appear, that if the actors had stood for themselves alone, it could never have risen to the level of public criticism and condemnation. But the good name of the state has been defamed by its apostate representatives, and the self-respect of the whole colored people has been wounded by Mr. Teamoh's servile compliance with the humiliation of the visit.</p>
                  <p>For him we can conceive of no defence. The attempted justification of the <hi rend="italic">Boston Herald</hi> seems to us hardly plausible. It calls Mr. Teamoh's course that of a gentleman. But a gentleman does not sacrifice manhood, even upon the altar of good manners. True, he does not  force privileges from others, but on the other hand he does not yield passively a single jot of that which is due to him.</p>
                  <p>It was then the time for Mr. Teamoh to protest, not with noisy assertion of equality, but with the uncompromising dignity of the intimately self-respecting man. The attitude of Mr. Teamoh was exactly that which no gentleman <hi rend="italic">could</hi> assume. Undoubtedly the colored people were most unfortunate in the personality of their representative.</p>
                  <p>We who are fortunate enough to belong to Massachusetts, we who love her, we who are proud of her traditions and who know that she makes no idle boast when she claims to have always kept in the vanguard of moral progression -- we feel a hot resentment that a few time-servers have made it possible to include her dear name in the list of apologists for southern injustice. We are thankful that one, at least, of her statesmen has declared that Massachusetts' principles are still dearer to her than her dollars.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>The views of certain representative (?) colored men at the south are being much quoted as expressive of the real feeling of colored  people in regard to southern social conditions. But it is not too much to affirm that, under existing circumstances at the south, the public expression of colored men is worth as evidence about as much as the testimony of an accused man under torture.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>The recent episode may be appropriately named, "The Passing of Mr. Teamoh."</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>There is a growing class of our people who doubt the wisdom in starting any enterprise along race lines; there are those who withhold their support from the ERA because they do not believe in "colored papers." Right here let it be said that the ERA is not "colored." It is a paper whose managers and editors are colored, but the paper is open to all, and hopes and expects in time to employ writers who are the best of their kind, whether such writers are black or white.</p>
                  <p>We do not believe in accentuating race lines, but we do believe in being more accurately represented than we are or ever can be in any paper that has no colored man or woman on its editorial staff. Colored reporters, space writers or special contributors can do nothing towards making the sentiment of a paper; and since it is a far cry to
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
a colored editor on the staff of any white paper, we think it the height of absurdity to discourage so-called colored papers while waiting for the millenium. The need of our better representation through the press grows stronger every year and even more pathetic; while our growth intellectually and financially is opening many ways to us; yet that same growth is bringing us into relations not before contemplated by the other race, which consequently is resenting the intrusion. In many respects our situation grows worse instead of better. So long as this is the case, so long as we all suffer together, just so long must we all work together to bring about a different state of affairs.</p>
                  <p>Thousands of colored women subscribe for the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Home Journal</hi>; hundreds of colored women are active workers in getting subscribers; and yet its editor tells Mrs. Mossell that he can not accept contributions to the columns of his paper from women known to be colored for fear of antagonizing his southern white subscribers.  Think of this, you colored women whose dollars and efforts are going that this man may live in princely style; think of your money going to support in luxury the writers of that paper, while you hesitate to give ten cents toward the encouragement of writers of your own race! O, the pity of it!</p>
                  <p>How useless to be continually hoping that others are going to do more for us than we will do for ourselves.</p>
                  <p>God speed the day when there will be no color in newspapers, when the <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Planet</hi>and the ERA will all be employing white as well as black. In the meantime, let us not be content with being served up as others choose. We are about old enough to speak for ourselves.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Atlanta Commercial</hi> says that "Massachusetts deserves to be insulted" in the Teamoh incident. It also scorns the papers which place the prefix "Mr." before the name of any negro, and closes its editorial by saying that any committee of white men that will serve with a negro are as bad as the negro, and that Gov. O'Ferrall should have turned the whole committee out of doors.</p>
                  <p>We refer northern sympathizers of the south to this editorial and then to the remarks of Governor Greenhalge of Massachusetts at the dinner of the republican legislators. He, the governor, referred forcibly to the significance of the oath taken by members to support the constitution, and declared with eloquent fervor that when Massachusetts sends her representatives beyond her borders, she asks for them no special amenities and she has no concern for social privileges.</p>
                  <p>In the broad spirit of the constitution of the United States, he said, she sends out her representatives, and while asking nothing of any state or individual, she demands that to her official representatives every right guaranteed by the constitution she ratified be accorded.</p>
                  <p> "She is not concerned in the unofficial utterance of an official," continued the governor, "especially those made  in a sort of ex-post facto way.  Massachusetts never asked more than the constitution, and her character of liberty demands and Massachusetts will accept no less.  She can not afford to diminish the power of the principles gained by the blood of her bravest and best."</p>

                  <p>A GLIMPSE OF CALIFORNIA MISSIONS.</p>
                  <p>The story of the missions of California is but the story of the dawn of civilization on the Pacific Coast, (therefore no pretense of originality is offered in the paper).   Those crumbling walls of stone and adobe, stately in their desolation, are the ruins of San Juan Capistrano, La Soledad, or some other of the missions in the heart of some sleepy Mexican town, where once flourished beautiful gardens and flowering orchards, where sparkled and fell in cadence soft fountains, when the <hi rend="italic">padres'</hi> word was law, and the savage Indians were initiated in the mysteries of the immortality of the soul under the signia of the cross. Stand within those vines when Luna's soft light changes and subdues the effects of devastation and time, wrapt in this mystifying light, something of the original and sublime influences of other days charms you; you look and see the hooded  monks walking, reading prayers in the mission gardens, you hear the Indians devoutly chanting an "Ave Maria," when the "Angelus" rippled over the eve of the missions content; or if nearing St. Gabriel (perhaps in the best state of preservation of any of the missions at this

time) you hear the bells call to prayers as they did an hundred years ago--listen attentively, they ring out the history of the life work of <hi rend="italic">padres</hi> Sena, Crespi, who with other zealous priests labored nobly and did grandly in the work of the church and humanity. About one hundred and fifty years after the explorations of Cabrillo, on the mysterious coast of Upper California, (where he discovered the beautiful bay which be called San Mignel, later named San Diego, by Vizcanio) the hope of the religious zealots was realized. For years their prayers had been unheeded by Spain, until political influences threatened to invade Alta California, then lethargic Spain aroused, and the decree to occupy and establish forts was given. Military posts were ordered established at San Diego and Monterey. Military control was vested in Jose De Galves, the most efficient officer of Spain, and prime favorite of Carlos III. Galves favored combining with military, religious influences and called <hi rend="italic">padre</hi>Junipero Sena into consultation. Sena's hope and zeal, intensified by years of waiting, hurried to meet the energetic Galves. Between the two it was decided the old Jesuit regime should be the method of establishing the new missions, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, that the old missions should create new ones, by giving such church property as bells, vestments, ornaments, also grain, implements and live stock of such quantity as could be spared. The church furnishings were considered gifts, but the other donations regarded as loans, to be repaid when prosperity of the new missions would permit. Jan. 9, 1796, the land and sea expeditions, blessed by <hi rend="italic">padre</hi>Sena, started out. Sena could not accompany either of them, on account of an ulcerous sore foot, caused by a journey made on foot through Mexico months before. Being possessed of great religious zeal and indomitable will, he started out in March; the fervor of his zeal overcame the anguish of his pain, so that he journeyed on from mission to mission, until, early in May he overtook one of the land expeditions, enduring many hardships and perils. The 16th day of July, 1769, the mission of San Diego de Alcala was founded. The crusaders assembled at the site selected for the <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>, bells were swung over the forest tree, which were rung by willing hands; "the waters were blessed, the cross raised, the royal standard thrown to the breeze, the 'Veni Creator' rang out clearly on the virgin air."</p>
                  <p>Thus was the country taken in the name of God and the king.  The savages gathered around in awe and astonishment--according to Vizcaino, a totally low and depraved people, no orators and few warriors among them--the women in short skirts of braided rabbit skins, trimmed with gaudy beads, faces smeared with colored mud, the men without even the traditional fig leaf. The first duty of the missionaries was to nurse and restore the sick to health, then the indomitable Sena began the study of the native pagan, while the soldiers erected suitable buildings for the <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>. Thus was sown the first seeds of Christianity and civilization in this work. The missions were prosperous, the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>loved and cared for the neophytes as their own children.</p>

                  <byline>Sada J. Anderson, Editor.</byline>
                  <p>One evening last week when I was not near so weary of well (?) doing as I am now, a friend and I were discussing the worth that woman has been to the world metrically, or what she has done in poetry and song. We decided that she had been of such great value that it would be nothing amiss to give a few thoughts concerning her metrical life to the ERA. Leaving out entirely those who have given volumes of solacing lines to the public, we speak principally of those who have given us pearls which have never been placed in a casket; yet lines which serve to make the woof of life the more beautiful are uttered and often sung without a thought of the author.</p>
                  <p>In journalism woman has been struggling for the last four hundred years against surmountable and insurmountable obstacles, until at last she has set sail, and her voyage on the journalistic sea seems to be peaceful and is successful. In church and state she has been an indispensable factor.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Norton, seemingly longing for praise of our fortitude, breaks forth petulantly,</p>
                  <lg type="stanza">
                     <l n="1">"Warriors and statesmen have their need of praise,</l>
                     <l>And what they do and suffer men record; </l>
                     <l>But the long suffering of woman's days</l>
                     <l>Passes without a thought, without a word."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>But Mrs. Adams comes to her with words of comfort, solacing words that have healed the wounded heart of many a weary one. What soul would not feel lifted up to the very gates while singing her "Nearer my God to Thee"? E'en though a cross raise us we are quite content to be nearer.</p>
                  <p>Again the curtains of heaven seem to be pinned back by the stars to let the drops fall for which Mrs. Codner asks for so plaintively in that supplicative air, "Let some drops now fall on me."</p>
                  <p>With all due courtesy to the Wesleys, Montgomery, Newton, Watts, Bonar, and many others whose names are household words, we fear that such women as Mrs. Adams, Codner, Phillips, Thrupp, Prentiss, and many others, have given us lyrics which will go with us beyond and be sung forever and ever. It is hard to determine which conveys greater comfort to our hearts, Robinson's "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing," or Mrs. Prentiss' "More Love to Thee," or Mrs. Brown's "I love to steal awhile away." Horatius Bonar breaks forth in praise to our God, and pours his soul out in "What a friend we have in Jesus," while Mrs. Bonar apparently joins him in her beautiful lines, "Fade, fade each earthly joy, Jesus is mine." A careful search of the songs of the church will reveal the fact that with but few exceptions no lines thrill our souls and cause the very heartstrings to vibrate as "Nearer my God to Thee," "I need Thee Every Hour," and "I Love to Tell the Story."</p>
                  <p>Not only in church has woman given us metrical food for reflection. If you would ask the question as to which song gives most satisfaction in church and state, perhaps the reply would be "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," by Julia Ward Howe. 'Tis true Payne gave us the song of all songs, "Home, Sweet Home." The presence of a woman in that home is the true poetry of the lines.</p>
                  <p>There are lines which have been consecrated with the tears and laughter of the last half century without a thought of the one whose fertile brain gave them to us. The metrical worth of woman will serve to help refine and ennoble the taste of the young. Luther said that next to theology he gave music the highest place and greatest honor.</p>
                  <p>There is one of us whose lines have had their day, yet live. One whose heart, under the most adverse circumstances, poured forth strains which the most benighted soul could, if hearing, understand, because she was one of them. One who had the genius to so weave her verses that they drew warm words of praise and encouragement from the immortal Washington. And today, in the same courts of praise and song eternal, dwell the two--George Washington and Phillis Wheatley.</p>
                  <p>The women of the Dicken's club were delighted with their introduction to the ERA. We bespeak a wide circulation for the paper through this club.</p>
                  <p>The Tennyson's were called upon to part with their noble president, Mrs. Eudora Bell Duncan, whose good works were silenced last Saturday evening by the hand of death. She was the daughter of J. Madison Bell, our representative poet at the World's Congress of Religions. The stroke is a heavy one to the Tennysons, the Henrietta Mental Culture Society, and the Golden Rule Circle of King's Daughters, for she was an energetic laborer with them. Together with her relatives, hosts of friends in St. Louis, Chicago and Detroit mourn the loss of one so affable, so noble and good. Mrs. Henans tells us that,</p>
                  <lg type="stanza">
                     <l n="1">Leaves have their time to fall,</l>
                     <l>And flowers to wither at the north wind's breath, </l>
                     <l>And stars to set--but all,</l>
                     <l>Thou hast all seasons for thine own, oh Death!</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>We were all very much delighted to meet Bishop Arnett, who gave us such an inspiring lecture at Warren Chapel. He is one of our jewels whose very presence gives us inspiration and whose words take us beyond ourselves. Such visits are rare, yet so beneficial that we are wont to say linger longer with us, Bishop.</p>

                  <p>Every woman who is a friend to her sex, a friend to her race, should manifest an interest in the ERA'S welfare; not merely a verbal interest, for words of themselves are lame vehicles upon which to build success, but an energetic, wide-awake, hands-in-the-purse interest. There is some element in the make up of our race pride wanting, else we would not manifest so little concern in the enterprises of <hi rend="italic">our people</hi>. Yes, in the language of our good old Southern aunties, "dar's a screw loose somewhars," or we would not indifferently let every undertaking of our race "go to the wall" for want of a little pecuniary assistance.</p>
                  <p>Club life has a growing popularity in Knoxville
<pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
and already plays no minor part in the social world of today.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Mutual Improvement Club held its regular meeting at Mrs. Orlena Lee's, Nelson street, on the third Friday of March. An interesting feature of this meeting was the reading of a paper by Mrs. A. B. Murphy, who, in her ever easy manner, told of Booker T. Washington's great educational efforts towards ameliorating the benighted condition of the race in Alabama. Mrs. Alexander Davis will entertain the club at its next meeting, April 5th.</p>

                  <p>The social horoscope shows: "An Old-fashioned Spelling Bee," conceived and carried out by several Shiloh Presbyterian ladies. The contestants will show an array of Knoxville ministers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. A prize will be awarded the tenacious individual who until the last resists being spelled down.  Proceeds for the pastor, Rev. J. R. Riley, Go.</p>
                  <p>Two probable weddings in the near future.</p>
                  <p>A novel entertainment under the direction of The W.M.I.C.</p>
                  <p>It is said: That a hitherto unwary fish, whose shyness to nibble the bait long held out to him has been remarked upon, has at last been towed in by a persistent angler, "fair and most divinely tall."</p>
                  <p>That three prominent churches of this town will, ere the "robins nest again," give in marriage their spiritual leaders.</p>
                  <p>That Flora Batson, at a recent performance, found a place in the hearts of our people by the side of Selika.</p>
                  <p>By some of both races, who attended the Batson Conceits, and who, by-the-way, are fair judges of musical ability, that our own little song bird, Miss Anna Prosser, need not feel ashamed of herself in any music-loving audience.</p>

                  <p>Boston</p>
                  <p>A letter from Texas, just arrived, brings the welcome news to the many friends of Miss Cuney in Boston that the health of her mother is improving right along. She is, however, obliged to still remain in San Antonio, and her physicians say in order to get well she must live out of Galveston. Hon. J. Wright Cuney, who has persistently declined to allow his name to be used for state senator, seems to be the only man the Republicans deem available for the place. A Texas morning paper says "The Republicans say, we will nominate him whether he accepts or not."</p>
                  <p>Episcopalians are considering the advisability of establishing a church at Houston, with Thomas W. Cain as rector.</p>
                  <p>Miss Hallie Q. Brown, who is lecturing, reading and singing in England in the interest of Wilberforce University, to help found a Frederick Douglass library in that institution, is receiving warm commendation from our English friends for her talent, her charming personality and her glorious voice, a combination that cannot fail to bring a good return in dollars to the work she is so ably presenting.</p>
                  <p>Rev. John G. Mitchell, president of the same college, is in New England, working up an interest here in that valuable old institution.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Joseph Lee, proprietor of the Woodland Park Hotel, is winning fresh distinctions in a new field, as an inventor. He has now two devices on the market, a bread-maker and a bread-crumber. The bread-making machine has been in use in his own hotel for some time, and has made the Woodland Park bread so famous that it is in great demand by bakers and hotel keepers in this vicinity. The crumber is being rapidly introduced into the leading hotels of the country. There is no reason why they should not bring him fortune as well as fame.</p>
                  <p>Miss Miriam Benjamin has composed a march which is now upon the market, the "Boston Elite Quickstep." It has been played by Sousa's band, and is published by Ross of West street, this city. The publisher is so well pleased with it that he offers to take any future work of Miss Benjamin. By the way, the author is published as E. B. Miriam.</p>
                  <p>The coffee party, for the benefit of the Home for Aged Colored Women, was a decided success in

every way. It was projected and given by Miss Stewart, assisted by the following committee of ladies:  Mrs. M. S. Ransome, Mrs. Rachel Only, Mrs. Charles Mainjoy, Mrs. W. W. Brown, Mrs. M. P. Brown and Mrs. L. Pope. The amount netted was something over thirty dollars. This is to be united with another small fund now held in trust as a nucleus for a fund to be used for some permanent specific plan for helping along the good work of the Home. The president of the Era Club, who holds the old fund, and Miss Stewart, one of the secretaries of the same club, have been invited to a conference with the managers of the Home to consider how to make a small amount of money return the greatest amount of good to the Home, and the blessing to those who unselfishly work for it.</p>
                  <p>The annual fair for the Home opened most auspiciously Saturday, March 23, at the new, commodious and elegant house of Dr. Ayer, on the water side of Beacon street. The central table, containing the work of the inmates of the Home solely, was presided over by Mrs. Smith, the matron, Mrs. Mary Howard, and Miss Eliza Gardner. Other tables, containing fancy work, exquisite home-made cakes and candies, art collections and books, were cared for by the managers, assisted by gracious and pretty girls. The fair was held here but one day, and re-opened at the Home on Myrtle street Tuesday, the 26th, and continued through the week.</p>
                  <p>Miss Gibbs, the director of the Eckstein Norton Conservatory, who has spent some time concerting in Boston and neighboring cities, returned last week to fill engagements in Cambridge, West Newton, Taunton and Boston. She is securing funds to erect a building for the Eckstein Norton University, an industrial school at Cane Spring, Ky. Since the fire of 1893, enrollment has so increased as to necessitate a new building. Her last concert in the east will be at Park Street Church, corner Tremont and Park streets, May 2, assisted by Prof. F. M. Davis of Boston Training School, Mr. E. T. Mingles of Boston Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Sidney Woodward, tenor, and Miss C. N. Allen, soprano.</p>
                  <p>The W. E. C. calendar is out. It gives dates of spring term classes, lectures, meetings, etc.  The constitution (amended) with rules for the governing of the Club is now in the hands of the committee, and will shortly be printed and issued.</p>

                  <p>Ye Gods! the golden monogramed, beautifully engraved invitations of the much discussed subscription ball for Wednesday, April 17, under the management of our swell bachelors are out!</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Dear, Trifles thin as air," you know, but who, oh who has been included! And the others--shades of a thousand Othellos defend us!--when they know who is of the elect and who is not. The patronesses, as will be seen, represent the most prominent ladies of the inner circle of society's exclusive and smart set: Mrs. Elizabeth D. White, Mrs. Frank Carmand, Mrs. Daniel Brooks, Mrs. John Gale, Mrs. Cordelia Attwell, Mrs. James W. Mars, Mrs. Peter W. Downing, Mrs. William H. Smith, Mrs. Edward Barefield, Mrs. Theophilus Fisher, Mrs. Charles A. Dorsey.</p>
                  <p>The handsome wrangler gave in very gracefully at the last meeting of the Bachelors when Our Rob was denominated McAllister.</p>
                  <p>The Confirmation Class at St. Philips was unusually large, the service beautiful and impressive, the floral decorations, as usual, artistic; Bishop Coleman officiated, and never did Rev. Bishop speak more impressively than when addressing the candidates.</p>
                  <p>The young women were all clad in white, wearing white veils and carrying ivory prayer books. The costumes were not nun-like, quite up to date, particularly as to the sleeves. Beauty, youth, elegance and refinement were very much in evidence.</p>
                  <p>T. McCants Stewart is greatly in demand as an orator. At the great Douglass Memorial, held recently in Brooklyn, he easily carried away the honors of the occasion.</p>
                  <p>The boys are calculating as to which will be most productive of weal, the exclusive Bachelor ball or the Bazaar that our most popular maids and matrons are arranging for the Sons. I have heard their splendid president named as A. D.--her name is Miss Angeline Dawley. The Bazaar under her management is sure to be a grand success--on the other hand, our Rob is a McAllister.</p>
                  <p>Anno Domini is between the deep sea and--Mephisto!--" I don't even imagine who the fellow is," she said, with cold indifference, "he is too mean to sail under his true colors"--and "Angry Rob" was himself again--and a McAllister at that!  Saved!!</p>
                  <pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>(Scene in committee room, at the "Sons," a bevy of bright women, a vivacious beauty suddenly enters.) "Such an idea! Can't divulge it now, but it is sure to take. Just wait, it's a secret, but such <hi rend="italic">an idea</hi> for our grand Bazaar!" Jealous glances at her retreating figure.  A few days later--the maiden with "The idea" at home, pretty brow puckered with frowns, reading letter: "Dear Girlie-Have canvassed the town thoroughly, found required number of acceptables, but your chosen prize winner, must <hi rend="italic">ask mamma</hi>--do you object to a mixture of gray in the mustaches? Yours, etc." "The idea"--a prize mustache contest!--um--ah!--oh mamma!</p>
                  <p>The sentimental violinist whose ambition misled him into drawing the bow with our unmatchable Craig is an aspirant for the honors that usually reward the troubadour. It is bewildering to perform to one, when so many beautiful maids robed in creations worthy to bear the name of Worth all around like so many butterflies!</p>
                  <p>The great event of the season is the much talked of Easter Ball, to he given by the Bachelors--and oh, dear chappies--which of us will be there when the final roll is called?</p>
                  <p>Dr. J. Frank Smith has tired of the aesthetic surroundings of his apothecary shop, and sold out to the highest bidders. We will miss the old stand--'twas so quiet.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Charles Lancing, Jr., has been quite ill, but is now convalescent.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Harry Mars as the "little mother" is one of the most interesting matrons of the city beyond the bridge; her little daughter is the sweetest tempered baby in the world.</p>
                  <p>There is a gentleman of wealth, culture and leisure in town from the West, in search of a wife, very desirous of winning one of Gotham's girls--not a "new woman" though, he wants somebody of the old-fashioned make; there's a little Indian mixture in his blood.</p>
                  <p>There is a number of chappies up town, who will separate Easter, so as to report that evening as to the number of "Leon Creations" in evidence during the day.</p>
                  <p>The beautiful Evangeline Walker has gone on a trip South--in search of real orange blossoms may be--another reason why a certain despised harlequin--A. D. is not a benedict.</p>
                  <p>Never heard of so many things going on at one time--big Bethel has moved, and in the future will be a close neighbor of St. Philips--quite interesting.  Mother Zion has purchased a wonderful organ. The handsome Gould house is almost finished. The coming ball of the bachelors.  The great bazaar for the gallant Sons. The colored doctors, fired by the success of Dr. Williams of Chicago, are about to found a colored hospital. Meetings for various purposes, and memorials for the great Douglass are being held all over both cities.</p>
                  <p>Same case in Brooklyn--unusual activity in the churches. And under the management of the powerful Mrs. Dorsey a great art exposition is set down for the first days of May, for the unrivalled Brooklyn Literary Union, T. McCants, president.</p>
                  <p>And it makes me sad to record that all these things are being carried by the women but in the end who will pay the taxes?</p>
                  <p>Oh, no, dear boy--no portrait of ANNO DOMINI.</p>

                  <p>Race progress is the direct outgrowth of individual success in life. As dollar by dollar adds to the accumulation of riches, and enables the possessor to be fortified against the distresses which often confront the poor, even so, when one by one, as a class or race, steps forward to occupy a front rank in intelligence and progress, he necessarily moves up a pace and opens a pathway by which others may follow.  If "the kick of a fly moves the world," and "no force in nature is lost," it seems only natural and just in the divine providence of the Creator, that man, made in the image of God, with an immortal soul of inestimable value, should be a powerful lever in His hand by which a people may rise to a creditable position among other progressive nations of the world. While this is a fact, yet the advancement may be more rapid and widespread by encouraging race enterprises.</p>

a helping hand to a worthy cause, has a small soul, when he refuses to do so, because he or she sees no personal advantage to be derived, and gives an excuse (which proves his selfishness) in these words, "Only a certain few will receive the benefit and credit for the work."  What would be the condition of the country today had the brave volunteer of the armies withheld himself when a noble cause demanded his services? Did he see any personal advantage in an engagement which perhaps meant sudden death? I think not. But loyalty to his country and the cause which he deemed worthy impelled him to sacrifice all selfish interests, and life itself if need be, to establish the party of which he formed a part, on a solid foundation.</p>
                  <p>If we be convinced that the object is a worthy one, and tends to place the race on a higher plane of civilization, we may fall into line of battle for the right, feeling certain that personal advantage will come when we least expect it, and are not working especially for that end.</p>
                  <p>Mr. I. Garland Penn of Lynchburg, Va., was in Richmond on March 8, and met many of the public school teachers at the Y. M. C. A. Building. Mr. Penn is chief commissioner of the Negro Department of the Atlanta Exposition, which opens from Sept. 18 to Dec. 31, 1895. He has met the teachers of many cities in Virginia, and enlisted their interest in securing exhibits and the means to provide for the care of the same to and from Atlanta, with no expense to the exhibitor. The teachers have organized an auxiliary board to work for that object.</p>
                  <p>Richmond is claimed to be a Baptist city but she seemed to have laid aside her denominational garb from March 6th to the 11th inclusive, while the M.E. Conference was in session at the True Reformers Hall. There were about one hundred and fifty delegates in attendance. Our Baptist people opened their homes and hearts to receive them. On the night of the 6th stirring welcome addresses were delivered by Rev. Hunter of the A.M.E. Church, Rev. Z.D. Lewis of the 2d Baptist Church, Rev. W.F. Graham of the 5th St. Baptist Church, Rev. W.W. Brown, Pres. of the True Reformers' Bank, and others. The visiting ministers could not have felt otherwise than welcomed, when they concluded. The pulpits were supplied on the following Sunday from ministers of the Conference.</p>
                  <p>Having received a commission as Lady Commissioner for Richmond, Va., a Ladies' Auxiliary Board was organized on February 28 at the Y.M.C.A. Building with the following officers: R.D. Bowser, president; Mrs. L.G. Lewis, vice-president; Miss M.L. Chiles, secretary; Mrs. R.K. Jones, treasurer. The committees are arranging for a musical and literary entertainment and bazaar on April 29, at which time the State Commissioners hold a meeting in this city.</p>
                  <p>Rev. William Troy, formerly pastor of the Sharon Baptist Church, has tendered his resignation, which was accepted with regret by the congregation.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman from Masschusetts has been visiting schools throughout the South, organizing Bands of Mercy. The children appeared highly delighted at his instructive address, and willingly joined the band.</p>
                  <p>We take this medium to return thanks to the <hi rend="italic">Virginia Baptist</hi> for the very complimentary remarks on our earnest, but weak effort for the ERA, as we do not know to whom personally we are indebted for the very friendly expressions.</p>

Seventy-five thousand dollars was left for the purpose by a Mr. Lamar of that city. The city added to this sum another seventy-five thousand dollars, making in all one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Certainly our people in the city of Augusta are to be congratulated.</p>

                  <docAuthor>Lula W. Johnson</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>April 1895</docDate>
                  <p>Read before the N.T.S.A.</p>
                  <p>Behold the incompetent, ignorant, superstitious nurse or midwife of the present day in our own community. Unknowingly more lives of women and infants are sacrificed in one year at her hands than are brought to an untimely grave by many of the worst forms of diseases.</p>
                  <pb n="16 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>In the majority of instances no treatment at all and no nursing whatever is better than that which she empirically gives. Better let nature bring about her own cure or make an attempt to do so, than to ignorantly meddle and kill.</p>
                  <p>In emergencies her value is not to be estimated by dollars and cents. For instance, a child playing around comes across some one of the poisonous preparations of mercury, which has been carelessly left within its reach, and drinks it. A physician is not near at hand, but there is a trained nurse near by. When told of the accident she replies, "I will do what I can till the doctor comes." She gives albumen in the form of the white of an egg, varying the number of whites according to the amount of the poison taken. A prompt emetic or something to produce vomiting is given.  The physician has not yet arrived, but the nurse has saved a human life.</p>
                  <p>To the physician the trained nurse is a powerful aid. For instance, in typhoid fever and those diseases where the febrile symptoms run very high, she takes the temperature accurately every hour, or at stated intervals, in order to know and stop its onward march to the danger degree.  Watching the strength of the heart by the char- <gap agent="tape" extent="6 characters"/> and count of the pulse, she is enabled to <gap agent="tape" extent="6 characters"/>ate it when necessary. Proper liquid foods <gap agent="tape" extent="6 characters"/>ven, while hemorrhages and secretions are carefully looked out for.</p>
                  <p>Asepsis and antisepsis of course are not forgotten, while thorough cleanliness, order and quiet, the first three commandments of the nurse, are minutely observed.</p>

                  <p>"The Open Court," as was Stated in last month's ERA, is a department open to all, a letter box into which may be slipped the note that suggests the text, and even the sermon itself. It is intended to "fill a long felt want"; it is a department in which the people "are going to be heard."</p>
                  <p>"The Mother's Corner," "Side Talks With Girls," and " Hints on Housekeeping.  " Fashion" is the one subject excluded. Having up to the present moment failed to answer for our individual benefit the query, "Wherewithal shall Ye be clothed," we decline attempting to answer this question for the world at large. A very valuable paper might be written on the moral and commercial value of a word or phrase.</p>
                  <p>Dr. J.H. Armstrong, Financial Secretary of the A. M. E. Church, and one of the most popular candidates for the bishopric in his connection, in a recent issue of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Recorder</hi>, (the organ of his denomination,) contributed a valuable paper bearing the title, "You Are Expected to Help Run This Train." A railroad porter had failed to take interest or assist in any manner toward discovering the cause of the clogging of some portion of the machinery of his train. He was very emphatically told by his superior officer that he was not only to do his stated work but further he was expected <hi rend="italic">to help run that train.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We desire to impress upon the readers of this column they are expected to help "run it" by subscriptions, by literary contributions, by commenting upon the matter found within its limits, or upon that which they think the column should contain.</p>
                  <p>We hope to make Dr. Armstrong's comment of great commercial value to the ERA during this present year.</p>
                  <p>The only way to make the ERA, the organ of our clubs, a thorough success is for each to feel a personal interest in its success or failure. We have watched
<pb n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
with great solicitude the ventures of our women in Journalism. In <hi rend="italic">Our Women and Children</hi>, Dr. Simmons editor, we said some years ago in a paper entitled, "Our Women in Journalism":  "And when at some future day we shall desire to start a journal by our women, for our women, we will have built up a bulwark of strength. We will be able to lead well because we have learned to follow."</p>
                  <p>Shall we not prove by our work for THE WOMAN'S ERA that, during our years of apprenticeship, we did indeed learn to lead--prove by our work for this journal that the queen has come to her own?</p>
                  <p>Up to the hour of going to press, we have received thirty-six subscriptions for the Open Court. Marked copies of the ERA will be sent to friends at a distance. We hope the response will be a subscription to the journal. We have been permitted to make the following offer under the auspices of the Open Court.</p>
                  <p>One young lady can receive a scholarship in the Trained Nurse Department at Hampton College, Va. Apply to Miss Eliza A. Grier, Women's Medical College, Philadelphia, Pa. A small salary is attached, which will aid the student while in training.</p>
                  <p>The query on every side is: "Have you read 'A Carnival Jungle,' by Alice Ruth Moore, in the March issue of the ERA?" Many women of our race have exhibited talent, ability, industry; but there is a charm, an artistic touch, a dramatic force about the work of this young writer that is attracting widespread attention. All hail to the rising star in the race's literary firmament.</p>
                  <p>Another writer of the race and sex deserving of honorable mention, an example of whose work appears in the July issue of the <hi rend="italic">National Baptist Magazine</hi> is Mrs. Amanda Miller Coleman, of Wayland Seminary, Washington, D.C. The bright sketch, "Dorothy's Soliloquy," is both charming and unique in its style. We hope to secure the writer for the Open Court. The race is proving daily that it has within its limits latent talents that are worthy of careful scrutiny and of every aid that can be given to its future development.</p>

                  <docDate>May 1895</docDate>
                  <p>The April literary meeting of the Woman's Era Club was in charge of the Race Committee, Mrs. Mary Howard, chairman. Two thoughtful papers on "Our Opportunities" were prepared and eloquently presented by Mrs. Lottie Sampson and Miss Eva Lewis, calling out much discussion by members present. Owing to small attendance, it is proposed to have the papers read again, that a larger number may be heard in the discussion of this important subject.</p>
                  <p>The joyous Easter season was made gladder and the ERA office fragrant by tulips and hyacinths sent in by Doogue, the florist, and sweet mayflowers, straight from Plymouth hillsides, brought by Miss Etta Toliver. The ERA returns thanks to both donors for their thoughtful kindness.</p>
                  <p>The last of the public meetings of the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs for this season was held on Thursday, April 11, in the Second Church in Dorchester, all the arrangements for the entertainment of the many club members being made by the Dorchester Woman's Club. So agreeable have been found these migratory visits of the state federation that Lynn has spoken for the first one of next year, and Roxbury for the second. The annual meeting, to be held in June, will take place on the first Tuesday of that leafy month, when the Social Science Club of Newton will be the entertainers.</p>
                  <p>At the meeting of the 11th ult, Mrs. Jennie K. Adams of Woburn presided in the unavoidable absence of Mrs. Howe. Mrs. Micah Dyer, chairman of the committee of arrangements, Miss Florence Everett, state secretary, and Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, occupied seats with M. <gap agent="tape" extent="3 characters"/>Adams upon the flower-decked platform. The <gap agent="tape" extent="4 characters"/>addresses of the day were made by Rev. William H. Savage of Newton, who described "Charity of the Olden Times," and Mr. Frank Sanborn, who spoke upon "The Nerves' Centers of Charity," which he affirmed were pity and constraint.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ednah Cheney spoke briefly, complimenting Mr. Sanborn on his paper and the clubs on their progress.</p>
                  <p>"Charity to Dumb Animals" found an advocate in Mrs. John Richie, Jr., of Boston, who read "Simon Grubb's Dream."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Micah Dyer read letters of regret from Superintendent Anagnos of the School for the Blind, and from Rev. Rufus Tobey of the Berkeley Temple.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ruffin, president of the Woman's Era Club, gave an interesting report of the good work of St. monica's Home, conducted by the sisters of St. Margaret.</p>
                  <p>"The Newspaper and Philanthropy" was the topic discussed by Mrs. Elizabeth M. Gosse.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Alice N. Lincoln was the last speaker, and she read a paper on "Charity in Public Institutions."</p>
                  <p>The annual meeting of Federated Clubs will be held at Newton early in June.</p>
                  <p>Telegrams of sympathy were sent to Mrs. Howe and Mrs. Livermore.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Fortune's recent discussion of the race problem, which has raised such a furore, is widely discussed here; and while some are disposed to condemn the expression of the class of ideas (truths--unsavory, but truths nevertheless) that he advanced, others applaud his courage in naming boldly the actual condition of the Afro-Americans as a whole, and laying bare the various causes that are slowly settling upon the masses, barring progress and enlightenment. When the emotional and sensitive character of our people is taken into consideration, his courage is obvious. No man is in a better position to speak on this subject than Mr.
<pb n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Fortune, and the fact of his having given this subject his closest attention during long years entitles him at least to fair and unbiassed judgment.  Thus far no facts have been produced in contradiction of his premises.  The history of all nations proves beyond a doubt that people often need a plain, matter-of-fact expose of ruinous customs and nobility-destroying tendencies, as well as the individual; and that man whose mind is given to the advancement of his race is untrue to himself, his people, and the rational demands of the age in which he lives, if fear of condemnation prevents his calling attention to a condition which, if allowed to develop, is liable to be productive of a national disease.  There is but one way, according to our way of thinking, to disprove the obnoxious statement; and that is, as Dr. John M. Henderson says, for the workers as well as the thinkers of the race to put themselves in harmony with the forces of progress.  If plain truth and honest criticism will be productive of self-examination as a people, by all means let us have such; for when a people begin to think, light and its attendant blessings and benefits follow.</p>

                  <docAuthor>Petite Reine</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>May 1895</docDate>
                  <p>A man and a woman in a plainly furnished room. He says, Cherie, knowing how lonely your life is, I have bought and arranged this kinetoscope with views of the happenings of today among our people in Gotham, also a phonograph, so that you may know the talk of the day. If you will place yourself at the kinetoscope, I will shift the scenes and explain, according to my ideas, what they mean.</p>
                  <p>Ah! this picture, she says, is the Silent Shore, Sharon, a boat, and across that river the beautiful beyond, and in that halo of light a glimpse of some that have fought the good fight and received their crown, Douglass, Garnet, Peterson, Price, Ray, and the shadow of an innumerable throng; and here, leading down to the river, is a Hill. Yes, he says, that is the Hill of life, and here are a few of the many who have reached the heights and are laurel-crowned, Cromwell, Coffin, Harper, and a goodly number of young men and women filling up the ranks with genius, talent and education and full of energy and aspiration, all striving to reach that goal--success. And this ladder, that the topmost rounds seem golden and are lost in the clouds above, that is the ladder of fame; but why, says she, do they look with envy and try to jostle and push each other aside?  Surely the rounds of the ladder are broad and wide enough for all. Because, he says, they are very human, and the unwritten law of humanity is self preservation.</p>
                  <p>And is this the legislature? Here are some of our prominent women; they seem to be making a petition. No, they are before the school board. Take the phonograph and you will find they are simply asking that justice be done, and that some of our well-equipped teachers be placed in the mixed schools; they also desire that one of our women be put on the school board to further the interest of the Afro-American.	Meanwhile, if some of our women who are born diplomatists will make friends with the power behind the throne, Mrs. Granis, etc., they will eventually succeed. You know Gen. Grant gained some of his victories through strategy.  And this large gathering of women, do you notice how much of refinement and intelligence there is among them? That is the W. L. U.; their purpose is the uplifting and betterment of their race and to give practical encouragement to all branches of industry and talent; they are doing a great and good work, because the leaders of the movement have the element of success within them and their influence is wide and far-reaching.</p>
                  <p>And this large crowd? Ah! they look so sad and anxious. Yes, he says, they are the great unemployed working class. Colored people as servants have gone out of fashion. "It isn't English, you know," to employ them, and yet in some instances it is our own fault. People now require the best service, and we don't keep up with the times, but do things in a slip-shod sort of way.  If the advanced woman would start a training school for domestics she might evolve competent help that would be in demand irrespective of race, color or previous condition.</p>
                  <p>What a bright, pretty picture this is, she says.  Yes, that is a function given by the smart set.  What a lot of lovely well-gowned girls and charming young matrons; but it seems to be er--er--rath<gap agent="tape" extent="6 characters"/>from the haunts of men.  There are <gap agent="tape" extent="9 characters"/>misguided, unhappy-looking youths who have doubtless done their duty nobly dancing, and they are now wildly but vainly trying to make their escape, and those pretty girls have a pensive, far-away, expectant look in their eyes, as if they were waiting with that hope that rises eternal in the female breast, that her own special lord of creation will put in an appearance. Do
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
you think he will Come? Oh no, he says, each and everyone of them had to see a man on business at the club, and they are there, telling with unholy glee how they dodged their wives and their sweethearts, their sisters and their cousins.</p>
                  <p>Why, this must be the great Mogul himself, and all of these Afro-Americans are casting tribute at his feet!  Oh no; that is only our colored brethren paying their money for the hire of halls for their entertainments. And why do they not co-operate and have buildings of their own? Because what this race need is confidence in each other and in their leading men. And this picture--</p>

                  <p>Early in April, Mrs. Mary Church Terrell was appointed on the Board of School Trustees for the District of Columbia. The placing of women on the board is an innovation for the District, and the applicants were many and persistent. This being so, and Mrs. Terrell being one of two appointed, (and of course the only one of color) she, as well as the WOMAN's ERA, may justly feel honored. The large number of applicants made the matter of choosing difficult and critical, and the fortunate appointees have the satisfaction of knowing that they have distanced all competitors in fitness and capability and stand as the best obtainable for their positions.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that some of our readers are unacquainted with the career of Mrs. Terrell; for their satisfaction we quote from the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, only adding that Mrs. Terrell has attracted much attention everywhere by her work in the ERA, extracts from her contributions being often copied in the leading papers of the country.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Terrell, who will serve on the board with Mrs. Stowell, is recognized as one of the brainiest women of her race. Her husband is a Harvard graduate, and they live at 1936 4th Street, Le Droit Park. Mrs. Terrell is an alumna of Oberlin College, graduating from the classical department with high distinction in 1884. She afterward taught Latin and Greek at Wilberforce University, Xenia Ohio. She was two years in Europe studying the modern languages, attending school at Lausanne, Berlin, Florence and Paris. She was for several years employed as a teacher in the Colored High School of the District, is chairman of the educational committee of the Colored Women's League of the city, and has been president of the Bethel Literary Society, being the only woman to occupy that position. She was appointed registrar of Oberlin College and professor of Greek there, but did not accept the appointment. She was the first colored woman to whom such an appointment was tendered."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Terrell has recently been interviewed on educational matters by the <hi rend="italic">Washington Star</hi>. Her remarks make most interesting reading, and an extract is subjoined for the benefit of our readers.</p>
                  <p>"Mrs. Terrell, whose connection with educational work, especially among the colored people, qualifies her to speak with some authority on the subject, talked interestingly on what she hoped might be accomplished in the future in educational methods. In the course of her conversation she laid special stress upon the need of kindergartens everywhere for all children. Especially is this need felt in the case of the colored children of the District.</p>
                  <p>"As to my views on industrial work, I have only to say that I should give some kind of a trade to each and every young woman who graduates from our public schools. There are at present about three hundred girls in the High School; of this number it is possible for a hundred, perhaps, to receive appointments as teachers. What is to become of the other two hundred, with so many avenues of industry closed against them on account of their color? To be sure, it is possible for them to learn the dressmaker's trade, but they cannot all make a living at dressmaking.</p>
                  <p>"I venture to state that it would be impossible to find a first-class millinery establishment to which a colored girl would be admitted as an apprentice. So I might go on multiplying examples of the disabilities under which our young women labor.</p>
                  <p>"The conclusion of the whole matter is simply this: Let the public schools equip our young women with trades, which they can acquire nowhere else. Let our girls be instructed in all the occupations in which women may engage. The dignity of labor I should preach in season and out, making it a cardinal principle of my ideal system. All young women who have not a pronounced leaning toward teaching should be urged to learn a trade at the beginning of the High School course. One study in the curriculum should he dropped in order to allow the pupil to devote more time to the chosen trade. A certificate or diploma should be given to the pupil when the prescribed course in the industrial department has been completed. The day is not far distant, I hope, when the public schools of the District shall afford our young women the
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
opportunity of becoming first-class milliners, dress-makers, scientific cooks and proficient artisans in whatever industry they may select."</p>

NEED OF CO-OPERATION OF MEN AND WOMEN IN CORRECTIONAL WORK.</head>
                  <docAuthor>Fannie Barrier Williams, Editor.</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>May 1895</docDate>
                  <p>Emerson says "That you may proceed in the faith that whatever the woman's heart is prompted to desire, the man's heart is simultaneously prompted to accomplish."</p>
                  <p>The need of co-operation of men and women in correctional work appears so evidently reasonable and axiomatic that the form of the subject might well be changed so as to read, Who says nay to the need of co-operation of men and women in correctional work?</p>
                  <p>But I take it that women simply propose to bring, to the work a larger heartedness than is now exercised in its behalf. What our humanity needs and what our religion and finer sentiments ought to suggest is that the very best agencies of our civilization ought to reach and lift up toward the most perfect citizenship all whom fortune and nature have illy favored.</p>
                  <p>Are there so many dependent, homeless and undisciplined children that institutions must be built to house, sustain and protect them through their minority? Then send to them as instructors not men or women, but men and women of the best hearts and the fittest minds and accomplishments. Women believe that the best that humanity has is none too good to be used in making good men and women out of what are called bad children. The best that woman can offer stands ready to be joined with the best that man can offer in lifting all correctional institutions of the country to a position of greater usefulness in developing character on the ethical side.</p>
                  <p>Our correctional institutions are not what they ought to be, largely because man alone has been the stern master. Correctional work has been a matter of business, a policy of hard necessity, of punishment, of discipline, of appropriations and of salaries. The management of all our institutions growing out of philanthropic impulses has cultivated a delightful aptness in the invention of cheerful names for such institutions. What a joy in such an array of names as Home for the Friendless, Home for Dependent Children, Home for the Incurables, Old People's Home, Erring Woman's Refuge, Old Men's Home, Orphan's Asylum, etc. What a vocabulary of misery! Such names cheapen the quality of mercy and make organized philanthropy but an expression of patronizing almsgiving.</p>
                  <p>But we need not resort to criticism in order to justify woman's desire to share in the responsibility of making a proper use of the humane forces that would rather save than condemn the waifs of society. We must be ready to recognize that men or women working apart in any reformatory work cannot show perfect results. The supreme need of our correctional institutions is a larger baptism of the home spirit in the management, and women, we believe, can bring this needed influence. She would justify her request for cooperation by making these institutions less of a prison. It should be the mission of woman, with her warmer heart and finer instincts for home training, to make the great body of society absorb into its home life every dependent child susceptible to tender influences. I have faith enough in human kindness to believe that there is somewhere a home for every homeless child.  It is possible to make every incorrigible child corrigible by a parental spirit of discipline. Give woman a chance and the great warm heart of human society will beat close to every human being capable of rescue front the blight of the vices. Women would come to this work with a heart and conscience, and ask to have a stronger emphasis placed on every influence that would tend to develop the home instinct of every child appealing to the state for protection and training. Women come to the study of these new responsibilities, not with selfish motives for honors and office and salaries, but rather with a burning desire to make better the world by helping to make better and sweeter the lives of the children of men. We would seek to give a new importance and honor to a department of human responsibility which society has learned to regard in the spirit of almsgiving. We would seek to quicken the responsibility in the breast of every man or woman for every child sent to a reformatory institution. We would establish a direct line of interest be-
<pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
tween every child of misfortune and the heartof every home in the land. We would increase the importance of every child and diminish the institutional features of every reformatory.</p>
                  <p>This is not saying too much or hoping too much for what woman can and will do when prejudice shall give way to the entrance of her love and aptitude for all things that concern the deeper and tenderer side of human life.</p>

                  <p>On Easter Monday evening the citizens of Philadelphia held a memorial meeting for Frederick Douglass at the Academy of Music. It was an impressive occasion. Many distinguished speakers dwelt on different phases of his many-sided life, tributes were paid to his unblemished integrity, his gracious personality, his strong mentality and magnetic eloquence, but it was reserved for a woman to electrify and enthuse the audience. Mrs. Fanny Jackson Coppin spoke of what Douglass' life meant to the young, each to work out in his own way the good work so nobly carried on by our spokesman who is now silent, he who in his life seemed to be a witness for the capability of the negro if only afforded the opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Coppin spoke of his belief in woman, of her ability to acquire knowledge and of her rights in the body politic. I would be happy if I could even faintly give you an idea of her eloquence as she contrasted the condition of the negro in 1843, twenty years later and now.</p>
                  <p>Her audience was charmed and thrilled, and responded to her thoughts that breathe and words that burn with such deafening applause that she gathered their commendation as a weapon against them and charged all who applauded her sentiments to be responsible for carrying them out.  It was a grand object lesson for the detractors of woman's ability and an inspiration for every woman who heard her, so capable, so powerful, so modest.</p>
                  <p>In a recent issue of a leading Wilmington, Del., journal, Miss Edwina B. Kruse, the successful principal of school No. 16, has contributed a forcible article on the "Mental Possibilities and Special Endowments of the Negro Race." The paper is valuable for the accurate and detailed account given of the educational opportunities furnished the negro, and of the use he has made of them, from primary grades to the highest collegiate course. Miss Kruse also tells us where the many college graduates of our race are employed and what they have accomplished.</p>
                  <p>The school population of the seventeen former slave states is very nearly three million. These pupils are taught by twenty-five thousand colored teachers. Here is a vast leaven working!</p>
                  <p>The article goes on to tell of the many industrial and manual training schools scattered through the south and of the vast good accomplished by them. We owe thanks to Miss Kruse for furnishing us with so valuable an array of facts of such vital interest.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of school work reminds me of an exhibition held in our city of Works of Art suggested for Schoolroom Decoration.</p>
                  <p>The exhibition was held in Drexel Institute, itself a work of art, with its marble court and magnificent stairway leading to the upper galleries and rooms.</p>
                  <p>If some of the old wielders of the hickory switch in the white-washed, wooden-benched schoolrooms of the past could have wandered through these halls and seen the models proposed for the decoration of our schools he would have thought that times were changed indeed. A new era is opening in American school life. The kindergarten was the entering wedge. It showed the possibilities of childish observation and perception. Trained in the habit of seeing beauty, surrounded by examples of what is pure and beautiful, classical and great, it is hoped that it will lead the children to hate ugliness in the home, in the street and in their lives.</p>
                  <p>The exhibition consisted of models, casts, prints, and engravings of what is highest and best in the world of art, the immortal marbles of Grecian and Roman masters, all the famous conceptions of the Madonna and child, the noted cathedrals of every country, historical and allegorical subjects, poets, statesmen, inventors, philosophers, triumphal arches, the Sphynx and Pyramids.</p>
                  <p>It was an instructive and interesting array, and if the City Fathers in their wisdom see their way clear to appropriate the funds necessary for the
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
purpose, or if in any other ways these objects of art are lavished on the schools, those of  us who are living a generation hence, when thousands of children have been trained under these aesthetic conditions, may expect to see a new Philadelphia indeed.</p>

                     <p>Some raise objections to this method of procedure. They say the parents will not like it. Well, suppose they do not? It is certain that they too need a lesson.  Most parents are alarmed when their children are sent home from school. They seem to feel it keenly as a great disgrace. Their first impulse is to go after the teacher. Even should they come with sleeves rolled up and sparks flying from their eyes, let them find the teacher polite and just. They will, in the end, conclude that it is better to have that boy managed by the teacher than to have him expelled and at home on their hands. The probability is that before they leave, they will be more severe on the child than was the teacher.</p>
                     <p>There is no question about it. When there is open rebellion, something must be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>--not <hi rend="italic">said</hi>. Some natures can be acted upon only in this way. It is a heritage that has come down from those cruel days.</p>
                     <p>All humanity is akin, but each people has its peculiarities, and we have ours. We are loath and very loath, to give credit, by word or action, where it is due. If one does a thing well, we seem to think a little praise will detract from our ability, and we begin at once to find fault and to tell of greater things we have seen and heard.  This spirit reveals itself in many different ways.</p>
                     <p>I once saw a young mother cast glances of the deepest affection upon her eighteen-months-old babe, as it sat upon the floor. But when the little one looked back at her, prattled and smiled she reached out and slapped it in the face. It seemed to me that she feared to let it see how much she loved it.</p>
                     <p>I have seen a large-sized girl trying hard to step upon a higher plane. I have watched the signs of the terrible conflict that was going on within her breast, between gentleness and habitual roughness. I have seen her stop and try to greet her teacher or schoolmates politely, and then (as though an evil spirit had turned her right about) toss her head up and stalk by. How pitiable to see kindness struggling in the toils of habit! Right here comes another opportunity for the teacher. She can help gentleness to gain the mastery.</p>
                     <p>In the heart of every child there is a spirit of kindliness. With some, the heart is full and running over. With others, the spirit is asleep deep down in some dark and hidden recess. There must be an awakening, before its presence can be felt; but when once it is aroused, the teacher does not appeal to the higher nature in vain. Refinement that springs from within, shows itself in the movements, as well as in the acts of a person. Many teachers spend valuable time in working on the wrong side. Begin within and work outward.</p>
                     <p>It is in the school-room that a child gets a great part of the training that is to fit him for the stern realities of life. He learns to respect the rights of others. He learns to curb his temper, to be manly enough to acknowledge his wrongs; to expect hardships, and to have courage to fight against them and down them.</p>
                     <p>There are teachers whose greatest force is flattery and fulsome praise. They give the child an exalted opinion of himself, making him believe that he is the teacher's sole support, and without his presence and assistance all would go wrong. The bad boy may be kept within bounds in this way. But what is the result when he gets out into the world? Who pets and flatters him then, just to keep him in good humor? Who jokes with him to take away the sting of a deserved rebuke?  Who thinks that he always should have the right of way? He will find life a hard and cruel thing. He will condenin his false teacher and hate her for her treachery.</p>
                     <p> Let us do good, honest work, so that the boys and girls we send out may be honest men and women. In no case should we let an act of dishonesty, by word or look, go uncensured.</p>
                     <p>Our aim should be to have the heart right, the head right, and the hand to work with them.</p>

                     <p>Not long ago, a junior class was reading.  I called attention to the quotation marks that inclosed a sentence. "Do you notice those marks?" asked I. A tall lad of fifteen thrust his hands into his pockets stretched out his legs their full length under the desk, and with one eye directed toward me, said, "Huh! I knew them long time ago."</p>
                     <p>"What are they?"</p>
                     <p>"Quotation marks!" was the lofty answer. </p>
                     <p>"What are quotation marks?"</p>
                     <p>The correct definition was given with a most triumphant air, and the other eye was turned round to note the effect.</p>
                     <p>"If I were to ask you to compose a sentence and place these marks where they belong, could you do it?"</p>
                     <p>He hung his head and had to admit that he could not.</p>
                     <p>"Of what use to us is the knowledge of quotation marks? To enable us to stand up and recite, or to fit us to use them in written work?"</p>
                     <p>He saw my point, and was manly enough not to murmur, as he usually did when I gave his class written work to do.</p>
                     <p>A few months ago, Rev. Dr. Hamlin of Washington, D.C., addressed the Y.M.C.A. upon the subject "Knowing and Doing." He referred to his recent visit to Yale University and spoke of the practical work of the students there as one of the greatest examples in this age of the necessity of both knowing and doing. "Knowledge," he said, is useless unless it is put into practice."</p>
                     <p>If a boy can spell well, there is no reason why he should not be able to let it be seen in his letters to his friends and in all other compositions beside his spelling exercise. Writing should be something more than another form of drawing.  Well formed letters and neatly arranged words should adorn every page of every written exercise, not the copy-book alone.</p>
                     <p>Can the teacher do more? Yes. She can do a great deal to brighten the poorest homes. She can explain to her little charges how homes can be made brighter by loving hearts and willing hands. She can make it clear that dimes spent for candy and pickles can be saved and put to a better use. She can impress upon infant minds that respect for old age is pleasing in the sight of God. She can broaden their syrnpathies and widen their sense of honor. She can bring careless children to see hundreds of beautiful little things that hitherto have lain in their way unnoticed.</p>
                     <p>But is this discipline? If discipline be the nourishing and direction of the gentleness that is in a child, this is discipline, and that of the highest order.</p>

Jones, Mrs. McDowell, vice presidents; Mrs. Cora W. Griffin, recording secretary; Mrs. Mallory, assistant secretary; Mrs. J. S. Yates, corresponding secretary; Mrs. Callie Edwards, treasurer.</p>
                     <p>A reception was tendered Miss Ida B. Wells by the League on the occasion of the last meeting of the year 1894-95, and after highly interesting remarks by Miss Wells, the following resolutions were adopted.</p>
                     <p>Whereas, the Colored Woman's League, an incorporated body, was organized for the purpose of lending aid in any possible way to all members of the race, and especially to the amelioration of the condition of our women and girls; therefore be it</p>

Wells, and in the untiring, self-sacrificing work she is putting forth toward arousing public sentiment, a potent force in the work of calling attention to the wrongs perpetrated upon individual members of the race; of bringing about better methods for

T. C. U., in view of recent discussions, are especially worthy of note. "Whereas the barbarous and atrocious custom of lynching is growing rapidly in all parts of the United States without regard for sex, and too often on mere suspicion, as witness the wanton murder of a white woman in Nebraska and a colored woman in Tennessee; therefore, we, the women of the Central Women's Christian Temperance Union, of Kansas City, Mo., condemn the brutalizing and degrading effects of such revolting spectacles, express our hearty sympathy with Miss Ida B.Wells in her crusade against lynching, and pledge ourselves to use our influence toward arousing public sentiment to the crying need of a full and complete protection by the law until the fair and impartial trial guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States shall have established the guilt or innocence of the accused."</p>

                     <p>With the rapid growth of country, city and town, old conditions have changed, new ones are brought forth. During the past decade, woman's organizations have sprung up, apparently with mushroom growth; yet many have stood the test of years, proving them to be important factors in educational life.</p>
                     <p>Denver is a city of women's clubs. The oldest organizations of this kind are the Fortnightly and Monday Literary clubs, both having been formed about 1881. The Fortnightly has rather the highest social standing, but it is a question whether it does any deeper or better work than the Monday, the standard of both being high, progressive and scholarly.  The membership of each of these clubs is limited to twenty-four. The papers cover a range of subjects relating to literature, art and the home.</p>
                     <p>The Clio Club is of a similar nature. It has made thorough study of historical periods, covering the literary, artistic, and social growth of each epoch. Perhaps its program for the past season will be interesting.</p>
                     <p>"The invasion of Europe by the Barbarians and its results;" "The Crusades and their effects upon European civilization;" "The Sieges of Paris;" "The mythical and romantic element in early English History."</p>
                     <p>The Round Table Club pursues historical studies, this year confining its attention to the historical plays of Shakespeare.</p>
                     <p>The Friday Morning Club, which meets in the beautiful art studio of one of its members each week, has studied the art of various epochs, beginning with the Egyptian and coming down to modern times. The history, life, manners, etc., of each country being studied in connection with the art.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Club, organized one year ago, is patterned after the Chicago Woman's Club. It already has several hundred members, representing mainly the wealth and fashion of Denver, but has among its members women physicians, teachers, newspaper women, etc. There are six departments, Home, Education, Philanthropy, Art and Literature, Science and Philosophy and Reform. All members must enter one of these departments. Each department holds a monthly meeting of its own, and there is also a monthly meeting of the entire club. Outside of the programs both of the general club work and the department work, much practical work is done, as opening industrial rooms for women, a cooking school, etc.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Educational Club is a new club which is doing excellent work in the study of political economy, so necessary to the new voters, and perhaps old ones as well.</p>
                     <p>There are a host of lesser clubs in Denver, including the political clubs of the women of the various parties, and dozens of study and reading clubs all over the city.</p>
                     <p>It will be of special interest to the readers of the ERA to know that among the last formed, but by no means least, in its scope of work, is the Woman's League of Denver. This organization was formed, primarily, to co-operate with the
<pb n="9  THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Colored Woman's League of Washington, D. C., whose principal object is to gather and compile facts showing the progress of the race in all departments of life, to encourage unity of purpose and to devise ways and means for promoting the best interests of the colored people of the United States.</p>
                     <p>The special work of the Denver League is suggested by its local needs. It was apparent that the time and effort spent in such an organization must be directed along such lines as would prove beneficial and remunerative. The work is divided into two principal departments, educational and industrial.</p>
                     <p>In order that the women may become educated in thought, an original paper is prepared and read by some member each week. A discussion follows. There is a parliamentary drill and the current events are given.</p>
                     <p>Classes are formed as the members desire to take up a particular study. Private instruction is furnished on easy terms.</p>
                     <p>The industrial department provides instruction in different kinds of handiwork. At the end of each quarter there is a public sale of foods and other articles, thus encouraging woman's industries, competition leading them to be satisfied only with the highest standards.</p>
                     <p>A Woman's Exchange will be conducted by the League as soon as suitable quarters can be obtained.</p>
                     <p>It is the aim of the Woman's League to become to women, however circumstanced, a means of aid, protection, elevation and development, according as each may need. Old and young, all creeds, unite on the common ground of womanhood.</p>
                     <p>Nothing so stimulates and creates enthusiasm as the contact and friction with other minds. To learn to work harmoniously is education of a high order. So if we are patiently persistent in working toward our ideal through the medium of the League, we shall gain that broad judgment, keen discrimination and charitableness which are productive of a well-rounded character.</p>
                     <p>The officers of the Woman's League for 1895 are president, Mrs. Lizzie M. Olden; first vice president, Mrs. Elizabeth Wallace; second vice president, Mrs. Julia Hubbard; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Ida De Priest; recording secretary, Mrs. E. Azalia Hackley; treasurer, Mrs. Marcellina M. Beatty; board of directors, Mrs. Louis Allison, Mrs. Eva Johnson, Mrs. H. W. Wade, Mrs. F. D. Cooper and Mrs. E. P. Ensley. The Woman's League is enrolled in the State Federation of Women's Clubs.</p>

                  <p>While the schools have made of woman a good deal of a scientist and a good deal of a philosopher, her genius for teaching the human heart its best lessons of home and its sanctities has lost none of its potency. But I do not wish to seem too flattering in urging the qualifications of women which should entitle her to co-operate with men in all work that makes for the public weal. I perhaps ought to admit that we ourselves are open to some criticism, in our tendency to organize all our plans and schemes for the public good on sex lines. We ourselves help to discourage co-operation by too many organizations of ourselves, by ourselves and for ourselves. If women wish to advance any worthy cause by organization that cause would be better advanced by the co-operation of men and women than by their separation. For the purpose of social pleasure co-operation is admittedly proper, but for the advancement of humane and other high interests women are deemed incapable for association. For this mean discrimination we are not altogether blameless. The best organizations on both sides of the sex lines would be strengthened in their good purposes by co-operation.</p>
                  <p>If the letter M could in some way be added to W.C.T.U. the saloon interests could not only be regarded as one of the greatest indecencies of our civilization, but the blessed cause of temperance would be more widely triumphant in practical ways.</p>
                  <p>I cannot refrain from adding that for peculiar reasons we, as colored women, should most devoutly wish for a larger and more rapid growth of this spirit of co-operation of men and women in all good works. The need of the heart and mind of every good woman to help in the solution of the many problems of sociology, suggest the further need of the heart and mind of every good man and woman, of whatever color or race, for the same good purposes. The co-operation that women now seek for is the levelling spirit of democracy emancipating itself from the thrall of prejudice and looking toward the ethical equalities of life. In this agitation all progressive women are help ing to bring our nation to the deep philosophy of Herbert Spencer, that "no one can be perfectly free until all are free, and no one can be perfectly happy until all are happy."</p>
                  <p>A gentle brave man is the hardest kind of a combatant to meet, and it is probable that Miss Katharine P. Loring has come to this conclusion in her endeavor to excuse the people of Camden for their treatment of Mr. Richard P. Hallowell.  Mr Hallowell is the quietest kind of a gentleman and probably a revelation to Southerners, who seldom recognize courage unless accompanied by bluster and foolhardiness.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hallowell, so far from ignoring Miss Loring's letter to the <hi rend="italic">Boston Herald</hi>, brands it as utterly false, and calls upon the lady who has made herself "a too willing dupe of her friends in Camden" for a public retraction.</p>
                  <p>Nothing has yet been heard from Miss Loring, who has probably not recovered from having her Southern friends shown up as they are and not as they make themselves appear so often to weak-minded northerners.</p>
                  <p>This is not the first of such occurrences in the south by any means. Probably all of us have personal knowledge of similar affairs. But in making a target of Mr. Hallowell, Camden certainly waked up the wrong passenger, for here is a man to whom loyalty is as the breath of life; who is loyal to himself, his convictions, to his sense of justice and right; who is not to be deceived by specious arguments.</p>
                  <p>Miss Loring has evidently retired, silenced by convincing truth, but as Mr. Hallowell "does not propose to release her from the responsibility she has taken upon herself," we have probably not heard the end of the matter yet.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Silas Dickerson, of Newport, and her daughter, Miss Kinloch, spent Easter week in Boston. Their many friends were more than delighted at the opportunity to entertain them, and the consequence was a delightful time all around.</p>

                  <p>A GLIMPSE AT CALIFORNIA MISSIONS.</p>
                  <p>(Concluded.)</p>
                  <p>Give your imagination full play, and picture these mission villages, located on some slight eminence o'erlooking a <hi rend="italic">bonito rio </hi>or verdant valley variegated with "baby blue eyes" and yellow poppies, valleys affording bountiful pasturage and feed for the cattle and livestock; or on some bold bluff where could be seen the beautiful blue sea.  In either location, about a court of about a half acre, the building; the <hi rend="italic">prozolera</hi>or dining hall; a wing containing the friars' cells, these small, poorly ventilated, with scarcely any furniture in many of them, oftimes only a couch of hides stretched over a stout wooden frame, the friars only luxury. There were shelters for the live stock, and store houses for grain and provisions, dwellings, and the monjerio, a low stone structure, with a square court in the middle. The monjerio was the nunnery; here dwelt the mission maidens, presided over by a trusty old Indian woman, who kept vigilant watch over her charges. In the court sat the Indian maidens, working, weaving, spinning, chatting, and casting coy eyes at the opposite sex, whom cupid would designingly decoy that way. All the cloth, towels, church embroideries, etc., used about the missions was the work of those maidens. Life here was simple and regular. At daylight all were astir, and proceeded to mass, after which breakfast, of the unvarying menu, <hi rend="italic">atole</hi> (a preparation of barley) was served. Dinner consisted of <hi rend="italic">atole</hi>cooked in various ways, with mutton as an <hi rend="italic">entree</hi>; occasionally spinach <hi rend="italic">frijoles</hi> were served.  "At six o'clock P. M." supper was served of <hi rend="italic">pinole</hi>, this a preparation of the ever present <hi rend="italic">atole</hi>.  To this the neophytes could add nuts and wild berries, which they gathered and stored in large quantities. Every morning from the commissary department, the <hi rend="italic">navera</hi> issued to each individual his daily bread. The benedicts carried their allowance home to be shared with their families; the unmarried males carried their allowance to the <hi rend="italic">prozolera</hi> where it was prepared and served at one common table.
common table. At sundown, the "Angelus," when the laborers, neophytes and <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>assembled in the chapel for prayers; the litany sung, the blessing invoked, the day ended, all returned to rest. The licentious and brutal conduct of the soldiers toward the Indian women caused numerous outbreaks and "Indian uprisings" so that the <hi rend="italic">presidios</hi> were moved from the church settlements, and the <hi rend="italic">padres </hi> discountenanced mixed marriages. To induce marriage among the natives, the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>would march all the male neophytes in the chapel, then repair to the <hi rend="italic">mojerio</hi>and say, "Which of you, my daughters, wish to marry?"  This would cause blushing and questioning glances from maiden to maiden, when they would all spring to their feet and follow the <hi rend="italic">padre</hi>into the chapel, where stood in row the anxious and prospective bridegrooms, each hoping to attract the choice of his ideal, the prettiest and youngest of the maidens, who had the sole right of choosing.  Sometimes the fastidious maidens, after coquettishly eyeing the row, would not find one to her liking, thereby deferring her choice and disappointing and blasting the hope of the aspiring candidates. Some of these romantic marriages were affairs of the heart and very happy unions resulted. These unions were rarely prolific, attributed by historians to the new and sudden modes of life forced upon the neophytes. Remarkably strange, the prolificness of the mixed marriages; it was not uncommon to see from fifteen to twenty-five children in a family.  Punishment to maintain order was in various forms.  Capital crimes were turned over to the soldiers; not infrequently refractory bucks were laid across the knees of the "fat, greasy" friars, and received physical emphasis of his admonition, with salutatory effect. There yet remains, despite the vandalism of the relic hunter, specimens of the workmanship of the neophytes.  They were instructed in all the arts and mechanics, etc., of that time.  In that time of successful communism, there was no display of greed of gain, no lust for money or selfish aggrandizement--the time of peaceful Eutopian villages; there was, to mar the serenity of the pious <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>, however, outbreak from savage and unfriendly tribes; then came the great troubles of 1812, which destroyed many buildings and lives; last came secularization.  In little more than a century thirty thousand Indians had been taken from barbarism, and taught to cultivate the soil and utilize its products, to manufacture and wear clothes, to build and live in houses, and

above all to know and worship the true God. Cattle and stock were thriving and increasing each year, vineyards and orchards flourishing and yielding abundant productions, all basking in the sunlight of prosperity, spiritual and temporal, but the storm of secularization was approaching, to soon burst with devastating fury. The empowered <hi rend="italic">Comision idos</hi>, armed with the proclamations of secularization, seized all lands and stock; the cowled monks were to cease walking and praying in the beautiful mission gardens; disintegration of property followed; the Indians had their possessions wrested from them.</p>
                  <p>Removed from the restraining influences of the <hi rend="italics">padres</hi>, a mighty struggle ensued between their few years of civilization, and hundreds of years of barbarism, "and it is not surprising that the weaker foe was vanquished." The mission ruins, beside whose walls lie sleeping those who played a conspicuous part in the history of their existence, are the links that connect our civilization with the romantic mission period. May they be preserved monuments to the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi> silently sleep, watched by the willows that o'er them weep.</p>

                  <p>Toledo has enjoyed quite a treat within the past few days. The second State Convention of the King's Daughters and Sons was held here.</p>
                  <p>It has been a great pleasure to sit under the sound of the voices of such noble women as Mrs. Margaret Bottome of New York, President of the International Order, Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson and Mrs. I. C. Davis, both of New York; the former editor of the <hi rend="italic">Silver Cross</hi>, the magazine of the order, and the latter the business manager. All three of these ladies are but to be seen to be loved. We all, no doubt, are acquainted with Mrs. Bottome through her "Heart to Heart" talks to the daughters in the <hi rend="italic">Ladies Home Journal</hi>. We feel that Toledo has been blest, and much good has been done here through these noble women.  Perhaps there is no organization on the globe, save the church, covering so large a scope of usefulness as does this order. Over 350,000 wear the little silver cross in His name; wee tots, whose little lips can scarce lisp the name of the King, wear it; hard laboring girls, on the mercies of a cruel world, wear it; women whose lives are one of toil, care and undeserved censure, feel the pang caused by the cruel thrusts of an unjust world no longer when the heart is hidden under the silver cross; silver-haired mothers become mothers indeed when they are all glorious within. Such is the characteristic of the King's daughter.</p>
                  <p>It was wonderful to hear what these dear daughters of Ohio have accomplished within the past year. Splendid, yes, marvelous reports were brought in from all parts of the state, of glorious results for the King. One very dear report to me was from the university circle of the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. These girls are saving enough money out of their own to pay half the expenses of an African girl in a college in Ashville, N.C., her lady principal bearing the other half.</p>
                  <p>I spoke to the young ladies concerning the noble act, and one said, "Yes, sometimes we have scarce enough money to bear our own expenses, but in His name we sacrifice our own pleasures for this dear girl in Ashville, for we all have learned to love her."</p>
                  <p>Thus the good work goes on. Would that the hearts of all wornankind could beat under the little silver cross and be pure and holy within. The work does not stop with philanthropic results alone, but these dear ones go on developing in spirituality and stimulating christian activities, thereby making the world better by their having been in it. Quite a good number joined the International Order, one of the number being your representative.</p>
                  <p>It nothing prevents, your representative will address the Y.W.C.A. at their parlors the second Sunday, in the afternoon. This organization offers the same opportunities to the colored woman as it does to the white. We feel perfectly at home there, and although the first woman of color to ever stand before them in such a position, we can not appreciate the honor too highly.</p>
                  <p>The Dickens Club was very highly entertained by Mrs. Hattie Cannon. It was our misfortune to be unable to be with them, thereby losing quite a literary treat, as they rendered a very fine program. This club has a membership of fourteen very studious women, whose aim is to become wiser in every respect. They have made vast improvements since their organization. The ERA is at home in this club, and its appearance every month is anxiously awaited.</p>
                  <p>An editorial in last month's issue concerning the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Home Journal</hi>forces me to say that the ERA has caused it (the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>) to become quite jealous, as those who have been taking the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> have given it up for the ERA. Last week a white gentleman friend of ours, a retired missionary, called in to solicit subscriptions for some periodicals in which he is very much interested.</p>
                  <pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>I told him that I could not find the time to give to his papers after reading our own publications. He was surprised, and said, "Why, you don't mean to tell me that your race has produced authors and editors, and can you show me some of the publications?"  I hastily placed before him every paper, pamphlet, journal and book in the library of the productions of our race.  "Well, well," says he, "you are taking me by storm. I did not know that your people aspired to such. Why, this is simply marvelous."</p>
                  <p>So it is with the white. They endeavor to get their literature into our homes, never once dreaming or perhaps wanting to know that our own sable sons and daughters are daily feeding us from the fruits of their own fertile brain. We are misjudged by many of the opposite race. You know that the rotundity of the earth seems impossible to us because we see so little of it at once, yet we believe that it is round. So it is with the white man. He cannot believe that the negro race is making advancements for he sees such a small portion of us at once. There are exceptions, of course, for there are some who know and believe that we are fast coming to the front.</p>
                  <p>Bishop Penick said to my husband not long since, "I never hear of any books or periodicals written by your people." This divine has charge of the work for the negro in his church. If seeing would convince him he was convinced, for my husband placed at his disposal the productions that would make him wiser if he will but read.</p>
                  <p>The Oak and Ivy Club of Springfield, Ohio, is now in China. The principal object of this club is to improve its members in musical taste and skill and travel prospectively.</p>
                  <p>The Lovers of Wisdom are striving to raise the moral, mental, physical, social and religious standards for themselves. This club is composed of young ladies.</p>
                  <p>The White Rose Club is composed of twenty-four devoted Christian women who have three special objects in view. First, to create a greater love for church and more devotion to the teachings of Christianity; second, to improve their minds so that they will be more useful in the community; and third, to entertain worthy strangers who may visit the city. [I wonder if these White Roses do not wear the silver cross?]  All of the pastors' wives belong to this club.</p>
                  <p>All of the above clubs are of Springfield. The ERA is at work there and we bespeak good results.</p>

                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Statesman Exponent </hi>in a recent editorial says:  "We must stop drawing the color line in every conceivable and foolish way, if we would have the color line abolished.  There is neither sense nor race patriotism in it." The foregoing remark so fitly tells us of our own participation in the same sinistrous line that we can not but borrow them to preface what follows. Once upon a time, and that not a hundred years since, two colored churches of this city jim-crowed (if I may so phrase it) their respective audiences; or in other words, provided separate pews for the white and colored people assembled.  The fashion, modeled after our own designing, was very soon adopted by an educational institution hard by, which, under white management, has done much for the elevation of colored youth in the south.</p>
                  <p>To think of such an outrage, as it is called, causes lips to pale and hands to go up in holy horror. But why object? We discriminate against ourselves, and should not, with a modicum of consistency, complain when others do likewise.</p>
                  <p>The recent admittance of Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams of Chicago to the Woman's Club of that place has brought to light the fact that two eastern clubs have each a colored member. As the General Federation of Women's Clubs has been invited to come to Atlanta this fall, the question naturally arises as to how the negro contingent shall be disposed of. Embarrassing question this.  The Woman's Press Club of Atlanta has become so aggrieved over the matter that it has withdrawn from the federation. Other southern clubs have followed en suite. The Ossoli Circle of Knoxville disfavors the withdrawal of one or more southern clubs from the General Federation of Women's Clubs, for the aforesaid reasons, and deems it best to take no action until after the next biennial meeting in May, 1896.</p>
                  <p>Miss Hattie Macafee is the agent at this point for Miss Wells' "Red Record."  It tells of many men--negroes, of course--who have been hanged to the highest limb of the nearest tree for (in most cases) uncommitted crimes. It is, indeed, a red record; yea, even more--a blood-dyed death roll of the south.</p>
                  <p>With Mrs. Ella Hamilton as hostess, the meeting of the Woman's Mutual Improvement Club occurred on Wednesday afternoon, April 24, at 3 o'clock. Mrs. Harriet Black read a paper entitied "The Dignity of Labor."</p>
                  <p>A man formerly of Massachusetts, but now a resident of E. Tennessee, has this to say about the southern negro: "In the south there is no use for an educated negro, and the more educated

he gets, the more useless he becomes. The white man will continue to be master in this country unless he becomes extinct, or until the millenium arrives, and the black man will continue to be his servant; therefore the wisest thing the black man's friends can do is to qualify him for that duty." It goes without saying that no such prophetic powers have been known since the days of old.</p>
                  <p>The Easter edition of the <hi rend="italic">Statesman Exponent</hi> edited and managed by the Woman's League of Denver, adds another feather to the crown of the race.</p>
                  <p>During the next two months hundreds of lighthearted, daintily-gowned girls will commence in reality to live. The anxiety of examination over, flowers and applause given, farewells said, school days past, and then the first act in life's great drama closes.  You, dear girls, will feel, upon that auspicious day, a strange thrill of pleasure, a high sense of pride, an indescribable exhilaration, something that perhaps during all your life may never be yours again. You have a happy anticipation of the future; so did we when we were in your place. The past is not so far away that we can not remember it still--the old chapel filled to its utmost cpacity, the music, the lights, the flowers; our girlhood friends, our parents, our teachers, smiling, waving their hands and wishing us a smooth journey upon life's opening sea.  No detail is forgotten.  It is a vivid picture, indelibly stamped upon memory's wall; and when you, sweet girl graduates, shall have grown older, wiser, and perhaps humbler, you will look back with pleasure, and may be a tinge of sadness upon the commencement day of your life's work.</p>
                  <p>The reception and banquet, Monday evening, April 22, given in honor of Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, who is visiting her parents in Memphis, Tenn., was very complimentary both to the lady so highly honored and to the ladies and gentlemen who showed their appreciation of one, born in their city, and who by her rare accomplishments has been so highly honored in Washington, D. C.</p>
                  <p>Among those attending were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Church, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Williamson, Mr. and Mrs. C.F. Hooks, Mr. and Mrs. J.T. Settles, Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Ridley, Mr. and Mrs. W.J. Harvey, Prof. E.L. Honesty, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cooper, Prof. Hamilton and wife, Rev. Honesty and wife, Prof. B.K. Sampson, Misses Katie Davis, Lottie Dickerson, Carrie Hamilton, Mamie Mosley, Mr. Chas. Williamson, Dr. Terrell, Prof. C.A. Thompson, Prof. John A. Ruffin and Mr. D.W. Washington. After a brilliant piano solo by Mrs. Julia A. Hooks, Prof. Thompson made the address of welcome to Mrs. Terrell, to which that lady responded in her happiest vein. And to those who had never had the pleasure of hearing their townswoman speak in public before, it was a revelation that charmed and delighted her hearers. Alter a solo by Mr. D.W. Washington, those assembled passed into the banquet hall, where an elegant repast was served. The toasts at the table were happily delivered and received much applause. The toast, "Our Guest," was responded to by Professor Ruffin, "Glimpses of the past," by Professor Sampson. "What of the future" was responded to by the eloquent J.T. Settles.  Professor Hamilton caused much laughter by his "Democratic Dog." Prof. W.J. Harvey responded to the toast, "Our Progressive Woman," as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <text>
                        <body>
                           <p>Our Progressive Women. "Had this subject been assigned as a toast a few years ago, it would have been simply "Our Women," and the responder would have thought it sufficient response to say "Our Women!  God bless them."  But in this age, which the ladies delight to call the "New Woman's era," the subject of this toast is "Our Progressive Women." The advancement of women in the professions and in other avocations heretofore considered as belonging exclusively to the men, has been most wonderful. We men, once called the "lords of creation," laughed at the idea of women getting out of their proper sphere, but the laughter has died upon our lips and in its place are looks of wonder and admiration. Our noble women have torn down barrier after barrier that hindered their progress, and leaping over the ramparts of selfish ridicule, they are swarming into every profession. Fitted by nature to care for the young, it is admitted generally that the women are our best teachers. The school master is fast giving way to the school marm. And although I was once a school teacher myself, I hope the ladies will pardon the admission, yet I confess this is a pleasing change, for the school marms rule with sweet smiles and kind words, but our school masters ruled with a frown and a bunch of hickories. In the profession of law our women are slowly but surely making their way. As dry as Blackstone's Digests are, the women are eating and digesting them thoroughly, so I warn you not to be startled when you look up and see an office sign reading "Miss or Mrs. Blank, Counsellor at Law."</p>
                           <p>Belva Lockwood, the ex-presidential candidate, as a lawyer has quite a large and paying practice and so have other female members of the bar in this country. And so, ye lawyers, beware of the day when you meet a woman in battle array. You may be able to measure swords with a man, but who can measure tongues with a woman! But it is in the medical profession, that our progressive women are meeting with the greatest
<pb n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
success; the tender hand that was wont to calm the sufferer with its soothing touch has been trained to use the surgeon's lance and its fair owner now prescribes for the sufferer's disease. Aside from the wide field of practice among those of their own sex, it is said that they are the best children doctors in the world, and what a field is here afforded them! But leaving the professions, what of their progress in political affairs? Again, I answer, wonderful is their progress. That noble-hearted old Christian lady, Susan B. Anthony, used to be the laughingstock of American politicians, but she has lived to see some of her fondest hopes realized, and in Kansas, several ladies are mayors of cities, in Wyoming and Washington they vote just as any other citizen. In Colorado, they not only vote but three of them are members of the Legislature.</p>
                           <p>Truly then, our women are progressing and our nation's capital is honored in having upon its Board of Education the talented lady who is the guest of this occasion.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen, think not that, the ladies are simply our imitators, because they wear our hats, coats, shirtfronts and bloomers; they are our competitors as well its our imitators. So this is to our Progressive Women, hoping that whatever their successes may be in art, science, or literature, they will still be loving sisters, good wives and dear mothers."</p>

                  <p>Wedding bells in the air! The latest announcement being the approaching marriage of the president of a seminary well-known in Virginia, to Miss -----, a student at H. M. College. Long life and happiness to them.</p>
                  <p>Rev. Graham of the 5th St. Church has been laboring earnestly in the revival meetings at his church for about two weeks. May success crown his efforts.</p>
                  <p>Miss Clara Alexander, the sweet singer of Lynchburg, and Miss H.V. Pankey, teachers in the public schools of L., were in Richmond during the holidays with a company under the supervision of Prof. Patterson of the Virginia Seminary. The company presented the beautiful drama, "The Belle of Saratoga," with Mrs. Dr. Jackson, of Lynchburg, pianist. We are of the opinion that no better entertainment has been presented to the people of Richmond at the Reformer's Hall. The proceeds were for the benefit of Virginia Seminary.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Sunday in March was Seminary day in Virginia. Many of the churches and Sunday schools held special services. Some of the churches collected nice little sums for the cause.</p>
                  <p>Beautiful lilies adorned the rostrum of the First Baptist Church on Easter morning. An interesting and instructive sermon was delivered by Rev. Crosby of the Theological Seminary. The choir from Lynchburg, under the direction of Prof. U.S.G. Patterson, relieved the church choir by the rendition of two selections appropriate to the occasion.</p>
                  <p>We think it has been difficult for the past three weeks to meet a child or adult who did not carry one or more envelopes for the benefit of the Y.M.C.A.  The pastor's entertainment for the same cause was given on the evening of April 15 at the First Church. This was the great rally night for the Y.M.C.A.</p>
                  <p>Sharon Church has called a pastor to succeed Rev. Troy.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Octavia Ferguson has left the city to visit friends in two or three northern cities.</p>
                  <p>Hard times had no effect on festivities.</p>
                  <p>When this issue of the ERA reaches its readers the glorious Eastertide will be a thing of the past. Many were the preparations for the event. The exercises of the various churches and Sunday Schools were grand. The singing was of a very high order, and nothing remains as a reminder but the glorious thought:  "He is not here, but is risen."</p>
                  <p>The Ladies' Auxiliary of the Y.M.C.A. have elected for its president for the ensuing year Miss G.V. Freeman, a very efficient young woman of our city. Meetings are held twice a month for the purpose of gaining young women to do active work for the Association. The second meeting in the month is always a "literary" one. These are well attended, and we have reason to believe that this too is one of the agencies of promoting Christ's kingdom on the earth.</p>
                  <p>Samaritan Hall was the scene of a very brilliant affair on Thursday night, April 11, the occasion being a "Banquet" tendered the M.W.G.M.A.F.M., B.A. Graves of Richmond, Va.  The

hall was tastefully decorated with bunting, ferns and rare hot house plants. The handsome costumes worn by the ladies, and the gallantry shown by the gentlemen to all their guests, made the party the most enjoyable social event of the season. After a general introduction, the Campbell Lodge of Norfolk, under whose auspices this affair was given, formed in line with the guests and to the strains of a march by the Excelsior Band of this city, wended their way to the floor below where a table laden with all the delicacies of the season awaited them. This over, P. W. M., J. C. Asbury began the toasts, welcoming the visitors in a most gracious manner to the "City by the Sea" and all its hospitalities. Then followed the toasts of the evening and the responses thereto, which brought out a veritable flow of wit and wisdom.</p>

                  <p>The people of Augusta mourn the loss of one of their most talented young ladies, Miss Addie Williams, a teacher in the Mandge Street School. Death, cruel death, has ruthlessly crushed the half-blown bud of hope and promise within his icy hands. Those who knew her best loved her most. But there is one consolation.</p>

                     <l>And tender voices to make soft the wind.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>We learn that the Phyllis Wheatley Club' of Augusta is progressing finely. The young men are anxious to know what subjects are discussed by the young ladies. This the members keep strictly to themselves. In the near future, however, I think that something pleasing to all will be reported. The WOMAN'S ERA should be read by all the inembers. What say you, Miss President? Why not advise all to subscribe?</p>

                  <p>[Concluded.]</p>
                  <p>The contagious diseases that interest us more than any of the others are the ones found most frequently in our own city; for instance, scarlet and yellow fever. The former being found more often, we will take it as an example and see of what use a trained nurse is in this disease. The good and bad qualities of a nurse are now shown up in every respect. The patient is to be isolated, the highest room in the house being selected for this purpose; all coverings from the floor removed, curtains, pictures and hangings of all kinds taken down. A single iron bedstead with a straw mattress, a small wash-stand, with not more than one drawer, a old small table, an old rocking, or reclining chair, an ordinary wooden chair and a clean starch or soap box, with a hinged cover, to take the place of a bureau drawer, are the only pieces of furniture necessary. White curtains of cheap material are the best for the windows because they can be destroyed. Two cheap rugs or pieces of carpet may be placed on the floor, one by the side of the bed and one for the use of the nurse. Our open fireplaces are the best ventilators, so they should not be closed; one window should also be kept partly open, with a triple fold of cheese cloth tacked across to prevent draught and let in the fresh air needed. The ordinary china chamber set should be kept and a bed-pan and tin set added. Old cotton pillow-cases and sheets are the best for the bed, and the same is true of the gowns, towels and other things used for the patient.</p>
                  <p>I forgot to say that the floor should be scrubbed and windows washed after the walls have been thoroughly swept. An old sheet should next be wet in a solution of Platt's Chloride, bichloride of mercury or of strong lime water, and hung upon the door in some other part of the room. There should be a set of dishes kept to themselves for the use of the patient. If it is in the winter, keep the room at an even temperature as the doctor advises. The urine should be examined once a day, by means of boiling and then adding one drop of nitric acid, to see if there is any albumen present. Baths and sponges, if ordered, should always be given under cover, and the most nourishing and digestible food administered. Observe with care all directions concerning the medicines; watch the pulse and temperature. In giving the oil baths, let us remember that too much oil does harm and that they should not be given oftener than the doctor directs. One more thought. Let us not forget that the patient is alone with the nurse for the greater part of the time. The physician sees her only for a few moments and then he is gone. Now the long, weary hours of the day and night drag on. Her friends cannot see her; no sounds from without greet her ears save the songs of some sweet birds or the rustling of
<pb n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the gentle breezes wafting sweet perfume from the flowers in the garden below. Now the nurse must do all that she can to comfort and enliven the patient. Sometimes all is done that can be, and yet the end comes on. The doctor has written his last prescription; the nurse has given the last dose of medicine. In the still hours of the night the patient realizes her condition. She turns to the nurse for a ray of hope or comfort, and the last look on earth from some loving wife, mother or child is given to the faithful, patient nurse.</p>

                  <p>BOSTON</p>
                  <p>WHO IS "ANNO DOMINI" SETTLED.</p>
                  <p>(Scene--W-d-l-d P-k Hotel.)</p>
                  <p>Mrs. D.:  "I wish I were sure of Anno Domini's identity."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. -------:  "Why, dont you know?  You surely can guess.  It's very evident who she is; there's but one person in New York who can serve things up in that chic style, and she lives in Brooklyn."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. D.:  "Who, the dashing young widow -------?  Oh, it's not a <hi rend="italic">she</hi> at all, but I, like you, feel sure that Anoo Domini has <hi rend="italic">his, her</hi> or <hi rend="italic">its</hi> observatory on the planet 'Mars.'  Are we hot?"</p>
                  <p>(turning to one who knew.)</p>
                  <p>O.W.K.:  "You are getting warm."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. -------: "Well, let us average up and charge it to 'Lord H.' Since we are agree that 'Anno Domini' may be settled somewhere upon 'Mars.""</p>
                  <p>And so it was settled to their satisfaction, but "Anno Domini" is as elusive as ever.</p>
                  <p>Like everything else the "Vaudeville" improves with time and experience. The members of the club may well feel pleased with the number of excellent entertainments given by them this winter, none of which was any better than the last given by Miss Gertrude Peake at the home of Mrs. J. H. Lewis. One of the features was a comedietta, "The Boston Dip," in which the now old favorites, Misses Lillian Lewis, Louisa Lewis and Gertrude Peake, Messrs. Marsh, Lewis, Hemmings and Gilbert took the characters; other features were a piano solo by Miss Glover--excellently done, of course; a recitation by W. H. Lewis and one by Miss Peake, in which much grace and training were displayed; Messrs. Hare and Harry Lewis gave pleasure with a banjo duet; but it was left to Miss Mary Lewis to make the hit of the evening; the young lady not only surprised her friends by the beauty of her voice in a vocal solo, but also delighted every one by her poses in Greek costume. Miss Lewis has decided natural advantages for such an exhibition; to these were added a good arrangement of lights and draperies, the whole making a most charming combinatlon.</p>
                  <p>The afternoon tea and sale held in St. Andrews Hall for the benefit of St. Monica's Home Wednesday afternoon and evening, the 2th inst, was a financial and social success. The leading spirits in the fair were Sister Catherine and Miss M. C. Dean. The tea table was presided over by Mrs. Sparrow and Miss Andrews. But where were Miss Marion Ridley and Miss Lillian Lewis, who were to have assisted in making money for this most needy charity?  The first named at the flower booth, and the latter booked to lead the "Vaudevilles" in an entertainment, and also to dispense "toothsome candies" to make sweet charity sweeter.</p>
                  <p>Mr. J. Rosemond Johnson gave his second annual piano forte and vocal recital at Steinert Hall Wednesday evening, April 24, assisted by Miss Maud L. Reese, lyric soprano, Mr. Edward S. Glover, violinist, Mr. Arthur Payne, celloist, and Madame Dietrich Strong, accompanist. The beneficiary, Mr. Johnson, was heard nine times in vocal and three in instrumental selections, the latter showing both taste and finish in the execution, which cannot with truth be said of the vocal efforts, strength being the quality most in evidence there. The singing of Miss Reese gave the most exquisite pleasure and satisfaction.  De Beriot's Seventh Concerto for piano and violin was rendered by Mr. and Miss Glover in a manner to call forth the most enthusiastic applause and an encore.  The concert was in every way creditable, and as an evidence of the esteem in which Mr. Johnson is held among the best of Boston's music lovers, a noteworthy success.</p>
                  <p>Our congratulations to Mrs. Terrell, who is well worthy of the honors bestowed upon her, we speak not only for ourselves, but for the many friends of herself and husband in Boston.</p>
                  <p>The "Harvard Boys," Messrs. Trotter, Royal and Williams, gave a tea at the College House last week to which the "buds" turned out in force and beauty. Mrs. Trotter matronized the affair and everything was delightful.</p>
                  <pb n="18 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>A beautiful girl baby made its appearance at 13 Rutland Square, the home of Mr. and Mrs. B.R. Wilson on the 13th of the month.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ray's poem, "In Memoriam," was one of the especial features which made the April ERA a conspicuously fine number. Miss Ray is one of our few real poets, and the many words of pleasure in her poem that have come to us from our readers show that she is widely appreciated.</p>

                  <p>The event of the season, the Bachelor's Ball, as was expected, proved a splendid success from every point of view, from the selection of the most beautiful hall in Brooklyn to the natty arrangement of the carnation hyacinth boutonniere on each bachelor's lapel, with the club colors, maroon and white satin, worn aslant each spotless shirt front. The decorations and brilliant illumination to a certain extent acted as a quietus. Before supper Anno Domini feared as to the enjoyment, and occupied the time looking for Les Miserables. One of the gay bachelors lost his laundry slip evidently. The same stood, just before "Home, Sweet Home" broke upon the charmed air, and said to a bevy of girls, "Say, <hi rend="italic">boys</hi>, ain't this out of sight?"</p>
                  <p>The patent leather market is evidently short. The Trilby of the occasion was the gallant president. He danced and-- But Miss Edie B--------, like a dear, little Quakeress, so quiet, yet so sympathetic, looked up in his handsome face in a way that would make a fellow forget an angel parent, much less his--steps.</p>
                  <p>Midnight settled on. One ought to have been gay Lothario when from a corner he darkly gazed upon his winsome lady in the mazy dance.  The fair Evangeline was radiant. Beau Brummel was as usual exquisite. We all envy his kinship with Sweet --------e, the loveliest debutante of the season.</p>
                  <p>The prettiest set in the room was that off in the little corner. In it was Our Rob, his chum, the Prince of Wales, Irvie Charlton, and a natty little fellow who wore a white vest. This is no discount on the one led by "our own Miles Standish." He's not as bashful as I first thought. Ern is all of the Revolutionary Captain of prim old Plymouth Rock --as handsome, if not as stern. The only time he seemed unsettled was when a pair of brand new patent leathers came into the set, mistakes and all.</p>
                  <p>Who is the belle? That depends, you know, on who answers. A chorus cries, "Why, the peerless leader of Brooklyn society's inner circle, Miss Katie Smith!" Robed in Cupid's own glow, a beautiful red.</p>
                  <p>In daintiest blue appeared the next popular belle, Miss Julia West. Then in regular order followed a perfect galaxy--in fact, the Muses. Miss Bessie Mitchel in Spanish gold; then Miss Alice Greenly in a queenly robe of white silk; Miss Annie Hawly--and oh, so many more!</p>
                  <p>Miss Evangeline Walker, whose bright eyes and peachy cheeks with their distracting dimples more than ever reminded one of early apple blossoms, robed as she was in snowy white, cut decollete. So many girls were in white, all so pretty! Anno Domini drank in the music of a soft southern voice. All else seemed artificial for the time. Miss Sallie Meyers is as pretty as her voice is sweet and thrilling. Such an accent!</p>
                  <p>You talk of young shoulders and old heads. Well, thats the feeling that assails you when talking with a certain little New Bedford girl. Her name belongs to the firmament.</p>
                  <p>The disappointment of the evening for A. D. was the non-appearance of the most magnificent looking matron in Gotham, she whose every costume is a delight to true artists. The scene needed her glowing South American beauty. The devotees at the Sons must have increased the score to a hundred. Selfish institution! They caused a shadow to fall aslant my otherwise perfect evening.</p>
                  <p>Bright-eyed Annie D-- and her tall fiance came not. The same is true of some of the patronesses. Why?  One, a queenly mother of three princely sons; the other, an aristocrat in every sense of the word, an authority on good form; and her chum; and some of Gotham's schoolma'ams; but thereby hangs a tale!</p>
                  <p>The young matrons were resplendent in their wedding gowns. Mrs. Charles Lansing, Jr., and  her tall husband--the boys insist on his being called Depew--were one of the most distinguished looking couples present. She was delightfully gracious.</p>
                  <p>Lord Chesterfield seemed unhappy, though he escorted a beautiful Norwalk belle, Miss Taylor.</p>
                  <p>Deferential Charles Day was fortunate and to be envied, in succeeding where Brooklyn's favorite tenor singer failed. Miss Mena Downing was radiant.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elizabeth D. White was in every way a patrician in a regal costume of gray, her bright black eyes and lovely silver-colored tresses making her look like a daughter of the Revolution.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Daniel Brooks was, as Mrs. Brooks always is, her own matchless self. Some say in describing her influence upon society, she is the Mrs. Paran Stevens.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Tom Francis contributed largely to a chosen circle. He went around looking for
<pb n="19 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
a novelty that night--a plain looking girl. Everybody was so handsome that he didn't report success. He was simply submerged.</p>
                  <p>Our Rob laughed without smiling.  His heart was in foreign lands--Jersey, I think. But his brother--the most envied as well as most gallant bachelor in the gathering--he escorted Miss Katie Smith, who consequently had to whisper "nay" to four disconsolates.</p>
                  <p>All the favors did not fall to the bachelors, however, for the other fellows, those to whom success never plays shy--they are a success whether or no--the altogether too numerous and too interesting widowers. On this occasion the handsomest was from Albany. The most popular--dare his name be called--the most lately bereaved, came alone.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Harry Mars, with her proud spouse, was everywhere envied as the "little mother." By the way, the "little cherub's"  auntie, the sweetest and prettiest of Dr. White's daughters, Mrs. Jerome Peterson, told me there would be another ball (bawl) soon--the christening.</p>
                  <p>The great bazaar for the Sons is still on as we are obliged to go to press.  "Everybody will be there tomorrow night," Mrs. Harry Kemp said at the ball. But she reckoned without the bachelor's now famous supper and sparkling liquidities. Ah!</p>
                  <p>Some of the yawning beauties did reach St. Philip's Guild organ recital the following night, but I don't know about the bazaar.</p>
                  <p>Though the night was fine in Brooklyn, it must have been foggy on the Jersey coast, for the "Goddess of Liberty" was conspicuous by her absence at the ball. Everybody pitied Our Rob but   ANNO DOMINI.</p>

                     <docDate>May 1895</docDate>
                     <p>
                        <text>
                           <body>
                              <p>In the course of an interesting lecture delivered at Association Hall, Phila., upon The University Idea in Modern Life, Dr. William Pepper, L.L. D., made the following statement:  "The great University movement will not be fully organized until in every part of the country there is felt the same sympathy and interest and obligation now concentrated in a few university towns." In this sentence the keynote of the true mission of this movement has been struck and it is becoming evident that this belief is slowly developing in the minds of many living at widely different points. Paul Quin Monthly, the organ of Paul Quin College, Waco, Texas, announces the opening of a Theological School of Correspondence. We can but feel that this movement is significant of many things. First, at this point there has been sown the seed of University Extension in its deepest sense, its truest meaning. Second, a keener sense of the duty of the university to those who are debarred from attendance at it; and lastly, a fostering of the spirit of helpfulness that remains latent in the breast of all.</p>
                              <p>The University Extension Magazine for January 31 contains a paper front the pen of Prof. Wm. L. Bulkley of Claflin College, Orangeburg, S. C., entitled University Extension in a Southern Town.  We give below in his own words a statement of the plan of work now being carried out under his supervision.  And can only add that the plan is meeting with the success desired.</p>
                              <p>The class we have organized may serve as a model for others.</p>
                              <p>1.	The teachers offer their services gratuitously.</p>
                              <p>2.	The cost to each member is reduced to a minimum, the charge being only for light, fuel and janitor work.</p>
                              <p>If any charge were asked, even fifty cents a month, the very object we have in mind would be defeated, for the class we would reach are absolutely poor, and such is the almost universal rule throughout the South, where wages are small and work is so uncertain.</p>
                              <p>Each member of the class pays one cent a night.  And, again, the cost of books is but little, as most of the instruction is given orally, with blackboard helps.  As the class meets in one of the school-rooms, there is no charge for rent.</p>
                              <p>Finally, the object in starting this class was not only to help the two or three scores who may become members, but also, and chiefly, to set an example to the hundreds of students who come to this school every year from every corner of this state and from adjoining states.  They can, they ought, they will do a like work where they go.  The lesson is one of helpfulness.  It is easy; it is practical; it is Christian. </p>
                              <p>Should such a movement receive encouragement in all the colleges of the South, be they state or church institutions, a decade hence would witness a tremendous improvement in those brawny toilers, whose brain and ambition are vastly larger than their opportunities.</p>
                              <p>Then could we step into a higher plane of University Extension <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> and join hands with our brethren of the North in offering to the workingman, treasures from
<pb n="20 The Woman's Era"/>
the coffers of philosophical, sociological and classical lore.</p>

                     <p>We hope that the example set by these two progressive universities may continue to spread in all directions. Such courses cannot be other than of vast service to a developing race like our own. Some of our magazines might also inaugurate a correspondence course in English literature and history. It would give practice and experience to the teacher of the department and would help to solve the problem among many of our girls as to what they shall read, and what course of study or reading would be most helpful toward supplying them with subjects for thought and hence for conversation.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. F.E.W. Harper, the noted author and temperance worker, read two papers at the Women's National Council held in Washington a few days ago. Her subjects were Woman as a Business Factor, and Is Physical Force the Basis of Government? Both subjects were ably handled.</p>

                     <p>The WOMAN'S ERA has awakened a great interest in club life among Afro-American women. Many are the inquiries sent us as to club work in Philadelphia, but apparently so far we have not developed the fervent club spirit that might have been expected in a City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection. Quite a number of our progressive women in the city are, however, working with the Civic Club. This club holds to Philadelphia the same relation as the Woman's Club, of which Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams lately became a member, holds to the city of Chicago.</p>

                     <p>A bill to revive the whipping post in New York state recently passed one legislative body and came within about four votes of passing the other. As originally phrased, the bill provided that a male person convicted of felony consisting in or accompanied by the infliction of physical pain or suffering upon another might have flogging added to the punishment already provided. The Senate Judiciary at a later date inserted a provision exempting wife beaters from liability to flogging and limited the penalty to persons guilty of assaulting a female or a child of either sex under the age of sixteen years. Now we do not propose to argue the advisability of the revival of the whipping post, but simply to claim that if revived in behalf of any class of criminals that class should be wife beaters, instead of making them exempt. But it would seem that we are to assume from the action of the learned Senate Judiciary committee that reaching the age of sixteen or becoming a wife places one out of the pale of humanity. One may cause the arrest of a brute who assaults a dumb animal but if it be his wife or a person above the age of sixteen, we must stand by and witness such action without protest.</p>
                     <p>It seems that this clause was put in to uphold the authority of the head of the house. Now, it is often said by men that women do not need the suffrage to form laws to ameliorate their own condition because the laws are continually being amended by male legislators against the interests of men solely for the protection of women. Now this may be so in some cases, but does any sane person believe that women legislators would have exempted wife beaters from flogging in the case before us? We hope if the bill comes up again that the Women's Loyal Union with other associations will look after the interests of wife beaters carefully and with tears.</p>

                     <p>Very many suggestions have been made in the various Women's Departments of the journalistic world pointing a way toward the desired result of putting off the hours of the first quarrel between the lately wedded benedict and his charming bride; counting up to one hundred, holding water or beans in one's mouth, and many other bright suggestions have often appeared, but I have just come across "the best yet" and give it at once for the benefit of my readers, many of whom are young and all sweet, who may lapse into matrimony at any time. <hi rend="italic">Quarrel tomorrow</hi>; now tomorrow never comes, hence a quarrel can never come. N. H. Junior, in the Evangelist, acts as sponsor for this new method of avoiding a quarrel and vouches for its success. Let some of The Open Court readers try it and report progress at some future day.</p>

                     <p>Let me correct a wrong impression concerning a certain matter of recent experience. I chanced to speak to a friend of a conversation concerning the entrance of our women writers into the columns of the Ladies' Home Journal to which many of them subscribe; this conversation was noted in a race journal, but feeling that the whole circumstance was not clearly stated I wrote a comment for a prominent journal. The article was cut considerably and from other recent comments I fear that the matter is misunderstood. The policy of Mr. Edward Bok, editor of the Home Journal, is to <hi rend="italic">accept </hi> such articles as have been deemed worthy, yet emanating from the pen of our women, but in two cases at least they have drawn out protests from the subscribers of the dominant race. Now the matter is of great interest to us as a race for the reason that we have long wondered why we could not secure space for good work in white journals, nor yet able replies to attacks on our
<pb n="21 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
race published in great monthlies of the country. I wish the matter to be thoroughly understood and that the editor may not feel misrepresented. The point for us to take to heart is to inquire in other quarters whether protests are being made against the admission of our writers into the higher grade journals, and find out the remedy, if there be any, to offset this system of oppression, and if none, let us at least see the necessity of keeping our dollars at home and continue to build up our journals until they can compete with these from which we are being excluded.</p>

                  <p>Of the finest land on earth, which they intend to colonize with colored people, and at prices within reach of men of small means.

These lands lie 60 miles north from Los Angeles, and 7 miles from the Southern Pacific R.R., and consist of a rich friable loam, being of sedimentary formation mingled with decomposed granite. The soil is from 4 to 50 feet deep, and is capable of producing everything on earth that grows in this land of <hi rend="italic">wonderful production</hi>.</p>
                  <p>It lies at an altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level and is peculiarly on the land of the olive and almond.</p>

                  <p>AFTER 2,000 ACRES HAVE BEEN SOLD</p>
                  <p>the price will be $35.00 per acre.</p>

                  <docDate>June 1895</docDate>
                  <p>"The Business Woman" is now a recognized factor in the world of woman's endeavor. Nevertheless the really successful and businesslike women are exceptions and command attention. This is only natural, as women are new in the field and are not yet too familiar with the paths.  In this field, as in all others, examples may be found of women of all races and colors. Among those who are making names and reputations for business capacity there is probably no woman in the country who is a more striking exampie of pluck and intelligent perseverance than Mrs. Georgianna Whetsel, whose portrait appears with this article. Doubtless many of our readers have heard of Mrs. Whetsel as the only known woman ice merchant. She conducts the largest ice business in Nova Scotia. She is a young woman and a widow. Her husband carried on the business during his life with the aid of three partners, three wagons and four horses. A year after his death she took matters in her own hands and has managed so well that she now owns the entire business and has increased her working force by doubling the number of horses and wagons. Every year has seen an increase in the number of men in her employ, the number of ice houses, carts, machines and ponds owned and controlled by her. Illustrated accounts of the harvesting of ice from her ponds have appeared from time to time in leading papers, which we hope, at some time to reproduce in the ERA, for in Mrs. Whetsel the race has one of its most brilliant examples of business capacity.</p>

                  <p>The Wendell Phillips Club held its quarterly meeting at the Bellevue Cafe Wednesday evening, May 22. The life and service of Frederick Douglass was discussed in conjunction with an appetizing menu spread by caterer Dixon. Mr. Charles Alexander seems to have made the most impressive of the after dinner speeches.</p>
                  <p>West Stockbridge, Lenox and Pittsfield will be the objective point of many of the vivacious school marms from the South and West this summer.  In the beautiful hill country of western Massachusetts was discovered, last summer, two or three boarding places, made so attractive by grand scenery, mountain air, and delicious cooking that the word has been passed along, and the result promises to be a large and jolly party of congenial friends gathered together among the Berkshire Hills. Of course everybody will be in Boston during the Christian Endeavor Convention, thence to scatter all over New England. Newport will probably see the usual coterie of old friends gathered together at the Smith and Dickerson homesteads. And even North Raynham, the antipodes of Newport, is threatened with an invasion of the fashionables.</p>
                  <p>The active and festive Domestic Science Committee of the Woman's Era Club are working hard for the success of the picnic to be given by them for the benefit of St. Monica's Home. Let us all go, and so help raise the amount necessary to keep this, the only home for sick of a particular class, open through the dull summer season.</p>
                  <p>The board of management for the Home for Aged Women on Myrtle St. have at last decided to build, or buy, a more commodious and convenient house to accommodate the ever increasing demands of needy applicants. A committee of the W. E. C. will aid in this good work also. The little fund now held by the president of the club, with that raised last winter by Miss Stewart and ladies of her committee, will be used as a nucleus of the building, or buying, fund. Mrs.Smith, the aged and beloved matron of the home, is slowly recovering from her recent illness.</p>

                  <p>At the annual Exposition of the Brooklyn Literary Union, Mrs. C.A. Attwell, a most successful trained nurse, conducted a hospital department. Beside the natural interest attached to such a movement, there are a few points deserving of more than a passing mention. As a part of the program, a number of our physicians and nurses were invited to be present and otherwise assist in demonstrating to the public the great progress made by this class of our professional men and women. Lectures were arranged for each evening, to be demonstrated by practical work on the part of the nurses, etc. Among the physicians and nurses taking part were Doctors Miller, Lively and W. H. Johnson, and Dr. Hill in company with two nurses from the Freedman's Hospital of Washington, D.C., Mrs. Fleetwood and Hawley, the ladies wearing the uniform of the Freedman's Hospital, blue seersucker dresses, large white aprons, with the regulation shoulder straps and white mob caps.  Mrs. Anna Rich was to have assisted, but was unavoidably detained at her post of duty at the Brooklyn Home for Aged Colored Persons. The point to be emphasized is the skillful and progressive manner in which Mrs. Attwell called the attention of the public to the work being done by our own medical fraternity. Mrs. Attwell might have secured some of the most famous white physicians in either of those two cities, her position and reputation among successful specialists being such as to sustain this supposition; consequently the endorsement which her act implies should be appreciated from a purely professional basis. The same applies to the nurses. It is beyond question that white nurses, graduates from famous schools in this city, would gladly have assisted her, just for the asking, if for no other reason than to attest appreciation for Mrs. Atwell's professional ability.  Notwithstanding this, the ladies in Washington were invited to assist, and to their credit be it said, they not only came, saw, but --conquered. The little incident teaches that when our people will prepare themselves to compete with any other progressive people, they leave no loophole for adverse comparison. There is no question but that those of our own who have, by dint of hard work and innumerable sacrifices, succeeded in making places for themselves, will gladly welcome intelligent candidates in the front ranks. When merit --cold-blooded merit--is the requisite, and not clique sentimentality, there will be less talk of colored people not supporting the enterprises of colored people.</p>
                  <p>The fact that we have paid little attention to the matter of encouraging our girls to enter the profession was painfully evident. Mrs. Attwell is the authority for the statement that, notwithstanding charges to the contrary, a colored girl, capable of filling the requirements (age, education, etc.) will not be refused as a candidate in the training schools of New York; yet there seems to be no disposition on the part of our young women to avail themselves of the privileges thus offered.  If they were wise, they would apply before a school has been established "for colored." Separate institutions should never be countenanced unless it can be authoritatively proven that they are a necessity.  Mrs. Attwell's department forcibly opened these questions before our people in a manner which will certainly make those who desire to progress think and, we hope, act.</p>
                  <p>A most unique exhibition was held during the early part of May, in one of the beautiful salons of the palatial Waldorf. It will be remembered that the Duke de Veirgua was entertained at this hotel during his stay while in this city. The affair in question was an exhibition of the industrial progress made by the various schools having industrial departments. The exhibits ranged over a wide class of work, from plain sewIng, patching, darning, button-hole making, to the most artistic accomplishments of modern dressmaking, millinery, tailoring and the most beautiful embroidery, lace making, knitting and crocheting.</p>
                  <p>There was a most creditable exhibit from Washington, D. C., in charge of Miss Siphax, the only one from a distinctively colored school, and in every essential it was on a par with any shown, excepting, of course, the French work, and nothing exhibited was comparable to this in artistic finish. In showing us the beauties of the latter, Miss Siphax volunteered the information that in France children are given lessons in needlework as soon as they can handle safely a needle, and by the time they are nine or twelve
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
years old they are accomplished in some of the most difficult grades. This accounted for the beautiful symmetry and delicate finish of the French exhibit, which contained many samples executed by children seven, nine, ten and eleven years of age. Miss Siphax further explained that this was largely true of Egypt, where fine linen was combined in a most wonderful manner with what they term metal embroidery. A sample of this work was pointed out to us that would otherwise have escaped our attention. In appearance it was like a drawn lace pattern outlined by gold threads; on close examination it was found to be very beautiful. When explaining her own methods in instructing the beginners under her charge, Miss Siphax was surrounded by many interested ladies at all times. The work brought on by her received many favorable comments, and deservedly; for in general arrangement, neatness, scope and artistic effect it was second to none in kind at the exhibition. It is to be regretted that a larger percentage of our women did not attend, as the affair in every particular was managed by true women, in what means all that could possibly be inferred by the term "real ladies." Among the visitors was Mrs. Octavio Furguson of Richmond, Va.</p>

                  <p>It is surprising to note the number of intelligent persons of both races who persist in writing the word Negro with a little <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, while at, the same time they honor every other race, Jew, Greek, Gentile and what-not, with a capital. Quite a number of race journals are assuming, with an avidity, the newly-coined appellation, Afro-American, which has nothing but its euphony to commend it to the use of its followers. Of the two words Negro and Afro-American, the one, etymologically speaking, expresses as much toward designating us as a race as the other; but it is a late hour in the day to discard the former, in which there is nothing dishonorable, and submit to the ludicrous christening of the latter, which is at best a cowardly and ineffective dodge of a time-honored name. It bears repetition, so far as we are cognizant, no dishonor attaches itself to the word, and until a better one can be found for us to answer to, the only manly and womanly thing to do is to "acknowledge the corn," and by our deeds make it "worthy its hire."</p>
                  <p>At its last meeting the Woman's Mutual Improvement Club heartily indorsed the action of the Woman's Era Club in its condemnation of the too prevalent custom of ticket selling by girls and young women, and its members seeing the evil done in their own midst by the same greed of gain, have without permission of their worthy exemplars in the far away Hub, adopted the same resolution. Mrs. A. S. Jones is chairman of a committee of three to enlist the co-operation of the different ministers in the city of Knoxville in trying to abolish the pernicious practice.</p>
                  <p>On May 10 Booker T. Washington lectured to a small though appreciative audience at Knoxville College. His subject, "Mind and Matter," is said to have been ably handled.</p>
                  <p>Rev. G.V. Clark of  Memphis, Chief Commissioner of Tennessee for the Cotton States and International Exposition, was in the city on April 30, on official business.</p>
                  <p>Mr. William H. Mason, a Knoxville boy, graduated on the 27th ult. from the Department of Music of Fisk University. Mr. John C. Dodson, also of Knoxville, assisted in his public piano forte recital.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Hester Ford, an energetic little woman of Ashville, N.C., is said to have sold in our city five hundred or more of the handsome steel engravings of the late Frederick Douglass. When shown a copy of the ERA, she did not wait for your correspondent to solicit her subscription, but forthwith ordered it, with "spot cash," to be sent her one year.</p>
                  <p>The proverbial unexpected, a cold wave, came last week and changed very materially the aspect of the season. Without, though cold enough for winter wraps, vegetation was exuberant in growth, and the flower-laden fields were loudly odorous; within, the busy housewife wore a forlorn look because grates had to be replaced and fires made to thaw out baby's benumbed toes, thus necessitating a sad disarrangement of her house.</p>

                  <p>The summer ending of school days is upon us and there are few households that are not more or less effected by preparations for the eager young graduate. The people's interest in their institutions of learning has never been so strong as now. The press and magazines have done so much to cultivate public interest in the educational work of our institutions of learning that commencement day is fast becoming the most popular event in the year's calendar of great occurrences.</p>
                  <p>Aside from being a day of inspiration to student, relief to teacher, and of growing interest to the thousands who put themselves in touch with the festive spirit of graduating times, commencement day has come to mean a day of annual recounting of our gains in the forces of intelligence and culture.</p>
                  <p>The men and women who now deliver commencement addresses are selected with the view of being able to utter something of interest to people outside the college walls. We now eagerly look forward to the commencement oration as having a meaning to all men and women who are eager to know and to do their full duty as citizens. On no other occasion in the year does the American orator have so large and appreciative an audience as on the day of university commencement. The people are in a receptive mood for reading and thinking, and the man who can say something interesting, instructive and inspiring on this occasion enjoys a rare opportunity for doing good.</p>
                  <p>We women have a special and growing interest in these commencement occasions, because they mean such a helpful reinforcement to the intelligence of our working forces. With a due appreciation of the thousands of educated and capable women who have done so much to advance our peculiar interests, we are yet lacking in women whose mental training has given them a sanity and balance of judgment and steadiness of conviction in affairs of large importance.</p>
                  <p>Women who have daughters capable of culture can do nothing better for womankind, as well as for the daughters, than to give them the advantage of a college training, or an education that will have an equivalent value in the quality of their intelligence. The mental discipline and culture that are the most important furnishings of a university education will save us from many humiliating mistakes in our public efforts, and will tend to lesson the small jealousies, petty envies and the general unkindness of woman for womankind.  Oh, for some kind of culture or talisman that will save us women from being consumed by each other in our ambitions to be useful in this world of ours!</p>
                  <p>While talking about women's peculiar interest in commencement week, it is perhaps offensively irrelevant to suggest a subject so dreary and irritating as that of moving and house-cleaning. But oh my, it is such a season of misery for all of us that the thought of it intrudes itself in spite of ourselves.  This is the season of the year when all of our weaknesses seem to be on trial. By the general consent of all womankind and the amiable tolerance of our "lords and masters," we lay aside our sweetness, our lovableness and charms and put in evidence all our hatefulness and biting impatience against every body and every thing.  Womankind seems to take a savage delight in this season of cleaning, renovating and reordering of her household.</p>
                  <p>If it be true that in the spring the young man's fancy turns to wooing and home making, it is equally true that the married man's realities tempt him to stray as far as possible froin the disturbances of his own roof tree. I think we would all be frightened if it could be made clear to us how much of domestic unhappiness and family disintegration are traceable to these spring time outbreaks of woman's peevishness.</p>
                  <p>What poor creatures we are, and how slowly we emancipate ourselves from many of our self-imposed afflictions!  Fretfulness over housecleaning, like tight lacing and balloon sleeves, seem to be some of our cherished miseries. Perhaps the college bred woman will, by and by, show us how to meet and treat philosophically these many disagreeable necessities. Then again, we have some hope in those useful inventions that year by year are diminishing the drudgery of home keeping. It really looks as if steam and gas and electricity, in various ways, are soon to make all kinds of housekeeping so delightfully easy that woman's only cause for ill-temper will
<pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
 be too much leisure. In the meantime, it is to be fervently hoped that we will become strong enough in the command of our better selves to endure more gracefully the trials of our little responsibilities.  Woman will make a very sorry figure in the contentions of politics and business, and in the larger questions of public concern if she fail to cultivate the patience, the good judgment and good sense that she nw so often lacks in the domestic sphere.</p>

                  <p>Owing to a temporary blindness, entailing great suffering and much inconvenience, the writer of this column was unable to get any matter ready for the May issue.</p>
                  <p>One of the most interesting things just about now is the decision of the Phyllis Wheatley Woman's Club to not only countenance the negro building at the Atlanta exposition, which opens in September, but to send an exhibit. This decision was arrived at, though not without some discussion on the part of the members and a little bitterness. It was argued that the line drawn in the South was drawn enough by the "other side," without our attempting to do anything of that sort ourselves. But, as one of the members expressed it, the exposition would certainly go on, and whether we countenanced it or not the Negro Department would be a success, Phyllis Wheatley Club to the contrary. The only way to convince our friends on the other side that we could do anything was to <hi rend="italic">show</hi> them, and here was an excellent chance to show as individuals and members of a race popularly supposed to he unable to do anything but subsist upon the charity of others. There is no doubt but that this exposition, like the one in Chicago, if not representing the negroes would be censured for it by them, and when a disposition is shown by the commissioners to grant space, the usual kick is made. The upshot of it all was that the club gave its decision not only to countenance the negro building but to make an exhibit there.</p>
                  <p>Another series of violent discussions which have been lasting some months  were recently closed by the dedication of the new St. Catherine's church in Tulane Ave.  St. Catherine's occupies the site of the old St. Joseph, now one of the largest churches in America.</p>
                  <p>When Mother Catherine Drexel some while ago sent Archbishop Janssens a handsome sum of money to be used in a manner that would do most good to the colored people of New Orleans, a clamor for a new church, a Catholic church exelusively for the colored people, where they might be ensured from discrimination of any sort, where there could be colored altar boys, a colored choir, and, if necessary, a colored priest. So preparations were made to embellish and repair the old church and it was announced that all would be ready in a short while. A storm of opposition was raised at once, newspapers and editors waxed furious; the archbishop was deluged in petitions, some lengthy, some pithy, some with many signatures, some with a few signatures that meant something. The archbishop was also kept busy receiving delegations of objectors who besieged him with reasons why this thing could not be.  But the preparations for the new church went right on.</p>
                  <p>As a matter of fact, it is unfortunate that the colored people of New Orleans should be instrumental in separating themselves from the rest of the Catholics in the city. The Catholic religion is the one broad common plane where all might meet and for the nonce forget the petty prejudices of birth or race. Within the average Catholic church prince or peasant, maid and mistress, man and master may kneel side by side and receive alike impartially the bread of the communion table. The separation of the colored people by themselves from the rest of the city is destroying the most beautiful portion of the Catholic creed. True the archbishop has made it most plain that this church does not, of a necessity, compel all colored people of the Catholic persuasion to attend it. That it is for one parish alone and only for those who desire to attend, and that the doors and pews and confessionals of the other Catholic churches are open as widely as ever to the colored people. But it is plain to see that it won't be long before such gentle means as a quiet discrimination all along the parishes will force the colored worshippers into the "Jim Crow" church. It is indeed quite an unfortunate move.</p>
                  <p>The Teachers' League has been busy for the
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
past month. Our kindergartens and kindergarteners are, or rather were, <hi rend="italic">non est</hi>. So the league secured the services of Miss Elizabeth K. Mathews from Des Moines, Ia., to come here for a month and hold classes of the members of the league. The classes were held every afternoon from three to five, special permission having been obtained from the superintendent, Mr. Easton, to dismiss those teachers who were interested a half hour earlier than usual. The work done was very interesting and a great deal was accomplished in a month's time. The result of Miss Mathew's labor was visible in an increased interest in the school work and in the introduction of more manual training in the schools.</p>
                  <p>While here she visited and worked with pupils and teachers in the different schools, attended and addressed a meeting of not only the Teachers' League but the Phyllis Wheatley Club also. Miss Mathews also gave a lecture, "A Trip to Yellowstone Park," for the benefit of the Phyllis Wheatley Club.</p>
                  <p>The air is full of Commencement. Out of the four large universities here, three, Leland, Straight and New Orleans, have closed, leaving only Southern and the public schools to drag through the long hot month of June. Straight University fairly outdid itself in the matter of Commencement Week. It always has an entire week given over to festivities of a general nature, but this year the festivities were unusually interesting. The class of '95 is the largest one since the year of 1888.</p>
                  <p>Two new things crowned the year's work. First, the alunini did away with their annual reception, and second, the school granted its first musical certificate.</p>
                  <p>Heretofore the immense reception given by Straight University Alumni has always been looked forward to with no little interest by the friends and patrons of the school. The evening before Commencement was spent by the alumnae in a banquet tendered by the school from five to seven, of which members only were allowed to partake. This was followed by a reception from seven to ten, to which each member had issued invitations, and as the body numbers some two hundred or more it was necessarily large. There was always a musical and literary programme, refreshments and a jollification. But this year all was changed; there was only the banquet, the annual address, which was delivered by Dr. A.J. Lopez, some music, and that was all. The sum usually expended for the reception was placed to the account of the school.</p>
                  <p>The other event of peculiar importance was the completion of the musical course by Miss Beatrice F. Rochin. It is the first time in the history of the university that any pupil has stuck to the eight years' study requisite for a completion of piano course. Miss Rochin of '95 celebrated her victory the Thursday before Commencement by a recital, assisted by her sister, Miss Anita, '95, and Mr. Wendell McNeal, '96, on the violin, Mr. Lockhard, '95, with a vocal solo, and a number of young ladies of the Normal department in Delsarte tableaux. Miss Rochin had a very trying ordeal to pass through in playing solo after solo before an intensely critical and rather incredulous audience, but she acquitted herself magnificently and won applause and flowers by the load.</p>

                  <p>In the April number of the ERA perhaps it will be remembered that in this column were pressed the claims of women to greater recognition in the government of the churches. The Vestry of St. Thomas' P. E. Church early in April passed a resolution allowing women in good financial standing to vote at the Easter election for officers for the ensuing year. It was very fitting that the initiative should be taken by the vestry of one of the oldest churches in the United States, which keeps up the high standard and courageous resolution of their forefathers, who founded this chuch in the infancy of the republic.</p>
                  <p>This extension of the franchise was accepted by the women in a very serene and matter-of-fact way. There was no unseemly haste; less than one-third of the eligible women voted. Those who expected strife and a complete reorganization of the church officers, found to their surprise the old vestry re-elected, with one exception, a faithful and efficient vestryman who desired to be excused from serving this year. Let the good work go on. We hope that soon in every church the women will be shown common justice.</p>
                  <pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>In the Diocesan Convention held early in May in our city, the question of admitting women as delegates was warmly discussed. Many clergymen supported the proposition, but one prominent and venerable layman delivered a passionate speech in which he fervently hoped that he should never live to see the day when one of these "new women" were seated in the convention. He spoke at length on the subject and declared that she is "a horrid creature." The motion was not disposed of finally, but was left an open question for the time.</p>
                  <p>One is tempted to sympathize with this view of the new woman. That term and the phrase <hi rend="italic">fin de siecle</hi>have surely earned a long rest. It is a question with me whether there really is any "Mrs. Harris," in the words of Betsey Prigg. It is the same old woman, the eternal feminine, only the outward visible sign has changed somewhat. The higher education, the attention to athletic sports, the greater knowledge of hygiene and proper food, the thick-sole shoes, the warm winter flannels, have all made her what Emerson says it is everybody's first duty to be, "a good animal."</p>
                  <p>With this grateful sense of physical well-being has come that joyous expansion, that exuberance that all happy, healthy people feel. It has become a necessity for her to find an outlet for all this energy, hence her interest in church and state, in all that is on the earth or in the waters under the earth. Look in the home, is she not a more intelligent companion, a wiser, more judicious mother, a more stimulating and sympathetic friend? Surely the vast majority of the women of today are like the picture I have drawn, and may it be a continually decreasing number who may be described in the words of the Rabbi Voorsanger of Los Angeles, who says, "The new woman is a rampant and rebellious woman, who gathers in conventions and talks much; a reformer who seeks to lay bare the rotten foundations of society; an evolved species of Roman matron with a tongue like a lash and a rod of chastisement in her fair fist."</p>
                  <p>Not many years ago some of us can remember that southern alarmists created a wave of interest that rolled all over the country, by reporting the alarming rate of increase in the negro population. It was predicted that the black man and brother would cover the face of the earth, as did the locusts in Pharaoh's time, and devour every green thing in the shape of a white man. Tables were compiled, and truly alarming progressions were
<gap agent="tape" extent="10 lines"/>and diseases resultant from immorality.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Furman J. Shadd's contribution to the New York <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> of May 16, in refutation of the idea that we will shortly be eliminated front the problem, is timely and reassuring. Having the wide experience that he has among the 87,000 negroes of the District of Columbia, he is able to speak with authority, and shows that even if the state of South Carolina is losing her black population, there has been in the District since 1876 a steady decrease in mortality and a regular increase in population, showing that the negro is one fourth more productive than the white race.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Shadd is hopeful of a greater improvement every year in the sanitary condition of the poor and the consequent lessened death rate. What would become of the country if there was no negro problem? All of us who are teachers know too well of the causes that lead to this alarming death rate. The insufficient clothing, the lowered vitality from improper and irregularly taken food, and the frightful ravages of that scourge consumption, brought on by night after night, during weeks in the depths of winter, attending revivals. With nerves stretched tense and bodies reeking with perspiration they come out in the icy air.</p>
                  <p>Some modern Paul must write an Epistle to the Ministers of these people. That is the surest way to reach the majority. The minister is their literature, their book, their paper, their only way of coming into touch with anything that helps them to grow towards the light.</p>

                  <p>There are two sides to almost every question. There is nothing very new or original in this remark, but it is suggested anew by the proposed Atlanta Exposition. There are good reasons why the colored people should be represented there and take advantage or this new and large opportunity of vindicating themselves, their enterprise and intelligrence. Now that our people have entered upon the project, it is hoped that it will be a great success. Nevertheless we cannot wholly endorse the movement; such exhibitions never do and never can do justice to the colored people. It is as impossible to separate the work of the whites and the blacks as it is to separate the work of those who have Irish or German blood. The result is inevitably meager, inadequate and mortifying.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, the Atlanta Exposition will carry with it the most humiliating conditions for all colored visitors. The commissioner general declares that <hi rend="italic"> we shall have all the rights we desire!</hi> But in the light of the past estimate put upon us and our desires, this is not reassuring. Doubtless the commissioners will add largely to their finances by including an exhibit from our colored people, but it is doubtful if one jot or tittle of the merciless discrimination carried on in the south will be abated on the fair grounds at this time.</p>
                  <p>We are open to conviction, but it seems to us that the only gain made will come to the managers, and that the "colored department" will be left entirely to the colored people, with the result that we shall not have grown over rich in dignity or worth in the eyes of the other race, and at the same time we shall be probably financial losers.</p>
                  <p>However we shall watch and wait and hope for the best.</p>

                  <p>The coming together of our women from all over the country for consultation, for conference, for the personal exchange of greeting, which means so much in the way of encouragement and inspiration, has been a burning desire in the breasts of the colored women in every section of the United States.</p>
                  <p>The matter has been discussed and re-discussed. Of some things all are convinced--the need of such a conference is great, the benefit to be derived inevitable and inestimable. In view of this, we, the women of the Woman's Era Club of Boston, send forth a call to our sisters all over the country, members of all clubs, societies, associations, or circles to meet with us in conference in this city of Boston.</p>
                  <p>And we urge upon all clubs, societies, associations and circles to take immediate action, looking towards the sending of delegates to this convention.</p>
                  <p>Boston has been selected as a meeting place because it has seemed to be the general opinion that here, and here only can be found the atmosphere which would best interpret and represent us, our position, our needs and our aims. One of the pressing needs of our cause is the education of the public to a just appreciation of us, and only here can we gain the attention upon which so much depends.</p>
                  <p>It is designed to hold the convention three days, the first of which will be given up to business, the second and third to the consideration of vital questions concerning our moral, mental, physical and financial growth and well-being, these to be presented through addresses by representative women.</p>
                  <p>Although this matter of a convention has been talked over for some time, the subject has been precipitated by a letter to England, written by a southern editor, and reflecting upon the moral character of all colored women; this letter is too indecent for publication, but a copy of it is sent with this call to all the women's bodies throughout the country. Read this document carefully and use discriminatingly and decide if it be not time for us to stand before the world and declare ourselves and our principles.</p>
                  <p>The time is short, but everything is ripe; and remember, earnest women can do anything.</p>
                  <p>A circular letter will be sent you in the meantime. Let us hear at once from you.</p>

                  <p>In the May issue of this paper, the ERA's comments on Mrs. Terrell were unfortunately placed in the department edited by that lady. Probably every reader understood the situation; nevertheless it is a matter of annoyance to the editors that there should be the chance or the likelihood of any readers believing that
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Mrs. Terrell was indulging in self-praise. By the same mischance, the fine article contributed by Mrs. Fannie B. Williams on "The Need of Co-operation of Men and Women in Correctional Work " was divided and the continuity of thought broken by placing the last portion on the editorial page.</p>
                  <p>We know that many of our readers are unacquainted with Colonel Dargan of Sumter, South Carolina; we therefore take pleasure in introducing him and his paper, the "Free Speech," to our readers. Colonel Dargan is indeed a rara avis --a secessionist, a confederate officer, with every interest in the south, he is now a fearless champion of justice and free speech. Considering the sentiment upon which he has been reared, his comments upon the approaching constitutional convention and the iniquity of the attempt to disenfranchise the black race are remarkable for their fearlessness. The south is very boastful of the bravery of its sons. Here is an example of genuine bravery. That it is so conspicuous shows the rarity of the true article in that portion of the country.</p>
                  <p>Let the good work go on in the meantime. We can all take hope and read the Sumter "Free Speech." One good man can work wonders.</p>

                  <docDate>June 1895</docDate>
                  <p>The editors of the WOMAN'S ERA are in receipt of a letter from Miss Florence Belgarnie, Honorable Secretary of the Anti-Lynching Society of England, in which she encloses a letter from Mr. James W. Jack, president of the Missouri Press Association. The letter of Mr. Jack to Miss Belgarnie is a denouncement of the morality of the colored women of America, and also a criticism of the peculiar ideas of virtue and morality held by everybody but the people of the south and west. Miss Belgarnie forwards the letter for publication in the ERA, with an expression of sympathy and indignation for the slurs we, as colored women, are subjected to. As the charges in this letter are so sweeping and so base, we have decided not to act hastily upon it, but to be very careful in our method of bringing it before the public. Our line of action has already begun; the letter will be printed and forwarded to leading men and women and heads of educational institutions, particularly in the south, people of reputation and standing, whose words carry weight; and in the next issue it is hoped to print the charge, with these signed replies.</p>
                  <p>The matter is a solemn one, and one upon which we shall call all our women all over the country to act. In the meantime we wish to move with discretion, and so not defeat the ultimate aim, which is the confusion of Jack and that host of traducers who are so free in bringing the charge of immorality upon all colored women.</p>

                  <p>Since I am requested to furnish news notes I hope you will allow me space for a few thoughts along the line of the most engrossing, topic at this time in Virginia as well as elsewhere, viz., Commencement. Not a more applicable title could be suggested for the time of completion of the college curriculum than Commencement, for those leaving its walls have been trained to gather discreetly the grains of knowledge, and they are therefore sent out to engage in the great army in defnce of truth and right. They go with the problem yet to be solved--education the unknown quantity, works of great educators, perseverance and diligence represent the known quantities.</p>
                  <p>The solution of this problem is not accomplished in a lifetime. Those who give a proper estimate to the value of an education will rather rejoice that the end of learning to them is very much the same as the end of the rainbow to a little child, the longer he tries to find it the farther it seems to be from him.</p>
                  <p>The effect of the research may be disappointment and discouragement for the child, while the true student is enthused by the knowledge that the more the obstacles he conquers in his onward march the higher he places himself on the ladder which reaches perfection. Hence his determination should be not to stand still, but to go on and on.</p>
                  <p>"The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight."</p>
                  <p>Each life carries with it an influence of elevation or degradation. What a weight of responsibility rests upon each individual. The greater the advantages the greater the responsibility.</p>
                  <p>From many schools and colleges hundreds of students have been licensed to toil unaided in the great field of labor, to gather in and store the mind with great truths that will serve as food for the mental powers and as seed falling in good ground, yielding, some thirty, some sixty and some an hundred fold.  Great truths that men of wonderful mental faculties have pondered over
<pb n="10 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
and developed, must be searched and weighed, reserving such as cause the mind to expand and reach out for other facts, in order to strengthen and build strong intellects. Students should endeavor to grow strong intellectually, so as not to be cast about by every attempt on the part of opposers to revolutionize well-founded theories, but by careful study so fortify themselves on the subjects as to become stronger advocates of the right. Diligence is the price of success, so no student needs be lacking in the material by which to acquire knowledge. One important point should be borne in mind, viz., the acquirement of an education, in the limited sense of the term, does not depend upon the number of books read nor the variety of literature, but upon the thorough study and digestion of the most important subjects by authors of worth and literary standing.</p>
                  <p>The discontinuance of attendance in a school, after having completed the prescribed course of study in that institution, does not signify that the mental powers have become thoroughly developed and the education completed.</p>

                  <p>The Virginia Baptist State Convention met in Suffolk, Va., May 9, 1895, and continued during that week. The ministerial shepherds are with their flocks again. The presidency of the Virginia Seminary seemed to have been the main topic for discussion. From all accounts we hear of the convention this matter consumed by far the greater portion of the session. Pres. G. W. Hayes was re-elected.</p>
                  <p>"The following Board of Trustees were elected for the Seminary:</p>
                  <p>"May 31, 1898 - - Rev. W.F. Graham, Mr. John Mitchell, Jr., Rev. R.H. Bolling. May 31, 1896 - - Revs. A. Binga, Jr., A. Gordon, John W. Kirby. May 31, 1897 - - Revs. J. M. Armistead, P.F. Morris, D.W. Vassar." --<hi rend="italic">Planet</hi>.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias convened on Newport News, Va., May 15, 1895. The gathering was very enthusiastic and much business for the order was transacted. The address of Grand Chancellor John Mitchell, Jr., was received with much applause and a vote of thanks tendered him for the noble sentiments which it contained.</p>
                  <p>Miss Annestine Snyder of Charleston, West Va., passed through Richmond May 17, from Shaw University, N. C., en route to her home. While in R. she was the guest of Mrs. Bowser.</p>

                  <p>No utterances of the year have come nearer to striking the keynote of race progress in America than those of Prof. Booker T. Washington in his address before the students of Fisk University; and even at the risk of being considered an echo, we must repeat that industrial training through its resultant skilled labor has been for every race, and will be for the Negro race, the most potent force in its development.</p>
                  <p>It has required years for the "industrial idea" in education to stamp itself upon the educational system of America, and we question whether the impress is yet sufficiently deep; but financial crises, the continuous influx of foreign skilled labor, and the losses sustained by the American laborer, if he is not equally skillful, are creating forceful demonstrations of the necessity for practical training in this direction. Afro-American labor is not foreign labor in the sense usually implied by this term; and in past decades it was a mainspring in developing the resources of a new country. In those years, the artisans of the South, the skilled laborers, as matters then stood, were colored men, and the inventive genius then exemplified by individual members of the race, even under those exceedingly unfavorable environments, furnish proof of our inherent creative capacity; and when at last the doors of school and college were opened to the descendants of these mechanics, had the industrial idea been as firmly engrafted upon the American system of education as at present, the future prospect of these comparatively young people would be brighter than it now is, for the trained hand must keep pace with the trained mind in order to be able to express the conceptions of the mind in material form.</p>
                  <p>Says Dr. Coffin, in an editorial appearing in the April <hi rend="italic">A.M.E. Church Review</hi>, "We are not fully aware ourselves, nor are the people among whom we live aware of what we have really accomplished since the war. The advancement in material wealth, and in education, including the professions, has indeed been marvellous.</p>
                  <pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>Our advancement in mechanical skill has not yet been equal to the progress made in literary pursuits. . . . But attention is now being turned and we think wisely, too, toward the workshop."</p>
                  <p>We are indebted to inventive genius for all the means of rapid transit, expeditious communication, the product of remote sections, the comforts in home, hotel and shop, the means of social and intellectual gratification which render life in the nineteenth century so far above all preceding centuries. In this march of progress, a few important inventions have originated in the brain of a Negro, but we must work more strenuously to stimulate the creative faculty, if we would maintain a permanent hold upon civilization in America or elsewhere. We must seize with avidity upon the industrial factors of education. Especially do our little ones need the industrial features of the kindergarten; and when parents and teachers fully realize this fact, then, from its earliest years, the child will be taught to contrast and to invent articles according to scientific principles. We do not, indeed, need a smaller number of scholarly men and women, but a much larger quota of those who to their literary attainments add the power to produce something which is a necessity to the masses. We need not less intellectual training in the field of higher education, but more practical education.</p>
                  <p>The young colored man who graduated from Lawrence University, Kansas, and then went, to his farm and settled down to solid work with the remark, "If the white race need scientific farmers, surely my race does," has solved the "race problem" for himself, and has furnished an example which many individuals can afflord to emulate. With pride from year to year we read that the "Potato King" of the Missouri Valley is a colored man; a man who by reducing the production of the tuber to a scientific process is bringing forth from his acres both fame and fortune--capital, that commodity which added to a better knowledge of investing it, is so great a necessity in the present stage of our development. The Afro-American of the United States is for various reasons behind his brother in the more advanced of the South American states in the acquisition of wealth, and therefore in the development of those enterprises which require the outlay of large amounts of capital. We are not particularly interested in trust companies, mining plants and grinding monopolies, although, from the force of habit, we read of and discuss them; but we have little capital invested in those lines. In the South, as an agricultural laborer, the Negro is a great industrial factor; but not until he owns the cotton and rice fields, the turpentine orchards and cane plantations in which he now labors, can he be considered in any sense a controling factor of the South; nor can we hope to take front rank in any department of civilized life until we are part and parcel of large industries.</p>
                  <p>Thus far in our career we may justly be accused of a quality which George Eliot styles "other worldliness." We need more of an eye to the main chance; or as Carnegie is said to have put it when, looking at a young man's collection of coins, "A very good thing to have in its way, a very good thing; but I tell you, young man, the coin to look out for is the American dollar."</p>
                  <p>Every Negro inventor of high rank, every scientific farmer, artisan, or tradesman, takes a long step ahead for his race, since the world is clamoring for proofs of our capacity, originality, and culture; hence the industrial schools should be intensely practical and filled to overflowing with our young people; for it matters not whether the Negro deciides to remain here, or migrate elsewhere, always and everywhere will he find this problem of scientific and industrial training confronting him, and, unless he learns to solve it under all of its conditions, possible and probable, will find himself a negative quality.  The South needs skilled laborers to develop her valuable resources, Mexico, South America and Africa the same; and the brainy men of each section, or country, will diligently seek until the find the laborer best qualified for the work; obviously then, the colored man need not run from the conditions which he finds in the United States, and unless he possesses superior industrial training may as well take his chances here as elsewhere.  A recent writer from Africa to the <hi rend="italic">New York Age</hi> states that those Afro-Americans who come to colonize in Africa should be civil engineers, mechanics, practical farmers, etc., and should bring capital with them. In other words, they should be of the order of colonists that brought about the most safisfactory results in the colonization of America, Australia, India, and the Islands of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The simple act of departing for "Africa, the home of our fathers," is not sufficient to secure even a foothold in a country already largely under the control of the English, French, Belgians, Germans, Italians, Portuguese and Turks, each
<pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
pressing to the utmost the development of the immense riches to which they have laid claim; each desirous of building up colonies toward which they desire to attract the surplus of their population; and looking the facts squarely in the face, it seems highly probable, that the African in Africa, like the Indian in America, will soon be dispossessed of his own soil. Is there not a possible remedy for the ills which confront us here, there and everywhere, in practical industrial training?</p>

                  <p>Everytbing in the outer world is suggestive of growth. White blossoms and hopeful green greet us on all sides. The whole landscape is rich in floral splendor. Nature also speaks to us joyously, tenderly, in the songs of birds.</p>
                  <p>When we consider that only a few months since, the plant was in embryo, we are filled with amazement at the mysterious and wonderful change.  The necessary outward influences--warmth, air, light and moisture--have caused it to grow harmoniously.</p>
                  <p>The question arises as to whether the growth and expansion of the "Woman Suffrage Plant" is commensurate with that in the natural world.</p>
                  <p>That three women were sent to act as legislators is in advance of the old regime. These women representatives have shown a progressive spirit in the measures they have advocated. Mrs. Holly introduced eleven bills, Mrs. Klock, three, and Mrs. Cressingham, four.</p>
                  <p>Two of Mrs. Cressingham's bills are designed to promote the sugar beet industry. "She believes in the possibilities of the sugar beet. Can cite facts and figures to show that she has studied the subject and is sure that in the cultivation of this saccharine vegetable there is a remedy for the wretched condition of the people where there is but a small rainfall and no large streams from which to irrigate."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Cressingham's third bill amends a section of the school law. In some of the southern counties of the state, Spanish was the language used in the schools. Her bill provides that English shall be the language in all public schools. Her last bill was for the creation of a "state board for the arbitration of controversies arising between employer and employee."</p>
                  <p>The Hon. Frances Klock, also of Arapahoe, presented "House joint memorial No. 6," asking Congress  "to grant the military reservation known as Fort Lyon to the state of Colorado for the purpose of establishing a soldiers' home at that place," the present home at Monte Vista being very undesirable.</p>
                  <p>Her second bill provides for the support of the state home and industrial school for girls. Her last bill deals with the same matter, but states in detail how the home is to be managed. All the officers and assistants shall be women excepting one member of the board.</p>
                  <p>Representative Holly of Pueblo, has the honor of being the first woman to introduce a bill in the house -- "the age of consent bill." One bill is a constitutional amendinent, and amends a certain section of an article which now permits a foreigner to vote upon declaring his intention to become a citizen. The proposed amendment enfranchises every person (instead of every male person) over the age of twenty-one years, provided, first, that "he or she shall be a citizen of the United States." And second, that "he or she shall be able to read the constitution in the English language."</p>
                  <p>A third bill also deals with the election laws. A fourth, refers to school matters. A fifth, affects the property of unmarried men who die without wills. Their possessions did revert to the father; this bill asks that such property be evenly divided between the parents of the deceased. A sixth asked cases concerning the validity of wills and testaments be placed at the head of the docket. Two other bills provide for the punishment of persons guilty of enticing boys or girls under twenty-one years into places of ill repute. A ninth bill provides for a truant officer. The tenth, concerns divorce and alimony.</p>
                  <p>"You will laugh at my last bill, for it is kind
<pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
of queer; it is a bill to give women all the rights that men have," said Mrs. Holly.</p>
                  <p>Passing over the city election which was not satisfactory to the majority of thinking women, we come to the school election, the result of which was to put another broad-minded, progressive woman on the school board.</p>
                  <p>Woman's work in politics must be like that of the chambered nautilus, the spiral animal, which after completing one house or shell proceeds to make another and so is constantly advancing.</p>
                  <p>There are several civic leagues in process of formation which organize to work for better municipal government.</p>
                  <p>On the 9th of May, the women of Denver had the inestimable privilege of greeting and listening to those grand, rare women, Miss Susan B. Anthony and Rev. Anna Shaw. Their visit here was brief, as they hastened on to congratulate Utah on adding the suffrage plank to the constitution.</p>

                  <p>It gives us great pleasure to state the fact that, with this month's issue of the WOMAN's ERA the Open Court has passed the limit of its fiftieth subscription. We feel especially grateful to Mrs. J.H. Armstrong, wife of the Financial Secretary of the A.M.E. Church, Miss Emma K. White, a teacher in the public schools, of Chester, Miss Lillian Spencer of Wilmington public schools, and Miss Lillian Thompson of Bridgeton, daughter of Rev. Joseph Thompson, D.D., pastor at that point. These ladies have shown their interest in the work in various substantial forms. Mrs. Armstrong sends us for May five subscriptions and such an encouraging, helpful letter. Through the kindness and perseverance of Miss Emma K. White the sum of fifteen dollars has been secured in aid of a worthy student. Miss Spencer and Miss Thompson are each assisting in the enlargement our subscription list.</p>
                  <p>As contributors to the literary work of the Open Court, we have secured the services of Miss Lillian V. Thompson, whose able paper on "Frederick Douglass compared with England's great Commoner," appeared in the memorial issue of the <hi rend="italic">Christian Recorder</hi> and of Miss Sarah E. Tanner, Principal of the Bordentown Industrial School, N.J., and Miss Emma K. White of Chester High School. The two last mentioned ladies will entertain and instruct the readers of the Open Court, Miss Tanner in this month's issue of the ERA, and Miss White in the July Number.</p>
                  <p>June, with its beautiful gift of roses and sunshine, its "perfect days," is with us once more.  Let us cast behind its the clouds and storms of the past and enjoy the heritage of joyfulness that comes with this purest and sweetest of all the summer months.  Let us strive to give to the world a message of love from hearts overflowing with the blessedness of having received good gifts.</p>

                  <p>"They are never alone," said Sir Philip Sidney, "that are accompanied by noble thoughts," and we say it is quite possible for the humblest to gain these "noble thoughts" if they will but be discreet in the selection of books they read.  The moment we enter the world of books that moment a great <hi rend="italic">personal</hi>responsibility rests upon us.  It is as necessary that we choose as wisely the companionship of books as we do the companionship of friends.  There is an old proverb, "A man may usually be known by the company he keeps," but he can just as truly be known by the books he reads.</p>
                  <p>No kinder or wiser friend can one have than a good book, for a book which is worthy for us to take as a companion is the embodiment of the noblest thoughts of which that life was capable.</p>
                  <pb n="14  THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>"You get into society in the widest sense," said Dr. Geikie, "in a great library, with the huge advantage of needing no introductions and not dreading repulses. From that great crowd you can choose what companions you please, for in these silent levees of the immortals there is no pride, but the highest is at the service of the lowest with a great humility. You may speak freely with any without a thought of your inferiority, for books are perfectly well-bred and hurt no one's feelings by any discriminations."</p>
                  <p>Great care should be taken in cultivating the habit of reading, for without reading it is impossible to ever be the "full man" of whom Lord Bacon tells us. It is no more reasonable to suppose we will have bright ideas and noble thoughts without reading "than to suppose that the Mississippi might roll on its flood of waters to the ocean, though all its tributary streams were cut off and it were replenished only by occasional drops from the clouds." We are told that the elder Pliny seldom sat down to eat a meal without insisting upon some one reading to him, and that so close and constant was Petrarch's application to his books that, his friends became anxious about his health, and through love to him refused to allow him to enter his study for ten days, and by the morning he was ill with fever; his keys were at once restored to him, and with them came his usual health and bright spirits.</p>
                  <p>Not only is it necessary to acquire the habit of reading, but also the habit of selecting carefully what we read, and this in itself will greatly develop our intellectual tendency, and then we will learn to appreciate the good and beautiful. Read with a purpose. No better advice can be given a young person than to "read much, not many books."</p>
                  <p>Milton says,</p>

                     <l n="1">"Who reads</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Now just a word as to what we should read.</p>
                  <p>To gather inforination read histories, biographies and travels.</p>
                  <p>Read the best novels and romances, authors like Sir Walter Scott, George Eliot, Thackeray , Dickens and Hawthorne.</p>
                  <p>Do not read about authors and imagine you have read the authors themselves, but with great care <hi rend="italic">study </hi> the masters of the art of literature, authors like Milton, Dante, Shakespeare, Bacon, Goethe, Cervantes, Schiller, and others.</p>
                  <p>We could not be expected to exhaust a subject so interminable as this. The thoughtful reader will have at once perceived that we have scarcely done more than given intimations. Our pleasure is that intimations only are necessary to a class to whom this article comes, and we therefore briefly hand it over to them with the hope that they will find it profitable to the extent we have gone.</p>

                  <p>Nothing more elaborate has been given in Boston society for a long time than the reception tendered the members of the popular Vaudeville Club by the equally popular Cracker-Jacks. Mr. Edward S. Glover's well appointed residence was the scene of the festivities. The young ladies, attired in handsome evening costumes, from the depths of luxurious chairs and under mellow lights, witnessed the one-act play and the burlesque dancing that followed, a noteworthy feature of which was the <hi rend="italic">pas seul</hi> of Mr.. Edward Glover, who, by the way, is especially good in theatrical imitations. Mr. Sam Marsh, fresh from the stage, having appeared in the performance of Leah at the Hollis Street Theater a day or two before, also made some clever hits in his acting. Appo Johnson appeared as Trilby, and some topical songs, in costume, ended the program. An elaborate banquet followed. The table decorations were in green, and the effect was enhanced by the reflection from the pale green shades that dimmed the light of the numerous small candles. Toasts were drank and souvenir stick pins were presented to the ladies. The presentation speech was responded to by Miss Lillian Lewis, in behalf of the Vaudeville Club.</p>
                  <p>The tea given to the members of the Vaudeville Club, at which Misses Libbie Watson and Carrie Patterson were the hostesses, wound up the brilliant series of entertainments that have given so much pleasure to society folk, young and old, the past season. Miss Watson's pretty home in Dorchester was thrown open for the occasion, and the evening was spent in a delightfully informal manner, the tea being the special feature.

                  <p>Hon. George T. Downing of Newport and his daughter, Mrs. Washington, have been making a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Mark de Mortie.</p>
                  <p>A large contingent of Washington people are expected to pass the summer in Boston, among them Miss Wormley, Miss Nita Turner, Miss Clare Smythe, who will take a summer course at Harvard, and the Misses Gertrude and Cora Smith, who will be guests of relatives in Jamaica Plain.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Frank Rudolph Stuart of Harvard was one of the contestants for the Boylston prize this year. The exercises were held in Sanders' Theater, and among the well-wishers of Mr. Stuart, who were present, were Misses Louisa Lewis, Mabel Grant and Dosia Marsh.</p>

                  <p>New York.</p>
                  <p>So Boston has settled the identity of Anno Domini, eh? The "he, she or it" in last issue is good--Pickwickian. Seriously, though, the astronomical guesses ought to read, as a penance, dying Brutus' words, "Et tu Brute." It's hard, but--the Hub is not famous in the line of guessing. And I suspect the gallant Philadelphian has kyar'd de news to somebody. But the guess is an iceberg, all the same.</p>
                  <p>The Young Men's Guild, connected with St. Philip's Church, is accomplishing wonders in these dancing days. They will soon take possession of the newly erected Guild House, a handsome structure costing over $13,000. The Guild's membership is now beyond the 100 line, and it represents the truly ambitious business class of young men generally in this city.</p>
                  <p>Bethel, like a great beehive, is but a few doors distant from St. Philip's. Rumors are flying as to great things to be done there in the coming fall. It is said that Rev. Henderson (who, by the way, is from the enterprising west) is desirous of becoming an epoch-maker.  Should his conference, which meets in Albany, return here, he will visit Boston and there begin a well-defined campaign of intellectual agitation under the cry of "Not prejudice, but brains to the front!"</p>
                  <p>St. Mark's will in a short time move into a spacious edifice, in close proximity to Mount Olivet, Rev. Wisher's, and it is confidently predicted that the M.E.'s will push the progressiveness of the great Baptist citadel with as much vigor as will characterize the M. E. ambitious restlessness as neighbors of St. Philip's splendid Guild.. By next fall the members or the Guild will be barons indeed, dwelling 'neath their own vine and fig tree. That's the lead!</p>
                  <p>For classic beauty, Carnegie Music Hall is second to none in this great town. As Frank Chambers was to graduate from the School of Pharmacy on the evening of May 9, that wretch, A. D., in "best bib and tucker" was seated directly opposite box No. 5. So the whimful beauty or beauties--for vieing with Miss Kate Smith's captivating mirthfulness was Miss Bessie Decline's foreign vivacity. They are both pretty girls. There's an unconscious tenderness in Miss Kate's voice and <hi rend="italic">tout ensemble </hi> that reduces to a minimum the resistance of adamant; much less the tender susceptibilities of our own Miles Standish, who also graced No. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fanny Rice, while performing some time ago in "Nadgy," I think, made her best hit in a denouement in which she cried aloud, "I was flamagasted, I was!"  Well, that was Beau Brummel's plight.  (He was in No. 5, too.) Under the fires of Miss Bessie's beautiful Italian eyes--ah! Our Rob stood calmly by, not <hi rend="italic">de trop</hi>, though later the young graduate, Dr. Chambers, joined the party, and they repaired to one of the finest hotels in town where the affair was brought to a most memorable end.  The ladies were gowned in a most fetching style, while the gentlemen were in faultless evening attire.  That's the way, boys!  Bravo!  Now--who's Anno Domini?</p>
                  <p>Dr. Chambers has gone to North Carolina to rest awhile, in company with a popular dentist, Dr. Reid.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ferguson, a gentle lady from Richmond, has been the recipient of considerable social attention among F. H. Carmand's coterie of friends.  Several dinners, luncheons, and infor-
<pb n="16 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
mal evenings were given in her honor. She was Mrs. Carmand's guest.</p>
                  <p>A merry party drove through Prospect Park recently. Charley Day and Miss Stella King would not tell who the others were.  'Twas a handsome couple.</p>
                  <p>A certain Brooklyn gallant will have to borrow Romeo's ladder, I fear, judging by the attention paid Miss Edie  B---- by a handsome South American, now in town. In some things Americans are slow. The cause which evolved the new woman, possibly.</p>
                  <p>By the way, there are three "new women " in town. Lord Harry's daughter, a tiny maid in the home of Dr. J. Frank Smith, and a daughter of the house of Stewart. The always popular counselor, in detailing the wondrous charms of Mistress Anna to an admiring company lately, brought the house down by telling a story of the late Philips Brooks, who, in his public capacity, was continually called upon to admire early editions of future great men and women. "This, you will observe," quoth Mr. Stewart, "impoverished his store of suitable descriptive terms, so in a moment of inspiration, a way out of his difficulties flashed upon him. After that, on every occasion, armed with the easily acquired but necessary smile and manner, he would simply remark, 'My dear madam, <hi rend="italic">this is</hi>a baby!'  See the point?  Good, isn't it?"</p>
                  <p>A notable feature of the exposition held by the Brooklyn Literary Union was  "County Fair," with our Rob, the Prince of Wales and the natty little district attorney, minus white vest, in charge. Ah, boys, you know a thing or two about--a race track! And the dear girls showed a knowledge of how to buy chances--ah, just so! All in life, and that is a hurried dream at best.</p>
                  <p>Among the prize winners was Miss Mena Downing, who won a beautiful desk. I know a score of fellows today who are hoping for notes written on that desk. Rob Willis got the wheel. Constant practice on such things has been known to lessen straight lengths into curves. Cummings won the cane, J. E. Garner the umbrella, and W. E. Gross the gavel.</p>
                  <p>The supper, under Mrs. Gross' supervision, was remarkable. Absolutely no highway exchange policy. Good food for common sense prices. I am serious in this, for, as a rule, at such entertainments, the refreshment committee tries to get square with the fellows who refuse to buy; everything dangled before them, you know. But in this instance Mrs. Gross positively inaugurated a real reform. Hereafter, the boys will pay careful attention to the refreshment committee before attending an entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Just a word to A.D.'s friends--those to whom the column is dear; those who look forward to its monthly appearance; those who read without thinking of how a subscription now and then would make it impossible to be curtailed as to space, etc. For such reasons the lovely costumes worn at the famous Bachelor's ball by Mesdames Fisher, Braxton, Gale, Thomas, Garner and many others, were cut. I've a secret to tell you all; and that is, for this cause a good-bye is soon to be said--a fact--and silently said by that aggravating, uninteresting

LA FIESTA DE LOS ANGELES.</head>

                  <p>The Lenten days are indeed past, and for one week this fair city of the South has become the realm of La Reina de La Fiesta. The city government is overthrown, and the reign of the Sovereign of Flowers and Fun is ushered in with blares of tin trumpets, jangling bells and shrill whistles. Decorations are gorgeous--the city color mad--from electric light poles and wires lazily flap the tricolored flags of gold, scarlet and olive, (emblematic of the orange, wine and olive productions of our state). Children scamper along the streets, like tropical birds, in their frocks of blended gold, scarlet and olive; carriages and tallyhos, tandem and cart are bright and gay with garlands and ribbons. From windows and steeples flutter the La Fiesta colors; street cars breaking into gay bunting become fanciful things of locomotion; horses prance proudly in their gay trimmings; and forlorn indeed is the dog that sports neither tri-colored collar or bow. The streets are thronged with merrymakers; every woman out in her new and fetching Easter bonnet and gown, so
<pb n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
absorbed in the spirit of La Fiesta, that she is not aware of the "mash" her big sleeve is making with the dirty car greaser who selfishly crowds her to get a peep at the queen's retainers; the pale face, without the least fear of the scalping knife, stands beside the Indian brave gaudily arrayed in feathers and paint; in the crowd sociably hurries the fat grey-gowned friar, beside the very red and horned devil; sweet Margarite's sensitive nostrils do not consider obtrusive the musty-scented Chinamen just crawled from the opium den; the "new woman," as usual, carricatured by her jealous brother, is present in gorgeous tri-colored blouse and bloomers; the fraternity of street fakirs, yelling "La Fiesta badges," is patronized by the sailors and country cousins who have "come to take in Fiesta"; dominoes of all colors and designs mingle with the fashionable and ordinarily dressed Angelenos. The pageants of the first two days represetned the history and religion of the Pacific coast, then followed floats depicting early California history, typical Spanish life made quite real by the presence of genuine senoritas and a company of typical and gallant caballeros on prancing steeds; next followed grand displays of commercial and mercantile interests, which could but feebly portray the enterprise, recourses and productions of southern California. The third day the school children paid to La Reina (and proud was Los Angeles as column after column of bright faced boys and girls swept through the streets;) such a spectacle of comeliness and intelligent prophecy no city can outrival. We sighed, again in vain, "Oh for the fount of youth." Other cities can display their soldiers, their expert horsemen, their fire apparatus, even their Chinamen, but the locality that can produce so complete an array of excellence in all these lines as displayed on Military day, would be hard to find. The Chinese portion was brilliant and picturesque, and will go down into history as the most striking success of La Fiesta, '95. Their barbaric splendor was imposing because it was genuine--a great moving living picture of historical events from the land of Confucius, dating back 2000 years, with real accessories from the Asiatic birth place, depicted by the people therefrom. There were glittering banners and helmets wrought in fantastic shapes, baggy silk trousers of sky blue, terminating in stockings of sea green, pink and white; heralding this were the diabolic strains of the Chinese orchestra, tom toms, and clanking of forty tin kettles and the shrieking rasp of the Chinese fiddles. Not a thread of cheap gaudy tinsel marred their glittering display. The exquisite embroidery and bullion fringe would have stood examination severe, it was every thread solid gold and silver metal; the gay, silken garments and banners were of the richest texture and material. Their high officials deigned not to handle a bridle, but rode horses led by white men, so richly attired were they it made the eye ache to look upon them; their garments were a mass of golden embroidery. This page of Oriental splendor had dropped bodily down into the busy bustling western world. The coolie exclaims, "Hip fine allee same melican show no good." The concluding function of La Fiesta was the floral display, a fragrant and beautiful success. The show a fairy dream. The triumphal progress of the perfumed pageant left in its wake a coating of crushed roses and carnations on the street pavements.  Pretty! Ah yes, it was something more than pretty, our plain language is too poor to express it--simply an outward and visible token of the inward and spiritual grace.</p>
                  <p>Among the most interesting events of the past month was the meeting of the Southern Calilornia branch of the Woman's Press Association in Los Angeles. Papers on different subjects were read and discussed. Rose Hartwick Thorn, author of "Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night," was present much to the delight of the admirers of her crowning effort.</p>

                  <p>From the many colleges all over our broad land the sweet girl graduate will soon return home, laden with honors and armed with that convincing proof of her intelligence and culture, the diploma.</p>
                  <p>Truly, commencement is upon us, but, my dear girls, have you ever thought out what is to be your commencement? All cannot be teachers, and, indeed, many do not wish to assume the arduous task of training the young. Then, what shall you do?</p>
                  <p>With so many avenues of labor closed against
<pb n="18 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
us, it is by no means an easy task to decide which of the employments still available it is best to choose.</p>
                  <p>It is much to be regretted that all can not learn some trade while at school; but since that is, at present, impracticable, the best thing to do is to go to work at once to supply the deficiency. A girl who is skilled in the dressmaker's trade, and is an adept in the art of designing a costume, can afford to be independent and demand her own terms. But there are dressmakers and dressmakers, just as there are teachers and teachers, and those who have not mastered all the intricacies of their trade will be forced to the wall. Learn a trade, but by all means learn it well; be an expert in your chosen profession, and patronage will be thrust upon you from all quarters.</p>
                  <p>I see that some of the cities have already appointed their committees and gone to work to get up an exhibit for the Cotton States Exposition, which will be a credit to the Lone Star State. This is a move in the right direction.</p>
                  <p>Those who do not wish to take part should not try to hinder or disparage the efforts of the committees. Of course things are not exactly as we would like--there are some objectionable features; but, we shall accomplish no good by standing aloof complaining, when there has been offered to us such at glorious opportunity to show to the world that we can do something.</p>
                  <p>People pay no attention to a man who says, "I can invent a machine;" but let him step forward bearing his invention in his hands, and say, "I invented this," he at once attracts their attention, and if it is really worth anything, their respect also.</p>
                  <p>Ours is the age in which work and not talk accomplishes the most good. The Caucasian sees so little of us, and very often that little our worst side, that he is amazed at the idea of one of us accomplishing anything worthy of his notice.</p>
                  <p>We have some brains in Texas; now let us utilize them in getting together such an exhibit as shall make the Texas Department of the Negro Building at Atlanta the cynosure for all visitors.</p>
                  <p>If we can demonstrate the fact that we call invent anything, mould a piece of statuary or write a book as well as anyone, then we shall do more to solve the negro problem than all preaching and complaining can do? Can we not do this?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Carlisle, our state superintendent, has consented to establish a summer normal of high grade for colored teachers this year.  It is something of which all true teachers have felt the need, and we should show our appreciation by attending in large numbers.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Kealing's name has been proposed as a conductor, and if he is appointed, we are all quite convinced that, with his ability and experience, he cannot fail to make it a success.</p>
                  <p>As the Teachers' Association meets in Austin just at that time, the superintendent would do well to locate the normal there, as it would save teachers who wished to attend the expense of another railroad fare. Let us urge that city for the normal.</p>
                  <p>The citizens of Austin are making strenuous efforts to give the teachers who attend a Teachers' Convention a hearty welcome. It is to be hoped that all who can possibly attend will do so. We are very anxious to have the meeting a success, but when more than half of the great army of teachers never attend, it certainly gives others a bad impression of us. We should be more interested in our own association. Make a few sacrifices if need be.</p>
                  <p>Three of our educational institutes closed their doors last month--Hearne Academy, Wiley and Paul Quinn. All have very interesting programs.</p>
                  <p>Prairie View Normal will close on the 7th of June. Bishop Lee will deliver the address to graduates and Rev. L. L. Campbell will preach the baccalaureate sermon.</p>

                  <p>There has been little published lately that is interesting and entertaining, or, in other words, popular; which is a good thing.  For if we are continually deluged with so much current literature, that it is really worth one's while to read, when are we to find time for our old favorite authors? For those books that, however old, never cease to be new ? That can be read and read again, and in each reading we can discover new beauties and learn new lessons of life?</p>
                  <pb n="19 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>By the way, did anyone ever consider what a dangerous thing it was to recommend a book, a thing we do so often and so carelessly? "Tell me something good to read," and you name the first interesting book that comes in your mind, not considering to what sort of a person you are speaking. Every book we read leaves an impression on the mind of some sort, but does not often impress two people in the same way. Often the book that may strengthen the weak places in the character of one, may have an opposite effect in that of another. Any book that is fascinating, or, indeed, at all interesting must appeal directly to some trait, taste, sympathy, or experience of the reader. Therefore it is well to consider the apparent characteristics of the friend to whom we commend a book; and we should be careful, also, lest we leave an erroneous impression of our own character by our tastes.</p>
                  <p>This has been called the reign of the paperbound book. Time was when it was considered the spurious article, but nowadays everything comes in paper from Ruskin, Huxley, and Drummond to "The Dark and Daring Deeds of Dick Deadeye," et cetera.  So "you pays your money and you takes your choice." Now if you send to John B. Allen, publisher, 10 and 12 Underwater Street, New York, for his catalogue you will get a list of books quoted at prices ranging from two cents upwards. These are remarkably well printed on good firm paper. The list consists of the world's best books and embraces biography, history, science and poetry, as well as the standard novels.</p>
                  <p>Here in Boston we have had Trilby indeed. Not only have we had the play, the original drawings for that most famous book, aud every article of of wearing apparel designated as "Trilby," but an enterprising baker advertises Trilby pies.</p>

Of Los Angeles, California, Have placed upon the market <lb/>
20,000 ACRES 20,000</p>
                  <p>Of the finest land on earth, which they intend to colonize with colored people, and at prices within reach of men of small means. In order to induce investments in these lands we offer 2,000 acres to the first settlers at <hi rend="bold">$20 per acre</hi> and guarantee to deliver water to each 20 acres sold, sufficient for irrigation. These lands lie 60 miles north from Los Angeles, and 7 miles from the Southern Pacific R.R., and consist of a rich friable loam, being of sedimentary formation mingled with decomposed granite. The soil is from 4 to 50 feet deep, and is capable of producing everything on earth that grows in this land of <hi rend="italic">wonderful production</hi>.</p>
                  <p>It lies at an altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level and is peculiarly on the land of the olive and almond.</p>
                  <p>SMALL FARMS</p>
                  <p>are the rule in Southern California and more profit can be realized from 20 acres here than on 160 acres in the East.</p>
                  <p>AFTER 2,000 ACRES HAVE BEEN SOLD</p>
                  <p>the price will be $35.00 per acre.</p>
                  <p>It is not an unusual thing for trees in bearing to yield</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>These lands have perfect title and will be sold for one-third cash, balance one, two and three years, with interest at 6 per cent per annum.</p>

                  <p>A wee "new woman" came to town last Sunday evening at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Grant, Charles St. The young stranger is said to be of such strength of lung and limb and that already the prospect of her casting her vote for president of the United States in 1916 is a settled fact.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mary Church Terrell delivered the address to the graduating class of the Wilmington, Del., High School June 25. The address was commented upon by the newspapers of the town as being the best ever delivered in that city by a woman.</p>
                  <p>Mr. W.E.B. DuBois' short stay in this city will probably be forgiven by his many friends when they learn that it was a sufficient time to secure for him the honored title of Ph.D. at Harvard. This is the first time a colored man has attained this title, and it is needless to say that Dr. DuBois has our best wishes and congratulations.</p>
                  <p>The picnic given for the benefit of St. Monica's home on the 1st of July, although an eminent success socially, owing to the uncertainty of the weather in the early part of the day was not the financial success it should have been. The hard and intelligent work put into the effort by the committee of ladies deserved to win for them the financial returns hoped for. About two hundred people went out. It required many times that number to meet the desire of the committee, which was to raise enough money by the picnic to keep the home open through the summer season, when most of its friends and donors are away from the city. The affair was projected by an independent committee composed of the following ladies: Mrs. Hattie Ruffin, Mrs. L. Pope, Mrs. Hemmings and Mrs. Fannie Johnson.</p>
                  <p>The Hon. "Jack" Durham, minister to Haytii under the Harrison administration, has been recently admitted to the Philadelphia bar.</p>

                  <p>Widespread interest is being shown in the coming conference, communications from clubs all over the country showing that interest in and sympathy with the movement will have substantial recognition in the presence of its delegates.</p>
                  <p>As the ERA goes to press before a complete list of delegates can be arranged, we append but a few names of those whom we may expect to have with us. Later, programs will be arranged and mailed to clubs desiring them.</p>
                  <p>First, the Woman's Era Club, and we are sure all other clubs represented will be glad to welcome among them Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett, who has been invited to attend. Being with them at their formation, and also being in every sense of the word a club woman, the congratulations waiting to be showered upon 'Mrs. Barnett will be heartfelt indeed.</p>
                  <p>The W.L.U. of New York will send three accredited delegates and six at large, Mrs. Victoria Matthews, Mrs. Katie Carmand and Miss Tarner being the three regular representatives. Mrs J. Imogen Howard, one of the N.Y. State Board Of Women Managers of the World's Fair at Chicago, will probably come on and tell us of what was done for that exposition by the women of N.Y. and N.E.</p>
                  <p>Philadelphia will be represented by Miss Dora Cole and Mrs. N.F. Mossell, who will read papers.  It is also hoped that Mrs. Fannie Jackson Coppin, principal of the Philadelphia Institution for colored youth, will be with us.  Mrs. Coppin was the first to introduce manual training in the Philadelphia schools, a system which is being successfully pursued in the institution of which she is now principal.</p>
                  <p>That sweetest of all poetic singers  and lecturers among us, Mrs. Frances E. W. Harper, will probably be heard.</p>
                  <p>From the west comes cheerful news, that Los Angeles, Cal., will be represented, and resolutions passed in three churches in that city will be sent for reading.</p>

                  <p>From Tuskegee, Ala., Mrs. Booker T. Washington is expected.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ella Smith, B.A., M.A., of Wellesley, will read a paper, subject to be announced later.</p>
                  <p>New York and Washington will each have entire control of one session of the conference, carrying out programs of their own arrangement.</p>
                  <p>Another special session will be devoted to "Social Purity," when papers pertaining to subjects as factors to social purity will be read--such subjects as "Hygienic diet as a factor," "Business education as a safeguard," etc. In this connection a valuable suggestion from Mrs. Alice S. Felts, that of circulating for signatures a social purity pledge, will be carried out, Mrs. Felts having been requested to present in a paper some phase of this subject.</p>
                  <p>Another session will be in charge of an eminent worker of the W.CT. U.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams of the Chicago Women's Club will lend interest by her presence.</p>
                  <p>From New Orleans, one or more delegates has been promised by the Phyllis Wheatley Club,and Mrs. R.G.L. Page, representing that new and flourishing club recently formed in Berkeley, Va., will come as its delegate.</p>
                  <p>A new club recently formed in Salem, Mass., through the interest and exertion of Miss Annie Blanchard, will be represented.</p>
                  <p>This by no means shows all the delegates expected, but simply gives an idea of the communications that are being received in accord with and desiring to participate in the conference.

                  <p>The man Jacks, seeing the way, doubtless, of getting his name before the public, estimating the possible free advertisement he could get from the reflex action of sending a sensational communication to England concerning a scarcely known class, adopted a method so thoroughly unfit for usage among honorable men that any wholesome-minded person finds it difficult to stay repugnance for such things long enough to enter a protest, or an appeal to universal reason.  Such an attack on womankind as his, so noisome and foul, is merciless in marking to the world the standard of man that the Missouri State Press Club has seen fit to elect as its presiding officer. He has not only slandered the women of negro extraction, but the mothers of American morality and virtue, when he says in his letter to the Hon. Florence Balgarnic: "Until such literature as your society (anti-lynching) sends out made an impression, and until northern women came along with their degraded views of chastity of women," etc., etc. Let reasonable minds ask what this means.  It it plain that it begins with the negro woman, but let reason say where it ends. "Until the northern people came among us with their degraded views of chastity of women"!  Where do Maria Lydia Childs, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Fanny Kemble, Harriet Martineaux, and hundreds of others who in pure lofty womanhood upheld the moralists of the nineteenth century--the abolitionists--stand in this Iewd fellow's sweeping statement? When truth-loving minds understand and acknowledge that the thing in slavery which destroyed the peace of mind of the ever-to-be-appreciated northern woman was in toto the demoralizing effect of the institution slavery on each succeeding generation--when this is considered, the only conclusion is a boundless pity for the depravity that flagrantly vents itself on the self-sacrificing labors of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> women who taught <hi rend="italic">southern men</hi>what chastity meant!</p>
                  <p>While no sane person will accept any statement of morals on such general lines as this individual
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
has outlined, and while it is repellant in every way to the chaste mind to dignify such foul thoughts and expressions by a public refutation, yet allegiance to virtue leaves but one course open, to warn the indifferent against permitting such an one as this man Jacks must be to think and speak for them. I mean particularly the Press Club of Missouri. While it is not to be expected that any good effect can be made by our utterances on the class that the defamer represents, yet the courageous women should speak through the WOMAN's ERA that the world may feel the power of the chaste mentality of the true negro woman. At least, this is no time to treat a vilifier in the manner only comprehended by a true man. As consistent women, jealous of our good name, we should not hesitate through mistaken ideas as to wise policy, etc., in. sending broadcast our burning contempt for any creature who can assail with viperous touch a subject that involves the innate mystery of hidden life out of our reverence for those who preceded us, made a place in history, song and story for us. Our indignation should know no limit. We as women have been too unobtrusive, too little known; we have been hidden by our close adherence to high endeavor. The dross has forced to the front too long.  We should realize, and let the world know that we realize it, that America, and the south in particular, owes a deathless bond of gratitude to the now slandered class, that the fair sons and daughters of the south were not corrupted or demoralized during their young and tender years. This is no shallow claim. History can be out in evidence to prove that decency existed most generally among the negro women of the south, for they only were forced by iron law and brutish control to live under the harrowing conditions by the chivalric (?) progenitors of possibly Jacks and his class. If there were enough negro women found at that time to whom the tender youth was entrusted, not only for training at the very time of life when the moral character pre-eminently is formed, but for nourishing the same, which is an indisputable fact, what claim to truth can Jacks and his class hope to establish by such malignant charges as are published in his letter to a noble English lady?</p>
                  <p>No man capable of reverencing his mother, or protecting the unsullied fame of any woman, would have written or forwarded such a communication to any woman; much less, one whose life work entitles her to the respect at least of progressive and wholesome minds, regardless of sex,  wherever principle and unselfish efforts to uplift struggling humanity exists.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Loyal Union will do all in its power to support the position taken by the Woman's Era Club of Boston in calling upon the women of the race to meet in convention. The matter is being pushed vigorously, other clubs and bodies of women being appealed to; and there is every reason to look forward to the convention as an epoch marking event in our history, for it can be made such, if every individual woman will realize that, as it is the first of the kind, much depends on the undertaking as a precedent. If successful, the organized bodies of women throughout the country will note it, and their respect for us as a body will rise correspondingly; thereby an advance will have been accomplished.  The brightest of our women should come together, for regardless of success or failure, it will afford an opportunity not only of educating public opinion as to our status as women, but will be a test of the broadmindedness an zeal in the matter of mutual advancement existing between the women of the races.  If the women will only read and think this manner over, we will have no fears as to the ultimate result.</p>

                  <p>Two women engaged in an interesting dicussion which I overheard the other day.  The ques-
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
tion to be settled was whether it is wiser for the average Afro-American to be so politic as to avoid antagonizing Anglo-Saxons by dissenting from their opinions, or whether he should boldly assert himself, when the occasion arises, and have the courage of his convictions.</p>
                  <p>"I believe that the reason why we make no more progress in securing our various rights is because all of us, men and women, are too weakkeoed," said a fiery little sister, fairly bristling with independence and earnestness. "Some of our most intelligent men counsel such allopathic doses of diplomacy in dealing with their brothers in white as to cure forever the tendency either to challenge accusations or resent insults offered by them. As long as we submit quietly just so long will the apostles of oppression and tyranny continue to insult and abuse us. According to my opinion, we have been too long-suffering and have given too little evidence of possessing back bone.  Patience ceases to be a virtue after it reaches a certain limit, and too much so-called christian submission is the virtue either of cowards or fools, I believe," she continued, boiling more and more with indignation as she proceeded.</p>
                  <p>'"Well, what do you advise, for instance?" said a level-headed woman whose pulse beat at least twenty times less in a minute than that of her friend.  "You would have our men go through the world with a chip on their shoulder, I suppose, offering fight to all Anglo-Saxons who differ with them. A more hair-brained course could not be imagined, because it would fall so far short of accomplishitig the end at which you aim. Policy and diplomacy will effect more than pugnacity as we are situated at present, according to my opinion."</p>
                  <p>"I do not advise going to extremes in asserting ourselves and maintaining our manhood," said the little advocate of resistance. "I want our intelligent men to be more ready to resent insults and stand up for the rights that are denied. I want lo see them less willing to preserve the silence they call "golden" when a word of manly independence and righteous indignation would raise them so much higher in the estimation of themselves and everybody else. We need to cultivate self-respect as a race. From the very nature of the case we have too little of that in our composition. The fact that it is not our fault that we lack this prerequisite to a dignified manhood and womanhood does not alter or help the matter. The effect upon ourselves is just as fatal in every particular. I want to see men of spirit possessing too much self respect to play the role of cowardice under the cloak of diplomacy. I want to see the number of men not afraid to denounce wrong increasing."</p>
                  <p>"That is all very well from a theoretical standpoint," said she of the slow pulse and the cool head, "but practically such a course would be suicidal to the progress of the race, as I look at it. We are as yet too dependent upon the masters of the situation to strike the attitude of defiance. We need money above everything else before we are in a position to make demands effectually. Such a bold expression of opinion as you advise would simply mean less of position to the average Afro-American who indulged in this pastime to any great extent. Here in Washington, for instance, some of our brainiest men are in the employ of the government, and their lips must be sealed when it comes to fault finding or denouncing wrongs inflicted by the dominant race. Our men of intelligence, who are for the most part independent of spirit, frequently refrain from taking an active part in the war against oppression because such a course would deprive them of means of subsistence. They do not want to take bread out of the mouths of their families, and so they keep silent."</p>
                  <p>This state of things is indeed discouraging," said the little Joan of Arc, "for it is a species of slavery more galling to men and women who have tasted freedom than to those who have never known the joys of liberty. But I do not believe that an exhibition of bold, fearless manhood in the race would result so disastrously as you imagine. Even tyrants admire courage in the victims of their oppression. If our men displayed more pluck and independence in their dealings with the Anglo-Saxon brothers the latter would have more respect for them. We can never command respect from others until we possess a sufficient quantity ourselves, and no man or woman can respect himself or herself who dares not stand up for what he or she conceives to be right. In the struggle for complete liberty some body must be sacrificef. If each one considers only what will be to his advantage as an individual, and is subservient because it will advance his personal interests, I doubt seriously that we shall ever attain that dignity and independence as a people without which we can amount to nothing."</p>

                  <byline>FANNIE BARRIER WILLIAMS, EDITOR.</byline>
                  <p>The July number of the ERA will find many of our readers among the teaching class in the cool retreats of their vacation season.  To no class of workers is a brief respite from service so happily welcome.  In their eagerness for this grateful season of change from the worries and bad air of the school room to the open air of freedom and exhilaration many of our teachers give but little attention to the best means of spending this vacation time.</p>
                  <p>Of course, I would not attempt to give either instruction or advice as to how the vacation period ought to be spent. This is a matter of individual determination to be governed largely by circumstances. It is interesting, however, to note and understand what important changes are going on in the popular mind with reference to the use of summer vacations. While railroad and steamboats are doing everything in the line of improvement in traveling facilities, and while the watering places are all wonderfully joyous in the things that delight soul and body, there has been a steady growth in in popular favor of the summer schools, and other assemblies for intellectual recreation.  Many of the great universities and centers of learning have become popular summer resorts for the increasing thousands who find no rest and strength in idleness or dissipation of time.</p>
                  <p>These summer schools are largely in the nature of lecture courses and embrace a wide range of studies that in many cases are in the nature of post-graduate work. The most eminent men and women in all departments of human knowledge are engaged in this new department of education. The Chicago, Madison, Lake Forest and Michigan universities are notable among western Schools for the thoroughness and extensiveness of their summer work for 1895.</p>
                  <p>The prospects of attendance from all parts of this country and Canada are exceedingly encouraging to the cause of education. Many eminent men from the universities of the older world have been secured for the summer course of Chicago university, and teachers and others who are eager to hear the authoritative word from the original thinkers of the day would do well to avail themselves of these rare opportunities.</p>
                  <p>It is to he hoped that large numbers of our southern teachers will feel inclined and be able to refresh themselves with these larger inspirations of vacation season. People in the North can help the cause of education in the South to a considerable extent by affording a hospitable welcome to such of our overworked and underpaid sisters in the South who come North to drink from these fresh founts of inspiration and high knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Exhilaration of soul, as well as a renewal of physical strength should be the aim of the men and women who for two or three months are released from the service of teaching. To thus enlarge the boundaries of the mind mean as much to the schools as to themselves.</p>
                  <p>It is a long time since Chicago has been in such a tip toe of eagerness over social events.  The announcement of June Weddings has fairly taken us off our feet with their startling surprises.  The approaching marriage of Miss Ida B. Wells to Mr. F.L. Barnett has an interest that exceeds all local  bounds.  The public has become so interested in the unique career of Miss Wells that her determination to marry a man while still married to a cause will be a topic of national interest and comment.  The public has been so accustomed to think of Miss Wells' remarkable zeal for the cause of law and order that, I suppose, no one ever reads a case of lynching without associating with it the indignant protest of our plucky little friend.</p>
                  <p>Aside from being an attorney of established reputation at the Chicago bar, the fortunate groom has manifested a chivalric interest in the cause of his estimable bride.  All Chicago unite in blessing the matrimonial union of two persons whose most conspicuous traits of character have been an unstinted interest in the cry for help and justice from an unfortunate people.</p>
                  <p>The I.B.W. Woman's Club will tender the wedded pair a reception that promises to be a notable event.</p>
                  <p>Another wedding of only local interest by pleasantly suggestive of happiness to the estimable couple is that of Miss Lulu Wiley to Adelbert H. Roberts on the 20th inst. Miss Wiley is a young woman possessed of so much exquisite good sense and sweet amiability that everyone shares her
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
happiness in marrying a fine type of the new generation of colored gentlemen.  Mr. Roberts is a recent graduate of the Chicago law school and is a high-minded, capable and companionable gentleman.</p>
                  <p>These June marriages chime in quite fittingly with the gladsome festivities of these school closing days. They both lend a joyous zest to this season of congratulation and good will. It is the season of flowers, music, bright expectations and love's triumphs. There is an optimism in the air we breathe, a melody in opening bud and bursting flower, and an inspiring opulence in this season when Hymen is the sovereign gay, and diplomas bring sweet messages to anxious hearts.</p>

                     <p>It has come to our knowledge that wrong impressions concerning the attitude of Miss Willard toward the colored people in America have been made in certain quarters, and as an act of justice we desire to put it on record that no such criticisin would be for a moment received in her own country by those who have any adequate knowledge of Miss Willard's character and career. Her ancestors were Abolitionists, her childhood's home was on the line of  "the underground railway" for fleeing fugitive slaves; her father was one of the founders of the Free Soil, afterwards the Republican party; and her convictions and sympathies as proved by her speeches, books and editorial articles are with those who from the beginning of the great anti-slavery agitation have been devoted to the cause of the colored people.</p>
                     <p>As president of the National W.C.T.U. and founder of the World's W.C.T.U., Miss Willard has always maintained the position that no colored line could be drawn by either society, and the women who have thus far guided and controlled these great national organizations have never sought to establish any distinction in either, but have freely and gladly accepted the colored women as officers and delegates to the convention of both. Within a few weeks Miss Willard publicly declared that if a certain woman's club of Chicago, of which she is a member, declined to receive colored women on terms of equality, she should resign her membership.</p>
                     <p>The National W.C.T.U. is organized on the basis that each state has a right to manage its own internal affairs. In some of the southern states, colored unions have heen formed with the hearty concurrence of leading colored women. When these unions send their delegates to the World's or National W.C.T.U., they are received on terms of perfect equality with white women. It is due to the white ribbon movement that this statement be widely made and thoroughly understood, as the work of that society is one of wide range and womanly beneficence. In view of these facts we feel that for any person or persons to give currency to statements harmful to Miss Willard as a reformer is most misleading and unjust. Through her influence many of the state unions have adopted resolutions against lynching, and the National union has put itself squarely on record in the same way, while the annual addresses of the president plainly indicated her disapproval of such lawless and barbarous proceedings.</p>

and morality. Since the object of all churches is to work for Christ, and the accomplishment of this end, I have thought to ask each church to form Temperance Mission Bands, and each Saturday or semi-monthly gather the children and give them short, spicy talks on the church's mission work, temperance, honesty, etc. With a few pretty songs these meetings could be made very interesting and helpful. Once a quarter an entertainment could be given and one half the proceeds used for mission work as the church would direct, and the other half given to the temperance work under the W. C. T. U. Each church has a number of intelligent young women who would gladly do this work for their church and race if requested by their pastor.</p>
                     <p>The future of the race depends on the training of the children of to-day. I will be glad to hear from any one, especially ministers and teachers who are willing to help "train the children in the way they should go."</p>

                     <p>A very interesting meeting of the Woman's League was held at the residence of Mrs. Bishop Handy Wednesday, June 5th, at which time it was decided to ratify the constitution of the National League of the Colored Women of the United States.</p>
                     <p>Interesting letters were read from Mrs. Charlotte Grinkle and Mrs. Helen Cook of Washington, D. C., and from Mrs. S. Dupee of Jefferson City, Mo.  Papers and documents from other points were also presented.</p>
                     <p>A program of work for the summer was mapped out, the ladies concluding to maintain the sewing school and make over-garments which might be of use to the needy in winter.</p>
                     <p>The "Fourth of July" issue of the <hi rend="italic">Kansas City Journal</hi>, a Republican paper of wide circulation, will be edited by the ladies of the city, and the corresponding secretary of the League has been requested to prepare for that edition a few statements concerning the nature and work of this organization of colored ladies.</p>
                     <p>Garland Penn, Chief of the Negro Department of the Cotton States and International Exposition, has created a commission for the "City of Kansas, Mo., and Kansas City, Kansas, whose duty it shall be to collect, forward, install and supervise the colored exhibit from the two cities."</p>
                     <p>Six young people graduated from Lincoln High School at the tenth annual commencement of this institution, and fifty promotions were made from the various ward schools to the High School.</p>
                     <p>On Monday night, June 11, Sidney Woodward, the Boston tenor, delighted a large and appreciative Kansas City audience with his matchless voice.</p>

                     <p>"Nothing succeeds like success."</p>
                     <p>The enfranchisement of the women of Colorado brings to them the knowledge that they are a power in the political world.</p>
                     <p>That earnest women can do almost anything was thoroughly demonstrated at the Republican State League Convention held in Denver May 28.</p>
                     <p>They went there with the intention of electing one woman delegate out of the fourteen to be sent to the National Convention at Cleveland, Ohio.  That they succeeded in sending not one but three, is another proof of what earnest women can do.</p>
                     <p>Promptly at ten o'clock the president of the State League, which numbers nearly one thousand, called the convention to order. To one who has attended conventions the usual preliminaries are familiar.  This one differed from others only in having a majority of women voters and a greater number of colored delegates.  When a candidate was elected in whom the women were particularly interested, there were no shouts and throwing up of hats, but only a clapping of hands, and that not very demonstrative for fear of bursting kid gloves.</p>
                     <p>Those who think of women voting only in connection with reforms should have visited the convention and have seen the adroit proceedings of
<pb n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the two leading women of the party. Both were anxious to receive the highest honors within the gift of the league. How they and their followers did work, not for the best good of the people in convention assembled, but for their own personal interests.</p>
                     <p>One side went so far as to put in the resolutions to be read before the convention, that a certain woman should not be allowed to vote because she was not what she would have the worId believe her to be. The men considered this a good joke and had a hearty laugh over it.</p>
                     <p>Already too much glimmer has been thrown over the real. Articles have been written from superabundance of self conceit, in which opinions are given instead of facts.</p>
                     <p>We women of Colorado are proud of our liberty. If we would clear and make better the political atmosphere of which we have so often boasted of doing when we should gain the franchise, we must carry our <hi rend="italic"> womanhood </hi> there. Let true womanhood enter into every part of politics and be used as the instrument of all reforms.</p>
                     <p>If the ideal of woman suffrage is still in advance of its realization, if its theories are still ahead of its practical accomplishments, if that which it has done pale by comparison with what it will do, then and not till then will woman suffrage be a grand achievement.</p>

                  <p>Early one morning of last month, despite the mists that obscured the bay, the overland train pulled on to the Oakland pier and safely landed its passengers, among whome were the two distinguished women, Miss Susan B. Anthony and Rev. Anna H. Shaw,  who had crossed the continent to meet with the second Woman's Congress of California. It was said by some of the "legal-minded men" that the subject ("Home") under consideration this year was not broad enough in scope and would prove tame. After the subject had beon discussed politically by Miss Anthony and Rev. Shaw, and by the other brainy women who considered it from domestic, social, evolutionary or hygienic standpoints, the men--not even conservative Rabbi Voorsanger of San Francisco--dared criticise the verdict of Mayor Sutro, "That there had assembled in Golden Gate hall an aristocracy higher than ever assembled in any place in Europe--an aristocracy of brains. Women have finer brain power than men and will improve government.  Let them step in and restore the patriotism of the revolutionary fathers and all will be well."</p>
                  <p>It was apparent that the new woman was not to be distinguished by any frightful logic dress reform attire, neither was she bereft the divine and sweet influences that characterize the mother and wife.  The new woman, as she appeared in Golden Gate hall, demonstrated her intellectual fitness and cleverly proved herself able to use her brain and appear attractive, for said the press,  "Oh, this is no Woman's Congress, this is some sort of swell reception." Yet her personal appearance was secondary to the vital question under discussion. If brains quickened with progressive thought, balanced by sound judgment, enthusiasm, crowded halls, from which has gone forth an impetus for greater effort in the elevation of woman and humanity, if these are indications of success, then this Woman's Congress was a success.</p>
                  <p>The presence and practical talks of Mrs. Stephen Matthews (known at the Woman's Congress as the little English woman with the big voice) has inspired to action the colored women of this place. The Woman's Club for the special interest of our own people has been organized. The possibilities are large for a grand work by this club, the women are of the class teeming with enthusiasm and bright thought and lots of "stick ability."  I only wish you might be present at our next meeting to hear the Rev. Jones "plea for the one man membership in the Woman's Club."  While some of us favor co-relative work the majority are vindictive and decree that what has been sauce for the goose shall now be served to the gander.  When it shall be aye and nay, the nays will carry.</p>
                  <p>We are on the verge of an educational war.  Supt. Search tried to introduce and advised the
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
individual system of  instruction in the public schools as superior to the old class system. The school board is divided, the superintendent's situation challenged, common sense requesting silence for the present from teachers, the citizens en masse for enlightenment, personalities so bitterly flung that as yet we don't know just where we are. It is to be hoped this very serious question of education may be wisely and carefully considered. Let the individual system have fair and impartial trial. If the present class system can be improved, teachers allowed opportunity for using a little more originality in giving unto each pupil his instruction as and when most needed, instead of the old way of cramming a prescribed course, mental capacity or none, such a system would be more helpful alike to teacher and pupil.</p>

                  <p>Sunday, the 19th ult., at 4 P. M., the parlors of the Y.W.C.A. were filled to overflowing with the members and friends of the association to hear your representative's address on the condition of the colored people of the south. Frequently throughout the address were the friends in tears as the listened in a sacred stillness to the condition of these dear people of the balmy southland so well delineated. The singing of the sextette added much to the meeting, as they told the sad story in song.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Emma S. Ransom of Cleveland, one of the editors of <hi rend="italic">Woman's Light and Love for Heathen Africa</hi>, one of our missionary periodicals, and the only one published by our women, spent a few days with us. Mrs. Ransom is but to be seen to be loved. Though young in years she is making the world know she is in it.</p>
                  <p>During Bishop Wayman's stay in the city, he was entertained by Mrs. Hattie Hicks, the enthusiastic little president of the Woman's Mite Missionary Society. Of course the dear bishop gave us quite a spiritual and intellectual feast.</p>
                  <p>The Dicken's Club has been taking a vacation.</p>
                  <p>At a late meeting, Mrs. Hattie Cannon delivered a fine paper on mental culture. In speaking of mentat improvement, she recommended mental food which best serves our needs, and mingling in refined and cultured society. She said there was no excuse for ignorance except indolence and indifference, so long as the public libraries were opened to the world.</p>
                  <p>The Henrietta Society had quite a pleasant literary and social meeting last week, and we regret very much that it was our misfortune to be absent.  This society has done and is doing much for the people at large.</p>
                  <p>Now that the weather is pleasant, the King's Daughters have changed their meetings from the homes of the members to the church, and all Daughters are earnestly requested to be about their King's business, for it requireth haste.</p>

                  <p>Though at the eleventh hour, the Trilby fad has come to town. One East Tennessee maid, even at the exorbitant cost of one dollar and a quarter, possessed herself of this peculiarly pathetic story, and read it forthwith. Whatever her mental verdict may have been, her verbal criticism was "horrible."  If by venting this acrid term before her friend, she though to curb their eagerness to read De Maurier's fancy, when too late she learned that the wrong term was unhappily employed in condemning it.  Instead of serving the purpose she had intended, it "o'erleaps itself and falls on other."  The consequence is that her quondam clean, cloth-bound copy of "Trilby" has been borrowed and read so much that, ere being read more, it must come in close contact with the glue pot.  </p>
                  <p>Having read a book, one must in reason have some opinion of it. Giving my honest, conscientious conviction of the much thought of, much written of, much talked of literary sensation of the times, I must say that I have failed to see in it so much of dross and shame as some of my more punctilious friends; I have failed <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> to see it in the alleged light of a "corrupter of morals."  To the contrary, I think, though the work is fraught with objectionable features-many--(by the way, that no girl of modest bearing would do well to imitate, unless, like Trilby,
<pb n="10 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
she err through ignorance) it carries, in the end, a moral of purity and innocence.</p>
                  <p>Sheeted and sleeping in the grave's cold embrace are innumerable mothers, good, old-fashioned mothers, such as the world is in need of today. Not that there are fewer god mothers now than in times past, but that there are more corrupting influences abroad, abasing the minds, the hearts, the morals and manners of the times. Mothers were once not so foolishly ambitious of their daughter's social popularity as now. Instead of being precipitately paraded before public notice, the girls were wont to be kept in obscurity too long, so long as to engender a shyness and awkwardness difficult of riddance, when from their hiding they emerged.</p>
                  <p>Then, in those dear, forever-gone days, girls were less prone to forwardness, less addicted to flattery and less susceptible to its seductive influences.</p>
                  <p>When mothers were more watchful of their daughters' incoming and outgoing, more zealous, of the company kept, more observant of the haunts frequented, more careful of their manners and behavior, girls were more sincere and less deceptive.</p>
                  <p>There was a time when young women would not, knowingly entertain young men who were morally, socially or intellectually their inferiors; but now, sad to say, the reverse is conspicuousily prevalent. In many places a man requires no family prestige, no brains, no money and--worse than all--no morals; nothing save a "gift of gab" and a stylish apparel to admit him into high and respected circles.  Poor requisites these for a man's entrance into the sanctity of our homes.</p>
                  <p>It may be a sweeping assertion--an assertion born of ignorance, through inexperience of maternal duties, for one from whom God has withheld his greatest blessing, the blessing of becoming a mother--to make, nevertheless I charge you who have been so expressly favored, you who are mothers, with countenancing and abetting this deadly growing evil.  I charge you with neglect of your offspring's welfare.  I charge you with the good or bad qualities of which your child is possessed. It is not altogether the fiat of inheritance that a man must necessarily be profligate because his father was a libertine, or that a woman must need be the second edition of her mother's untowardness. By virtue of the power of blood, the tendency may exist--must exist, for blood will tell: it is sure to come out, if not in the present generation, in the next or the next; but as in nature it is possible to overcome the center-fleeing forces by the center-seeking, or <hi rend="italic"> vice versa</hi>, it is also possible by prayer, christian endeavor and christian determination to overcome the evil tendencies that are your child's inheritance. Mothers, vast, immeasurable, never-ending are your responsibilities; your nursery songs, your daily lessons, your words, your thoughts, your deeds, your walks, your maternal influences, all make or mar, elevate or degrade the child.</p>
                  <p>The commencement exercises of the Austin High School, which took place at Staub's Theatre Friday, June 7, was, in the estimation of your correspondent, the best ever given by that school. The class was small, being composed of only two young ladies, Misses Eva Kidd and Minnie Smith. Miss Kidd was as usual, happy in the delivery of her well written thesis, "Unheeded Opportunities " which he treated under the guise of  "ShipsThat Pass in the Night."  Miss Smith, in a few well-chosen, impressive words, delivered the valedictory. The four well-rendered recitations by as many young women were most entertaining.</p>
                  <p>Another noticeable feature, and one worthy of commendation, was the total absence of ostentation; simplicity, sensible and pleasing, reigned instead. The young ladies, with but a few exceptions, wore white wash goods. Much credit is due Professor J. W. Manning and his able corps of teachers for the year's course of instruction and its happy termination.</p>

                  <p>The Fifth Baptist Church of Richniond, Virginia, is spreading a feast of religious inspiration for the church lovers, by securing the services of some of the most able and gifted divines in the state. Rev. W. H. Brooks, whom everyone here loves to hear, preached at the above named church on the morning of June 16, and at the First Baptist Church in the afternoon of the same day. It is needless to say that on both occasions the audiences listened to soul-reviving, animating  sermons,
<pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
and the name of Rev. Brooks of Washington, D.C. (formerly of Richmond) will be sufficient announcement to gather a large congregation. The Fifth Baptist Church of Sidney, or the western section of the city, occupied a small frame structure until about two years ago. Now the church has purchased a beautiful site and has built one of the most beautiful houses of worship in the city. Under the direction of the pastor, Rev. Clarke, dedicatorial services will continue for several weeks.</p>
                  <p>Rev. Gullins, of the 33rd St. A.M.E. Cliurch, has won the hearts of the people of all denominations, and very many are enthusiastic in praises of his fine sernions and a very instructive address to the young men at the Y.M.C.A. building a few weeks ago.</p>
                  <p>Several State Institutes and Peabody Normals will be conducted in different portions of Virginia during the month of July. Three of these normals are for the benefit of colored teachers.</p>
                  <p>So the question of the day is, where are you going?  "Are you going to the Institute ?" comes next. Many teachers from the cities and counties attended last year, but the outlook does not seem so bright this summer as far is Richmond is concerned.</p>
                  <p>The Second and First Baptist Sunday schools hold commencement exercises the 18th and 20th of June respectively, at which time the students of the normal class receive their diplomas. The plan may be a very excellent one, and perhaps could be improved by putting each S. S. graduate in charge of a class. But I am sorry to confess that I have not been able to perceive the benefit to the S. S. from S. S. graduation. I have in mind cases of students who walked with their certificates out of S. S. and have only attended the church services since that time. They seem to have outgrown the Sunday school.</p>
                  <p>Mr. T. Thomas Fortune, editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Age</hi>, visited this city about the middle of June. The hospitality of his friends must have convinced him that they appreciated his visit. He was the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Dismond.</p>
                  <p>Prof. J.E. Jones delivered a very fine address at the commencement of the High and Normal school on the evening of June 15.  This address added interest to the exercises, which, as a whole, were pronounced a decided improvement on last year's entertainment.</p>

                  <p>The annual address delivered by Mr. S. Laing Williams was an able and powerful one. The beauty of it was that he did not discuss the "negro problem" or any phase of it, but all he said was sound common sense.</p>

                  <p>The last social meeting of the season of the Woman's Era Club was in charge of the Current Events Committee, Mrs. Mary Dandridge chairman.  A very pleasing programme was carried out.  Miss Harriet Smith read a paper on the "influence of clubs on the home," and an unusually fine progreamme of music was rendered by Mrs. Sparrow, Mrs. Harris and Mr. Moses Hodges.  The afternoon wound up with a club tea.  It was decided to continue business meetings of the club through the summer on account of the coming conference.</p>
                  <p>The action of Miss Florence Belgarnic at the recent World's W.C.T.U. convention in London will always stand out as one of conspicuous bravery, and the fact that she stood alone proves nothing so much as that Miss Willard is a great leader as well as what we claim for her--a great temporizer in matters pertaining to southern sentiment.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To dare be true to one's self respect and dignity should not be too hard a task to set for even the most timorous when it is remembered that self respect and self pride will halt and waver when it does not compel respect, and must finally die of wounds made by the contempt of others unless active means are taken to keep it alive. In a crisis, ability to see the right thing to do and courage to do it must command respect, at least for the effort. A crisis demanding a display of such qualities is upon us, and no plea of sensitiveness to making public slanderous insults can excuse the traduced from seeking vindication from unjust accusations, especially as these accusations are made and scattered broadcast.</p>
                     <p>Will not longer pretending to igore these things look like either a tacit admission of their truth, or a fear to honestly face the charges so sweepingly made now? At the conference it is not proposed to make this refutation by boisterous denials of the accusations, but by earnest affirmations and showings of what we are, our aims, aspirations and hopes. The slanderous letter referred to in last month's ERA, while it has served as a spur to action in a matter long considered and frequently suggested in the ERA, will not be the keynote of the discussions of the whole conference. One session will be devoted to  "social purity" and what can be used as factors in promoting it. At that session the answers to inquiries sent out to prominent and reliable educators, and missioners among colored people, as to the moral conditions among these people as they find them, will be read. This subject should properly receive most careful and delicate handling, but with courage enough to compel condemnation of vice wherever it exists, and vindication for the innocent victims of a widespread slander.</p>

                     <docDate>July 1895</docDate>
                     <p>In the Kansas department this month appears a circular letter explaining Miss Willard's position on the color question. The defence is timely, and it is a question if even now, since its publication, the majority of colored people will have their opinion that Miss Willard is a "temporizer" materially altered. The fact is, Miss Willard is at the head of a tremendous organization, and in that capacity and in order to keep everything and everybody harmonious, is obliged to be politic, and for the Welfare of the W.C.T.U. not to antagonize any section of this country.</p>
                     <p>Doubtless Miss Willard is a good friend to colored people, but we have failed to hear from her or the W. C. T. U. any honest, flatfooted denunciation of lynching and lynchers. The London Daily <hi rend="italic">News</hi>, in commenting upon the resolution passed at the June convention upon lynching, says that the resolution saying "We deplore the taking of life without trial," is a practical condonation of the practice and an evasion sprung by the Americans, of which every honest-minded British woman upon second thought should be ashamed.</p>
                     <p>We have great respect for the signers of the circulars, but it will take more than this and more than Lady Somerset's scoring of Miss Wells to convince us that the W.C.T.U. does not hedge.</p>

                     <docDate>July 1895</docDate>
                     <p>It seems as if Dr. Donald's speech at Tuskegee has stirred up more commotion in Massachusetts than in Alabama. It is true that private letters from the Institute, expressing the deep resentment of the pupils and teachers, had been received in Boston long before the sermon was published, but no open comment upon it has been heard from that quarter; we did not expect it.</p>
                     <p>Not so here in Boston. While we admit the truth of some of the Dr.'s remarks, we condemn
<pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the whole spirit and motive, and frankly acknowledge that our chiefest concern is that Dr. Donald represents the growing spirit of the times--sympathy with the south and its methods, a growing belief in the inferiority of the negro, a disposition to put him down and back--these are the sentiments which are growing daily stronger in the North as well as the South. It is useless to blind ourselves to the fact that our position grows worse; we progress in education, in character and in the acquisition of money, but while in some cases these must tell, they do not bring that universal respect that they should. As long as identified with the race, the negro is regarded and treated as an inferior except in individual cases.</p>
                     <p>The prospect could hardly be gloomier. South Carolina will doubtless disenfranchise the black man and very shortly restrict his educational privileges. Florida has recently passed laws making it a penal offence for black and white to study together, and in Georgia <hi rend="italic">a black man can't even buy an Atlanta Constitution</hi> to show the ridiculous side of the situation.</p>
                     <p>We must acknowledge that there is nothing left for us but to strike for ourselves.  We have a few staunch friends, but only a few, and even public sentiment as its best is bored with us.</p>
                     <p>We can no longer wait for the problem to solve itself. Away with the doctrine of humility.  As Mr. Higginson says, let us "be bold." Life is more than meat. Let the people of South Carolina leave a state which gives them no good thing but food.  If extinction awaits us finally, let us go to meet it like men, not lie down for it to overtake us.</p>
                     <p>Here in the North the spirit of the times is felt, but here a black man is a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, and if forced to it can physically force the respect which is his due.  In the South we are powerless to strike for ourselves with everything against us.  But there are more ways than one. The negroes can leave and end a situation which grows worse rather than better. The time for resistance, wise resistance, has come. Our hope for creating public sentiment grows dimmer and dimmer, and patience and humility have ceased to be virtues.</p>

                  <p>Hurrah!  If one could only be a boy to throw up one's cap and shout out in the middle of the streets.  School, the long, tiresome ten months' session of the public schools is over at last, and one can rest for a few weeks at least.  Rest, sleep and mental dormancy before the long term of hard work begins.  Hurrah!</p>
                  <p>The air was full of school entertainments.  The public school child demands a picnic or party and an exhibition during the last two or three weeks, and as children rule the world nowadays, suffering teachers must comply with the demand.  Then the teachers from the other schools would come and look on and eat ice cream and smile, remembering their past experience, or sigh, dreading the future.</p>
                  <p>Southern University wound up in a brilliant display of musical glory.  The orchestras there, under Professor Nickerson's direction, are trying hard to rival the outside orchestras.  The baccalaureate sermon and commencement were revelations, especially the former, in scared music, and the possibilities of instruments in the hands of mere students. </p>
                  <p>Another brilliant social as well as musical success was the promenade concert given by the Eddie Moore Conservatory committee July 1 at Loeper's Park.  The name Eddie Moore committee serves as a talisman always, and as about a thousand invitations had been issued, there was a great and generous crowd assembled.  Interspersing the dances, the Students' and Ida Club orchestra played classic overtures, as also dod the mandolin club.  So then, every one voted the affair a success in three ways, musical, social and financial.</p>
                  <p>The Phyllis Wheatley Club held an interesting

                  <p>Texas, the largest state in the Union, has a most interesting history, one with which no other state can compare.  A stranger coming upon Thrall's or Pennybacker's history of Texas for the first time is lost in wonder and admiration of the daring deeds and almost superhuman accomplishments of its brave patriots in their struggles for freedom.</p>
                  <p>How many Texans have stood within the portal of the Alamo Mission in San Antonio and felt a glow of pride, not unmixed with sorrow, as the scene of cruel massacre of that little band, composed of 172 courageous men, by the savage Mexicans under their cruel leader, Santa Anna, rises before them.  How one's heart burns with indignation when he remembers that these martyrs were not even given a Christian burial, but were piled in a huge heap and burned!  Every one of that noble band killed and burned!  Every scene rises vividly before our eyes as we gaze upon the beautiful Alamo monument erected within the precincts of our capitol grounds in Austin.</p>
                  <p>The State Teachers' Association, which convened at Austin, June 11 to June 14, was one of the most successful in its history.  The attendance was larger than that at Galveston last year, and the papers read showed careful preparation and were both instructive and helpful.  It is to be regretted that more of the young teachers do not take an interest in this association.  These inexperienced workers are just those who need the aid of such instruction, and yet they are slow in taking the advantage of the opportunity of meeting and comparing notes with our leading educators of the state.  We, as a race, labor under most adverse circumstances, and there are things which the young teacher, who is to succeed, must know. These cannot be found in text-books; they can only be imparted by those experienced educators who have worked in this particular field; they, only, can aid and strengthen these young birds which are, for the first time, about to essay their tiny wings and soar away. Too soon they will discover that they are not teaching the model boy or girl spoken of in the different educational journals, who always gives the expected answers. On the contrary, their boys and girls seldom or never give the correct answer, and they so discourage the young teacher that he often silently vows to let their morals, at least, severely alone. Theory is one thing, but practice is quite another. Let us urge our young educators to meet with us, join us, visit us, and learn how we have groped in the dark and reached--not perfection, but a plan for better and more effective labor.</p>
                  <p>Teachers from all over the state were in attendance. All of the great schools were well represented. Dr. I.B. Scott, of Wiley University, at Marshall; Prof. H.T. Kealing of Paul Quinn College at Waco; Prof. L.C. Anderson of Prairie View State Normal School at Prairie View; Prof. M.H. Broyles of Hearne Academy at Hearne; and Prof. D. Abner, Jr., of Sequin College at Sequin. Beside these, all of the large cities were represented by the principals and assitants of the different schools, as well as the army of teachers from the rural districts.  What an array of intelligence and culture!  Nothing but a great good can come from such a gathering.</p>
                  <p>The day sessions were held in the chapel of Tillotson College, and the night sessions at the Third Baptist Church, Wesley Chapel and the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church. It all ended in a blaze of elegance and beauty at Turner Hall, where the citizens had prepared a most sumptuous banquet, which was partaken of with much enjoyment, while the orchestra discoursed sweet strains of music.</p>
                  <p>Just a word to my friends. You see that Texas has joined this grand array of states, and she has come to stay. We wish to make the Texas department one of which all Texans may be proud.  This can only be done with your assistance.  Do not wait until your school re-opens to give us your subscription, but subscribe at once, so that you may not miss anything.  The paper is such as to need no encomiums; one needs but to see it to like it, and only to read it in order to praise it. I ask you to give me your aid by passing the paper on to some friend.  Texas must not be behind the other states. I rely upon you to assist me in making it second to none.

                  <p>BOSTON.</p>
                  <p>The events of the month of course have been graduating and commencement exercises. Among the graduates were included Miss Genevieve Lee from the Newton High School, Miss Gertrude Peake from the Boston High, and Miss Mary Lewis from the Everett school.</p>
                  <p>Out at Harvard Mr. W.H. Lewis took the degree of LL.B., and Mr. Munroe Trotter finished the academic course, a winner of two degrees in four years, B.A. and M.A.</p>
                  <p>Both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Trotter entertained on Class Day.  Mr. Trotter an especially large company of buds and belles and matrons.  Of course, "it goes without saying," although said many dozens of times, that everything was "perfectly lovely."  The day was perfect, the girls radiant in their fresh and appropriate costumes, and "the spread" most satisfactory.  Conspicuous among the girls present were Misses Maud Trotter, Cromwell, Marsh, Glover, Grant, Lillian Lewis, Cartwright, Scotron and Bessie Mitchell.</p>
                  <p>The closing of the schools brings home our college girls as well as our teachers.  Miss Hemmings comes back from Vassar, Misses Bake and Trotter from Wellesley, all fresh refutations that pretty girls are not students.</p>
                  <p>Miss Florence Smith and Mr. Parker Bailey are at home on their annual vacation, and Miss Ella Smith is paying her yearly respects to her Alma Mater, and making a round of visits in Boston and vicinity.</p>
                  <p>The friends of Miss Hattie Howard of Philadelphia are in receipt of invitations to her wedding which takes place on the 3d of July.  Miss Howard is well remembered here as a girl of especial vivacity, intelligence, and attractiveness.  She marries the Rev. John W. Johnson of Virginia, and will make her home in Richmond.</p>
                  <p>Rev. A.C.  Garner, of Paris, Texas, and Mrs. H.E. O'Neil, of Hot Springs, N.C., are in Knoxville attending the bedside of their sick sister, Miss Marion Garner, a young elocutionist of much promise.</p>
                  <p>In its last issue, the <hi rend="italic">Statesman Exponent</hi> showed a flattering degree of appreciation of the efforts of our women in the field of literature by its liberal clippings from the columns of the WOMAN'S ERA.</p>
                  <p>This week's mail brought quite a pleasant surprise in the invitation of the Ida B. Wells Club of Chicago to the marriage of its president.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The first quarter of the editorship of the Open Court has reached its limit with this, the July issue of the ERA.  The list of subscribers is still expanding.  I can but express my heartfelt gratitude to those who have shown and are still showing by every means in their power the interest they take in the uplifting of the womanhood of the race by their labors on behalf of the WOMAN'S ERA and "The Work of the Afro-American Woman."</p>
                  <p>One of the most gratifying facts in my experience of this work is the deep interest taken in these publications by the men of the race.  Many of the progressive professional men of Philadelphia, such as Drs. Jackson and Cox, dentists, Dr. George R. Hylton and Dr. N. F. Mossell have secured copies of these works for use in the waiting rooms at their offices.  Other gentlemen have subscribed for these works as birthday, graduation and wedding gifts, and also assisted in the sale at many points.  These facts prove conclusively that if a just cause be properly presented, the men of the race will show themselves loyal to the work in hand.</p>
                  <p>A dear unknown white friend in the south sends me a letter stating the fact of her having come in possession of the last three copies of the ERA containing the Open Court.  She is engaged in work among the colored people.  She desires to present and has already presented me with pamphlets of Bible readings.  For all this I appreciate the dear lady, but her letter continues and I cannot forbear giving the readers of the ERA an extract from the closing pages:</p>

                  <p> editor meets in the course of years with many proofs of kindness, but this assurance that our people, as represented by the various departments of the ERA, are not looked upon as heathen, surpasses all others thus far received.  </p>
                  <p>all means let us continue this work of convincing our white friends of our merits.</p>

                  <p>"What America Owes to Women" is a handsomely bound book by Lydia Hoyt Farmer. The introduction is by Julia Ward Howe, and it contains many full page portraits.  The general subjects embraced are: Women in the Home, Women in Professions, Business and Trade, Women in Literature, Women in Art and Music, Women in Education and Science, Women in Philanthropy, Women in Church Work, Missions and Charities.  It contains many interesting anecdotes and personal sketches as well as brilliant articles from the pens of Mrs. U.S. Grant, Jessie Benton Fremont, Mrs. Frank Leslie, Jane G. Austin, Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, Mary A. Livermore and many others.</p>
                  <p>Someone who knows whereof he speaks, says, in regard to the countless number of books being published at present, "The quality of the paper is so poor that at the beginning of the twenty-first century, not one of them will be in existence." Mr. Swan, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Records, after a thorough investigation of the subject concludes that there is as good, if not better, paper made today than ever before, as well as poorer, but that neither good paper nor good ink can be had at bargain counter prices. It has been suggeted that public libraries be supplied with books of superior material that can be warranted to outlast those now in general use.</p>
                  <p>Bret Harte is said to be about to publish a fairly long story, but whether is is a romance of California or London is not known.  What a pity he did not save his very euphonious title, "The Bell Ringer of Angels," for a long story instead of applying it to such a short one. This story, "The Bell Ringer of Angels," contains a deep romance in spite of its brevity. Its attractive but worthless heroine, and its two good men and true, particularly he who sacrifices himself, recall the plot of Hall Caine's best novel".</p>
                  <p>Freeman G. Miller, a native of Indiana, farmer, teacher and, now, Professor of Literature in a Western college, is attracting attention by his poetry which has a picturesqueness and dash that is extremely captivating.

                  <p>SUBSCRIBE FOR MRS. CASNEAU'S GUIDE TO ARTISTIC DRESS CUTTING AND MAKING.</p>
                  <p>It is entirely original and is sure to satisfy a long felt want of young dressmakers, women who do their sewing at home, and those who anticipate learning the trade as the means of gaining a livelihood.</p>
                  <p>The book is self-teaching and can be used with any system or with paper patterns.</p>
                  <p>The order of arrangement places the rules where they will come in regular order for cutting and making a gown. In fact, the aim has been to make the work eminently practical for the average woman.</p>

Of Los Angeles, California, Have placed upon the market <lb/>
20,000 ACRES 20,000</p>
                  <p>Of the finest land on earth, which they intend to colonize with colored people, and at prices within reach of men of small means. In order to induce investments in these lands we offer 2,000 acres to the first settlers at <hi rend="bold">$20 per acre</hi> and guarantee to deliver water to each 20 acres sold, sufficient for irrigation. These lands lie 60 miles north from Los Angeles, and 7 miles from the Southern Pacific R.R., and consist of a rich friable loam, being of sedimentary formation mingled with decomposed granite. The soil is from 4 to 50 feet deep, and is capable of producing everything on earth that grows in this land of <hi rend="italic">wonderful production</hi>.</p>
                  <p>It lies at an altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level and is peculiarly on the land of the olive and almond.</p>
                  <p>SMALL FARMS</p>
                  <p>are the rule in Southern California and more profit can be realized from 20 acres here than on 160 acres in the East.</p>
                  <p>AFTER 2,000 ACRES HAVE BEEN SOLD</p>
                  <p>the price will be $35.00 per acre.</p>
                  <p>It is not an unusual thing for trees in bearing to yield</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>These lands have perfect title and will be sold for one-third cash, balance one, two and three years, with interest at 6 per cent per annum.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>Whereas, a most indecent, foul and slanderous letter, traducing American womanhood, has been sent to Miss Florence Balgarnie of England, by one Jno. W. Jacks, Pres. of the Mo. Press Association,</p>
                  <p>Be it therefore resolved, that this National Conference of Colored Women denounce this man as a traducer of female character, a man wholly without sense of chivalry and honor, and bound by the iron hand of prejudice, sectionalism, and race hatred, entirely unreliable and unworthy the prominence he seeks.</p>
                  <p>That no man capable of reverencing his mother or protecting the unsullied fame of any woman, much less Miss Balgarnie, whose life work entitles her to the respect at least of progressive and wholesome minds, regardless of sex, wherever principle and unselfish efforts to uplift struggling humanity exists. And as the man has not only slandered the women of negro extraction but the mothers of American morality, on a question that not only involves the good repute of the present generation, but generations yet to come, </p>
                  <p>Be it resolved, that our condemnation be expressed in leaflet form and forwarded to England, with the request that a copy of each be enfolded in all the publications sent out by the Anti-Lynching society.</p>
                  <p>Be it further resolved, that we hereby express our appreciation of Miss Balgarnie and the whole English people for their unselfish interest in the cause.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>Whereas, it occurred to the Era Club of Boston to issue a fraternal call to the Colored Women's Clubs of America to meet in this city to discuss the needs of the race,</p>
                  <p>And, whereas, the result of that call has brought together many of the noblest women of the race, who might otherwise never have met, and whereas the meeting has been one of profit and pleasure to the individuals and the race, be it therefore resolved, that we do now extend to the Era Club and its honored president our deepest appreciation of the pleasure, profit and courtesy extended to us as a conference and as their guests.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>RESOLVED, That we, the representative women <gap agent="unknown"/>   in United States, have witnessed with great admiration the noble and truthful advocacy of Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett, defending us against the lying charge of rape, and we take this opportunity of congratulating her upon her recent marriage, and are glad to hail her, in the face of all her assailants, as our noble "Joanna of Arc."</p>

To us you are inexpressibly dear, and we wish you to feel that your sorrow and anxiety are ours, and that the prayers of the colored women of America are that God, in his infinite mercy, may "let the cup pass" and spare your parent for many years, so that her watchful love and care may continue to guide you and help you in your noble work for humanity. But to one of your abiding faith there is no sweeter consolation than that "He doeth all things well."</p>

                  <docAuthor>Kate V. Carmand</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>Feeling the need of our women coming in closer contact with one another to discuss matters of vital interest to the race we represent, and which can only be done by organization, the Women's Loyal Union was formed December 5, 1892, with Mrs. Victoria Matthews as president, which office she now holds, and to whom much of the success of the Union is due.</p>
                  <p>We have for our watchwords, "Vigilant, Patriotic, and Steadfast."</p>
                  <p>Our object is the diffusion of accurate and extensive information relative to the civil and social status of the colored American citizen, that they may be directed to an intelligent assertion of their rights, and unite in the employment of all lawful means to secure and retain the undisputed exercise of them.</p>
                  <p>The methods of the Union are, First, full and free discussion of existing evils, moral, physical, and political. Second, the circulation of printed matter relating to the colored American, whether written by them or not.</p>
                  <p>We have a membership of over seventy women, pledged as willing workers. Many have proven themselves, zealous, earnest, and always ready when called upon to contribute not only their time, but their means. Among, our members we claim professional women, doctors, school-teachers, literary women, writers of poetry and prose, trades women, artists, home-makers and housekeepers.</p>
                  <p>We have formed chapters, or branches, in Charleston, S. C., Memphis, Tenn., Philadelphia, Penn., and Brooklyn, N. Y. Since our organization, we have called public meetings in our churches to discuss topics affecting the interests of the race in the Southland and in our own section, with beneficial results. At one of our meetings we had the honor of having present as our guest, the President of your club, Mrs. Josephine Ruffin, who read a very interesting paper. We have contributed clothing and money to the Sea Island sufferers; presented a very fine Mason and Hamlin organ to the Colored Hospital and Home of this city. To stimulate race pride, we held in the parlors of a private residence an exhibition of art, work done by colored men and women, with marked results; so much so that an organization now holds an art exhibit every year.</p>
                  <p>Sent petitions on the Blair Resolution to Congress, signed by over ten thousand men and women. Through the untiring energy of our President, distributed hundreds of circular letters through the South and West, asking for information concerning the moral, intellectual, physical, and home life, generally, of families. Assisted various causes by giving entertainments.  Presented Miss Hallie Q. Brown with a purse of money toward her mission in England, to solicit funds to establish a library at Wilberforce College, to be called Frederick Douglass Library. Presented to Miss Jennie Dean the sum of fifty dollars for the Manassas Industrial School.</p>
                  <p>In the death of the Honorable Frederick Douglass, we felt that the women of our land had lost a great advocate and staunch friend, and as a token of our appreciation of his efforts in our behalf and sorrow for our bereavement, our Union presented to his widow and family it handsomely engrossed, bound, memorial resolution.</p>
                  <p>In the early part of June last we gave an entertainment at Bethel Church, where Mr. Richings exhibited his views of people, places, industries, and progress made by the colored people, especially in the South, despite the oppression and disadvantages they labor under. The race problem seems to he solving itself. Give us a chance!</p>
                  <p>We are now turning our time and attention to the circulation of printed matter in the form of leaflets, which have been suggested to us by the answers contained in the replies to the circular letters. We have already printed for distribution, at a small price within the reach of all, leaflets addressed to "Parents and Guardians," and will soon have another, "The Sanctity Of Home," to be followed by others-- all of which are written by members of our Association.  In this way we hope to reach the masses, and do more effectual good than spoken words to the few.</p>
                  <p>We have not always had the helping hand extended to us that an organization and such an object calls for and demands, but by persistent effort in the future, as in the past, we hope to merit the good will and ready assistance of all good women throughout the land.</p>

                  <docAuthor>M.E. Dorsey, L.H. Wooldridge, S.A. Dupee, and M.E. Capelton</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>Under the name of the Harper W.C.T.U. a few of our women have been organized and work along reformatory lines for the past five years, the object being to better the condition of the colored people of the community by a gradual training of the mind to higher aims and purposes of life.</p>
                  <p>Realizing the value of the words of Solomon, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it," we early opened a training school, and each Saturday afternoon gathered the children and gave them about an hour's instruction in plain sewing, after which short talks on temperance, truthfulness, honesty, etc., were given by some of the women of the Union.  Pretty songs were also taught which the children delighted in.  At length a fair was held, and each article made by the children, together with fancy articles made by members and friends were placed on exhibition with the maker's name attached.  Each child delighted to point out to parent or friend any article she had made, and a parent delighted to buy because her child had made it.  This training school proved very helpful to the children.</p>
                  <p>The Union also held mothers' meetings, and special talks were given on "Child Culture," "Social Purity," "Value of Example," etc.</p>
                  <p>Our much beloved and esteemed F.E.W. Harper was brought to Jefferson City to lecture, and the great zeal and inspiration of this race-loving woman is still bearing fruit, from seed sown when she was with us years ago.</p>
                  <p>In fact, any zeal that I, or most of the other colored women of Missouri have today for the uplifting of humanity, we owe to Mrs. Harper, who came to us and turned our thought to the great need of earnest effort by our women.</p>
                  <p>At Jefferson City, Mo., there was a number of women who, for various reasons, we could not enlist in our W. C. T. U. work, so in a meeting of the Union we decided to extend our borders, and admit women who were not specially pledged to temperance work.  Therefore, the Woman's Club was formed, the special object of which is to work more earnestly for the purity of our homes and the general advancement of colored women.</p>
                  <p>The first week as a club was to bring Miss Ida B. Wells Barnett to Jefferson City to lecture, June 18. By her graphic descriptions of the wrongs upon our race, she won the applause of all who heard her.</p>
                  <p>The ERA and other colored  papers are read and discussed at our meetings.</p>
                  <p>When the call for this Conference was made through the ERA, to refute the charge of immorality by one J. W. Jacks of Missouri, on hearing his slanderous letter our women became aroused as never before.  Committees were appointed to confer with ministers; as  a result, three large public meetings were held and strong resolutions adopted and sent to Montgomery City, Mo., his home, to England, and the press.</p>
                  <p>Nothing has ever called forth such just indignation from the citizens of Jefferson as did this base letter, coming as it did from our own state. When this call for a Conference was read, they decided to send a delegate, at any cost, to utter their project.  And never did women work more earnestly than did these slandered women to raise the money which makes it possible for me to be with you today.  Their prayer is that we may yet bring good out of this great evil done us, by resolving here to so unite ourselves and concentrate our forces that we may be able to show to the world that we, as colored women, are struggling for a higher, nobler, and purer life.</p>
                  <p>The following resolutions were adopted and sent to this Conference:--</p>
                  <p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 23, 1895.</p>
                  <p>National Convention of the Women's Club, Boston, Massachusetts:</p>
                  <p>At a recent meeting of the Woman's Club, located at Jefferson City, Missouri, in Cole County, a committee was appointed to draw up resolutions denouncing certain slanderous statements which were written in a letter to Miss Florence Balgarnie, London, England, dated March 6, 1895, by one J. W. Jacks, president of the Missouri Press Association.  Whereas he says, first, that the Negroes of this country are wholly devoid of morality; second, that the women are prostitutes and all are natural liars and thieves.</p>
                  <p>THEREFORE be it resolved, That we denounce him publicly to the entire country as a falsifier, and his statement as wholly devoid of truth.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">THE WOMAN'S CLUB OF OMAHA.</head>
                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>In answer to the call of Mrs. Ophelia Clenlaus and Mrs. Laura M. Craig, eighteen women assembled in Omaha, Feb. 14, '95, to discuss plans for organizing the progressive women of the city into one united body, whose aims and purposes might be the education of the heart, hand and mind of the individual members and the promotion and advancement of all race measures. Realizing the fact that the best success results from concerted action, and that not individual effort, nor the efforts of the few, but rather the united efforts of the masses must win the desired end, the women unanimously agreed to organize themselves into a body that should be liberal in its principles, broad, charitable and far reaching.</p>
                  <p>The result was an association called "The Woman's Club of Omaha," which aims to serve a three-fold purpose.  First, to stimulate intellectual development; second, to promote unity and good fellowship amongst its members, and thirdly, to strengthen by organization, individual, philanthropic and reformatory effort.</p>
                  <p>The club is strictly nonsectarian in its principles and offers its advantages to any respectable woman who is in sympathy with the work and may present herself for membership.  Already the number has increased from 18 to 15 active workers, and the club enjoys the happy distinction of possessing the approbation and endorsement of nearly every broad-minded, race-loving, progressive citizen of Nebraska.  As a further mark of recognition, the club has received greetings from the Omaha's Woman's Club, an organization composed of 600 white women; resolutions of endorsement from the Afro-American League of Nebraska, an institution operated by the negro talent of the state, and numerous  letters of approval from the clergy, literary societies and private citizens.  It is the hope of the women to soon establish themselves in permanent club rooms where they may hold their regular meetings, lectures, etc., and conduct a library and reading room for club members and any other women who may desire to take advantage.</p>
                  <p>A committee is now negotiating for such rooms and until the plans are completed the club will continue to hold bi-weekly meetings at the homes of the members.</p>
                  <p>For intellectual development the club work is divided into three departments, viz., Political Economy and Civil Government, Current Topics and English Literature and History.  Every member of the club must register in some one of these departments, all of which, under competent leaders, are doing excellent work.</p>
                  <p>In all reformatory efforts affecting mankind generally and women particularly the club enters enthusiastically.  At the last general assembly of the state of Nebraska it was engaged earnestly in the effort to stop the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the state, and joined heart and soul in the social purity question, sending down to the legislature a petition, bearing the names of 150 colored women, praying that the body to raise the "age of consent" from 15 to 18 years.</p>
                  <p>In many ways the association has helped individual advancement, and much credit attaches to it for its unceasing and untiring efforts in securing the appointment of a negro teacher in the public schools of Omaha.</p>
                  <p>While the club was organized primarily for intellectual improvement, social affairs are not entirely neglected, and its members strive to create and foster a spirit of kindliness and sociability amongst women generally by bringing them in friendly touch with one another, but the lighter amusements of life are discouraged in that the club as a club does not engage in them.  To supply the diversion necessary to healthy social life, a series of lectures, followed by an hour's social intercourse, has been inaugurated and is yielding excellent results.  The annual lecture course consists of eight numbers, the most of which are to be gratuitously furnished by local talent, in which Omaha happily abounds, and as the club can arrange to do so the remaining numbers will be filled by the best imported talent the race affords.</p>
                  <p>Together with the prescribed club studies and readings and the lecture course the Woman's Club of Omaha is thoroughly enjoying its initial year.  Perfect harmony and good will prevail amongst the members, and the women seeking to "touch life with upward impulse" are quietly executing their desires to make our girls better women, our women better wives, our wives better mothers.</p>
                  <p>The western delegates were typical western women, bright and alert, and thoroughly at home on the floor.  Unfortunately their stay was so limited, and the sessions of this congress so prolonged and fatiguing that Boston saw little of them socially.  All of the westerners, Mrs. Pitts, Miss Anthony, and Mrs. Mahammit were at Mrs. Ransom's.</p>

                  <docAuthor>The Women of Bethel Church, New York City.</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>To the Women's Convention, Boston, Mass.</p>
                  <p>The call sent out by the Era Club proposing a gathering of Afro-American women in deliberative convention simply put in words what has long been the wish of thousands.</p>
                  <p>We are sorry, that the "Jack's letter" should seem to be the prick which stung to activity. We would not have it to appear that we are aroused to action only by the irritation of external circumstances, but would be glad for the world to know that, in reality, our women are taking intelligent cognizance of the inner life of the race, and that the desire to be actually noble is more potent than the impulse to resent insult and seek vindication. What we think of ourselves is always more important than what others think of us, that is to say, self-respect based upon truth is the foundation we seek to lay.</p>
                  <p>We would desire the world to know that long before the base slanders, born in the vile mind of a common Missouri white man, were uttered, our women were actively at work among the masses of our people, seeking to ground them in the fundamental principles of true progress. The existence of such a sheet as THE WOMAN'S ERA, the existence of such organizations as the Women's Loyal Union, the Women's Afro-American League, the Women's Meeting of Bethel Church, the work which these various enterprises have laid out and the earnestness with which it has been pursued, are in themselves a complete vindication against all slander. We trust that the vile "Jack's letter" will not give color to your deliberations nor in any sense become the spur under which you lay out the work of the future. We would have the world to see that there is a large element of our women who, in convention assembled, can show complete freedom from the imaginative and mercurial disposition which has been the fatal defect in so many conventions of our men.</p>
                  <p>We believe that it would be unwise to permit this convention to be the sounding board of mere "agitators."  We recognize in the "Jack's letter" and other such slanders the natural results of the resentment provoked by the fierce denunciations of "southern white women" that have been injudiciously indulged in by some of the "mercurial persons" of the race.  We look with more hope to the conservative workers who seek to lay true foundations and who employ such means as the well-edited WOMAN'S ERA and the well-conducted organizations referred to above. The truly representative women of the race can never be enlisted in any movement that is lead by the ignorant enthusiasts or the fiery agitators, whose incentive to action is the intoxication of excited sensibilities, full of the chimeras of distempered fancy.</p>
                  <p>We know the character of those under whom this convention is called, and we have faith in the calm sobriety which has always characterized their endeavors. We send to you Mrs. Hannah Jones, who will represent the one thousand Afro-American women of Bethel congregation. Our work is among the masses and our motto is "true progress."  We can and will lend powerful support to such enterprises as promise true good to the race.</p>
                  <salute>May God prosper your great undertaking.</salute>

                           <p>To the Woman's Conference in session in Boston, Mass., under the auspices of the Woman's Era Club:</p>
                           <p>GREETING.</p>
                           <p>"Let love be without dissimulation.  Abhor that which is evil; <hi rend="italic">cleave</hi> to that which is good."
Rom. 12: 9.</p>
                           <p>We, the Cleave Circle of King's Daughters of the Antioch Baptist Church, New York City, regret very much that we find it impracticable to be represented among you in person, and take great pleasure in conferring with you by letter. We heartily unite with you in all good in behalf of the object of your work. We think it a very timely move, and hail with joy the "era" of woman's activity amid the many interests which should demand the attention of every "energetic" woman, for upon each rest greatly individual thought, expression, and action, which can and shall do much toward revolutionizing the preset state of affairs existing in this most enlightened age of all time--the dawn of the twentieth century--and believe much can be done in this direction by working in conference for the improvement of law, leading to equity in the administration of the rules of government, without partiality.</p>
                           <p>The Rev. Granville Hunt, pastor of Antioch Baptist Church, kindly called our attention to the infamous letter written by John W. Jacks of
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Missouri to Miss Florence Balgarnie of London, England, regarding the characters, etc., of colored women.  After having considered it thoroughly, we are prepared to say emphatically that it is erroneous and contradictory as a whole; and we are inexpressibly sorry that enlightened America has a citizen in public service, who manifests in plain English his lack of that sensibility, love for neighbor, which teaches us to consider both sides, yes, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sides of a man's condition, especially when treating on <hi rend="italic">character </hi>.</p>
                           <p>As members of an organization striving for the betterment of humanity along all lines impartially, we would advice John W. Jacks to read Prov. 28 and digest its contents; and we pray that he, through Christ, may be lead to think and act according to God's own words as written in his Book.  <hi rend="italic">May he be saved! </hi>  And as to the disposition of his letter, we are content that your mature judgment will, with divine guidance, manage it aright.  After this manner, we pray for you in all your deliberations, and most co-operatively sign ourselves,</p>

                  <p>GREETING.</p>
                  <p>It was proposed in local circles-too late, however, to become practicable-that joint resolutions and a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> letter endorsing your Convention and expressing sympathy with its motive and tenor be prepared by the various religious bodies and other altruistic organizations in this vicinity, and sent by the hand of the Nebraska Delegate to your Convention.</p>
                  <p>In lieu of such general documents from my congregation, I send you most gladly a personal letter, less authoritative, perhaps, but none the less sincere, as an <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> expression of my deep interest in this advance movement among the women of our race, which issues in your Convention.</p>
                  <p>This is the age of centralization and unification:  concentration of forces, unity of purpose.  You show yourselves children of the age by assembling in convention for "devising liberal things" for the advancement of the interests of and for the protection of the womanhood of the Negro race in America.</p>
                  <p>National conventions are not necessary, however, to vindicate the <hi rend="italic">honor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">good name</hi> of Negro womanhood from libelous attacks by <hi rend="italic">obscure</hi> Southern journalists, such as the unknown individual from Missouri, whose letter to Miss Balgarnie was in part responsible for your Convention.  What vindication needs Negro womanhood?  Look at our happy and virtuous homes.  If our womanhood is depraved by what <hi rend="italic">miracle</hi> are our homes preserved?  National conventions of Negro women <hi rend="italic">are</hi> necessary, however, to demand such legislation as will protect comely colored girls and women from the insults and rapacity of Southern chivalry.</p>
                  <p>Your deliberations will be, I trust, marked with wisdom, and fruitful in results.</p>

                  <p>One of the interesting features was a delegate from "the thousand women of Bethel Church, New York," Mrs. Jones.  Mrs. Jones was a calm and dignified delegate and, representing so many women, attracted much attention.</p>

                  <p>One of the departments of work taken up by Harper W.C.T.U. is the care of orphan and neglected children.  In October, 1888, the ladies opened a home for homeless children. Since that time it has fed, clothed, and for a time, schooled 110 children. The management consists of a board of fifteen ladies chosen from the W.C.T.U., under whose entire charge is the care of the Home.  The Home is unendowed, our means support being by donation, subscription, and entertainment.  Our current expenses are from $100.00 to $115.00 per month. We keep regularly employed a matron, nurse, and cook. While non-sectarian, it is emphatically a religious institution. While we try to meet the physical and mental wants of our children, we also give them religious instructions and a reverence and love for God's word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <text>
                        <body>
                           <p>Friends or strangers are welcome to make inspection of our Home at any time. We have 42 children in our Home at present. We receive no children under two years of age or over twelve years. At the age of twelve years we find homes for them, as we know the individuality of each child can better be preserved, its character studied and molded and more freedom granted in a private home than in an institution.</p>
                           <p>We place children out for adoption on three month's trial.  If, at the end of that time, the party and institution are both satisfied, we make the stay permanent by adoption; if either is dissatisfied the child is recalled. When adopted, so far as possible, we keep in communication with them and know their welfare.</p>
                           <p>As to our <hi rend="italic">resources</hi>, we have none.  All of our expenses are met by donations from a generous public and entertainments, without which our Home would long since have closed its doors, but with which we have thus far been able to receive and properly care for all its inmates.</p>
                           <p>It will be readily seen that upon a Board of fifteen ladies there is entailed in this work of soliciting a very arduous task.  With great cause for gratitude in the past, we look earnestly into the future, hoping the time is not far distant when the St. Louis Colored Orphan Home, which has proven itself a necessity in the community, will not be allowed to struggle on without an endowment fund, the income of which will be sufficient to relieve us of the outside and humiliating work of securing money to feed and care for the helpless orphans who appeal to our sympathy.  We cannot measure the good it reaches into eternity.</p>

                           <p>To the Honorable President of the Woman's National Convention, Boston, Mass.,--</p>
                           <p>WHEREAS, one John W. Jacks, President of the Missouri Press Association, has written a letter to Miss Florence Balgarnie, Honorable Secretary of the Anti-Lynching League of London, England, whereby he attempts to traduce the womanhood of the American negro, and whereas the future of every race of people is entirely dependent upon the intellectual and moral status of its womanhood, and,</p>
                           <p>Whereas, the letter referred to is a willful misrepresentation of facts, originating from a morbid brain and a lack of appreciation of truth and justice,</p>
                           <p>Therefore, resolved, that we hereby denounce and brand the Southern gentleman as a willful and malicious falsifier and traducer of womanhood.  That no gentleman worthy of the name could afford to lay aside his dignity to indulge in such language as that contained in the letter to Miss Balgarnie from John W. Jacks; that we entertain no fear for the anti-lynching cause through such agencies or methods.  </p>
                           <p>Be it further resolved, that we heartily endorse the action of the Colored Woman's Club of Omaha in sending a delegate to the National Convention to be held at Boston, that they have our sympathy and will have our co-operation in all they may do for the elevation of mankind, regardless of race or nationality.</p>
                           <p>Be it further resolved that a copy of these resolutions be sent to the Woman's National Convention through the representative of the Colored Woman's Club of Omaha.</p>

                  <p>To the Conference of Colored American Women assembled in Boston, Mass.:</p>
                  <p>The colored women of St. Louis have received with pleasure the call issued by their sisters of the Woman's Era Club for a conference to be held in Boston.  We recognize the fact that there is a pressing need for such a conference, since never in the history of our country ha prejudice against our race been more active, and in certain directions more influential and more regnant.</p>
                  <p>We recognize the fact that we are no longer wards of the nation; the time when we could ask for special legislation in our behalf, either by the national Congress or the state legislatures, has passed; that to ourselves, and ourselves alone we must look for progress in the future, and that that progress must come through the cultivation and exercise and virtues proper to a Christian civilization.</p>
                  <p>Living in the state from whence has recently emanated a foul slander upon our people, we emphatically protest against the truthfulness of the same, and joyfully join our sisters of the whole country in vindicating the womanhood of our race.</p>
                  <p>Hoping that deliberations of the Conference may be moderate in tone and wise in purpose, and that the plans of action proposed may be prudent and practicable, we pledge ourselves to the extent of our ability to aid in carrying out the work which it may propose.</p>

                  <p>The Woman's Progressive Club of Salem was formed June 12, '95.  The purpose of this club is to broaden and strengthen the moral, social, intellectual and religious life of its members, and through them to make itself a power for good, not only in their home, but abroad in other fields; also to help those who have not had the advantages of home influence and education, thereby assigning them to a higher plan of living.</p>
                  <p>As our club is of very recent formation, the report is necessarily brief, but as the days and months pass by we shall be enabled to accomplish some good.  Our club consists of 17 members, who are wide awake, enthusiastic, and interested in helping to solve the various problems of our day and time.</p>

                  <p>We consider this Woman's Conference to be a matter of vital importance to the women of our race, and would extend our hearty goodwill and appreciation of the movement through Mrs. B. T. Washington, the originator and president of our club, who, with Miss Susie H.

                  <p>We have received your call and respond in spirit, if not in presence. We are not lacking in progressiveness neither in indignation at the slur cast upon our mothers, sisters, daughters, and ourselves by Mr. Jacks' letter, but circumstances involving finances prevent us from sending a delegate. Our women have held meetings, read and re-read the articles sent by your club, and we assure you that every sentence of Mr. Jacks' letter--the most infamous ever written by a man possessing the attributes of manhood--has been literally burned in each and all hearts.</p>
                  <p>Whatever action may be taken by the women who will meet you to discuss present conditions and how best to elevate the race, you can count upon our co-operation.</p>
                  <p>We wish you a pleasant and satisfactory gathering. I am very cordially yours,</p>

                           <p>I shall think of you and your friends in your convention beginning on the 29th, and only wish I could be there. You have done just what I expected brave, true-hearted women would do, that is, put on a bold front to the traducers of your race and sex. I am sure great good will come out of your discussions. Please let me see your paper if it contains accounts of it. I am most anxious to learn all particulars.</p>
                           <p>Please also convey my expressions of sympathy to your friends, and make it quite clear to them that in sending you the letter I was convinced of its utter and dastardly falsehood from the first. You have a hard fight before you in America, but never fear, right must triumph, and with God on your side you are in a majority.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>It is with especial joy and pride that I welcome you all to this, our first conference. It is only recently that women have waked up to the importance of meeting in council, and great as has been the advantage of women <hi rend="italic">generally</hi>, and important as it is and has been that they should confer, the necessity has not been nearly so great, matters at stake not nearly so vital, as that <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, bearing peculiar blunders, suffering under especial hardships, enduring peculiar privations, should meet for a "good talk" among ourselves.  Although rather hastily called, you as well as I can testify how long and how earnestly a conference has been though of and hoped for and even prepared for.  These women's clubs, which have sprung up all over the country, built and run upon broad, strong lines, have all been a preparation, small conferences in themselves, and their spontaneous birth and enthusiastic support have been little less than inspirational on the part of our women and a general preparation for a large union such as it is hopes this conference will lead to.  Five years ago we had no colored women's clubs outside of those formed for special work; to-day, with little over a month's notice, we are able to call representatives from more than twenty clubs.  It is a good showing, it stands for much, it shows that we are truly American women, with all the adaptability, readiness to seize and possess our opportunities, willingness to do our part for good as other American women.</p>
                  <p>The reasons why we should confer are so appar-
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ent that it would seem hardly necessary to enumerate them, and yet there is none of them but demand our serious consideration. In the first place we need to feel the cheer and inspiration of meeting each other, we need to gain the courage and fresh life that comes from the mingling of congenial souls, of those working for the same ends. Next, we need to talk over not only those things which are of vital importance to us as women, but also the things that are of especial interest to us as <hi rend="italic">colored </hi> women, the training of our children, openings for our boys and girls, how they can be prepared for occupations and occupations may be found or opened for them, what we especially can do in the moral education of the race with which we are identified, our mental elevation and physical development, the home training it is necessary to give our children in order to prepare them to meet the peculiar conditions in which they shall find themselves, how to make the most of our own, to some extent, limited opportunities, these are  some of our own peculiar questions to be discussed. Besides these are the general questions of the day, which we cannot afford to be indifferent to: temperance, morality, the higher education, hygienic and domestic questions. If these things need the serious consideration of women more advantageously placed by reason of all the aid to right thinking and living with which they are surrounded, surely we, with everything to pulls us back, to hinder us in developing, , need to take every opportunity and means for the thoughtful consideration which shall lead to wise action.</p>
                  <p>I have left the strongest reasons for our conferring together until the last. All over America there is to be found a large and growing class of earnest, intelligent, progressive colored women, women who, if not leading full useful lives, are only waiting for the opportunity to do so, many of them warped and cramped for lack of opportunity, not only to do more but <hi rend="italic">be</hi> more; and yet, if an estimate of the colored women of America is called for, the inevitable reply, glibly given, is, "For the most part ignorant and immoral, some exceptions, of course, but these don't count."</p>
                  <p>Now, for the sake of the thousands of self-sacrificing young women teaching and preaching in lonely southern backwoods for the noble army of mothers who have given birth to these girls, mothers whose intelligence is only limited by their opportunity to get at books, for the sake of the fine cultured women who have carried off the honors in school here and often abroad, for the sake of our own dignity, the dignity of our race, and the future good name of our children, it is "mete, right and our bounden duty " to stand forth and declare ourselves and principles, to teach an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women. Too long have we been silent under unjust and unholy charges; we cannot expect to have them removed until we disprove them through ourselves. It is not enough to try to disprove unjust charges through individual effort, that never goes any further. Year after year southern women have protested against the admission of colored women into any national organization on the ground of the immorality of these women, and because all refutation has only been tried by individual work the charge has never been crushed, as it could and should have been at the first.  Now with an army of organized women standing for purity and mental worth, we in ourselves deny the charge and open the eyes of the world to a state of affairs to which they have been blind, often willfully so, and the very fact that the charges, audaciously and flippantly made, as they often are, are of so humiliating and delicate a nature, serves to protect the accuser by driving the helpless accused into mortified silence. It is to break this silence, not by noisy protestations of what we are not, but by a dignified showing of what we are and hope to become that we are impelled to take this step, to make of this gathering all object lesson to the world. For many and apparent reasons, it is especially fitting that the <hi rend="italic">women </hi>of the race take the lead in this movement, but for all this we recognize the necessity of the sympathy of our  husbands, brothers and fathers.</p>
                  <p>Our woman's movement is woman's movement in that it is led and directed by women for the good of women and men, for the benefit of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> humanity, which is more than any one branch or section of it.  We want, we ask the active interest of our men, and, too, we are not drawing the color line; we are women, American women, as intensely interested in all that pertains to us as such as all other American women; we are not aleniating or withdrawing, we are only coming to the front, willing to join any others in the same work and cordially inviting and welcoming any others to join us.</p>
                  <p>If there is any one thing I would especially
<pb n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
enjoin upon this conference it is union and earnestness. The questions that are to come before us are of too much import to be weakened by my trivialities or personalities. If any differences arise let them be quickly settled, with the feeling that we are all workers to the same end, to elevate and dignify colored American womanhood. This conference will not be what I expect if it does not show the wisdom, indeed the absolute necessity of a national organization of our women. Every year new questions coming up will prove it to us. This hurried, almost informal convention does not begin to meet our needs, it is only a beginning, made here in dear old Boston, where the scales of justice and generosity hang evenly balanced, and where the people "dare be true" to their best instincts and stand ready to lend aid and sympathy to worthy strugglers.  It is hoped and believed that from this will spring an organization that will in truth bring in a new era to the colored women of America.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>Boston was a fitting place to hold the first conference of colored women that has ever been held in the history of the country. No one could look at their bright, intellectual faces and listen to their earnest words without feeling a new hope for the race which has such mothers and teachers.</p>
                  <p>As the colored woman has been the most oppressed and downtrodden, so now as she comes into the light of the new era, she will be the leader not only to those of her own sex who have not yet been so favored but to the other. The colored race, like every other, will rise or fall, be honored or degraded, according to the status of its wives and mothers, daughters and sisters.</p>
                  <p>We are sure that this convention will be an inspiration to the colored women of our country, and that the electric impulse will be felt North and South, East and West. If Phyllis Wheatley could only have seen this day! She whose star went down early in the eclipse of an unfortunate marriage, but whose short life was a dim earnest and  prophecy of the heights in literature, science, and philosophy, which the Afro-American woman is yet to attain. -- <hi rend="italic">Woman's Voice</hi>, Boston.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. Matthews of New York stopped with Mrs. Comer at the Highlands.  To many minds Mrs. Matthews was the "star" of the convention; so devoted was she to the interests of the Conference that Boston saw comparatively little in a social way of this gifted woman.</p>

                     <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                     <p>There has just closed in Boston a conference of the colored women of America. This conference was held three days, and during that time there were read papers as fine as any ever produced at any gathering; important matters were discussed earnestly and sensibly, and the large body of women brought together dissolved with the most amicable feelings toward each other.</p>
                     <p>It is you, women north, east, south and west, who made it possible to hold this convention, which has been a marked event of the times; it was your ready response, your intelligent appreciation of the situation, your singleness of purpose, which made the success of this gathering. You may well feel pleased with the outcome of it all. The callers of the convention reckoned wisely, they knew your temper better than those men who, in the light of their own experience, predicted disastrous failure.</p>
                     <p>But this is only a beginning. We want our national organization to be a model, an ideal body.  We want it run on the broadest lines and conducted in the most intelligent manner. You have done well; now prepare to do better than well, and in this, as in all things, prove yourselves a shining light to your brothers.</p>
                     <p>The selection of Mrs. B.T. Washington, of Tuskegee, Ala., as the president of the National Federation of Afro-American Women is going to prove beneficial in more ways than one. "Putting aside Mrs. Washington's personal. fitness for the position and the advantages for the work which her position as a co-worker with her husband will give her, this choice will go further than anything else in uniting the intelligent women of the North and South. It will cement the friendly feelings already existing. It will be the means of building up in the South large clubs for culture and race work such as already exist in the North. It is an earnest of the single-mindedness of our women and a good omen of the future efficiency and prosperity of our organization. Under the leadership of Mrs. Washington, who has devotion, energy, intelligence, and a large charity, no colored woman who has the interest of her race at heart can find excuse not to enlist.</p>

                     <p>The WOMAN'S ERA desires that its position in regard to the W.C.T.U. should be clearly defined. At the conference lately held in Boston a resolution endorsing the work and methods of the W.C.T.U. was introduced by Mrs. Anthony of Missouri, and an effort made to "rush" it through the convention. Mrs. Ridley, realizing that the majority of women present were unacquainted with the facts in the case, made an explanation, and in order that time might be gained to lay the matter squarely before the women, supported the president in her voting of the resolution as out of order. However, the Washington delegation pushed the matter, the resolution was presented and carried with half the women not voting and our dissenting voices. The resolution, though passed, never appeared for record and is still missing.</p>
                     <p>However, the matter was brought up at a special meeting of the Woman's Era Club. The following resolutions were presented by Mrs. Ridley and unanimously endorsed.</p>
                     <p>In closing let it be understood that the editors of this paper stand by Mrs. Wells-Barnett squarely in her position on this matter and fully endorse her work.</p>

                     <p>RESOLVED, That this club, while it recognizes and appreciates the good work done by the W.C.T.U., does not hesitate to condemn that body for its position upon the lynch law question and to deplore that the latest regulation passed at the London convention should be in effect a condonation of lynching.</p>
                     <p>That, in the light of the recent action of the W.C.T.U., the circular addressed to colored people and sent out first some two years ago, is misleading, and should be withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>That this club, believing the attitude taken by the W.C.T.U. is calculated to mislead foreigners as to the true state of affairs in the United States, calls upon representative colored women of the W.C.T.U. to be careful not to allow themselves to be included in the company of "apologists for lynch law," but, in the prosecution of their good work, let their loyalty to their race be known, not taken for granted.</p>
                     <p>That this club believes that in Miss Florence Balgarnie, of England, who stood so valiantly for our cause in the London Convention, the colored people have a brave and devoted friend.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1895</docDate>
                  <p>If any one doubts that Lady Somerset and Miss Willard are apologists for lynching, let him read the following marked editorial from their English organ, <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Signal</hi>, sent to Mrs. Ridley, with the above-mentioned ladies names as editors underscored:</p>
                  <p>"The Battersca tragedy follows close upon the Walthamstow horror; in each instance a little girl, a child, is the sacrifice to man's brutality and cruel passion. Are these crimes growing in England? And if so, as it seems to us they are, where are we to look for the reason? Is it not in the failure to mete out justice to such offences? Look up the records and see how often capture of the offenders has utterly failed, and how often sentence has been commuted to inadequate punishment. <hi rend="italic">It is such crimes and such travesties of justice that have made lynching possible in the United States.</hi> There is little likelihood that England will relapse into barbarism; but how should we like to hear of societies in America formed to secure Safety Of Person to English Female Children?"</p>
                  <p>We feel much satisfaction in being able to publish this; it settles the disputed question as to the position of these ladies of the W.C.T.U. on lynch law.</p>
                  <p>The argument set forth in this republished note has been made so many times that it hardly calls for an answer now. What interests us most is the fact that these ladies, out of their own mouths, convict themselves and stand self-confessed endorsers of lynch law.</p>
                  <p>We only make room in our already overcrowded columns for an extract from remarks on the lynching question by Mr. Moncure D. Conway, and published in the London Daily <hi rend="italic">News</hi> of July 30.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Conway's remarks meet this matter, and with his refutation we let the matter pass for this issue, only making these points in passing:</p>
                  <list type="simple">
                     <item>1. Only One fourth of the Negroes actually lynched in these United States are ever <hi rend="italic">accused</hi> of rape.</item>
                     <item>2. The majority of these cases have been found to be "trumped up."</item>
                     <item>3. No negro <hi rend="italic">has ever</hi> escaped punishment for this offence.</item>
                     <item>4. If this <hi rend="italic">lie</hi>were true, that the law fails to punish the negro, then the <hi rend="italic">law</hi>should be attacked, and the energies of the people directed to good government..</item>
                     <item>5. "Two wrongs never did nor never can make one right." It is at least expected of <hi rend="italic">reformers</hi> to recognize this truth.</item>

                           <p>Mr. Moncure Conway has presented to the Anti-Lynching Committee his report of observations on this subject made during his six months' sojourn in the United States. Mr. Conway, who is a native Virginian, says that his visit greatly strengthened his conviction of  the value and importance of the English Committee.  There is a combination of forces in America tending to induce torpor with regard to the lynchings in the South.  He has not seen in any daily paper of New York for several years a single editorial protest, of any earnestness, against these atrocities. In Boston, the Boston <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>, an influential evening paper, has, however, written powerfully on the subject, and in Chicago, the residence of Miss Wells, now Mrs. Barnett, the services of the Chicago <hi rend="italic">Inter-Ocean</hi> have been very great. But the American conscience has not been fully aroused. At the late meeting in London of the British Women's Temperance Association an American speaker, Mrs. Rounds, said, 'If we in America could only feel that when a criminal has been brought to trial and condemned, his sentence would be carried out, we should feel very different on this question of lynching. 'This,' says Mr. Conway, 'was a were imposition on the English women.  <hi rend="italic">Where are the instances of pardons contrary to public feeling?  In all American history there has never been an instance of pardon for a Negro violator of a white women or child.</hi>  That anyone making such a misleading statement in the presence of leading American women should not have been checked, illustrates what I have said, that my countrywomen are not yet awakened to this frightful wrong.'"</p>
                           <p>Our August number has been delayed in order to give our readers the news from the conference.  We wish that we were large enough and rich enough to print altogether the splendid papers read on this occasion.  We can only give them a few at a time, and feel that even in this way our readers will be eager to get them.</p>
                           <p>We did not aim to be, but we <hi rend="italic">were</hi>an object lesson and revelation to the men.  We hesitate to speak of the compliments received, but in the interest of the spread o intelligence, we must.  We believe the high tributes paid us by Dr. Crumwell, T.T. Fortune and Booker T. Washington were heartfelt, and just as welcome and just as sweet were the hearty but inelegantly expressed commendations of the males of our own household, who did not hesitate privately to tell us "You girls are daisies," "we men have got to hustle."</p>
                           <p>It was hoped to print in this issue the address of Mrs. B.T. Washington to the Conference.  Although promised, the copy has not yet been received, and after waiting several days we go to press without it.</p>

                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Inventive Age</hi> says:  "The most unique of all inventions which will be placed on exhibition at Atlanta by the colored people is Miss Miriam E. Benjamin's device known as the 'Gong Signal Chair.' This young lady inventor is at present a medical student in one of the colleges of the District of Columbia. She was born in South Carolina, and educated in Massachusetts. In 1888 the patent was issued to her, and soon after an improvement was added in order to cheapen as well as to add to the utility of the appliance.</p>
                  <p>"The invention is one of those useful novelties suitable for chairs in hotels and restaurants, on steamboats or railroad trains. It can also be used in theatres or legislative halls, and for invalids' chairs in the hospitals.</p>
                  <p>"The object of the invention is to mainly reduce the expenses by decreasing the number of attendants usually required for the convenience of guests; also to obviate the necessity of hand-clapping and loud calling, where the service of a page or waiter is needed. The present system now in vogue is to have one attendant for about every three or four guests. By the use of this invention, it is claimed, one waiter will be enabled to attend to the wants of from twelve to fifteen guests."</p>
                  <p>The young and flourishing Newbury Association of Boston held a delightful dinner and smoke talk at the suburban residence of Mr. J. B. Tatum, West Medford, early last mouth. A score or more of the members were present, and shared Mr. Tatum's hospitality in the way of a bountiful course dinner. Covers were laid for sixteen. Among the guests were Lawyer Clifford Plummer and Mr. Samuel Hodges, both of whom made encouraging and instructive addresses. Mr. Shirley Liggins, toastmaster, introduced the members in a particularly witty vein, and hearty responses were made to the toasts.</p>
                  <p>The young men composing the Association are for the most part so progressive as to be already well known in connection with successful business enterprises, Mr. J.B. Tatum being manager of the well-known catering establishment of J.R. Young, Mr. Clarence Robinson, associated with his father in the express business, and Mr. W.H. Scott occupying a trustworthy position with the Washington Street Stationer, M.R. Warren. Besides these gentlemen the Association includes Mr. W.H. Wilson, president, Messrs. Dane and Phillips, vice-presidents, Messrs. King, Hawkins, W. F. Phillips, Stith, Hipkins, and E.S. Hodges.</p>
                  <p>Miss Emma Wariner will remain away from Boston during the summer months.</p>
                  <p>Boston has been a veritable Mecca in this, the summer of '95. The C.E. brought a small army of visitors, and later the Conference swelled the number.</p>
                  <p>During the early part of July, Misses Miranda Vennig. and Carrie Compton of Philadelphia were in the city, the former the guest of Mrs. Lewis Terry; Misses Cora and Gertrude Smith of Washington the guests of the Misses Smith of Jamaica Plain; Miss Julia Wormley of Washington, who visited Mrs. B. R. Wilson; Mrs. Ellen Cruns and Miss Ingalls of Charleston; the Misses Williams of Washington; Mrs. Clough of Worcester, Miss Murphy, Miss McCloud, and Miss Param of St. Louis. So many of the young and shining lights necessarily called forth something in the way of social festivities. Among the occasions was a reception by Mrs. Terry and the Misses Smith; a musicale by Miss Glover; a large harbor party managed by Mrs. J. H. Lewis, an "At Home" by Miss Grant, and a supper by Miss Lillian Lewis; besides these were numerous smaller teas, luncheons, theatre parties, and excursions.</p>
                  <p>Miss Marion Shadd is spending the entire summer with Mrs. B.R. Wilson. Miss Shadd is studying geology at Harvard and most of her recreation is in this manner as excursions taken by the class in the study of rocks, etc. Mrs. Wilson has also entertained her brother, Mr. Bruce Evans, and Mrs. J.F. Cook and Miss Cook of Washington. Mrs. Cook was a delegate to the Conference, and both she and her daughter have been the recipients of much attention.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. G.F. Grant entertained Miss Smith and Miss Hunter during the Conference week.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. R. Jerome Jeffrey of Rochester, formerly of Boston has surprised and pleased her old friends by a visit to Boston, where she has taken up things just where she left; not only has she been prominent socially, but was also one of the active workers in the Conference.</p>
                  <p>The Misses. Baldwin have been entertaining Mrs. Cooper and Miss Barier of Washington and Miss Florence Lewis of Philadelphia. It would  be hard to get together a group of brighter women than these, and it goes without saying that the group of pleasure trips planned by the Misses Baldwin for their guests which included pilgrimages to Concord and to Plymouth, and trips down the harbor and drives through the country were in every respect delightful.</p>
                  <p>Miss Edwina Kruse of Washington is also in Boston; Miss Kruse is one of those general favorites who is welcomed wherever she goes.</p>
                  <p>Miss Marie L. Burgess has only just left the work she is so devoted to in the hospital at Hampton Institute, and come on to Boston to enjoy the few remaining weeks of her vacation.</p>
                  <pb n="19 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>Among the best known and most conspicuous women of the convention were Mrs. Cook, Mrs. Matthews, and Mrs. Cooper; all of these are women of unusual ability, and yet each is essentially different from the other. Mrs. Cook, intelligent and practical, and although versed in parliamentary tactics --always a cultured lady; Mrs. Matthews, full of fire and intensity, with natural gifts as a speaker and writer; Mrs. Cooper calm, thoughtful, and analytical,--a woman to mould opinion, rather than a leader of men. Mrs. Cooper, the student; Mrs. Matthews, a born leader; Mrs. Cook, the trained leader.</p>
                  <p>Another conspicuous figure was that of Mrs. B.T. Washington. Mrs. Washington wins love; she is warmhearted and largehearted, practical and earnest.</p>
                  <p>Miss Hunter and Miss Smith were among the younger members of the council, and were conspicuous for their culture and intelligence.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Williams of New York was also a notable figure. Mrs. Williams was ready in debate, and in her paper on the race work was one of those who "caught" the conference.</p>
                  <p>The alacrity with which our gentlemen friends responded to an invitation to address the conference one evening, on "political economy" proves what we have always asserted, that intelligent people who are earnestly and honestly seeking to advance the humanities, are not divided by either race or sex or section. T. Thomas Fortune, whose position as chief editor of the New York <hi rend="italic">Age</hi>, special writer on the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Age-Herald</hi>, makes him easily the foremost among colored journalists, ran over from New York to show his interest in the woman movement, and immediately ran off again to his work, thus depriving the ladies of the W.E.C. of the chance to show him some of the attention they thought he deserved and they had planned to give him. Henry B. Blackwell hastened back to Boston from a Chautauquan engagement in New Hampshire to tell the ladies, as no other could, their duty and opportunity in the coming crisis in the cause of woman suffrage.  His speech was thoroughly appreciated and made converts to the cause he always advocates, both among the men and women present. Wm. Lloyd Garrison promptly accepted the invitation, and as usual honored the gathering with an address as carefully prepared as would have been done for delivery before the U.S. Senate. To show the position of the "new" man on the subject of woman suffrage, Stanley Ruffin had been invited and was prepared to deliver an address. on that topic, but in the pressure for time home folk had to take a back seat.</p>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>'s excellent report of the convention deserves especial notice.</p>

                  <p>The WOMAN'S ERA is not satisfied with Miss Willard's rather mild treatment of the lynching outrages at the South, while it recognizes the fact that "Miss Willard is at the head of a tremendous organization, and in that capacity and in order to keep everything and everybody harmonious, is obliged to be politic, and for the welfare of the W.C.T.U. not to antagonize any section of this country."</p>
                  <p>No one yields to the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Voice</hi> in its admiration of Miss Willard, but a little more vim and fire in her utterances on this and kindred subjects would be refreshing.  The milk and water resolution passed at the London W.C.T.U. Convention that "We deplore the taking of life without trial," must strike our Southern brethren in much the same light that "Miss Feely's whips" did Topsy, as more amusing than painful. --<hi rend="italic">Woman's Voice</hi>

                  <p>Tillotson College at Austin has added a regular nursing department and will soon be turning out trained nurses. It is to be hoped that many of our young women will grasp this opportunity to make themselves proficient in this most useful occupation. I believe this is the only school in the state which makes a specialty of nursing. Why do not our other large schools attempt something in this line? It does not require the expenditure of any amount of money and is far more useful and practical than so much fancy work and drawing, for few, very few, ever become skillful in either of these arts.</p>
                  <p>Since the meeting of the Teachers' Convention at Austin everything has settled down into a monotonous routine and the teachers are scattered to the four winds. Now is the hard part of the teacher's lot. The all-absorbing question is, "Shall I be successful in procuring a summer Normal certificate?" Those who are not spending these hot days in teaching in some Normal are studying for the examination, occupying every spare moment in trying to master all the technicalities of each subject. It is certainly hard that teachers have to be called up at the most inopportune moments for examinations. The time which should be given to light reading and pleasant recreations must be spent in the hottest weather in hard study. In no other profession is this the case. There is little time for reading, for the text book must be one's constant companion. Why cannot successful teachers, who have taught a certain number of years, be given permanent certificates? The last legislature repealed this act before it had been given a fair trial.</p>
                  <p>The election of officers of the State Teachers' Association seems to have given entire satisfaction. There were few dissenting voices and little or no caucusing, which was somewhat unusual. The following officers were elected : Prof. M.H. Broyes, Pres.; F.W. Gross, W.M. Taylor, Miss Hattie E. Lee,  B.T. Wilson and Mrs. D. Abner, Jr., Vice-Pres. ; Miss Cora L. Smith, Sec., and Mr. W.R. Taylor, Asst. Sec., with Mr. E.L. Blackshear, Treas. The next meeting of the Association will be held at Corsicana.</p>
                  <p>All of the large cities in most of the other states are having woman's clubs, whose objects are to elevate and better the condition of women both morally and intellectually. Why cannot we, in Texas, have a few clubs? Let the leading women of each city get together and organize and go to work for ourselves. We must be taught to be good mothers; must learn how to train up our sons and daughters, for the future of our race depends upon the rising generation. Much good is being accomplished all over the union by the women's clubs, and Texas must not be behind in the march of progress.</p>
                  <p>The last of the summer Normals opened on the l6th of July and will close on the 16th of August.  It was a happy thought of Mr. Carlisle's to have two examinations, one in July and one in August. It gives teachers two chances to win certificates, which is certainly encouraging to those who fall by the way.</p>
                  <p>We are all glad that our little friend, Mrs. Wright Cuney, is at last convalescing. She has been so ill as to cause grave fears of her recovery, but now there seems little doubt that she will soon be around among us again. Miss Maud is already looking much more cheerful, as is also Mr. Cuney and Lloyd.</p>
                  <p>June weddings were numerous and aristocratic this year.  That of Dr. W.T. Green, of Bryan, to Miss Leonora Bowers, of Galveston, was one of the most pleasing affairs of the season. The bride was most charming and even more graceful than usual. The presents were most costly and numerous.</p>
                  <p>Many fine papers prepared for the conference remained unread; we might have been in session a week and then not have exhausted ourselves. Mrs. Luellan Williams, who is known to our readers as an able writer, sent a paper; Miss Ella Spencer's interesting paper on Art remained unread, as also did Mrs. Felts on Social Purity, Mrs. Anthony's and Mrs. Pitts', both on Race Work, and Mrs. Ridley's on What We Need for a More Equable Development.</p>
                  <p>The papers especially prepared for the conference would make a creditable book, and although it is only possible for the ERA to print them singly, or at most doubly, it is hoped that in some way or other, at some time or other, they may all be collected in one volume.</p>
                  <p>The sessions of the conference were brightened and lightened by some excellent music. Among contributors were Mrs. A. C. Sparrow, Miss Fisher, the WOMAN'S ERA protege, Miss Goines, Mr. Moses Hodges and Mr. Geo. L. Ruffin.

                  <p>Colored graduates from western schools, colleges, and universities this year seem to be exceptionally numerous and have excited an amount, of favorable comment from the public press that cannot fail to affect public opinion to a considerable extent. The one thing to be especially noted is the fact that those great journals which were once so hostile or disrespectful in all their references to colored people are now eager and pronounced in their encouragement and splendid estimate of the present worth and possibilities of the Negro race. As to the rights and wrongs of colored people, there is no longer any distinction between Democratic and Republican journals in the North. In this respect we have made a decided gain in our struggles to cultivate and win a favorable public opinion.  This growing habit on the part of hitherto hostile and unfriendly papers of telling the truth about us will inevitably beget among their readers the practice of doing justly.</p>
                  <p>The public is being gradually educated up to the feeling that the American Negro is a very interesting person in his self-emancipating efforts.  There is so much of pathos, of desperate triumphs and tragic disappointments in every achievement of the race that the onlooking world cannot fail to be moved with wholesome interest. This interest will certainly increase and deepen with each year of our advancement, and become more and more allied to the kindly forces which are subtly working out our destinies.</p>
                  <p>Referring again to colored graduates from western institutions, especial mentions should be made of Mr. Charles Winter Wood who received a B. A. from Beloit College, Wisconsin.  This is a case where a college degree contains more meaning than can be expressed in its perfunctory Latin and official signatures of president and faculty.  When Charles Winter Wood was gathered from the street gammins of Chicago and sent to Beloit College some years ago, hope of his recovery from the blight of his associations seemed ridiculous.  When he left Beloit the other day, polished, fluent, full of honors, and with the unstinted acclaim of the gathered thousands about him, his degree seems trifling when compared to his achievements.</p>
                  <p>To say that Mr. Wood's especial distinction is his histrionic powers, may seem to cheapen his worth, because false standards have given a wearying prominence to so many "barn-stormers"!  It is not too much to say that these so-called "dramatic readers" can sustain no sort of comparison to Charles Winter Wood.</p>
                  <p>Eight years ago the present Mr. Wood was discovered as "Charley" by Judge Jarvis Blume of this city, a man of fine literary taste, and a man full of chivalric kindness of disposition.  At the time of discovery Mr. Wood as a hopeless and almost homeless little urchin, but could imitate Irving with a wonderful accuracy and appreciation.  Judge Blume immediately decided he had found a rough diamond.  He took the boy to his office and got him to recite from Shakespeare to a company of gentlemen.  Every one was astonished, and after that actors and literary men, notably the late Prof. David Swing, heard him in parlors and testified to his exceptional gifts.  Interest in his education became manifest and finally a Mr. Hanson, a wealthy gentleman of this city, gladly assumed all responsibility for his proper education and has kept him in the Wisconsin Institution for the past seven years.</p>
                  <p>While in the college he won nearly all the prizes in the college oratorical contests.  In the Greek tragedy, "Oedipus Rex," performed by the students at Beloit and Chicago, Mr. Wood took the title role and scored an extraordinary triumph.  The dramatic critics in Milwaukee and Chicago papers pronounced his rendition "phenomenal."  In voice, facial aptitudes, grace of movement and dramatic feeling, Mr. Wood is surprisingly gifted.  It is not enough to say that he is not equalled in America by any of his race.</p>
                  <p>In deference to the wishes of his generous benefactor, Mr. Wood has decided to take a theological course in Princeton.  To those who have seen and heard him there is an instant wish that he might be given the utmost opportunity to develop his dramatic gifts.  He is a gentleman of such splendid rectitude of character, so refined I taste and culture-bent, that nothing would be too high, to hope for him on the stage, were he but untrammeled by the tyranny of American prejudice.</p>
                  <pb n="22 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>We Chicago women feel more or less ashamed in not being represented in the Boston Conference. The coming together of our representative women for high purposes is important enough to make us feel deeply concerned in the outcome. The character of the women who have been able to respond to the call inspires the absent ones with confidence that the Conference will mean much to every cause of peculiar interest to colored women. With such women it is not too much to hope that the Conference will set in force influences that will reach in their helpfulness the farthest confines of colored women's needs.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Clubs throughout the country are furnishing our women with the right kind of training for organic work.  Out of those clubs must come women strong in the elements of leadership for any cause having in it the spirit and purpose of reform.</p>
                  <p>Heaven grant to our sisters in council the inspiration to see and point the way that leads to a sweeter realization of the blessed privileges of a purer womanhood!</p>
                  <p>The foulness of the Missouri scribbler may be the ignoble cause of a combination of womanly influences that will mark an epoch in the advancement and moral assertion of Negro womanhood.</p>

                  <p>July 4th to 7th was of unusual interest to the colored people of Pittsburg and vicinity.  The occasion of this interest was the convention of the Woman's Mite Missionary Society of the Third Episcopal District.  Some of the most distinguished divines of the A. M. E. church, noted professors and many of the brightest women of the race were in the city:  114 delegates were present.  The secretary reported over $1,000 collected during the year by small contributions.  Reports from the various societies were most encouraging and marked great advancement in the work during the past year.</p>
                  <p>At the first session welcome addresses were made by Rev. I.W. Ross, Mrs. Gracie P. Offer, Mrs. D.S. Bently, Rev. W.H. Brown. These were responded to by Rev. Ransom of Cleveland, Mrs. S.T. Mitchell of Wilberforce, Mrs. Rosa Johnson of Cleveland, Bishop Arnett, Dr. Derrick. A letter of welcome from Mayor McKenna was read. Most of the next three days was spent in hearing papers and discussing questions relative to the work of this society.</p>
                  <p>That the association is far from partial in its missionary efforts needs no further proof than the importance paid the subjects, "Our West Indian," "Our Indian Mission," "Our Librarian Mission." Very able papers on these subjects were read by Miss Anderson, Mrs. Caliman, and Mrs. Hicks. "The Short Line to the Redemption of Africa" was treated in a very original way by Mrs. Ransom of Cleveland. She said the ladies are collecting money to bring native Africans to this country to be educated and return to teach their own people. She lived in joyful anticipation of the time when the colored women of Africa and the colored women of America would clasp hands at the foot of the cross.  A very beautiful talk, full of inspiration to the younger women, was that of Miss Lizzie Jackson of Wilberforce, who told of "Woman's Work in the Mission Field." Mrs. Draper and Mrs. Thurman were always entertaining and instructive in any discussion.  It was a rare treat and one fully appreciated to have at the same time and for three successive days our own Bishop Barnett, Dr. Derrick and President S.T. Mitchell of Wilberforce.</p>
                  <p>One very noticeable feature of the convention and worthy of commendation was the harmonious spirit that prevailed throughout the meeting.  It was undoubtedly a gathering of Christian workers intent upon doing the bidding of the Master.  We are glad to have had such a gathering of intelligent, zealous, Christian women among us.  Their presence has been cheering and inspiring.</p>
                  <p>The following are the officers for the ensuing year:  Pres., Mrs. Gracie P. Offer; Cor. Sec., Mrs. Anderson of Drayton, C.; Rec. Sec.,  Miss Lizzie Jackson of Wilberforce; Asst. Rec. Sec., Mrs. D.S. Bently of Allegheny; Treas., Mrs. S.T. Mitchell of Wilberforce.</p>

                  <p>July was a month of conventions. We have been busily engaged every day since the glorious Fourth.</p>
                  <p>Our Woman's Mite Missionary Convention which met in Pittsburg, Pa., was well attended and grand success followed our meeting.  Surely this organization of women of the Third Episcopal District is doing a noble work for humanity.  We were highly honored with our own fearless Bishop Arnett and the indefatigable Dr. Derrick.  These two were our timely counselors when our own storehouse of knowledge failed to meet the demand.  After a very pleasant four day's session of reviewing the work of the past year and formulating plans for the future, we very reluctantly took leave of one another, feeling that the convention was a success from the opening song to the fond benediction.</p>
                  <p>We had no more than reached home and become partially rested before we were ready to be off again to our S.S. Institute at Hamilton, Ohio. This institute is not composed of women alone, but to lookers on it would seem as though the women had the day there. Owing to the absence of our President, Rev. Priolean, the first vice, Miss Jessie Henderson, presided, and for the impartial way in which she ruled she was elected president for the ensuing year.  Miss Henderson is quite young, a graduate of the high school and normal of Springfield, Ohio, and a student of Wittenburg College of the same place.  She is a power for good among our people and as bold as a lion in upholding the right. On the second day of our institute it afforded us unbounded pleasure to welcome the fraternal delegate from the Southern Ohio Institute in the person of Miss Minnie Moore, who came bringing greetings from the sister institute.  After three days' successful labor the convention adjourned to the banquet room, where, beneath palms and among flowers and happy faces, we lingered until the approach of the "wee sma'" hours.</p>
                  <p>Time is fleeting. The conference of noble women is now a thing of the past, and although it was not our good fortune to clasp the hand of those who dare stand up for our womanhood, when recording the names of all the rest may ours stand out in bold relief as that of Abon Ben Adhern.</p>

                  <p>The scene of Hall Caine's latest novel, "The Shadow of a Crime," is England, and the time is the English Restoration.  It is a story of the many lives, upon which the shadow of the crime has fallen, and though perhaps not quite as good as his three celebrated novels, "The Deemster," "The Bondman," and "The Manxman," is sufficiently good to make a name for its author had these never been written.  The hero, Ralph Ray, like all of Hall Caine's heroes is a fine, strong, self-sacrificing man, who is ready to surrender his happiness to another; and his heroine, after deciding which of the two brothers she loves, sets about delivering him from a fearful suspicion in which she finally succeeds.</p>
                  <p>Says the "Twentieth Century":  "The cause of social reform in this country is immensely indebted to Howells.  His work is of priceless value.  He has the ear of all that is best and most cultured in this republic.  In preaching socialism to his countrymen our greatest living author has conferred a service upon his native land of which the value cannot but increase with the passing years."</p>
                  <p>"A Madonna of the Alps," a recent publication of German fiction is translated into English by Nathan Haskell Dole.  Its deep romance and dramatic episodes together with its exquisite local descriptions make for its author, B. Schultze-Smidt, a high place in the ranks of the novelist.  It is the story of an artist who in his travels in the Alps, falls in with a couple over whom a cloud of mystery and trouble has fallen.  The wife is accused of having killed her child, which in reality died by accident, and she by her sweetness of disposition and patient endurance of false accusation awakens a more than passing interest
<pb n="24 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
on the part of the artist-hero.  He finally brings about a reconciliation between her and her husband, whose love had also become estranged.  To the husband, too, he renders great service by removing from his mind the fear that he, in his duties as an Alpine guide, was responsible for the loss of one of a party whom he was conducting on a dangerous expedition.</p>
                  <p>"The Girl from the Farm," an English story by Miss Gertrude Dix, is the story of a young woman with a university education, and a great longing for some sort of philanthropic work in which to distinguish herself.  She, however, cannot see work ready to her hand in her own family which she could have done to great benefit to herself and others.</p>
                  <p>The International Education Series has been augmented by a translation of Frederic Froebet's "Pedagogies of the Kindergarten," by Josephine Jarvis.  It is designed to aid mothers as well as teachers in developing the mind of the young child.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Crawford's latest novel, "The Ralston's," is better liked in England than in this country.  It has run through its first edition there.</p>
                  <p>"One Fair Daughter," by Mr. Frank Frankfort Moore, is an interesting love story, though somewhat sentimental and sensational.</p>
                  <p>"The Woman's Manual of Parliamentary Law" is a safe-guide and great comforter to women in their efforts to know more of the management of public affairs.  Every club woman should have one for her reference.</p>

                  <p>California is so far away, and from Boston seven day's mail, therefore news by mail, which has become stale in eastern circles, is fresh to us behind the Rockies. To here offer good wishes for the success of the convention would be out of date, for before this appears in print the convention will have adjourned and the life of its good work begun.  Jacks' letter here and probably elsewhere received as much consideration as the laudable call to convention--possibly that too was wisdom's way. Said one of our women: "No one better knows than Jacks that the assertions in his letter are false. I do not fear his power to proselyte to his letter wording, believers from those who have not 'grown up in the wild and woolly west,' as I do fear the intimidation of many who might become part and parcel of public sentiment, condemning the unjust treatment of the negroes of this country. Our own boasted locality has recently demonstrated the sort of intimidating influences on a small scale that I argue."</p>
                  <p>"I neither agree nor fully comprehend your argument," interrupted our dear little enthusiast, tiptoeing to a covert height. "To a certain extent Jacks' letter <hi rend="italic">is</hi> true. A story that is partly true is harder to contradict than one wholly untrue. I think individual efforts to higher and better living, voiced here and there in a quiet way through the medium of the press, will more effectually overcome the belief in such charges than these short-lived excitements. Though the convention may do some good, it is a splendid opportunity."</p>
                  <p>"Jacks' reflections are <hi rend="italic">no more true</hi> of us than of other races, not as much," continued the first speaker in our group, tenacious of her view of the situation, and as if interrupted.  "We are aware of what followed the lecture of Rev. O. Summers, first negro chaplain of the late Cal. Assembly, protesting against the one blot now on the statute books of our state, the law making unconstitutional mixed marriages. At the close of the lecture one of our influential white divines, stirred by honest conviction and approval for every effort to elevate the moral condition of our state, in bold and strong words condemned class legislation and evidenced his influence to assist in striking from the California code the word 'black' or 'negro and mulatto' as it actually reads. In a few days after, you remember, appeared in one of our dailies a letter from an M.D., not as vile in slander of our morals as Jacks', but every whit as deeply colored with contemptible prejudice, I may even say blasphemous, for he attempted to base his illogical logic on God's word.  The white divine knew then, I believe he feels yet, that he spoke truth, but the M.D.'s criticism was stinging and severe, he became personal; the white divine had to reply.  He did not retract entirely his former statements, neither did he sustain them--was intimidated.  Expediency in his situation
<pb n="25 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
wrote a different explanation. Do you sabe my argument now?"</p>
                  <p>While we were for the second silently absorbed in thought, an old '49er looked over her specs and said:  "Girls, I dunno how that Jack's letter hez struck other places, but my 'pinion is, that letter should be follered by er few mo jess like it; it'll do good yit; bitter medicine is sometimes the best. That letter hez struck Los Anguls frum centre to circle in the way uv studin our gineral good.  It shows you it is more'n talk an' rezolutions. Nothin' but lively intrust, hard work, backed with dollars, 'll overcum sich things.

                  <p>The press has attracted a great deal of attention to the defense of a notorious criminal of Philadelphia, whose mother has tried to secure executive clemency for him on the plea of inherited criminal tendency. She pleads that he is not responsible for his acts, that she, the mother, is; that she was forced by cruel treatment from his father, before the son's birth, to steal from the father's pockets money for her actual sustenance. She writes:  "Thus I went through all the brain sensations of a daring burglar, even such as I am informed you have become. Shortly after that you were born, and I firmly believe you came into the world a thief, owing to that crime-like though necessary practice of mine."  Medical science asserts and has proven that mothers influence the character of their children before they are born, and such a plea, while new as an argument of defense, is worthy of serious consideration, especially to colored women in view of the fact of the serious charges made against us.  Sacred should be esteemed the privileges of motherhood and jealously guarded, that only the noblest and best influences be exercised in the formation of the child's character before its birth. As some one has said, "The successful reformation of a nation is begun before 'it is born.'</p>
                  <p>The comments of the local press on the successful rendition of the sparkling operetta, "New Flower Queen," classes it so far above <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> social events, that our letter would be incomplete without its mention. Those of us bemoaning our "crow feet" age signs are elated over compliments, "you <hi rend="italic">girls</hi> were just lovely."  How could it have been other than a success under the able direction of Mrs. Harry Reed?</p>

                  <p>It is entirely original and is sure to satisfy a long felt want of young dressmakers, women who do their sewing at home, and those who anticipate learning the trade as the means of gaining a livelihood.</p>
                  <p>The book is self-teaching and can be used with any system or with paper patterns.</p>
                  <p>The order of arrangement places the rules where they will come in regular order for cutting and making a gown. In fact, the aim has been to make the work eminently practical for the average woman.</p>

20,000 ACRES 20,000</p>
                  <p>Of the finest land on earth, which they intend to colonize with colored people, and at prices within reach of men of small means. In order to induce investments in these lands we offer 2,000 acres to the first settlers at <hi rend="bold">$20 per acre</hi> and guarantee to deliver water to each 20 acres sold, sufficient for irrigation. These lands lie 60 miles north from Los Angeles, and 7 miles from the Southern Pacific R.R., and consist of a rich friable loam, being of sedimentary formation mingled with decomposed granite. The soil is from 4 to 50 feet deep, and is capable of producing everything on earth that grows in this land of <hi rend="italic">wonderful production</hi>.</p>
                  <p>It lies at an altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level and is peculiarly on the land of the olive and almond.</p>
                  <p>SMALL FARMS</p>
                  <p>are the rule in Southern California and more profit can be realized from 20 acres here than on 160 acres in the East.</p>
                  <p>AFTER 2,000 ACRES HAVE BEEN SOLD</p>
                  <p>the price will be $35.00 per acre.</p>

                  <p>These lands have perfect title and will be sold for one-third cash, balance one, two and three years, with interest at 6 per cent per annum.</p>

                  <p>A new department will be opened next month -- Indiana, conducted by Lillian Thomas Fox, impersonator and dramatic reader, late of the <hi rend="italic">Indianapolis Freeman</hi>. Mrs. Fox is now at Atlanta, Ga.</p>
                  <p>The last club to be admitted to the Federation is the Phyllis Wheatley, a report from which, by its able president, Mrs. Williams, appears in this issue.</p>
                  <p>So many fine papers come to us from the women of Kansas City. It is indeed unfortunate that we are not able to print them all. It is said that the literary centre is going west.</p>
                  <p>In the loss of her beautiful baby boy Mrs. Terrell has the sympathy and condolence of her host of friends and admirers.</p>
                  <p>Representatives from the different New England clubs will shortly hold a meeting for the purpose of forming a local federation to co-operate with and be a component part of the national organization formed in July last. The gathering will be in response to a call from the national vice president for New England, Mrs. M.A. Dickerson, and will probably be held in Newport, R.I. A number of the members of the Era Club will make this meeting the excuse for a trip to that beautiful city by the sea, which in the autumn is at its best and balmiest.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mathews, (Victoria Earl) president of the Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn, is in Boston visiting the Woman's Era Club president. Mrs. Sada J. Anderson, of Toledo, Ohio, is expected soon as a guest in the same house, both she and Mrs. Mathews coming on for a consultation over ways and means for forwarding good works.</p>
                  <p>The next meeting of the Woman's Era Club will be held in the parlors of the Cooley House, Saturday afternoon, Nov. 2. The first hour will be devoted to business, after which an informal reception will be held in honor of the visiting president of the W.L.U. of New York.</p>
                  <p>What promises to be a most interesting occasion is the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Daughters of Zion, Thursday evening, November 7, at Zion Church, when there will be congratulatory speeches, music, a collation, and other festive features. A most felicitous time is expected. This beneficent organization, in its fifty years of vigorous existence, has been a prime factor in the prevention of suffering and pauperism among colored people, and as such should receive public recognition.</p>
                  <p>The Mammy Pleasance, referred to by many of our exchanges, and our California correspondent, will be recognized by a few old Bostonians as the mother of Miss Emma Stewart, the adopted  daughter of  Mr. and Mrs. Peyton Stewart. Mr. Stewart had the distinction of starting and successfully carrying on the first gymnasium established in Boston, with the daughter as teacher of the small, select ladies' class. Miss Stewart was greatly admired for her fine personal appearance and sweetness of disposition. All of the old girls will recall the good times at the Boylston Gym over the old Boylston Market, and the departure of the Stewart family to join Mrs. Pleasance in California, where one after another they passed away, a grandson being now the only survivor and heir-at-law to the great wealth accumulated by Mrs. Pleasance.</p>
                  <p>Miss Mabel Grant is organist at the newly organized Congregational Church, of which the Rev. Peter Stanford of Birmingham, EngIand, is pastor. The choir is made up of a large number of young people, and this, with the winsome sweetness of the pastor's English wife, is of great potency in gathering a flock together  at Berkeley Temple, where the services are temporarily held.</p>
                  <p>Old Southac, now Phillips St., is keeping pace with the rest of growing Boston. More activity is being displayed in improvements in that street of four short blocks than in any other of the same length in the city. Two school  houses and two handsome new churches act as a spur to improvements by property owners on that historic thoroughfare.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>"Unity in Diversity," the greatest good of all, and that which will serve to link the heart and hand of every woman in a common cause, should become the watchword of all in this nineteenth century.</p>
                  <p>American history has passed through the varied changes of one hundred and twenty years. Our country stands today strong, mighty and powerful -- a verified solution of the "one in many." A casual glance at the history of the nations of the world proves the superior strength of those who are united in purpose over those who are eyeing each other with covert suspicion, delving and scheming for petty, selfish ends, and stirring up anarchy and that strife that "divides man from man and makes him unmerciful to his brother."</p>
                  <p>As the  united mothers of ancient Sparta felt the necessity of resolute action in order to develop a vigorous constitution and make strong the emotional natures of their sons, so do our women of America need to feel the importance of a united fixity of purpose in reference to the affairs that relate to the development of the members of our sex; for with unity of purpose and resolute action, our women will receive an impetus that will urge them to a higher plane of mental, moral and physical life.</p>
                  <p>Thirty years ago, over two millions of our women were set free from bondage of soul and body. With few exceptions, such as had been gained by instinct, spiritual instruction, or a kind owner, none bad been taught lessons that tended to improve womanhood or motherhood, and their condition was most miserable. Without homes, and with no deep realization of their deplorable condition, many drifted here and there, often filling by the wayside, too helpless amidst their environment to have a desire to lead purer, nobler lives.</p>
                  <p>Not many years and the American Missionary Association and a host of noble workers began to open the doors of their schools to these people. They were stunned and bewildered by the reaction of their freedom from slavery, but the hearts of these former slave mothers began to quicken with the hope of securing the advantages of an education for their children.</p>
                  <p>With those born upon a more favored soil, many of these daughters stand today eager to lend a voice and a helping hand that will gain a reaction from the insidious influences of years of helpless bondage to the tempter, years in the thraldom of indifference, and years in the depths of some teachings that give its discount to lost virtue, degraded motherhood and the consequent tainted atmosphere of hundreds of our homes.</p>
                  <p>True, honored womanhood, enlightened motherhood, and happy, comfortable homes can only be secured by concerted effort on the part of the women of our land. Individual effort has accomplished some good in this direction, but the mighty effect upon the masses unreached will be the result of our future united effort.</p>
                  <p>In the month of July, 1895, Mrs, Josephine St.P. Ruffin of Boston called a three days' conference of colored women for personal exchange of greetings. This meeting did much to inspire and give life to the women whose privilege it was to be present; and the result of this gathering is a national organization of colored women, who have for their purpose the general development of women.</p>
                  <p>In the name of the National Federation of Afro-American Women, I call upon the women of the United States of America to lend us their influence, their interest and their aid.</p>
                  <p>Our poor need to be fed and clothed. Our women must be taught to study for their own advancement.</p>
                  <pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>They need inspiration and encouragement to keep a brave heart. Homemaking must be thought about, child-rearing needs attention. Our girls need social purity talks. They must be warned of evil company. They must be brought in closer touch with more that is good and pure. They must be taught to realize that they have a vital part to enact in developing the womanhood of their country.</p>
                  <p>All topics of social, economic and intellectual reform must in turn receive a share of our interest. For these and other reasons we need to form local organizations for local reforms in the cities, in the towns, the villages and country districts of our land.</p>
                  <p>We hope this call will touch many chords of hidden forces that will vibrate and respond, and thus our power as women of a national sisterhood will be strengthened and made more effective.</p>
                  <p>Let every delegate of the national organization answer to this by her individual effort "to uplift, to inspire, to do, to look for the noble purposes of life, and hold them aloft as a banner where those who see its folds waving shall say, 'Behold the influence of goodness, of knowledge and of truth.'"</p>
                  <p>In organizing our forces, we ask the hearty cooperation of the wives of our bishops and ministers, our professional women and other women who see the needs of our sisters and will seek to find a remedy.</p>
                  <p>Any woman or body of women, after forming an organization with this end in view, founded upon a definite plan of work for a definite purpose, and having a president, secretary and other officers, if needed, may become a part of our National Federation by notifying the secretary, Mrs. Florida Ridley, 103 Charles street, Boston, Mass., or the president, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee, Ala.</p>
                  <p>Let us take the words of Milton, who said, "We go through weakness to the greatest strength," and we as a race of women may by constant progress attain that goal. Our gain shall be "Concentration of purpose, forgetfulness of self, interest in the social, educational and moral reforms of the day, enlightened motherhood, intellectual development, individuality, and with all a steady growth in development of noble womanhood."</p>

                  <p>Our plan for the winter's work: For our own improvement we will devote our time to reading what matter we may secure relating to the race and its interests, and will impart all the good we can by doing benevolent and charitable work wherever and whenever we see it needed.</p>
                  <p>Among the objects calling our attention is the Home for Aged Colored Women at Providence.</p>
                  <p>Entertainments will be given for the purpose of procuring funds by which worthy objects coming before us may be assisted.</p>

                           <p>EDITOR OF THE WOMAN's ERA:</p>
                           <p>Kindly allow me space in your widely circulated paper to call the attention of the public to a worthy institution in South Carolina which I have the honor to represent, the Lowry Institute and Industrial School at Mayesville, S.C.</p>
                           <p>This institution was organized in 1881. It was founded by a few poor families who felt the necessity of a longer term in school for their children.</p>
                           <p>We began teaching in a rented house with seventy-five pupils and two teachers. The number increased so rapidly that more teachers were employed. The present enrollment of pupils is two hundred, with three teachers. The indebtedness of the school is $1,000, and seeing the utter impossibility of paying on this debt without help on the first of July, 1895, I was elected and sent out to solicit aid for the institution, that the work so well begun may go on successfully. I was one of the founders of the Institute, and have worked very hard in its interest. I shall be glad of an opportunity to visit all the churches in and around this city for the purpose of asking all friends and well wishers of education to assist in paying off the present indebtedness, or to receive books, money, clothing, etc., that friends may see fit to give for the work.</p>
                           <p>I have recommendations from the leading citizens of my town, which will attest the genuineness of my work and purpose.</p>

                  <p>October 4, on the return of Mrs. B.T. Washington from the Atlanta Exposition she called a meeting of the club to discuss the propriety of a barroom in the Negro Building there.</p>
                  <p>She described the bar, gave the supposed cause of its presence there, the present evil effects, those that will follow, and the lasting disgrace that the sale of intoxicants in this building will reflect upon the entire race.</p>
                  <p>In the discussion that followed it was agreed that the barroom should be condemned, expressions made public and a sentiment created by the public against this evil that should be righted. A committee was appointed to draw resolutions denouncing the bar. It was decided further to send a copy to Commissioner Penn of the Negro Building, to others in charge of Exposition, and to certain papers for publication.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Josephine T. Washington was appointed chairman of committee, with Mrs. A. Logan and
Mrs. Martha Hurd Willis.</p>
                  <p>The names of president and secretary of the club were affixed.</p>
                  <p>The Executive Committee of the Tuskegee Woman's Club, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Mrs. Josephine T. Washington, Mrs. N.B. Young and Miss M.M. Fleming, have arranged under various heads the following subjects for consideration of the club this first quarter: "Woman and her Work," "Education of Negro Girls," "The Temperance Movement," "The Status of the Negro Ministry," and "Robert Browning" -- life, characteristics of style, Browning Clubs in England.</p>
                  <p>At the first literary meeting of the current year two phases of women's work were discussed. First, "Women in the Home," by Miss M.M. Fleming. She gave but little latitude for the woman in her home outside of the sacred precinct; but pictured the ideal woman in a home  -- worth having. "Woman in Business," by Miss Leonora L. Chapman introduced facts and portrayed the business capacity or the new woman with a zest that created a fervor in the breasts of those who are advocating some of her principles, if not her dress. On the evening of Oct. 7 the subject for discussion, "The Education of Negro Girls," was divided under eight heads. First, "The Early Education," by Miss Mattie Child, who recalled the days of toil and pain that attended those who struggled in secret for a little learning. "Present Methods," by Miss Milla Hadley gave a marked contrast over that of years ago and a corresponding feeling of thankfulness was aroused in her hearers.  "Defects in Present System," were strongly pointed out by Mrs. Young, who gave the danger of extremes, one-sidedness, and the lack of simple thoroughness in small things. "Suggestion for Future Improvement," by Miss Sarah Hunt were timely. Miss Hunt gave her hearers some of the benefits she received from her summer course taken at Cottage City. "Home Training," by Mrs. Irene Bond, struck a keynote that gave no uncertain sound, but vibrated throughout with the idea of its vital importance. "School Training," by Miss S. Belle Bransford prompted each member to the serious duties that are involved in the work of training our student girls. "Training for Society," by Miss Eliza Adams brought out more duties for mothers and others in training the daughters in habits of economy, in modesty, in uprightness and honesty in dealing with others.</p>
                  <p>The discussion of current news of the week, introduced by Mrs. Sara Peake Greene, was deferred. Reports from the various departments of the club evinced an interest that no doubt will strengthen as the days go by.</p>

                           <p>To the Editor Woman's Era:</p>
                           <p>At a meeting of the Anti-Lynching Committee held on October 10, Mr. Moncure D. Conway in the chair, it was unanimously resolved</p>
                           <p>"That the Anti-Lynching Committee having heard in the early part of this year of the marked diminution of murders known s lynchings in the United States of America, nevertheless observe with profound regret that within the past few months cases of an aggravated nature have taken place, more especially in Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, and Ohio.</p>
                           <p>"While uniting with the friends of humanity in the United States in indignant protest against atrocities in eastern countries, they fear that such protest is greatly weakened by the participation of persons of their own race in burnings, shootings, hangings, mutilations, slayings, and dragging by the neck on the ground until choked to death by the dust of the street, which are characteristics of torture practised in America, upon persons innocent or guilty, without trial, or after due sentence has been pronounced by Court of Law.</p>
                           <p>They therefore appeal once more in the name of Justice and Mercy, to all Governors, Judges, Sheriffs, Senators, Representatives, Editors, Ministers of religion and other leaders of Social, Temperance, and Philanthropic bodies, praying them to co-operate in a vigorous and determined effort to end this terrible disgrace."</p>
                           <p>Permit me also to add a few personal words of sympathy, and to say with whatdeep interest and concern I am watching the heroic struggles of your race against the shameful tyranny of Senator Tillman and those bent upon the disfranchisement of colored man in South Carolina.</p>
                           <p>I have also noted with pained surprise the passing of a retrograde law in Florida, rendering the co-education of the two races penal.</p>

                  <p>There should be a united effort in the study and discussions of the reforms necessary to the progress of our people. The practical usefulness of a National Federation of our women is eminent. I hope the women's clubs and organizations of California may respond to the call of the president. This federation means so much toward the emancipation of women, <hi rend="italic">our women</hi>, and the general good of humanity.</p>
                  <p>At the state meeting of the W.C.T.U., Oct. 3d, the Demorest Gold Medal offered in the elocutionary contest was awarded Mrs. Aimee Murrels-Ray. The eligibles to compete for the grand gold medal were those who had won silver medals in their respective districts. With at least six competitors, Mrs. Ray won in her district. These medal holders contested for the country; Mrs. Ray won, then the counties contested for the state; this accomplished woman was again the success-
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ful competitor, and will be California's representative in New York for the National Diamond Medal. The only reference to this young woman's color was when congratulations were being offered; a lady stepped forward and said, "I am a Southerner. Proud am I that by ability you've won, but prouder still to know your people sent such a matchless exponent. 'Tis no longer color that is the total barrier -- be qualified and competent."</p>
                  <p>Probably the most important event before the Los Angeles women in October was the Woman's Parliament. The first day was devoted to  a symposium on dress: artistic dress, maternity dress, bicycle costume. A striking feature of the programme was an exhibition of a bicycle costume by Dr. Rose Talbot Bullard, showing the convenience and utility of her suit. The second day, woman suffrage was discussed from seven standpoints: Does the Wife Need It? Does the Mother Need It? Does the Unmarried Woman Need It? Does the Working Woman Need It? Does the Business Woman Need It? Does the Professional Woman Need It? Does Politics Need Woman Suffrage? I am certain no woman listening to these logical arguments longer questioned the need of the ballot for women. Mrs. Locke, of Pasadena, very cleverly handled the subject of artistic house furnishing, emphasizing the vital importance of making home beautiful and the available means within the reach of all to beautify their homes in this wonderfully beautiful land. At the close of the parliament women find themselves better fitted for the duties of home and the outside world, having gained by contact, social and intellectual, inspiration. The men, too, should have learned, atleast, that questions of importance can be thoroughly and intelligently discussed, and the point carried, without filibustering and confusion.</p>
                  <p>At the last meeting of the Woman's Club the following officers were elected: president, Mrs. Katie Williams: vice-president, Mrs. Amanda Jones; secretary, Mrs. Lilla Williams; corresponding secretary, Miss J.B. Fry; treasurer, Mrs. Mary Harris.</p>
                  <p>Eureka! San Francisco boasts of originating something "new under the sun" - a "bloomer café," where the best of service is given the patrons by girls attired in bloomers. It is said the waitresses were at first shy, but have found their costumes convenient for work. The advantages seem many, at any rate the girls have declared in favor of bloomers.</p>
                  <p>"Mammy Pleasance," of the Sharon divorce case notoriety, is reported dying. Rumor insinuates that she carries with her many secrets that if known would cause many of the high hands of 'Frisco to hang in mortification. She came to the coast from Boston early in the '50's, and has required great wealth, estimated to be way up in the hundreds of thousands and some hint at a million. Although having agents to collect her rents and look after her investments, she always supervised and was recognized as one of the shrewdest and successful financiers of San Francisco. Mrs. Pleasance was lavish with her money and has educated and supported several girls of good birth and saved from failure a number of business men. This old colored woman, in her alapaca dress and worn bonnet, was one of the familiar and prominent characters of San Francisco.</p>

                     <p>Few, perhaps, doubt the existence of the law of heredity; to do so is to doubt the very law of life, the propagation of species.</p>
                     <p>The psychological, physiological effects of the law, conditions which modify it, man's power to direct the law and his duty to himself and his race in so directing it, are indeed matters of question.</p>
                     <p>Nature uses this means to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, likewise his virtues. Among the strongest of human sensibilities is the love of parents for children, and when the law of heredity is accepted in its full force and, through this love observed, prison walls shall tremble, reformatories and refuges shall be institutions of the past, and man shall live in the full enjoyment of the Godliness within him.</p>
                     <p>Numerous astute minds have dealt with the question, among them Mr. Galton, who has tabulated the judges of England through two hundred years, the prime ministers through one hundred years, and so on through three hundred families
<pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
consisting of poets, musicians, divines, scholars, oarsmen and wrestlers. Of these three hundred families one thousand persons are eminent, four hundred and fifteen illustrious, and the general result is that one-half the eminent men have one or more eminent relations.</p>
                     <p>Another striking example is given of a family of five hundred and forty members, traced through seven generations; all descended from a common thief, the greater number of whom died on the scaffold for theft or assassination. On one side of this family shameful death on the scaffold or torturing imprisonment stood a constant menace, on the other the reward of a free, honorable and respected life, yet neither was so powerful as to overcome that inborn tendency to crime.</p>
                     <p>Distinctive genius or traits of character do not always appear to descend in a direct line; a generation or two may seem to lose the family bent, then a child is born giving evidence of the peculiarities of his grandparent or great grandparent. One way to account for this is by the Iaw of cross descent, that, as a rule, the mental qualities of the male progenitor descend to his female progeny, while the mental qualities of the female progenitor descend to her male progeny. It is often remarked that great men are seldom fathers of great sons. Another way to account for this is that the parent having the advantage of youth, health and mental activity will be reproduced in his child.</p>
                     <p> Ribot says that injudicious marriages are the cause of much of the degeneration in many families. In families of distinguished intellect it is found that there is a regular increase of power up to a culminating point, and as regular a decrease from that point. In the first case, marriages were consistent to its production, and in the latter they were incapable of preserving it.</p>
                     <p>The history of the races of man shows that physical and mental laws coincide in their action. The Jew is today what he was in the time of Moses. True his complexion is modified under different climactic conditions, but it is only by a long course of training, under entirely new conditions, that the Hebrew becomes other than the typical son of his forefathers.</p>
                     <p>Frederick William I., king of Prussia, recognized the fact that our peculiar bony structure, shape and size are an inheritance when he made it obligatory upon his soldiers to marry wives equal to themselves in stature, that he might secure a guard of giants.</p>
                     <p>Certain diseases of the mind and body are set down by the medical profession as hereditary, such as insanity, gout, rheumatism, consumption and scrofula. Science attempts to regulate but does not promise to cure. These words occur in a leaflet from the Moral Education Society: "Conscientious physicians, who consider the moral as well as physical hygiene, are perplexed and in despair over the problem."</p>
                     <p>It is true that environment and training may modify the natural condition of mind, but always at the expense  of greater energy and time than is necessary to overcome acquired habit. Hereditary traits have the great advantage of time. What circumstance of a life of twenty-five or fifty years could be so powerful as to overcome centuries of training?</p>
                     <p>The most effectual training which the human soul can possible receive is given before birth. If this be of such a nature as to counteract probable evil tendencies, the labor and time consumed in creating a new mental condition is much lessened and possibly rendered unnecessary later on.</p>
                     <p>In his treatise on the subject, Le Bon says: "Heredity governs the form of our body and its tendencies, the mind with its bent and its powers. It has placed in us those sentiments without which no society is possible, those intellectual aptitudes without which no civilization could have arisen.

                  <p>The work of the National Art Association for the promotion of the love of art among the masses signalizes an important movement in the realm of the aesthetics. It is a most gracious recognition of the refining and chastening influence of art in the life of the nation. The fierceness of politics, the strife of commerce, and the severities of religion all need the softening touch and ennobling influence of kindred arts.</p>
                  <p>I wish that I might say a helpful word as to how art may be brought into our home life and
<pb n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
made to minister graciously to the higher needs of our better selves. No woman sufficiently realizes the sacredness of her trust and privileges as a home maker who is not always ambitious to make her home bright, beautiful and refined, as well as comfortable and convenient. The world of art, with all its joyousness, moral and suggestiveness and purities, is now within the reach of any home that would appropriate some of its treasures. Indeed it seems as if the entire art world, by the use of the decorator's skill, is assisting woman to understand and appreciate the uses of art in the simplest articles of home furnishing.</p>
                  <p>The time was when art was haughty and exclusive and had no interest in or sympathy with the common people. It then lent itself only to palaces, churches and temples. The great masters felt that art was exalted only when the ceilings of some great cathedral or the walls of princely dwellings were decorated by their genius. Then it was that only the faces of saints, kings and the nobility were worthy to inspire the portrait artist. Then it was that art found more glory in portraying the triumphs of war than the laughing faces of childhood. But thanks to the growth of liberality in all things - thanks to the potencies of science and the humanizing influences of education - art is no longer the exclusive servant of the rich and noble. It now finds as much inspiration in the cottage as in the palace; it is as much glorified in portraying the face of a pure woman or an honest man as in painting the faces of saints or sickly princes. In short, art has become the ardent lover of humanity, seeking in every way to glorify our lives.</p>
                  <p>As an illustration of this fact, the pictures of the Columbia Exposition will at once come before the mind, and we will recall that the most popular and prized pictures in all the departments were those which represented the most ordinary incidents in human life. Take, for example, the picture entitled "Breaking Home Ties," made particularly pathetic by the recent heroic death of the celebrated artist who painted it. The artist here has seized upon one of the saddest incidents in family life - that is, the first break in the family union. The universal interest in this canvas was not so much due to its size, coloring or artistic finish as to the powerful representation of one of the tenderest sorrows of family experience. The artist has told here in a wonderfully impressive way the simple story of the power of a mother's love and the sacred influences of a good home.</p>
                  <p>If any of us have denied to the Indian any feelings of sentiment, there was a small picture in the United States section capable of correcting this opinion. The artist here represents an Indian stooping to take a water lily from the pond. This seems a very simple incident to claim the attention of an artist, yet the idea sought to be conveyed is a large and instructive one. The grim visaged brave is returning from a hunt with all the evidences of his savage butchery of bird and beast about him, yet the sight of the lily seems for the moment to change his whole nature, transforming his savagery into tenderness and his thirst for blood into a love for the beautiful. The spirit of humanity in this picture appeals to us so powerfully that we lose sight of the savage and feel only the touch of kinship with all who are moved to pay homage to God's gifts of the beautiful in nature.</p>

                  <p>Just at this time our woods and prairies are particularly beautiful. Here in the lovely Southland tired Nature seems loath to close her eyes and rest. She lingers and hovers around us, putting on every day a different dress, which, in gorgeousness, eclipses that of the previous day. The long red grasses, waving beneath trees whose leaves are bright with a variety of colors which defy the painter's art to reproduce, and the bright

sky bending above us, enclosing us in a blue haze, all form a picture upon which no eye can gaze without a feeling of reverential awe for the Giver of all good and perfect gifts.</p>
                  <p>How proud we have all felt over the achievement of our great orator, Mr. Booker T. Washington, whose address at the opening of the Cotton States Exposition excited more comment than any other of the day. Being a typical Negro, his grent qualifications cannot be attributed to his Caucasian ancestors. It was a sight to gladden the hearts of his race, to see him standing upon the platform, the cynosure of all eyes and surrounded by the pride and chivalry of the south, delivering an address to the very people who thirty years ago held his people in bondage and refused to believe that they were made for anything but serfdom. Truly, a new era is dawning upon us, and we should he glad and eager to recognize it. Of course, some of us do not agree altogether with some of his utterances, but every man has a right to his own convictions and they should be expected. For instance, Mr. Washington warns us against trying to spend our dollar in an opera house. Now, while it is certainly the best thing for us to be economical and less profligate, yet I can't see why we should be debarred from spending our money to see a good play, such as Shakespeare's tragedies, in which there is a world of instruction, any more than our more fortunate Caucasian brother. We certainly should be allowed to spend our money which we have earned, in any harmless way we may see fit, even though it be an opera house. Nevertheless, we all know that it is best to save all that we can, for there is no doubt but that the much talked of negro problem call only be solved by our growing intelligence and wealth. A man with money can do much more for his country, his race and himself than one without this necessary adjunct. Therefore we must get wealth. Get wisdom, but with all our getting, get wealth.</p>
                  <p>It was a day for much rejoicing when our legislature in extra session declared against prize fighting. We need our great state advertised, but not in that way. We repudiate the advertisement which other states refuse and which Dallas seemed determined to thrust upon us. Texas has too long been considered a haven of refuge for the disreputable classes from her sister states. It is time that we should let it be known, far and wide, that we have as good government here and as law abiding citizens as any in the Union.</p>
                  <p>The death of Mrs. N W. Cuney, last month, left a vacancy in our midst which cannot be filled. She died in Austin, where she had gone for her health.</p>

                     <p>It might have been expected that Mr. Fortune of the <hi rend="italic">New York Age</hi>, the proud paternal parent of the hyphenation, Afro-American, would buckle on his armor and go forth to do battle in defense of his cherished offspring, and in his zeal for the perpetuity of the thing he has given life to, call upon any who object to it to "face the music," or admit that they are "in a bad box." His most recent agitation is caused by a modest hope expressed by the WOMAN'S ERA that at the first gathering of the newest federation of women's clubs, now known as the "National Federation of Afro-American Women," the name will be changed, as it is a misnomer. Now it is much easier to give reasons for our objection to the name, "Afro-American," than to give the correct "form," as is demanded of us "honor bright." Boston people, whoare accused by the <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> editor of insisting "that they are something else than what they are, "are too busy rolling unnecessary words around under their tongues, be they ever so euphonious, and too conscientious to put counterfeit labels on anything. So because the appellation is cumbersome, unbusinesslike, and the use of it will help create proscription by more widely dividing and serregating a class that has as much right as any in the country to be known as Americans, without affix or excuse, we decline to be a party to this latest stamp act and decline to name this child until the coming leisure age gives time for the ethnologists to examine, divide, sub-divide and name the rest of the component parts that help make up the conglomeration known as the great American people. It is, however, earnestly hoped that it will not be necessary to wait for the critical analysis to be made before convincing those who now seem so anxious to prove themselves less American than others, that a people with two or three generations of ancestors born on the soil, many with an admixture of the blood of the Aborigines coursing through their veins, have as much, if not more right than any to be known simply as Americans. Until it becomes necessary to particularize (as it often does) the descriptive affix "colored" will fill the bill and cover the ground. So, with due respect for the antiquities, we must continue to reject the hyphenation, Afro-American, even though it is "a Latinization used by the Assyrians before the name of Christ," and still insist it is a misnomer when applied to all Americans who are colored.</p>

                     <docDate>November 1895</docDate>
                     <p>Many women are desirous of forming Clubs who, from lack of time or opportunity, have not been able to study the methods of successful clubs now in good working order. From such many requests have come. In giving a "club model," not "model club," we can do no better than to cite the methods of our own club, referring our readers to the reports from such clubs as the Loyal Union, the Washington League, the Kansas City League, for other and different models. Every club must work out its own salvation; adapt itself to the peculiar needs of its members. As has often been said, the Woman's Era, which is composed of nearly one hundred and fifty women, is divided into committees, every member being put upon some one of the committees, of literature, civics, philanthropy, domestic science, race work, etc. Each committee takes charge of a meeting in turn, selecting an essayist, and these are to discuss the particular matter which is to be put before the club. The club has the usual officers, with an executive board, which maps out the work of the year and presents it to the club in the form of a printed programme. Some one committee may choose to have a public meeting with public speakers, some one to have it "tea," some an entertainment to raise funds. "The ways they are many, the end it is one." Many of the clubs of other cities carry on large and flourishing industrial classes, where cooking, darning, patching are done; some, including the Era, have classes in literature, music, etc.</p>

                     <p>Any body of women will find so many avenues opening to them that, having once started, they will need no leading. Of course, much that is discouraging will be met with, but the work, in the main, will be found delightful.</p>

                     <p>There is no class in the United States that suffers under such disadvantages as the colored women. This class has everything to gain and nothing to lose by endorsing the woman suffrage movement. Race prejudice is expressed in many ways, but the exhibition of it is often crushed when a vote is wanted.</p>
                     <p>Colored women are prepared and would be very glad to be eligible for state and city positions as clerks, stenographers, etc., and might be considered once in a while if possessed of a vote.</p>
                     <p>It is reported that the colored women of Kentucky outregistered the white women two to one in their ambition to get a colored man on the school board. In commenting upon this, the <hi rend="italic">Boston Herald</hi> cites it as an instance of the ignorant class outvoting the intelligent class. To the unprejudiced person, this movement on the part of the colored women to obtain representation on the school board is an evidence of their earnestness and intelligence, and the sneer at ignorance is misplaced.</p>
                     <p>One of the most interesting incidents of the suffrage movement here in Boston is the desire to vote expressed by two inmates of the Home for Aged Colored Women, one of whom is ninety-two years of age and the other eighty-eight, and the spirited, intelligent letter sent by these old ladies to the suffrage leaders speaks volumes, particularly when it is realized that they have had no advantages in the way of education and environment. With the suffragists the colored woman is in good company; it is more often true that she is "in the house of her friends" with this class than with any other.</p>

                     <p>The first annual meeting of the Colorado Federation of Women's Clubs was held at Colorado Springs, Oct. 1 and 2. There was a large attendance and great interest was shown in the proceedings</p>
                     <p>The morning session of the first day was devoted to business. The report of the president, Mrs. E.M. Ashley, was read. Mrs. Henrotin, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, opened the afternoon meeting. The keynote of her address was, "As you rise to triumph, what a host of women mount. Among other things she reminded the women of Colorado of the close attention being paid to their course, and begged them not to think for an instant that they do not want the suffrage or any of the privileges or duties which that implies. She felt like saying to them, "What manner of women are you, that this magnificent thing should come to you?"</p>
                     <pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                     <p>The topic under "Trend of Popular Literature" - "To what extent may we accept," etc., the conclusions of others without personal investigation, was discussed by Mrs. Ida DePriest, one of the two colored delegates sent from the Woman's League of Denver. This was considered one of the hardest, if not the most difficult subject under discussion. Mrs. DePriest was equal to the occasion. She spoke with ease and crowded much thought into her five-minute paper. The subject was treated from an ethical standpoint, showing in many instances why conclusions deduced from reading magazine articles, reviews, and newspapers were false and not conformable to true progress. Mrs. DePriest said in part: "Only when the motive, intention, and apparent purpose of an act is known, and when a calm and comprehensive survey of the subject is taken, have we any right to express conclusions and then they must be placed on the broad ground of right."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. DePriest, who was an agreeable surprise to the women, is a graduate of the Denver High School, and is corresponding secretary of the Woman's League.</p>
                     <p>Among the other papers was one by Mrs. Lizzie Olden, the other colored delegate, who is president of tile Woman's League. She talked upon "The Club as a Factor in Bettering Social and Civic Conditions." Mrs. Olden said that grave problems were pressing upon society with such a force that one almost looks to the future with fear. In the day when the republic was in danger from rebellion, the moral support of the women was not less efficient than the bayonets of the men in settling the difficulty. In the new conflict of mental and social forces the women must come to the front again. Social conditions will never be better or purer than the best women of a community. She said: "Those who are called our best women have little right to their title unless they make use of their talents and their leisure for the benefit of the community."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Olden's address was frequently applauded.</p>
                     <p>The two ladies were the guests of Mrs. Dr. Solly, one of the wealthiest and most prominent club women of Colorado Springs.</p>
                     <p>Thursday afternoon, August 3, the Woman's League gave an informal reception to the teachers and visitors who still remained in Denver. It was a most pleasing affair. The visitors were asked by way of encouragement to the league to tell of the organizations of women in their respective cities.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Julia Hubbard, our own vice-president, welcomed the guests in a brief and appropriate address.</p>
                     <p>Fourteen different cities were represented. Miss Carrie Syphax, Principal of the Industrial Department of the schools in Washington, D.C., made the address of the afternoon. Possessing it thorough knowledge of her subject, she speaks with the utmost ease. All the mothers must have been impressed with importance of giving their children industrial training.</p>
                     <p>Among the others who spoke was Miss Coleman of St. Louis. She told in a very interesting manner of the Orphan's Home maintained wholly by the efforts of colored women.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Maguire of Kansas City made a pleasing address.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Braxton of Omaha, Neb., in a very graceful speech spoke encouragingly of woman -- thought she had awakened to a knowledge of her power and how best to use it for the betterment of humanity.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Cassell of New Mexico congratulated the Deliver League on what it had already accomplished.</p>
                     <p>All present were highly entertained and instructed. Surely the women of Denver feel that they have grown by contact with the fresh, bright spirits that have lingered a while among the Rockies.</p>

                  <p>Indian summer has come to the Maumee. We doubt if our own Hallie Q., in picturesque Switzerland, has gazed upon a more lovely bit of landscape than can be seen here in the Maumee Valley.</p>
                  <p>Squaw winter has paid her fleeting yearly visit, and Indian summer, with its draperies of scarlet and gold, now reigns a queen upon her throne.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps no city in the Union is provided with the means of entertaining visitors at this season of the year as is Toledo. A trip around the Maumee belt, through a living panorama of river and autumn tinted forest views, is not an experience

to be had everywhere. Going around this belt, one passes the historical Fort Meigs, one of the endeared spots in the hearts of the Buckeyes. For several miles side by side runs the belt line with the sparkling waters of the Maumee; then almost ere we are aware, we go spinning through the forest, which at this season of the year is glorious in scarlet and gold and alive with the busy nut hunters who make the woods ring with their merry making. This is the season to bring the blood to the cheeks and the frost sparkle to the eye of those who love life and the world in which they live.</p>
                  <p>It was our good pleasure last week to take a flying trip down through the oil fields it short distance south of here. For miles the eye could behold nothing but huge oil tanks, and derricks to hoist from the interior of the earth that which God has placed there for the benefit of mankind and only obtainable by the "sweat-of-the-brow." After a run of two hours or more we were in Findlay, the city that sprung up in a day during the great gas boom some few years ago. Things seem dead there since the boom has subsided, but we found our people alive enough to appreciate the good, beautiful and true, and on making known to them our especial business -- the ERA'S interest -- scarcely one failed to give the paper the proper support. For a small town, we dare say, that in intellectual aggressiveness many larger cities do not surpass Findlay. Here is a musical club called "The Sisseretta Jones Club." Mrs. Emma French is the president. She will soon graduate in music from the Findlay College, an institution broad enough to make no distinction, throwing wide its doors to all for intellectual advancement. We bespeak for the ERA progress in Findlay among white as well as colored people.</p>
                  <p>If any of the readers of the ERA have never heard Rev. J.M. Henderson of New York City on "Our Certain Destiny," be advised by one who has, and hear him at your very first opportunity. He has been with us this past week and delivered his excellent lecture in Warren Chapel to a small audience. On his return to Toledo, standing room will be at a premium, for he has reached the hearts of the people, through those who heard him.</p>
                  <p>Now, dear sisters, the Ohio department remains to be made what you will make it. I am sure that I am doing all that one can do to make it a success, and I ask your hearty co-operation so that we can all enjoy the fruits of unified labor, for the further advancement of our country-women. It is not so much the new woman as it is the awakened woman.</p>
                  <p>"To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heaven . . . A time to keep silence and a time speak." By the necessary changes of time, this is our time to speak and do. Let us ask God to grant us that give whereby we may not abuse this glorious privilege extended us now, by taking all the honor to ourselves.</p>
                  <p>Let us act in the living present.</p>

                  <p>New Orleans, La., Oct. 11, 1895.</p>
                  <p>The club originated in the necessity which I saw all around me, of doing something to elevate the race, especially its women. I have been, for twenty years, principal of a public school for girls, and try as I would, I could not succeed to my entire satisfaction in making real true women of many of my girls, because my influence did not extend far enough into their lives. I therefore thought of working upon the morals of the mothers, the majority of whom were poor and ignorant and could not give to their girls the home culture proportionate to their educational advantages. For years I have felt that something ought to be done, but just how to reach them I did not know. I wanted help, but did not know where to turn to find it. At last the club idea dawned upon me. It was a happy one. I consulted some of my personal friends, and by coaxing and begging others, we succeeded in getting enough together to organize.</p>
                  <p>The object is plainly stated in the first article of our constitution, wherein we declare that we will do all that our hands find to do toward elevating and helping our women. Every intelligent, respectable woman is eligible to membership; the dues are only five cents per month, with no initiation fee. The dues were purposely made so small that no one could offer the expense as a plea for not joining us. The result is that we now number seventy good responsible women.</p>
                  <p>The club is divided into twelve committees, every member belonging to one or more of them. The appointments are not arbitrary; each one chooses the committee she prefers. This is allowed so that each one will work with more zeal when interested in the work. The Temperance, Anti-Cigarette, Suffrage and Social Purity committees preach their respective doctrines, scatter reading matter and form leagues of all who take anyone of the pledges. The Literature, History and Law committees form classes in the club, for our own benefit and improvement. The Self Help committee are organizing free sewing schools all over the city to teach poor girls how to sew, but especially how to mend, darn and patch, for I find that many of them go in rags because they do not know how to use the needle. Each member of the club pledges herself to furnish two ready made garments during the year, and we propose to solicit aid from our friends so as to be able to have, at least, one new made garment to distribute to each one of our poor by Christmas. The Philanthropy committee devote their time to prisons and houses of correction; they give sympathy, advice, and reading matter to the inmates. We propose to enlist the interest of the colored lawyers to look into cases where we have reason to believe that injustice or undue severity has been exercised in their sentences. The Hospital committee has charge of visiting the sick in the hospital and at their homes, where they give whatever aid they can. Of the free night schools, we had one in operation all last term and will soon open others. They are open to all young people who are compelled to work in the day and cannot afford to pay for their schooling. The Committee on Newspapers and Current Events search the papers and magazines for all articles, either commendatory or derogatory to us as a race or as women. These are brought to the notice of the club, which endorses them as the case requires.</p>
                  <p>I have given you an outline of our work. Of course we are somewhat hampered for want of funds, but as we have considerable talent among us, we are preparing to give an entertainment for the benefit of our treasury.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Zangwill, whose letters in the <hi rend="italic">Cosmopolitan</hi>are such a fund of information, is thus described by a friend. "Mr. Zangwill has a lovable personality and is a delightful companion. He is a brilliant talker, for he does not save all his good things for his books, and he likes to listen as well as talk. His sweetness of disposition remained untouched by the hard grind of his youth, and it is unspoiled by his present success. Ho possesses the quaintest of humor, the dryest of wit and the keenest appreciation of good qualities in others. In spite of his enthusiasm in anything in which he is interested, and an often childlike enjoyment of little things, the sorrows and the injustice of human lives have sunk deep into his heart. He is in his thirty-second year. It is not strange that people think of him as much older. Personally he might be described as an ungainly man, awkward and unconventional in dress and movements, with dark, irregular features, a mop of curly black hair, and large, pathetic, near-sighted eyes."</p>
                  <p>Walter Besant is an advocate of the theory that novel writing can be learned like any other profession by anyone of ordinary ability, with due exercise of intelligence and industry. He is much interested in a sort of school conducted by prominent novelists, in which the manuscript of young authors is read and criticised, defects pointed out, and helpful and practical advice given toward improvement. In some cases the writer is advised to withdraw from a hopeless struggle.</p>
                  <p>"Religion in Common Life," a volume of sermons by various ministers, indicates that the pulpit is giving to the people something other than creeds and dogmas. Among the topics presented are "Individualism and Socialism," "Phases of Idleness," "Problems of the Poor," and "Religion and Politics."</p>
                  <p>"Ave Maria," by Miss Marie Louise Burgess of Boston, is an interesting story of love and devotion. It is a tale of the conflict between love and duty, in which love is sacrificed on the altar of faith. The neatness and correctness of the printing and the taste displayed in the binding make it an attractive little volume.</p>
                  <p>Edgar AllenPoe possessed the power of prophecy, for in a letter written by him in 1844 occurred this passage: "I perceived that the country could not fail of affording in a few years a larger proportionate amount of readers than any upon earth. I perceived that the whole energetic, busy spirit of the age tended wholly to magazine literature - to the curt, the terse, the well timed and the readily diffused, in preference to the old forms of the verbose and ponderous and the inaccessible."</p>

                  <p>It is entirely original and is sure to satisfy a long felt want of young dressmakers, women who do their sewing at home, and those who anticipate learning the trade as the means of gaining a livelihood.</p>

                  <p>The order of arrangement places the rules where they will come in regular order for cutting and making a gown. In fact, the aim has been to make the work eminently practical for the average woman.</p>

20,000 ACRES 20,000</p>
                  <p>Of the finest land on earth, which they intend to colonize with colored people, and at prices within reach of men of small means. In order to induce investments in these lands we offer 2,000 acres to the first settlers at <hi rend="bold">$20 per acre</hi> and guarantee to deliver water to each 20 acres sold, sufficient for irrigation. These lands lie 60 miles north from Los Angeles, and 7 miles from the Southern Pacific R.R., and consist of a rich friable loam, being of sedimentary formation mingled with decomposed granite. The soil is from 4 to 50 feet deep, and is capable of producing everything on earth that grows in this land of <hi rend="italic">wonderful production</hi>.</p>
                  <p>It lies at an altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level and is peculiarly on the land of the olive and almond.</p>
                  <p>SMALL FARMS</p>
                  <p>are the rule in Southern California and more profit can be realized from 20 acres here than on 160 acres in the East.</p>
                  <p>AFTER 2,000 ACRES HAVE BEEN SOLD</p>
                  <p>the price will be $35.00 per acre.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That as the National W.C.T.U. offers so many opportunities through which the women of our race may be enlightened and encouraged in their work for humanity, therefore be it further resolved that we, as Afro-American women, accept these opportunities by entering this open door, and heartily endorse the work taken up by the W.C.T.U., but insist that their attitude in regard to the lynching evil and color prejudice question generally be less equivocal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">WHEREAS</hi>, many women of this Congress, coming from points remote, have had experience with the separate car system prevailing in many states of the south, of it brutal, inhuman and degrading nature, and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, the separate car system is contrary, not only to the law of contract but to the genius of our liberal institutions, tending to accentuate unduly discriminations on account of color and condition, and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, it is the proud boast of Southern white men that the ennobling of womanhood is the basis of all chivalric manhood,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we call upon the Southern legislators, in the name of the common womanhood, to adopt a first and second class fare, so that the womanhood of the race may be protected from every outrage and insult.

                  <p>WHEREAS, all tendency toward mob rule, lynching, burning, midnight marauding, and all unlawful and unjust discriminations, is not only contrary to the fundamental principles of our government, but a menace to every department of justice and the well being of posterity,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we condemn every form of lawlessness and miscarriage of justice, and demand, without favor or compromise, the equal enforcement of the law for all classes of American citizens.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, one Dr. S.A. Steele, a prominent minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, south, and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Epworth Era</hi>, the official organ of the southern Epworth League, has in that paper made one of the most scurrilous attacks that has yet appeared against the Negro,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we, the women of this Congress, most severely condemn this article and all such articles which may hereafter appear, as they seriously misrepresent us and are detrimental to the work we are doing and what we hope to accomplish.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, organization among women has proved a most active agent in stimulating and inaugurating needed reforms and wise movements for the advancement of progress, not only of women, but mankind in general, and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, there are efforts now being made for the unification and concentration of existing national associations among women at this time in Atlanta, and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, it is the policy of the National Federation of Afro-American Women, Mrs. B.T.

                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That this Congress endorse and co-operate with the National Federation of Afro-American Women in the final establishment of one truly representative national body of colored women.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lucy Moten, of Washington, objected, on the ground that the resolution as it stood gave the Federation the advantage of the National League. Mrs. Matthews offered an amendment, and the resolution as amended was adopted. The amendment was as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That this Congress recommend to file various organizations here represented, local,
state and national, the wisdom of uniting for the establishment of one national organization of women.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, we a race have never been taught to feel and appreciate the value of good homes, and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, to this day there are to be seen in many of our country communities the one room log cabin where many live together in an unwholesome atmosphere which is detrimental both morally and physically to the best growth and development of the masses,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That as a body of women we do urge upon the teachers and leaders of our race the necessity and importance of mother's meet-
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ings, social purity talks and such other agencies as shall most forcibly impress upon the mothers of our race the evil influences generated by the admission of frivolous or obscene books or pictures into their homes.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, the colored women of this country stand very greatly in need of all the aid and assistance that the more fortunate and intelligent members of the race can offer them, and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, the elevation of the motherhood and womanhood of the race is the most effectual and powerful means for raising the mental and moral standard of the masses of our people, therefore be it</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we hereby pledge ourselves individually and collectively to use every effort in our power,</p>
                  <p>1. To establish homes among our people the influence of which will tend to the development of men and women of strong character and purity of purpose in life.</p>
                  <p>2. To demand of our leaders and teachers the highest standard of' character, refinement and culture.</p>
                  <p>3. That we require the same standard of morality for men as for women, and that the mothers teach their sons social purity as well is their daughters.</p>
                  <p>4. We condemn the universal prodigality of the race and urge upon our people, having the best interests of the race at heart, to give permanence to our present progressiveness by practising strict economy in their homes and business relations, and to count no effort insignificant which is made in the interest or with a view toward the purchase of a home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That it is the duty of the colored women of the country to take a more practical interest in the condition and treatment of the unfortunate members of our race and in making proper provision for the establishment of reformatories and institutions for the orphans, the aged, and the infirm, not excepting those institutions that have steadily adhered to the broadest of philanthropic principles, and thrown wide their doors to suffering humanity regardless of color, past condition or creed.</p>
                  <p>Realizing the gravity of our social and economic condition, and the wide influences of our teachers in assisting in the formation of the character of our children,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we urge upon those in authority to exercise the greatest diligence in selecting trained, competent teachers, who are imbued with the love and true spirit of their work. Further we urge upon parents the necessity of co-operating with the teachers in all matters that pertain to the successful development of those intrusted to their care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That in order to secure healthful bodies in which to contain healthful minds and souls we do heartily encourage all teachers, parents and guardians to make physical culture a prominent feature in their training of our youth.</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, since every race must possess intelligence, energy, industry and enterprise in order that it may rank among the great and powerful races of the world, and,</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, we feel that the life and prosperity of the home depends largely upon its women who are entrusted with its making, therefore be it</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we endorse and encourage every phase of higher industrial education and urge all persons to take such training as will elevate and make the noblest types of woman and man, and thus fit themselves for the actual responsibilities of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the tone of the Negro press should be elevated and placed upon such high standard so that none but those having special training for that calling may be encouraged to continue in such work. In the publication of race journals the personality of the editor should either be wholly eliminated or subordinated to questions of public importance. The advocacy
<pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
of the selfish ends of any person or persons as against the public interests should be condemned, and no article that is not elevating in its character and pure in its purpose should ever appear in the columns of our newspapers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we endorse the work of the John Brown Memorial Association of the state of Minnesota, of which Mrs. T.H.T. Lyles is president, and suggest instead of the proposed marble statue, that the funds collected by the association be devoted to the purchase and maintenance of a home farm for helpless and dependent children, the same to be dedicated to the memory of John Brown, and located in that section furnishing the most money for the purpose.</p>
                  <p>

                           <p>DEAR SISTERS -- Appreciating the incalculable blessing your first congress will be in the cotton states in raising the status of womanhood, and desiring to augment that effort in the Central States during the Tennessee Centennial, which is to be held in this city beginning Sept. 1, 1896, continuing 100 days, we, the Colored Woman's Centennial Committee, must cordially and earnestly invite you to hold your next congress with us, believing by so doing you will greatly enhance the recognition and value of true womanhood in the South.</p>

                  <p>As the Atlanta Congress was intended only as a temporary gathering, but one that represented all parts of the country, the general understanding was that the people of Nashville interested in the coming centennial, being desirous of reaching
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
all our women, individuals as well as organizations, took this means of coming before the colored women of the country, particularly as there is ground for every hope at this time that all the various bodies of colored women of the country will merge into one grand organization that the entire country will respect. A council committee representing the National Colored Woman's League and the National Federation of Afro-American Women, met, and after agreeing upon the basis of union to be submitted in joint convention next year, agreed as to the wisdom of meeting in Nashville, and will doubtless urge a full attendance on the part of the bodies in question on that occasion in the hope of final union of all forces. Mrs. Thurman, chairman of the Atlanta Congress being most enthusiastic in favor of union of all forces.</p>
                  <p>The gathering was very harmonious, and takes its place as one of the most notable gatherings ever convened in Atlanta. It proved a revelation to colored and white alike, and will serve as a strong argument as to woman's power in pointing the way to needed reforms in the future in the south. Unlike most gatherings of the kind in which our women take part, everyone was on the alert and quick at repartee. Some of the brightest women of the country were present, and many excellent papers were read and discussed.</p>
                  <p>There were three sessions daily, all well attended. The south will be greatly <sic corr="benefited">benefitted</sic> by the object lesson indicated by this gathering. It will have a most beneficial effect upon our women, who, heretofore, have never advanced to the front save through religious channels ; indeed, have taken but little stock in such undertakings. If the women of the south have been indifferent, it has been through lack of experience, and, likely, confidence in the ultimate good to be accomplished by such movements. As a rule our women of all sections have been discouraged by our men in any and all attempts at public work, the result being lack of real progressiveness all around. It was a splendid gathering. Many of those who labored for the First National Convention of Colored Women in Boston last summer were present and labored zealously for the good of the Congress. Judging by the general conduct of the delegates, the attendance, and the quality of the papers read, too much praise cannot be bestowed.</p>
                  <p>At great expense and personal sacrifice, delegates came from parts remote, and be it said to the credit of all concerned, that with but one or two exceptions, all participating preceded upon most liberal grounds. The women were thoroughly in earnest, as will be shown by the resolutions, which are claimed by some leading Atlanteans, both black and white, to have been the backbone of the Congress, and in every way fitting.</p>
                  <p>Sample copies of the WOMAN'S ERA were scattered freely at every session, many declaring themselves highly pleased with its appearance and promising support from the January number. As is usual is such affairs, the expenses attendant upon visiting the exposition were exceedingly great. No effort was made to secure any very great reductions in board for the delegates, this constituting one of the most unpleasant features. But a beginning has been made in the south where the great masses are, and that beginning is of such character that we are sanguine that ere long we will all see one magnificent body of women, with their hearts inflamed with the common intent to uplift one struggling race.</p>
                  <p>Many prominent men of both races visited the sessions, many making short speeches. Hon. I. Garland Penn, Dr. E.W.E. Bowen, Dr. Thirkield, President of Gammon Theological School, Hon. J.C. Napier, Prof. Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee, Bishops Turner, Grant and Gains, Dr. Jennifer, Prof. R.R. Wright, T. Thomas Fortune, Mrs. Thompson of Syracuse, zealous worker for S.P.A., and Sister Jane Moore of Little Rock were among many others.</p>
                  <p>Bostonians will remember Mrs. Dr. Butler, of Atlanta, who fairly captivated the hearts of the National Federation of Afro-American Women last summer. Her address of welcome was in every way worthy the impression she then made. The response was made by Mrs. Rosetta Lawson, who from the beginning has labored indefatigably for the success of the Congress.</p>
                  <pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>Our old friend, Mrs. Pitts of St. Louis, the "Lafe Pence" of the Boston meeting, fully sustained her reputation by supporting all practical measures.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. B.T. Washington, Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, and Prof. Mary V. Cook attracted especial attention.</p>
                  <p>The chairman, Mrs. Lucy Thurman, who represented the W.C.T.U. at the late World's Conference in England, and Mrs. T.H.L. Lyles, who has been laboring for many years for the erection of a suitable monument to John Brown's memory, proved themselves to be powerful extemporaneous speakers.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Lyles has given several years to the work of raising funds for a monument as aforesaid, having secured an act of incorporation for the John Brown Monument Association under the laws of the State of Minnesota, and filing a bond for $10,000, has by her unceasing efforts and most laudable zeal attracted the attention of the governor of her state, who pledges practical and important interest, providing she is able to raise a certain amount. It was the sense of the Congress that we stand more in need of institutions, educational and reformatory, than a marble tribute to show our esteem. The proposition was made to purchase, establish and maintain a home farm, for dependent and helpless children, in that section raising the most money for the memorial. Mrs. Lyles has had her heart set for years upon a monument, but showed her unselfishness by accepting the verdict of the Congress as her will. It is a glorious augury for our future, to know that we have in our ranks at this time such women as Mrs. Lyles. The Congress stands pledged to support the movement, and the WOMAN's ERA will open its columns to all who wish to aid the cause.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. J. St. Pierre Ruffin's absence was a source of great disappointment. Many looked for Mrs. Helen Cook and others who helped to make the First National Convention of Colored Women famous. Many of them not otherwise represented sent most excellent papers. Mrs. Ella L. Mahammit's was read by Mrs. Rosetta Lawson.</p>
                  <p>At the adjournment, flowers were presented to the chairman and secretary.</p>

                  <p>It is the verdict of nine-tenths of the visitors to the exposition that the Negro building is one of the chief and most creditable displays. About the doors of the building the bust of Frederick Douglass, representing the capabilities of the Negro race, of a typical Negro slave, showing from whence we came, agricultural implement, musical instruments, scrolls, globes, etc., showing the advancement made along the different lines.</p>
                  <p>Entering the building you are confronted by the District of Columbia exhibit. The fancy work is <sic corr="enclosed">inclosed</sic> in glass cases, and on either side of the aisle are musical and photographic displays. The work of the Art Amateur Society has received much praise. The most attractive feature of the District exhibit is a statue six feet high on a pedestal three feet high. It is the work of W.C. Hill and represents the condition of the Negro today, "Chains Broken but Not Off." It is a representation of a typical Negro, large and muscular, struggling to free himself of the effects of slavery. This piece of work has received favorable comment for the originality of design and its splendid execution. A combination centre table, work table, and writing desk by H.A. Jackson has received highest praise. Mrs. M.A. Langston received a bronze medal for her embroidery and upholstering.</p>
                  <p>The patents of Negro inventors from the U.S. Patent Office are showing what the Negro is doing along that line. Since 1883 more patents have been granted to Negroes than before. There are to be found agricultural, electrical and mechanical patents. Congressman Murry has several agricultural inventions and Granville T. Wood has many electrical inventions.</p>
                  <p>The oldest patent granted to a Negro was in 1845, on a gridiron.</p>
                  <p>Hampton Normal and Industrial School has the finest grade of work in the building. The academic work is represented by a large screen, showing methods and results in teaching geography, history and sociology. A handsome mahogany tile-faced mantel, a handsome hall seat of oak with hand carving, a revolving bookcase, and a mahogany sideboard would do credit to any exhibit. The harness exhibited is all handmade. The institute fills orders for Wanamaker. They

have constant demand for all articles made by them.. A 100-pound trotting buggy and a small pony phaeton showed skill in wheelwright work. The drill press 28-inch swing, from the Pierce machine shop, shows work such as is manufactured regularly for the market.</p>
                  <p>The Negro press is represented by thirty-five journals the chief ones being the <hi rend="italic">Colored American</hi> of Washington and the <hi rend="italic">Daily Opinion</hi> of Atlanta.</p>
                  <p>Kentucky is represented by a photographic and statistical display. The pastels in this exhibit are exceptionally good. The kindergarten work from Louisville is among the best on the grounds. The Louisville National Medical School is represented by photographs.</p>
                  <p>A neat exhibit has been fitted up by the Board of Missions for Freedmen, showing by photographs the schools and churches established by them. Their statistics show 175 ministers, of whom 166 are colored, and 306 churches. They have schools in fourteen states and territories <gap agent="unknown"/> of Charles Sumner, by Miss Ed- <gap agent="unknown"/>in this space and Collegiate Institute of Claremont Va., under Rev. J.J. Smallwood, <gap agent="unknown"/>is doing a great work, as is shown by his exhibit. His booth is tastefully arranged with pictures and needle work.</p>
                  <p>A neater and more attractive exhibit cannot be found than that of the True Reformers of Richmond and Lynchburg. It is a pictorial exhibition of the buildings owned by the organization. It is a benevolent and banking organization owned and controlled by Negroes since its foundation in 1881. It has a membership of 30,000 with $850,000 benefits paid. In 1893 it was the only bank in Richmond which continued to pay currency to its depositors during the financial stringency. The organization recently paid W.W. Brown, the founder, $50,000 for the plans by which it is run.</p>
                  <p>The agricultural exhibits from North Carolina are the finest in the building. A miniature coffin, handmade harness, tobacco, crayon work, and a log cabin plush quilt, valued at $500, are all creditable exhibits.</p>
                  <p>Florida has a characteristic exhibit, beautiful flowers, fine needle work, industrial work, collections of sea weed, sponges, corals and miniature ships. The most striking article in this exhibit is a hand-carved cabinet made of five different kinds of Florida wood. The literary, industrial and mechanical work of the State Normal at Tallahassee are very good.</p>
                  <p>The women of Memphis and Jacksonville, Tenn., have very good exhibits. Central Tennessee College has an exhibition of work done by students taxidermy, entomology, dentistry, and pharmacy. The botanical display is well arranged.</p>
                  <p>Fisk University has portraits of faculty, students and grounds. A large oil painting of the Original Fisk Jubilee Singers adorns their space.</p>
                  <p>Knoxville College has an industrial and literary exhibit.</p>
                  <p>Arkansas has a display of grains that are very fine quality. An engine weighing 700 pounds and carrying 100 pounds of steam is exhibited. An oil painting from an original Arkansas cotton field, painted by Dr. J.H. Smith of Little Rock, is among the best paintings. George Jones of Little Rock has an exhibition of some of his fifty houses, one drug store, one livery stable, and an undertaking establishment. The printing department of Philander Smith College has very artistic work.</p>
                  <p>Virginia collective exhibit occupies a very large space with exceptionally good work from the Old Dominion. Some of the most attractive exhibits are a 124-pound ball-bearing buggy, miniature model of the United States steamer Raleigh, hand-carved colonial chairs, compartment tool chest, relief maps of North and South America and Virginia.</p>
                  <p>G.R. Devane of the South Carolina exhibit has some artistic carvings on canes and horns. He presented a horn to the President when he visited the Negro building. One cane has all the important events of the discovery of America, another is the presidential cane, with pictures of all the presidents carved on it. The photographic and crayon work in this space is very creditable.</p>
                  <p>The American Baptist Home Mission shows pictures of the faculties and buildings. It also gives the following statistical report for 1895: 1,600,000 colored Baptists, 29 schools, 232 teachers, of whom one-third are colored; schools at Lynchburg, theological school at Richmond, two schools, One for boys and one for girls, at Atlanta, one law, one medical, one trained nurse, the missionary training and two high-grade normals.</p>
                  <p>In the miscellaneous space are exhibits from Ohio, New York, Kansas, Michigan, Louisiana,
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Missouri and Pennsylvania. A painting of Charles Sumner and a violin and sheet of music in oils, by Mrs. Lottie Jackson of Michigan, are acknowledged among the best in the building.</p>
                  <p>Tanner's famous "Bag-pipe Lesson," Banjo Lesson," and "Lion's Head" are the best paintings in the building. Tanner is at present abroad studying art.</p>
                  <p>The Negro authors are well represented. Among the prominent ones are: "Black Phalanx," by J.T. Wilson; "Africa and America," by Alexander Crummell, D.D.; "Our Baptist Ministers and Schools," by A.W. Pegnes; "From Virginia Plantation to the United States Capitol," by Jno. M.

Harper," and numerous books of fiction, religion and hymnals.</p>
                  <p>Morgan College is represented by a model of the college and by samples of literary and industrial work.</p>
                  <p>Gammon Theological Seminary has a neat photographic exhibit. Gammon is the best endowed theological school for Negroes in the country. It has seventy-one students and its professors are all highly educated men. Dr. J.W.E. Bowen, orator of Negro day, is a professor at this school. An autograph of Harriot Beecher Stowe, written for Gammon School, July 7, 1895, and one of John Greenleaf Whittier, written May 19, 1881, are exhibited at this space.</p>
                  <p>The Atlanta University exhibit thoroughly represents the work done there. It gives it college, normal, preparatory and manual training course. The work exhibited in higher mathematics, classical translations, mechanical drawings and tintings are exceptionally good. The wood turning and iron work is also very fine.</p>
                  <p>Clark University has a well-arranged exhibit. The carriage, dressmaking and laundry departments have representative work that attracts much attention. The Thayer Home, at Clark, is modeled after a real home and is furnished with all modern improvements. It accommodates twenty young ladies, who are taught cooking and housekeeping as practised in well-kept homes.</p>
                  <p>Spelman Seminary, under the Baptist Home Mission, has a training school for nurses. The model sick room, showing the care of the room, costume of the nurses, surgical instruments, sick charts, etc., all are very attractive. The literary and fancy work of the school are very tastefully arranged. In the early history of the school, when several thousand dollars had been raised, Mr. Rockefeller came to the relief of the school and gave $56,500. The school was named Spelman Seminary in honor of Mr. Spelman, the father of Mrs. Rockefeller, who was for forty years a steadfast friend of the Negro race.</p>

                  <p>The Georgia State and Industrial College for Boys at Savannah has a manual training, scientific, normal and complete college course. A carpenter's compartment chest is one of their best exhibits. Their wood turning and iron work are very creditable.</p>
                  <p>An institution which stands as a monument of Negro thrift and enterprise is the Morris Brown College at Atlanta. It was founded and built by the A.M.E. churches of the state of Georgia. It has no endowment, no permanent fund, and is controlled and supported by the people of that church in the state. They have 450 students and 12 teachers. The courses taught are preparatory, normal, collegiate, law, theology, music and industry. The school is but ten years old.</p>
                  <p>The Carrie Steele's Orphan Home was begun five years ago with five little orphan boys without a dollar. Today she has a beautiful home of thirteen rooms, four acres of land, two cows and two horses. She has seventy-one orphans whom she gives a common education and a knowledge of general housework. Their exhibit consists of fancy needlework, products of their farm, and canned goods, all the work of the orphans.</p>
                  <p>Bishop Turner's African exhibition of instruments of war, native cotton, baskets, heads, and cloth woven by the natives, is a curiosity. A

has many Northern friends who contribute largely to the <gap agent="unknown"/>support of her school. <gap agent="unknown"/> canned fruits, preserves, jellies, pickles, vinegars and unfermented wines in fancy glass jars and bottles, artistically arranged on stands. This exhibit was prepared by Mrs. Rosa Morehead Bass and received a bronze medal. Her exhibit has nearly a hundred different kinds and has been bought by Edward Atkinson, inventor of the AIaddin oven.</p>
                  <p>A biblical quilt, representing Jacob's dream, Cain killing Abel, the crucifixion, the baptism of Christ, the holy family, and other biblical stories, was made by an old lady who could not read but had heard these stories read.</p>
                  <p>The Georgia women have exhibited fine needlework, china-painting, drawing, millinery, cooking, and almost every line of work.</p>

                  <p>Alabama collective exhibit has a good display of paintings, drawing, needlework and photography. A large space is used by the Anniston Drug Company. The Hale Infirmary of Montgomery is represented by a model and pictures of the building.</p>
                  <p>The Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute is the centre of attraction at the Negro building; in fact, nine-tenths of the visitors ask for it as soon as they enter the building. Tuskegee has the largest space, and is more compactly filled. The institution is fourteen years old, has five hundred students and seventy-one teachers. They have eighteen hundred acres of land, six hundred under cultivation, and teach twenty-eight industries. Last year the total enrollment was 1,025. They raise all the vegetables and grains used by the school. A photographic display shows the buildings of the Institute, the shops, residences and interior of the different departments. The system of basting in the dressmaking department is very fine. The tailoring department furnishes clothes for some of the best people in the city. A handsome oak, hand-carved bedroom suite, two-seated phaeton, piano-body buggy, pony phaeton, two horse wagon, boots and shoes, tinware, dairy articles, printing, wheelwright, bricks, etc., compose the bulk of the exhibit.</p>
                  <p>The drawing and designing <gap agent="unknown"/>departments <gap agent="unknown"/>Industrial School at Normal, <gap agent="unknown"/>was one of the neatest exhibits in the building. The work from the dressmaking, laundry, wheelwright, cabinet, domestic and broommaking departments is of a very fine quality. The winding stairs exhibited are specimens of superior work. One of the students invented a cotton press, and a dozen bales of cotton from this press are shown.</p>
                  <p>In the centre of the building, under the tower, is in exhibit from Butler, Slater &#x0026; Co., Pioneer Negro Druggists of Georgia. This booth is artistically decorated and well filled with perfumes, tooth powder, soup and toilet articles, all made by the company.</p>
                  <p>Howard University stands for higher education. The photographic exhibit of the buildings and grounds is very creditable. The statistical report, showing 1,402 graduates in the different departments, speaks well for the school. Much care has been taken in the selection of the natural history and chemical exhibits. The sewing cannot be excelled by any work in the building. The normal and printing departments have large exhibits.</p>
                  <p>There are about fifty well-educated men find women in this building who have charge of the exhibits and are thoroughly informed in the work they represent. All of them have labored hard for the success of the Negro building and the exposition.

The exhibition of the Negro at Atlanta has done much toward opening the eyes of the world as to the capabilities and accomplishments of the race. Many who opposed the exhibit at first are now frank to say that they are sorry they did not lend their support. The people and the press have been unanimous in their praise of this worthy effort. It serves as an inspiration to those who have lost hopes of the Negro accomplishing anything in this country. And yet, we are safe in saying, that this exhibit did not consist of the best work done by the race nor did it have the support of one-third of the influential people in the respective sections.</p>
                  <p>What might we not have done had we united support?</p>

                  <p>A glance backward causes us to rejoice over the gains Woman Suffrage has made in this and other countries during the past year. Utah makes the third star in our suffrage flag, and South Australia has fully enfranchised its women. That public sentiment is growing in this direction is evident, since a Woman Suffrage amendment has been submitted to the constitution by the state legislatures of New York, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and California. Can the result of the vote on the referendum in Massachusetts be discouraging, when one out of every three men and twenty-five out of every twenty-six women, who expressed their opinions on the question, were in favor of equal suffrage? State suffrage societies have been organized in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, Arizona, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia and Delaware. We hope for splendid results the coming year.</p>
                  <p>The exercise of suffrage stimulates women to venture outside of the narrow circle in which they formerly worked. I recently had an interview with a lady who was an active worker in our suffrage campaign, and who is now president of the Bonita Cold and Silver Mining Company, an organization officered by women. She said:</p>
                  <p>"You ask me how I first came to think of the 'Woman's Mine.' I hardly know just when the idea took shape and crystallized into its present form. My mother was the 'Lady Bountiful' of our village, and after I grew to womanhood, my personal experience brought home to me the need of some business making it possible for women of the most limited means to invest in something which would bring them quick, sure and steady returns; this, too, without leaving home and children, or whatever work they might be doing for a livelihood. It was really the result of observation, brought by my work for universal suffrage. An instance which came under my notice some years ago will make it clear.</p>
                  <p>"A woman from Illinois invested quite largely in one of the best mines in Colorado. When it began to pay handsomely, the other owners, all men, decided to 'freeze her out,' in mining parlance. They made false reports, --  no ore, etc. -- finally shut down and stopped work; but the lady did not 'freeze out' and having money as well as courage, compelled the other owners to divide and treat her fairly.</p>
                  <p>"I thought then, 'Why not have a woman's mine?' Today I offer you that in the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company, organized in New Mexico and Colorado.</p>
                  <p>"Some years ago I asked my husband to give me a mine to manage myself. He said that he would. Occasionally I would ask, 'Where is my mine?' He would say, 'Wait till I get it in good shape.' Last October, in the midst of the excitement preceding the election, when every woman I wanted to see was canvassing for the different parties, my husband handed me the deed to the Bonita, saying, 'Here is your mine; the deed is recorded, title absolute and without flaw, not one dollar of indebtedness, patent work all done, ready to make the application, with nearly eight thousand dollars' worth of work done as carefully and economically as I could do it; apex on every claim, with timber, water and all that makes a first class property, and now within about fifty feet of an immense body of ore, running from fifty to one thousand dollars to the ton, the average two hundred and fifty. A mine! Not a mere prospect at the grass roots.</p>
                  <p>"'Now see what you can do as a woman's company. If you can keep six men steadily at work, you ought to have pay in from sixty to ninety days.'</p>
                  <p>"This I want to do. We need only about five thousand dollars for patents and all, after which we expect to pay a dividend and that from that time the mine will pay its own expenses.</p>
                  <p>"I am charmed with the ERA. A glance at it shows its status and scope. It has finely gotten up in all respects - its personal appearance, very distinct individuality, the pictures, and the ability with which it is edited. It is inferior to none of the woman's journals which I have read and excels many."</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>Attention is called to the announcement of the N.E. Farm Agency. The manager of the movement is well endorsed, and the scheme is worthy the careful consideration of those to whom it appeals, as one of great possibilities for any one looking for a home among friendly surroundings.</p>

                     <p>In the interest of the  of the race, <gap agent="unknown"/>of the space <gap agent="unknown"/>to Atlanta, <gap agent="unknown"/>and Woman's Congress. Both these are events which go to make up history and demand more than passing attention.</p>
                     <p>The attitude of the ERA on the question of a "Negro exhibit" is well known. It has been open to conviction. We did not believe it possible to make a Negro exhibit that was truly representative; that the interests of the races are so amalgamated its to be impossible to separate them to make an exhibit that would show the present status of the race. More than this we feared and realized the possibility of attendant evils and personal mortifications for which nothing in the way of an imposing exhibit could compensate. At the same time we realized that many of our most thoughtful people endorsed the movement and saw in it a large opportunity. The results are before the reader. The separate exhibit attracted much attention and favorable comment. The Colored Woman's Congress brought together a large number of progressive women and gave an additional impetus to the woman's movement, beside opening up possibilities for the future.</p>
                     <p>The Congress held by our women at Atlanta was a notable one, not only in its personal make-up, but also in the value of the work that was done -- the subjects discussed, the papers read. It was not, however, the first congress; that held in Boston last July enjoys that distinction. Our women have caught the fever, and there is everything good to be hoped for in their efforts toward union and concentration.</p>

                     <docDate>January 1896</docDate>
                     <p>One Of the editors of <hi rend="italic">The Christian Educator</hi>, the organ of the Freedman's Aid and Southern Education Society, has been at some pains to locate and learn something definite of the man Jacks, who wrote the shameful letter to Miss Balgarnie of England in March last. Letters of inquiry were sent to prominent people of Missouri, and some of the answers are given in the Educator. No names are mentioned by the Educator. Following is one of the replies:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. ----- is the editor of a paper here. He is a member of the ----- Church in this town, and the Sunday School superintendent. I learn he is the son of an ex-slave holder of this state. There are several of the leading colored men of this town and country that are subscribers to Mr. -----'s paper, and he has never printed a disrespectful word in his paper here against the colored people."</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italic">Educator</hi> adds: "It is safe to say, from what is known of the man, that he would never be even courageous enough to print the whole letter in his own paper, and look his neighbors in the face the same week."</p>
                     <p>We are indebted to the kindness of De Wolfe, Fiske &#x0026; Co., publishers of the "Life and Times of Frederick Douglass," for the loan of the fine cut of Mr. Douglass presented in this number of the ERA.</p>

                     <p>The friends of equal rights owe a deep debt of gratitude to the Man Suffrage Association for the impetus their organized opposition to Woman Suffrage as given to that cause. Not for many years has so much interest and enthusiasm been shown in the annual meetings of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association as in those held in Association Hall the week ending January 18. The hall was filled at all times, and crowded in the evenings. The ranks of the workers for this cause are being largely augmented by enthusiastic young women and men from the different colleges. Harvard, Yale, Tufts and Wellesley all were well represented in these meetings by lucid, logical and speakers. But it re-

mained for John Graham Brooks to make the most assertively convincing argument on "Some Economic Aspects of the Woman Question" ever advanced in this section. This speech should be printed and scattered broadcast.</p>

                     <p>These conventions are revelations. Through them the colored women are discovering their strength and possibilities, and through them the outside world has been led to see a condition so promising, so encouraging as to be almost inconceivable. Nashville at once recognized the power and possible influence of so significant a body, and through its mayor and council has extended a courteous invitation for its next meeting to be held there.</p>

                     <p>An interesting event is the approaching marriage of Miss Marion Ridley of this city to Dr. Milton Brown of Baltimore. Miss Ridley is one of the younger set of Boston girls and has a large circle of acquaintances in the eastern cities. Dr. Brown is a recent conspicuous graduate of the Harvard Medical School who has settled in Baltimore and is taking a graduate course at Johns Hopkins. Nowadays, it is comparatively seldom that we find a couple marrying, neither of whom has reached the age of twenty-five.</p>
                     <p>The Dumas Quartet, composed of Messrs. Woodward, Ruffin, Hodges and Johnson seems still a long-felt want. Since the formation this Quartet has been in active demand and deservedly so. All of the voices are picked and each young man is a thorough musician.</p>
                     <p>Miss Edna Brown is enjoying a position at Ditson's, music publishers. This is very appropriate and she is to be congratulated.</p>
                     <p>The death of Richard H. Lewis, son of the late J.D. Lewis of Philadelphia and grandson of the late R.H. Brown, is the third recent death among the young men, which has been more or less of a shock to the community. Young Lewis was a promising student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was preparing upon his graduation in the spring to go to South Africa as a civil engineer. He and his sister, Miss Louise Lewis, lived together in loving companionship. His death was a great shock to her and leaves her almost without relationship. The funeral was largely attended and the details were of much elegance. The floral tributes from classmates, clubmates, and individual friends were markedly beautiful. The death of a young man of so much promise is not only a loss to his friends, but a loss to the community as well.</p>
                     <p>Mr. John Ransom of Ohio made a visit to Boston during the holidays, much to the surprise and pleasure of his large circle of friends.</p>
                     <p>The holidays also brought home the schoolgirls and boys: Miss Hemmings of Vassar College, Miss Baker of Wellesley, Miss Marv Lewis from Bradford, Mr. Harry Lewis from Bradford were all in the city for a two week's vacation.</p>
                     <p>Miss Maud Trotter is at home from Wellesley threatened with an attack of nervous prostration.</p>
                     <p>A very successful "small and early" managed by Mrs. J.H. Lewis, was held at Arcade Hall on the 7th.</p>
                     <p>Many of the Old Guard Abolitionists were among those who gathered at Faneuil Hall on the evening of Dec. 20th to take part in the memorial services, held under the auspices of the city of Boston to the honor of the late Frederick Douglass. They heard a splendid eulogy by Judge Albion W. Tourgee, some interesting reminiscences from Prof. Richard T. Greener of New York, and some fine vocal music from the Dumas Quartet. After the meeting the city fathers entertained the orators, Mrs. Frederick and Mr. Lewis Douglalss, Mrs. Colonel Thomas of Portland, Me., and the WOMAN'S ERA representative at a banquet at the Parker House, and with a drive over the whole park system the next morning.</p>
                     <p>The invitation to the silver wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick J. Loudin is the handsomest of its kind ever received. The celebration took place at "Otra," the luxurious home of the couple on Walnut Street, Ravenna, Ohio, on the evening of Jan. 9, 1896.</p>
                     <p>N.B. - Mrs. T.H.T. Lyles of St. Paul, Minn., and Mrs. Lucy Thurman of Jackson, Mich., and one other lady gave Mrs. Victoria Matthews one dollar for a year's subscription to the Woman's Era. While in Atlanta, owing toa slight attack of illness while the Congress was in session, the third lady's name was lost. Will she communicate with the ERA?</p>

Chaloner at the Bostonia Club House; to the first anniversary exercises of the Sons of Freedmen, Norfolk, Va.</p>
                     <p>Miss Annie Dillet of Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas, has just graduated from the New England Hospital for women and children with an excellent record for both character and acquirements. She has not fully decided  whether to follow her profession in Boston or return to her old home. It is believed by the hospital authorities she will do good services in either place. She will register at the Nurse's Bureau while here.</p>

                     <p>I wonder if it will be accounted heresy to say that one's replies are as varied as are the circumstances of the question.</p>
                     <p>After a prolonged tour of the Negro building, a feeling of self-congratulation takes possession of us, based partially upon what we have seen, partially upon what we feel <hi rend="italic">could have been there</hi>.  The feeling formulates itself in some such words as these, "If this result of Negro intellect and industry is a marvel to the civilized world, how much more would that world wonder if it could see all that the race really has accomplished." We think of the fine work in <gap agent="tape repair" extent="1 word"/>   lines, that is not shown; of the designs and architectural work of several colored civil engineers who compete with the best in the land and whose work knows no color line; we think of the colored dressmakers whose patrons are the wealthy and fashionable of both races; of the tailors, the milliners, the caterers, the skilled mechanics scattered through the land; we think of the numerous women artists, with their decorated china, their crayon portraits, their wood carving, their work in oils and water-colors; very little of it was shown.</p>
                     <p>We think of the many homes of wealth and culture in the east, west, north and south, with their beautiful and artistic surroundings, but whose very refinement prevents public exhibition.</p>
                     <p>While <sic corr="there">their</sic> is much, that from its very nature, could not have been shown, more could have been exhibited had there been unanimity of sentiment, but of that which is itself a result of race development, it is useless to speak here.</p>
                     <p>Another thought expressed itself -- the exhibit was largely a school exhibit. We felt that there we were getting the best that could be shown. There were the leven that was infusing itself through the Southland.</p>
                     <p>One could not help seeing much that was crude, much that might have been omitted and we were not surprised when told that many articles had to be denied admittance. We felt that we might have spared some of the patchwork and a few of the photographs.</p>
                     <p>There was much, very much, to admire, but many words of commendation have been spoken and will continue to be spoken, and this thought of "what might have been" is not intended to be a discordant note in the chorus of praise, but to voice a feeling that must have come to many. To the commissioner and his assistants much credit is due for giving us, that fine average of Negro accomplishments.</p>
                     <p>Tile Ladies' Whist Club held its formal opening with a high class reception several weeks since, and will entertain bi-monthly for the remainder of the season.</p>
                     <p>The lady commissioners appointed to represent Missouri in the Women's Congress held in Atlanta were as follows: 'Mrs. Libbie E Anthony, Jefferson City, Miss Florence Smith, Kansas City, Miss Georgia De Baptiste, Macon City, Miss Luvenia Cartel, St. Louis, J.S. Yates, Kansas City.</p>
                     <p>By special request the following papers were prepared and read before the Congress: "Social Purity," Mrs. Libbie C. Anthony; "How Best to Raise the Moral Status of the Race," J.S. Yates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Future State</hi>, a monthly journal of Negro progress, for December, is a most excellent number. Mr. Paul Gaston contributes a translation from original French manuscripts. Mrs. Lynwood, wife of the editor, writes on "Negro Education in the South," with her usual force and earnestness.</p>

                     <p>Through Miss Carrie E. Syphax the industrial department of the colored schools of Washington has been highly complimented. As the directress of the sewing department, Miss Syphax has developed such an excellent course of instruction and has been so successful in pursuing it, that competent judges rate her among the most efficient teachers of sewing in the country. She was recently invited to send specimens
<pb n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
of her work to Buffalo, N.Y., into whose public schools sewing is soon to be introduced. The invitation was accepted by Miss Syphax, in whose care the work was sent. In the beautiful and spacious ball room of the Waldorf Hotel the exhibit was held, and there it was that Miss Syphax achieved a great triumph as a directress of sewing. Praises for the excellence of her work were heard on all sides, and congratulations were showered upon her by the most competent judges of this branch of instruction. The Woman's Educational and Industrial Union, under whose auspices Miss Syphax went, volunteered not only to pay for the transportation of the articles from Washington, but also to defray all the expenses of Miss Syphax if she would come to explain her work. The exhibit represented every branch of the work as carried on in our schools.</p>
                     <p>The Washington branch of the Colored Woman's League has decided to give monthly socials, in order to create a deeper interest in its work and aims. The first social was held in the Berean Baptist Church and was a signal success. Miss Ednorah Nabar, popular elocutionist, made an interesting and instructive talk. Several vocal and instrumental selections were rendered. To the indefatigable energy and good taste of Mrs. A.F. Hilyer is the success of this first effort in a great measure to be ascribed. Miss Ella Barrier has charge of the new social.</p>

                     <p>The members of the Lookout Circle of King's Daughters, who are ever on the <hi rend="italic">qui vive</hi> have invitations out for a leap year party.

She is right. The wearer of the little silver cross finds a welcome everywhere, as she goes forth on her mission of love.</p>

                     <p>The Henrietta Circle was entertained by Mrs. George Remley at its literary meeting last week. The program was very interesting, and was made more so by readings from Mliss Mary Dyer, who is fast gaining a reputation as an elocutionist of whom Toledo feels exceptionally proud. Mrs. John D. Stewart, nee Miss Adah Olivia Brown, formerly of Chicago, but now an addition to Toledo's literary circle, also gave a very fine reading. The Henrietta Circle entertains friends once each month, and at each of its public literary meetings it shows that the members are doing telling work. We patiently await the next meeting.</p>

                     <p>At high noon, on Dec. 18th, I beautiful wedding of more than local interest occurred in Chicago. The bride is the only daughter of Mrs. Lavinia Lee and the one living granddaughter of Mrs. Mary Jones and the late John Jones of this city. The fortunate groom, Dr. William Whipper Purnell of Washington, D.C., is the only son of Miss Julia Purnell of Washington and the late James Purnell of Camden, N.J.</p>
                     <p>The bride has bad education and culture, advantages beyond the reach of most American girls. For several years she has pursued the study of vocal and instrumental music to the point of fine attainments in both. Along with her musical accomplishments she is endowed with a delicate artistic taste and has done much clever work with brush and pencil as a pastime.</p>
                     <p>The groom, Dr. Purnell, is a young physician of established practice in Washington and a social favorite in the east. He has had the very best of training and equipment for his profession.</p>
                     <p>The wedding was unique in its delightful freedom from ostentation. The scheme of color carried out both in house decorations and costumes was pink and white. The bride wore a heavy ivory satin, without train. The waist was trimmed with plaited white chiffon and heavily embroidered in pearls. Her veil was fastened with a diamond ornament, the gift of the groom. The maid of honor, Miss Elizabeth Seals of Cleveland, is a young lady of stately beauty and many social graces. She wore a beautiful and artistic gown of taffeta silk, Dresden design. The bridesmaids were the two prettycousins of the bride, Miss Etta Brown of Detroit and Miss Mabel Wheeler of this city. They were prettily costumed in mousseline de soie over pink silk and carried bridesmaid's roses. The bride's mother, Mrs. Lee, wore black satin trimmed with heliotrope velvet.</p>
                     <p>The groom was attended by Mr. Andrew J. Stevens of Philadelphia as best man, and Messrs. John Wheeler and George Gray of this city acted as groomsmen. The ceremony was performed by Rev. Richard DeBaptiste, who performed a similar service for the bride's mother nearly a quarter of a century ago. Smiley's service and Tomasso's orchestra were among the details of this beautifully interesting occasion.</p>
                     <p>The wedding party left for Washington the same evening, where Dr. And Mrs. Purnell will permanently reside.</p>
                     <p>The week presiding the Lee-Purnell wedding occurred the marriage of Miss Gertrude Washington and the noted elocutionist, Mr. Richard B. Harrison. The wedding ceremony was performed by Rector Thomas at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in the presence of a host of admiring friends. The wedding was one of the social events of the season, and units a popular

pianist in the person of the bride, and one of our most gifted readers. The poet, Paul Dunbar, acted as best man.</p>
                     <p>After these brilliant wedding chimes an additional word will seem prosaic indeed, I cannot forbear, however, extending to all of my associate contributors to the ERA a most hearty New Year's greeting. I am willing to confess that my meagre service in behalf of this Journal and reading the heart words or our women from all parts of the country, have been to me both a delight and an inspiration. A new and high sense of the value of associated interests must come to us all from this labor of love.</p>

DOUGLAS AND DUMAS.</head>
                  <docDate>January 1896</docDate>
                  <p>So they are termed by Thomas Wallace Swan of Philadelphia in a long letter to the <hi rend="italic">Woman's
Journal</hi> of this city, only extracts of which will space permit us to reprint. This is much to our regret, especially as it includes a long letter from Alexander Dumas, giving a Frenchman's views on the legal disabilities of women. Mr. Swan says:</p>
                  <p>"Two of the most significant coincidences relative to great men and great movements happened in connection with the death of Frederick Douglass and Alexander Dumas, the world-famous writer of fiction.</p>
                  <p>"On the day of the death of Mr. Douglass he attended the Woman's Rights Convention, then in session at Washington, where he made one of the most eloquent pleas of his career for the equal, civil and political rights of women. This was his last public utterance.</p>
                  <p>"About four days prior to the death of the younger Dumas, he addressed a letter strongly endorsing the movement to Madame Maria Szelya-Loevy, the leader of the Woman's rights party in France.</p>
                  <p>"It is, indeed, a significant incident that two of the most brilliant public men of our time, both of them directly or indirectly connected with a proscribed race, should in their last moments throw the whole strength of their intellect and individuality in support of women, the most oppressed class in the world."</p>

                  <p>We have received copies of many of the addresses made at the recent Congress of Women at Atlanta, Ga. The papers are all good, many of them exceptionally fine, and if our paper was only appreciated sufficiently well to return us three times the amount of cash it does monthly, we would make it three times as large us it now is and then be able and happy to print them all, that they might be preserved as a part of the history making of the age. In the collection there is the address of the president of the Women's Auxiliary Committee, Mrs. Josephine Bruce, of Mrs. Rosette Lawson, secretary of same committee, who opened the Congress, the welcome speech of Mrs. Selena Sloan Butler, "A Mother's Duty in the Home," by Mrs. Sylvanie F. Williams, "How to raise the Moral Status of the Race," by Mrs. Josephine S. Yates. Beside all those mentioned, there is on hand a large number of well written articles sent in by our regular correspondents which we are compelled to very much condense or leave out for this issue entirely. If it is considered that by so doing we have trenched on the rights of subscribers who may be more interested in other things than the Congress, our excuse must be our enthusiastic interest in the work our women are doing everywhere, and our desire to carefully record it for future reference. None of our male contemporaries can find space in their papers for this information. Their
<pb n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
columns are "so crowded" with patent matter, ghastly jokes on women, by would-be male wits with women's front names, lists of tin dippers and pie plates received at tin weddings, etc. Sometime our women will come to realize that only through the columns of a paper controlled by themselves will the hard and beneficent work they are doing all the time be made known to the world, and so bring to them the respect and dignity they so richly deserve.</p>

                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>What, then, shall we expect of Pitkin and the Quartz Creek District, which has a mineral bearing area as large as these three districts combined, when so far the developments there have proved the mineral deposits to be fully as rich and extensive?</p>
                  <p>We can come to but one conclusion: Its wealth is limitless, and no more safe or profitable field for investment can be found.</p>
                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>The ore is high grade, netting from fifty to one thousand dollars per ton, average two hundred and fifty. The Company has undisputed title to the entire property, which is free from any <sic corr="encumbrance">incumbrance</sic>, and will be kept so.

                  <p>The  last regular meeting of the Woman's Era Club was in charge of the domestic science section of that club, Mrs. Harriet Ruffin, chairman of section, in the chair. Carefully prepared papers were read on "Ventilation," by Mrs. Fannie Johnson, on the proper care of cooking utensils by Mrs. Pope, food preparations by Miss Simmons, and on decorations, wise and otherwise, by Mrs. Ruffin. Short discussions followed all the papers. A special meeting will be held in charge of the civic section, when the club and their friends will listen to a talk by Mrs. Ellen A. Richardson, editor of <hi rend="italic">Business Folio</hi>, on the advantage of a business training for women, and she will also tell something of the work and aim of the Floral Emblem Society. The meeting will be held in the Revere St. Chapel. Members will be notified by card as to time.</p>
                  <p>Sectional chairmen are warned that hereafter monthly reports of the doings of their branches will be called for, and at least one meeting a year arranged by them. Mrs. Lottie Sampson, church fair committee, reported progress of work for the coming fair for the benefit of St. Monica's Home; her com mittee are soliciting yearly subscribers to the Home, and the ladies are pledged to give some form of a benefit annually to it.</p>
                  <p>The last literary meeting of the "New England Women's Press Association" was one of the most enjoyable ever held by that lively club. It was journalists' day, and was wittily presided over by Mrs. Gosse. The different newspaper women told what they knew of the different departments of newspaper work. Bright papers, laughable stories, music and flowers galore, with the usual "high tea " in the beautiful crystal parlors of the Parker House, filled the afternoon and evening with delight.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Club House Corporation will tender a reception to Mrs. E.M.H. Merrill, its president, at the Hotel Vendome next Friday afternoon from four to seven. Tea tables will be in charge of different clubs and decorated with club colors. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe will preside. There will be five-minute speeches by witty women, vocal and instrumental music, and a delightful time for all fortunate enough to be present.</p>
                  <p>Miss Florence Johnson, late of the New England Conservatory of Music, contributed largely to the success of an entertainment given in Brooklyn lately for the benefit of Siloam Presbyterian Church. Miss Johnson is an accomplished pianist, and while in Boston was much appreciated for her readiness to respond to any call to assist, by her musical gift, any deserving cause.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Frederick Douglass is editing her late husband's speeches.</p>
                  <p>Cards of invitation issued by Mrs. Lucy A. Roberson to the marriage reception of her daughter, Laura Viola ("Vodia"), to Mr. Artrudoe Moore Lee, have been received in Boston. The marriage was celebrated Feb. 25, at 541 Sibley St., St. Paul, Minn.</p>

<pb n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Godwin, Hemmings, W.H. Jackson, H.P. Johnson, Payne, Peake, C. L. Smith and J.R. Jackson were at home to friends Monday evening, the 17th, at the Grundmann Studios, Copley Sq., and welcomed their friends to one of the most delightful entertainments ever given in Boston. The spacious halls, reception rooms, and promenades were beautiful and inviting in their elaborate decorations, and the bachelors all attentiveness and courtesy. Copley Hall was hung with white and pink bunting, the ceiling being all in white, through which the electric lights shone with a soft, mellow light which was universally becoming. The walls were draped with laurel, and the stage set with palms and ferns. In the great smoking room were rugs, couches and hangings galore, and to crown all a huge wood fire. It is not strange that with such a setting the costumes of the ladies showed to perfection and that the scene was one of unusual beauty. There were many beautiful gowns worn for the first time, conspicuous among them those worn by two attractive "buds," Misses Genevieve Lee and Elizabeth Hemmings. Miss Lee, who has manner of unusual charm, was very attractive in white silk and spangled chiffon, made decollete, and decorated with white rosebuds. Miss Hemmings could not have worn anything more becoming to her than her perfectly simple dress of white Swiss muslin, undecorated save for the ribbon at the waist and those which held the gown on the shoulders.</p>
                  <p>The young ladies who acted  as ushers were Miss Lillian Lewis, in white and blue, Miss Gray, in white over pink, Miss Grant, in white and violet, Miss Hare, in yellow, Miss Harriet Smith, in yellow, Miss Trotter, in pink, Miss Hemmings and Miss Watson, in white with violets.</p>
                  <p>Every bachelor, from those who received the guests at their carriages to those who received in line, did his utmost for the pleasure of his guests. A reception and a musicale by the bachelors occupied the early part of the evening. These were followed by supper and dancing, and all left believing it would be a long time before the Bachelors' At Home would be surpassed.</p>
                  <p>Several New Bedford girls came up to the Bachelors', Miss Gertie Piper, Miss Wilson and Miss Carter being among them.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Joseph Lee was distinctively elegant in black and silver.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dandridge was, as usual, very stylish in pearl brocade.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Wilson wore her wedding dress, cream faille.</p>
                  <p>Miss De Mortie carried off with her usual distinction her dress of pale blue silk with trimmings of white and pink.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Grant wore white silk and white chiffon.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. J.H. Lewis wore Nile green silk.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. U.A. Ridley was in black brocade, with rose-chiffon and pink velvet.</p>
                  <p>Miss Latimer of Saratoga was one of the pretty girls; Mrs. Trotter and Mrs. Smith were among the handsome women present.</p>
                  <p>Among the prettiest dresses were the organdies made over silk. Miss Smith, Miss Trotter and Mrs. Alston all wore them.</p>
                  <p>Dr. and Mrs. Brown of Baltimore are at home on Calhoun St., Baltimore, and are receiving much quiet attention. At their first "at home," their house was open from two till 11 P.M., and as many as twenty-five people at a time were present.</p>
                  <p>Miss Maud Cuney will spend the summer in the north. Her friends in Newport and Boston will give her a hearty welcome.</p>
                  <p>Some of the smart set of Philadelphia are negotiating with Mrs. DeLos Mars to give one of her dramas in that city.</p>

                  <p>Engagements and prospective wedding bells!</p>
                  <p>Well, Lent is upon us, which means no more parties, dancing or card playing.</p>
                  <p>The many friends of Mr. Esteve S. Mars of Brooklyn will be pleased to learn of his final success in securing a sheepskin and becoming a full-fledged M.D. Meharry College, Nashville, Tenn. conferred the coveted honor.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Charles Lansing, Jr., and wife, (nee, Miss Kitty White) of Quincy St., Brooklyn, gave a christening dinner in honor of their little daughter, Katharyn Olga, Sunday evening, the 9th. Among the guests were Mr. George T. Downing of Newport, Mrs. E.D. White, Rev. and Mrs. H.C. Bishop, Mr. W.C. Bolivar of Philadelphia, Mr. and Mrs. C.H. Lansing, Miss Gertrude O. Lansing, Mr. and Mrs. H.T. Mars, Mr. W. Russell Johnson, Mr. and Mrs. J.B. Peterson Mr. T.B. Francis, Dr. W.S. Kissam.</p>
                  <p> St. Philip's Fair was very fine, and as usual a
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
hard matter to leave with enough money to take one home again. The girls are such talkers that the money almost walks from the young men's pockets.  Miss Kate Smith is one of the most successful of these talkers. I know from past visits to fairs at which we have met.</p>
                  <p>Wedding bells will begin soon after Easter, and goodness only knows when they will stop their sweet chiming, from the number of engagements we hear of. Well, health and happiness to them all. Mr. Robert is still looking Jerseyward, but I heard they were on the "outs." No doubt nothing more or less than a lover's quarrel. Charlie Moore has stolen the heart of a fine little girl, much to the disappointment of one of the older girls who had great anticipations. But never mind, dearie, this is leap year, so make your choice. Our lovely Lottie is also on the list of those whom we expect soon to congratulate. Mr. Miller must be very proud of his success in securing the coveted prize. How she will be missed by the girls in their frolics.</p>
                  <p>Very soon I suppose we will hear something definite from Miss Alice Greenly and Miss Walker. Mr. Milfred Jackson has at last made up his mind not to change the date of his announcement again. Good luck, old boy.</p>
                  <p>Miss Florence Nichols and Miss Ellen Ford are two very charming girls. Some young man will soon be laying his heart at their feet, if he has not ere this.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Ernest Attwell seems very attentive to our Kate. I can hardly blame him, but then --- </p>
                  <p>At the musicale and farce given for the Siloan Presbyterian Church, Madame Wilson played divinely, as usual. Mr. King, the baritone, did not make a very good impression, for his first appearance in New York. After the concert came the farce, "My Neighbor's Wife," characterized by the Misses Nichols, Greenly and Ford, also Messrs. E.T. Attwell, Frank Chambers and R.M. Attwell. The acting showed careful preparation, and everything went off without a hitch. How noticable it was that the ladies and gentlemen of the "inner circles" were not up to the dances. This winter's dances were all Greek to them. All the ladies looked charming, but I must speak especially of the toilettes of Misses Eva Walker and Alice Greenly. I think they were Louis XV coats  -- at least some one said so. Anyhow they were fine, and spoke well for the maker.</p>
                  <p>The Chronothanatoletron at Hardman Hall was very enjoyable, and the young ladies, as well as the ladies who were at the head of it, deserve great credit. The "Black Patti" was the crowning success of the affair. Professor Craig played beautifully to a very attentive audience. Miss Blanche Washington was as fine and graceful as usual. Miss E. Nowell Ford played a difficult piano solo so fast that one could get no sense nor enjoyment from it. The dear girl was affected with stage fright, I guess.

                  <docAuthor>Victoria Earle Matthews</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>February 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Shortly after the adjournment of the first National Convention of colored women in America, which met in Boston, Mass., July 1, 1895, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, President of the National Federation of Afro-American Women, the organization which grew out of the said convention, conferred with Helen Cook, 1st, vice president of the convention, and president of the National League which desired union, as to the possibility of uniting the two organizations in one grand body, and as a result accepted the latter's proposition;
<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>: That a committee of three, headed by the president of each organization, be selected by said presidents to form a "conference committee" which should meet at a given place for the purpose of consultation and agreement as to a basis of union, the same to be submitted in joint convention for united action, looking to final union. This plan differed from one submitted by Mrs. Victoria Matthews, chairman of executive committee of the National Federation, but in the interest of harmony that lady withdrew her plan.</p>
                  <p>After subsequent correspondence it was decided by the two presidents to hold Conference Committee in Atlanta. It was expected that Mrs. Cook would be present, but she delegated her powers to Miss Lucy Moten, of Washington, D.C. Many ladies of the Atlanta Woman's Congress, in their earnest desire to see harmony be-
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
tween the two bodies, requested the privilege of having said congress represented on this committee, for the purpose of attesting their unbiased and perfectly neutral attitude. After much discussion and consideration by the parties most interested, it was finally agreed to extend the courtesy, particularly as the presence of an outside presiding officer would tend to put the two national organizations on an equal footing. This action was unanimously accepted by the conference committee as fair and in order. Miss Moten, acting for the National League, appointed  Mrs. Ida C. Bailey of Washington, and Miss Anna Jones of Kansas City to serve with her. Mrs. Washington appointed Mrs. Pitts of Missouri and Mrs. V. Matthews of New York; the congress appointing Mrs. Emma Ford of Michigan, Mrs. Arthur S. Gray and Mrs. Rossetta Lawson of Washington. Mrs. Ford was chosen to preside ; Mrs. Pitts as secretary.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Matthews moved that courtesy be extended the National League in the matter of opening discussion upon the question at issue. Miss Moten declined on the ground that she was uninstructed and preferred to hear what suggestion the Federation would make. Mrs. Washington directed Mrs. Matthews to speak for the National Federation. Mrs. Matthews playfully referred to the strategic point gained by Miss Moten. She outlined the plan as proposed to her in Washington at a personal meeting with Cook, and clearly stated that she approved the plan, which was as follows: 1. Both names be discarded and a new one chosen which should represent the new Union; all agreed.  2. Both constitutions be discarded and a new one formulated; agreed. 3. A joint call to be issued in the ensuing year for a joint convention, before which the foregoing suggestions should be submitted for united action, favorable or otherwise; agreed.</p>
                  <p>In the friendly informal discussion which followed, various minor points were touched upon; for instance, it was suggested that the new name be The National Federation of Colored Women. Of course all understood that the committee had no jurisdiction in the matter, but merely suggested it in order to arouse popular discussion on the subject, all agreeing to differ according to understanding of the principle involved.</p>
                  <p>The official organ of the National Federation was also discussed conjointly. Its present form was objected to, the understanding being that an editorial change was desired, i.e., fewer editors and more reports as to the work of organized bodies of women; that the paper should be so supported as to give space for light literature, essays, fiction, etc. Mrs. Matthews spoke for the ERA and said that the ERA was prepared to make suggested changes, in fact those identical points had been discussed by the editor-in-chief, who went further by suggesting that the editorship be an elective one, and that the national organization form an incorporated society for the purpose of owning the paper. The management of the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Journal</hi> of Boston, and other papers, were discussed. Like the name, this too was left to the decision of the women in joint convention. Mrs. Matthews believed that our women had an opportunity of establishing a clean, chaste paper at very little cost. It could easily be done by the clubs composing the Federation guaranteeing the cost of publishing per issue, the clubs being taxed per ratio, and in return every member of the Federation would be entitled to a paper free. All agreed that the latter plan was exceedingly practical. Miss Moten stated many things, which from her point of view detracted from the ERA'S reputation for unbiased dealing with public questions, her language being decidedly strong, but she was willing, she said, to modify her views providing the changes suggested would be adopted in the future. Mrs. Matthews replied that the whole question hinged upon the quality of support which the colored women of the country would give the paper. The matter of making public the work accomplished by this committee was then broached. It was informally considered wise to report privately, but there must have been a misunderstanding on this point as every point covered was commonly discussed an hour or two later, and these extracts from my note book are herewith given to THE WOMAN'S ERA for the information of all persons desiring the same.</p>
                  <p>The conference committee was remarkably <sic corr="harmonious">harmonius</sic>; not a jar, save when the minor discussion concerning the ERA obtruded itself. Miss Ford, the chairman, congratulated the ladies and said, "Union must follow such an amicable conference as this has been."</p>

                     <text>
                        <body>
                           <p>EMBODYING FOR ECONOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS, ANSWERS TO MANY PERSONAL LETTERS, QUERIES, ETC.</p>
                           <p>When the National Federation of Afro-American Women, was organized in Boston it was understood that every delegate present and every club of women represented by letter or otherwise would support and sustain the Federation by making it strong numerically and representatives of women were urged to organize local clubs and use their influence not only in bringing into the Federation clubs so organized, but all women's clubs then existing in the respective localities, Organization was conceded to be the first work of the Federation, and plans were laid with this end in view. Instructions were given our Chairman of the Executive Committee concerning this matter and that of uniting with The National League. As we earnestly desired harmony and union our best counsellors advised and urged delay on our constitution and by-laws on the ground that when union was effected a new constitution would of necessity be required; further that no constitution would be adequate to cover our needs as a national body that was not constructed upon the constitutions of the various bodies comprising the Federation, our policy being opposed upon principle to any constitution otherwise constructed for the reason that only by knowing and providing for the various objects of the clubs comprising the Federation could we hope to become a truly representative body of Afro-American Women. Sorrow and affliction in our official family caused general retardation. Our position as a dignified self-respecting body is one of gravity. Our constitution as adopted at the Boston convention stood thus:</p>
                           <p>NAME -- ARTICLE I.</p>
                           <p>This organization is and shall hereafter be known as The National Federation of Afro-American Women.</p>
                           <p>OBJECT -- ARTICLE II.</p>
                           <p>The object of this organization is: (1.) The concentration of the dormant energies of the women of the Afro-American race into one broad band of sisterhood; for the purpose of establishing needed reforms, and the practical encouragement of all efforts being put forth by various agencies, religious, educational, ethical and
otherwise, for the upbuilding, ennobling and advancement of the race. (2). To awaken the women of the race to the great need of systematic effort in home making and the divinely imposed duties of motherhood.</p>
                           <p>GOVERNMENT -- ARTICLE III.</p>
                           <p>The organization shall be governed by a president, four vice-presidents, representing the four geographical sections of our country, a treasurer, two secretaries, corresponding and recording, and an executive committee, whose members shall be chosen by the chairman from the sections represented by the membership, with a view of making the committee truly representative.</p>
                           <p>MEMBERSHIP - ARTICLE IV.</p>
                           <p>All women's clubs are eligible to membership (number not restricted), whose work is embraced in the object of this organization.</p>
                           <p>MEETING - ARTICLE V.</p>
                           <p>The organization shall meet annually, time and place subject to the executive committee.</p>
                           <p>OFFICIAL ORGAN - ARTICLE VI.</p>
                           <p>The official organ of The National Federation of Afro-American Women is the publication known as the WOMAN'S ERA.</p>
                           <p>It will be seen that the constitution thus adopted  in convention, imposed no burden or tax upon clubs. It made no provision for the necessary correspondence. Your officers have been slow to act in order to study the most progressive methods of procedure in use among National bodies. Officially we expected to communicate through our official organ, but unfortunately the clubs composing the National Federation have not systematically ordered sufficient numbers of the ERA to guarantee the expense, not only of necessary communications, but of the work done and fully reported in our memorable convention number. This is a sad confession, but we make it in the hope that our women will pause and thoughtfully consider, first, that any organization founded upon other than common business principles must fail; secondly, we are before the public; critics, friends and disinterested parties, men and women of both races are watching us and naturally expecting results; and thirdly, the expense of our meeting in Boston, the communications that have since been given space in our official organ, has been paid by some one or is still hanging over the paper; and lastly, we, The National Federation
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
of Afro-American Women, not only have it in our power to establish before the world the first and only paper owned and published by Afro-American women, but we can own it and through its columns let the world see what manner of women we are. Our women will need no argument as to the advantage in having as our official organ a paper so well established as to literary merit, as the WOMAN'S ERA, and we consider it absolutely necessary for the perfecting of our organization, as a means of communicating with associate clubs, that we urge upon the officers of alI women's clubs, unions, etc., that they send a monthly letter as to the work carried on by the clubs or unions, and to specify the number of copies per month that respective club or union will order. This is practical. It is necessary, for we have no means with which to conduct private communications, and will have none until after our next annual convention, unless public spirited and sympathetic persons will make toward that end.</p>
                           <p>In order to facilitate the work of the Federation it is necessary at this time that the chairman of our executive committee be immediately furnished with a copy of the constitution and number of members of every club in the Federation, and those desirous of entertaining; and we do earnestly invite all women to organize for practical work and join us without delay. We trust the presidents and others in authority in various local and state organizations will give this matter close and immediate attention. Our struggling race is in travail, and needs above all things the united, earnest and determined uplifting efforts of strong vigorous womanhood; this is pre-eminently the foundation  making age; the future moral and intellectual status of our race depends upon the real basic work, that the women of the race perform in this decade. Burdened with this conviction, we stretch out our hands to our sister women everywhere for help and courage and inspiration and light. Let us be up and doing. Time is passing and opportunities fleeting; let the heads of all clubs communicate at once with Mrs. Victoria Matthews, Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, Tuskegee, Ala., and also raIly to the support of our official organ -- the WOMAN'S ERA. Remember we can establish it as a creditable race enterprise, or for lack of sympathy and support let it fail. We can make of it what we will, provided we first make it permanent. It not only never furnished a source or suspicion of income to the many writers composing its staff, from editor-in-chief, down, but has not paid its running expenses. It has established its name as a good wholesome, neatly printed, family newspaper. As the official organ of the Federation, it is not only our duty to support it, but to our interest as a body of women without other means of communication, and for the present without an exchequer. As soon as the heads of the various clubs, unions, etc., put themselves in communication with Matthews, important propositions concerning the future management and support of our official organ will be submitted. For this and other progressive lines of work vital to our organization we urge immediate attention.</p>
                           <p>In order to facilitate organization, we have issued application blanks for the use of clubs desiring membership in the National Federation of Afro-American Women. The secretaries of the clubs composing the Federation will please fill out forward at earliest convenience to the secretary of the N.F.A.A.W., </p>

                  <byline>REPORTED BY ELIZABETH E. LANE.</byline>
                  <p>The literary program of this club for the current quarter is varied. Subjects for discussion in the fortnightly meetings are: "The Relation between Women's Clubs and Churches," various phases of "The Suffrage Question," "The Province of Women's Clubs," "How shall our Young Women be Properly Trained and Protected," "The Atlanta Exposition."</p>
                  <p>The latter subject was discussed the evening of Jan. 17, when the club opened the doors to the gentlemen of the school's faculty. Mrs. B. T. Washington discussed "The Negro Exhibit," Mrs. S. Peake Greene "The Exposition as Related to the Cause of Education," and "The Part Played by Woman at the Exposition," by Mrs. Irene Bond.</p>
                  <p>The members of the club had decided to give nothing but the regular program, even if the
<pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
"lords of creation" were in attendance. The program proved interesting to all, but some gentlemen who believed that the club movement at Tuskegee savored too much of the "New Woman," showed signs of uneasiness when "motions," "points of order," etc., were in use by the members of the club during the time devoted to business matters.</p>
                  <p>No one of them rose for a "point of order" on the "New Woman," but at the close of the evening's exercise one rose to give a motion for a vote of thanks for the invitation that had been extended, and in the regular form a rising vote of thanks was given by the entire party of thirty-five gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>Club matters have proved of great interest this month.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Washington has been called to several places to organize clubs among women. She has given hopeful and interesting accounts of the earnest women who, though timid, are determined to do effective work on reaching the masses who are less fortunate.</p>
                  <p>A plan is on foot and arrangements are being made by which the club may assume control of the county funds devoted heretofore to the mismanagement of the domestic affairs of the County Poor House. Frequent visits to the Poor House by members of the club, and the report of a committee that made a thorough investigation of affairs there, found an intensely serious condition of things that involved matters of life and death.</p>
                  <p>The reports from the departments of the club argue well for the coming year. The Vesta Club, under the direction or Mrs. N.B. Young, gave an entertainment and devoted the proceeds to the needy poor. Two old women, who were helpless and bedridden, have been made comfortable.</p>
                  <p>The members of the Ednah Cheney Club, under Mrs. Thornton, have three old ex-slaves in their charge. Helpless and alone in their cabins, they have been comforted, clothed and fed during the present storms of the wintry weather. The club is not only systematic in its charities but is also in its literary efforts to maintain the principles of their constitution.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers' Wives Ciub, under Mrs. Estelle Penney, gives hopes for better and more earnest work by the members in the field of the church and homes to which they are allied.</p>
                  <p>Miss Francis Willard has become intensely interested in the W.C.T.U. circle, under Miss Susie Porter. She has contributed all the current publications of the Temperance Union for the reading room, and has written words of encouragement as a sister to a sister of one sisterhood.</p>
                  <p>The department of Current History, under Mrs. Warren Logan, still gives a report that shows there is no lack of interest in the questions of the day, though minutes are few and not easily spared from the duties of the moment, when one may cull the current literature.</p>
                  <p>Just as many women as heretofore are interested in the work that Mrs. Booker Washington plans for her club or town and country women. They come to the club every Saturday afternoon, eighty and one hundred of them.</p>
                  <p>The Dorcas Club For the young girls meets every Saturday in the room of the same hall that Mrs. Washington rents for the work. The Margaret Murray Washington Club of ten Normal school girls, assisted the Dorcas Club in making articles for a fair that was held one afternoon in the above mentioned hall. The mothers contributed their share of raw material in the shape of eggs, chickens, pork, etc. The latter were cooked, and with the handiwork of the young people, graced the tables. Thirty-two dollars were cleared.</p>
                  <p>A reading room and circulating librarv has been opened there under the auspices of the Dorcas Club. The nucleus of the library were forty-five books contributed from the library of the young daughter, Portia, of Mrs. Washington, who is now attending the school at Framingham, Mass.</p>

                  <p>The situation of Charleston, S.C., is singularly beautiful, being bordered on its eastern and western shores by two streams, the Cooper and Ashley, whose convergence forms its magnificent harbor reflecting the azure tints of the sky above and luxuriant foliage around; glorious to look upon when the glinting sun rays made its rippling bosom to resemble a sheet of silver sparks. It is unobstructed, save the presence of Fort Sumpter, that theatre of daring deeds, whose invincible ramparts proclaim it the guardian of our peace.</p>
                  <p>On entering the harbor to the right, stands Sullivan's Island, the Coney Island of the South-
<pb n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
land, on which stands old Fort Moultrie. To the left is Morris Island, where the first shot of the Civil War was fired, and from which point shot and shell were leveled at our city and its fortifications with slight intermissions, for over 500 days . This could rightly be termed the "Dark Age of Charleston."</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this and subsequent physical disturbances, cyclones and earthquakes, she has arisen from the ashes of a troubled past, and is fast putting on the garments of progress in all its varied forms. Numerous foreign as well as domestic craft speak for its commercial activity. Vast areas of King Cotton, rice, maize, truck produce, etc., under a high state of cultivation, tell of its agricultural wealth. Immense structures girding the suburbs and pouring forth volumes of smoke as they grind the valuable phosphate fertilizers, give employment to hundreds of breadwinners.</p>
                  <p>Educational institutions abound, chief of which are the College of Charleston, established in 1823; the High School, organized in 1839, and the Citadel Academy in 1843.</p>
                  <p>The city public schools are in a flourishing, condition. Those for colored children are represented by the Shaw Memorial on Mary street, and the Simonton on Morris street. These are large and well appointed buildings, but are necessarily crowded on account of the dense population, there being about 1700 in the two. The former was erected by the colored people about 1868 or '69, in memory of Col. Robert G. Shaw, Commander of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, who so gloriously fought and fell on Morris Island during the bombardment of the city.</p>
                  <p>Industrial training is now attracting much attention, and we trust ere long that such an important factor in the development of our people will receive the practical recognition it deserves.</p>
                  <p>Churches are numerous, indeed Charleston may be called the "Lesser City of Churches," the oldest being St. Michael's, which has an history of its own; it may be of interest to note that the first boy choir in America originated in this church in 1798. Many of these edifices belong to the colored people, and are nobly sustained by the several denominations in spite of the financial depression of the last decade. </p>
                  <p>Its people are hospitable, genial, intelligent, industrious, and are making rapid strides toward the goal of ideal citizenship. Their individuality is strongly marked by the diversity of taste in the construction of their homes, it being hard to find two or three exactly alike, unless built for tenements.</p>
                  <p>The dwellings on East and South Battery are indicative of refined taste coupled with affluence. There are many others scattered through the city that are noticeable for their beauty and the pronounced comfort of their surroundings.</p>
                  <p>Its points of interest are not numerous, but there is a charm about each from the grim, old, battle-scarred walls of Sumpter, Moultrie and Johnson on the south, to the wide spreading oaks and spirelike pines on the north, whose graceful drapery keeps time to the breezes that play over them; all historic charm which will linger as long as there is to be found a soul worshipping at the shrine of patriotism.</p>

Smallwood, of the so called ,"Temperance Industrial and Collegiate Institute of Claremont, Va." Of all solicitors for northern money he is one of the most plausible and adroit, and invariably makes a strong impression, backed as he is by southern credentials. Nevertheless he is unworthy of assistance, and for the sake of deserving southern schools, his petition should be denied. I have in my possession evidences of his character which unfit him for the work in which he is engaged, and shall be ready to show them to any one interested in him.</p>

                  <p>N.E. WOMEN'S CLUB RESOLUTION.</p>
                  <p>At a meeting of the New England Women's Club where the subject of discussion was "The Effect of the Race Elements upon the Well-being of our Country," the following resolution was passed :</p>
                  <p>That the thanks of the New England Women's Club be presented to Rev. Samuel M. Crothers, university preacher of Cambridge, for his prompt

and frank utterance in regard to the action of three of the leading hotels of our city in declining to receive Bishop Arnett during his recent visit to Boston; that the club believes, if such action on the part of those hotels was because of color distinction, that it was contrary to the best customs and traditions of the city of Boston, and wishes to acknowledge its indebtedness to Mr. Crothers for having expressed the higher sense of the community, with a conviction that his course has not only gratified the general public, but must also help to influence the body of future citizens among whom his present ministry is placed.</p>

                  <p>Some of the delegates attending the Atlanta Colored Woman's Congress, judging by many letters which have since come to the Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, were mistaken as to the attitude of the committee on "Mob Law." An addition to the original resolution was offered, which contained the following: "Be it further resolved that, in denouncing lynch law, we also condemn the crime that provokes lynch law." The addition was not "beheaded " or purposely lost, as some were disposed to think, but after fearless intelligent direction by the committee, on the ground that mob law and execution follows <hi rend="italic">suspicion of guilt, if the culprit or suspected one be colored, so swiftly</hi> that a crime is never proven, it was decided that there was no tenable ground for the acceptance even of the injurer's apology, much less a condemnatory resolutioin based on no other evidence than the word or reports of even those who support by non-interference crimes against law, humanity and God. As John Mitchell says: "There must be no toying with serpents. Lynch law must go."</p>

                  <p>THE PRESIDENT APPEALS TO THE NATIONAL FEDERATION.</p>

                        <body>
                           <p>Having seen every humiliation imaginable or possible to the working of the Separate Car Law, and given much serious thought as to how we could so agitate the matter as to lead to the abolishment of the system and the substitution of first and second class cars for the protection of our self-respecting travelers, I venture to lay the matter at this time before the National Federation of Afro-American Women, not only for consideration, but immediate action. Argument is not needed to portray the evils of this system in the matter of forced indiscriminate contact, nor the illegality of the extortionate tariff placed on all who have to ride in the notoriously filthy, ill-ventilated "Jim Crow" cars. With others, I had hoped for greater harmony among our women at this time, so delayed the matter. Delays are dangerous. I therefore appeal to and urge the heads of all clubs comprising the Federation to present the accompanying resolution to their respective bodies for signatures, and also to make an active canvass and secure as many signatures outside of their ranks, among interested parties, as possible, and forward to me without loss of time, the same to be placed with others and put into the hands of some one of our strong women, who will make it her business to present in person the petitions thus signed to the proper authorities in the various states, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the officers and directors of the railroads affected and the legislative committees having jurisdiction over such matters.</p>

                  <p>Recognizing the injustice of the law known as the Separate Car Law; knowing it to be not only brutal, degrading and inhuman in its operation, but contrary to the laws of contract and the genius of our liberal institutions, tending to accentuate unduly discrimination on account of color and condition; in the interest of common womanhood we unite in urging the annulment  of said oppressive and iniquitous measure from the statutes of the states Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. Further, that we, in the meantime, urge upon the officers and directors of the railroads affected by this color legislation, in justice to a self-respecting traveling class, the adoption of first and second class cars. This so-called law is a blot most foul, not only on the section boasting of its chivalric treatment of womanhood, but the fair fame of our common country.</p>

                  <p>Personal feeling has no place in newspaper work. A good newspaper gives facts, and is not concerned, and surely is not to blame, if the facts encroach upon somebody's pet hobby or were furnished by someone who is personally distasteful to a subscriber. A paper which is afraid of everybody's feelings has no call to he published. If a paper be clean it is certainly privileged to be brave if it can, and a clean, brave paper serves a double purpose; it justifies itself and takes its readers out of that overcrowded territory which is filled with those who judge through personal feeling.</p>
                  <p>The appeal of Mrs. Washington to the clubs of the country to circulate protests against the Separate Car System, refers to a matter of vital importance to every colored woman of the country. There is no one among us, no matter what her culture or refinement, but who may become the victim of this iniquitous custom, and the experience of Mrs. Thomas Fox, who was put off in the woods and at night, is an example of what may befall any one of us, or of our daughters, if called to the South. Mrs. Washington's movement is
one of practical moment,.and there is no other to which our women should lend their energies with more devotion and energy.</p>

                  <p>The women of the North long ago became convinced of the worth of Mrs. Matthews (Victoria Earle) as a woman of intelligence, enthusiasm, energy and talent. As all these attributes possessed by Mrs. Matthews have been employed and devoted almost exclusively in race work, it is not strange that her reputation and the esteem in which she is held has grown with the years.</p>
                  <p>In the last few months Mrs. Matthews has been traveling in the South, first in the interest of the Atlanta Congress, and latterly in the interest of the ERA. In her travels she has worked with the same unflagging zeal and intensity which characterizes all she does, and with the same results. Her reception everywhere has been more than cordial. Not only has she interested the women, but she has won their sympathy and love. It is one of our crying needs that our women who are working for "the one end" all over the country, should be united in order to carry on their work with the zeal and ardor which only union can give. It is to this end that Mrs. Matthews is bending all her energies and it is to this end that the ERA works.</p>
                  <p>In the future, Mrs. Matthews will be more intimately connected with the ERA, and its management can feel assured that this announcement will be read with pleasure by women everywhere.</p>

                  <docDate>February 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Comments on the Arnett case are getting a trifle monotonous, and it would seem as if the whole gamut of opinion and comment had been made. And yet there is a last word to be said, and it is fitting that it should come from the seat of the trouble.</p>
                  <p>Boston itself has spoken officially upon the matter, the city council unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed a set of resolutions introduced in a speech made by Mr. Stanley Ruffin, not only censuring the hotel-keepers, but calling upon the city attorney to press the law.</p>
                  <p>The Arnett case is a peculiar one. There is hardly a hotel in Boston which does not entertain colored guests every month in the year. We have been informed that the Bishop himself has, on other occasions, put up at first-class hotels. All of us know of prominent colored people who have registered at leading houses time and time again; colored business men daily lunch and dine at Young's, Parkers, the Adams House, the Thorndike, the Quincy, and there is never a theatre
<pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
party but that freely and thoughtlessly walks into the most available hotel for an after-theatre supper. To all these, the refusal to accommodate the Bishop came as a surprise. The fact is, that if the Bishop had presented himself for accommodation he would scarcely have found one of these cowards bold enough to refuse him, but it was a chance for cowardly negro-haters to express themselves without danger, and it was embraced.</p>
                  <p>The splendid expression from press and pulpit brought out by the incident almost repays the race which was insulted. Boston contains many people as prejudiced, as cowardly and bitter on the race question as can be found anywhere, but this incident has proven what the ruling sentiment is. Moreover, the colored people will continue to go just wherever they please, and feel assured that if a man is found bold enough to insult them he will never do it more than once.</p>

                  <p>The closing action of the Atlanta Congress in adjourning as a body to meet in Nashville is very perplexing., especially in view of the resolution passed concerning the Nashville Centennial. Our women bid fair to compete with the lords of creation in the matter of forming new organizations. We understand this is the only congress connected with the Cotton States Exposition that did not end with it. One pleasant feature of the Congress was the much commented upon, thorough unselfishness of the members of the National Federation. The workers in the Congress were largely made up from the ranks of the Federation. The National League was hardly in evidence. Their only representative was made, through Mrs. Lawson's courtesy, a member of the Congress, after her arrival in Atlanta.</p>

                  <p>ANSWERS TO QUERIES SENT OUT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERATION.</p>
                  <p>Sometime ago Miss L.C. Carter, Recording Secretary of the National Federation, was requested to communicate certain important queries to the clubs comprising the Federation, among which was, "What Plan would you suggest for the practical support of our official organ, THE WOMAN'S ERA?"</p>
                  <p>We submit a few of the returns:</p>
                  <p>Mrs. B.T. Washington thought that each local club would appoint an agent, and order through her, monthly, as many copies  as the club had members. "It would serve not only to increase its circulation, but broaden the minds of indifferent women as to the proportions of our woman's movement."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Mary H. Dickerson of Newport, writes: "I think the best means of support for our official organ is a large subscription list, and the best way to secure it is to write to each League for subscribers, and ask that each League appoint an agent to solicit outside subscribers."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Libbie C. Anthony of Jefferson City, Mo.: "I think our National President should have a column in the ERA each month, in order to stimulate a desire on the part of the various clubs to see the account of the Federation work. I also think copies should be sent to prominent working women in the various states, requesting their support and that they show the paper to their friends."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. R. Jerome Jeffrey of Rochester, N.Y.: "I thought it was decided in the convention that each club should take a certain number of papers. Surely each member of a club would be willing to do this much toward making our position secure as a self-respecting body."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Rebecca Aldridge of Pittsburgh, Pa.: "The paper  should be under the control and management of the National organization, and each club represented in the same pledge itself to take as many copies monthly as it has financial members."</p>
                  <p>Miss Annie L. Blanchard of Salem,.Mass.: "I would suggest that each club he held for so many copies, or that they guarantee so many subscribers from their members, and one member be appointed to sell to outsiders. In the various clubs there are members who have not had the advantage s of an education and home influence. Some of these are married, while others are single. Would it not be advisable, in order to have the ERA reach and touch every member, to have a 'Home  Department,' and under this head have papers which will suggest to some of the members to pay more attention to the moral, physical and intellectual training of the young; for instance, Mrs. Matthews' paper on 'Kindergarten Schools' is a
<pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
very fine article and should be read by every woman interested in the young. I think this sort of reading would attract a large class."</p>

                           <p>In an article published in THE ERA of December, 1895, on the death of the late Mrs. Robert Morris, of this city, we find a mistake. It says:</p>
                           <p>"She was carried to the hospital to die, as the last rites of the Catholic Church would not have been administered in the house of a 'heretic.'"</p>
                           <p>The facts are simply these. It was due to the forgetfulness or negligence of one of the priests of St. Joseph's, Rev. W. O'Connell, who was duly notified, and also to the b1undering  of those Catholics whose duty it was to attend to the matter and see that it was done. In no instance are the sacraments withheld on account of Protestants being the owners or inmates of the houses in which a sick Catholic may reside. In only one case are they withhold, that is, when the house is one of ill-repute or the circumstances such as no Christian could remain in them without sin.</p>

                           <p>REPLY. -The mistake complained of in Miss Cassidy's letter concerning a custom of the Catholic Church, was made through information given by one supposed to be well acquainted with those customs. However, if there was no reason why the rites (which Mrs. Morris reverenced and loved well enough to leave the whole of her estate to help perpetuate) should not have been administered, then it was criminal negligence on somebody's part that it was not done. The financial part of her affairs was carefully and quickly adjusted, nothing was neglected or overlooked there.</p>

                  <docDate>February 1896</docDate>
                  <byline>FANNIE BARRIER WILLIAMS.</byline>
                  <p>So much has been said and written about the South lately, that I may he guilty of forcing upon our readers  a worn out theme in attempting, to give some impressions as gained by a three week's experience in Georgia and Alabama during the past month. Yet it is impossible visit any of the southern slates and to know something of southern life without being more or less stirred to speak of one's impressions. There is something in the land of the south and in its civilization that makes it the most interesting portion of our Country. There are in this sunny land so many social contrasts, so many contradictions, so much good cheer and so much sadness, so much hope and so much despair, and above all such warmth of welcome on the one hand and so many repelling, prejudices on the other, that you are scarcely sure of your beliefs after leaving the south and again settling down to the certainties of your own fireside. There is an unseen relation of things, a deeper meaning of cause and effect, that make many things seem to he what they are not. You feel a degree of hesitancy in holding to conclusion's based upon a mere roadside observation of things and people. Nothing is more easy than to injure the cause of justice to our southern friends by mere declamatory statements of ill considered conclusions of what appears to the senses.</p>
                  <p>The existence of the Exposition made Atlanta a good place to start from to see the south and its people. The best of the south, both in things, people and behavior was here  on exhibition. Whatever the south was <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of in the spirit of hope, good cheer and hospitality, every stranger within its gates was made to feel. Here it was possible to find, as no where else in the south, suggestions of the narrowing of the fundamental differences between whites and blacks. Here could be found the blending of hopes and fears, and patience and forgiveness that must some day result in better and juster standards of estimating the worth of people.</p>
                  <p>It is scarcely possible to add anything of interest to what has already been so fully and well said by Mrs. Matthews, Miss Anna Jones and Mrs. Gray about the Atlanta Exposition.. I merely wish to add my testimony of appreciation as to the noble meaning and inestimable value of the Negro exhibit as a source of wholesome influence. Nothing since the enactment of the 15th amendment has awakened so much popular and kindly interest in the colored race as the contents of the Negro building at the Atlanta Exposition. Though but a partial exhibit of the Negro's progress in things material and spiritual, the exhibit was of a character to suggest a great deal that was not displayed.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Congress was an inspiring object lesson of our women's capacity for harmonious action. Linked with the Boston Conference of last August, the Woman's Congress in Atlanta can scarcely be less than a historical landmark in the development of the fraternal spirit among the colored women of America. There was displayed at the Atlanta Congress a variety of talents and fibre of character and capacity for achievements that were a surprise and inspiration both to the women themselves, and to the thousands, who came to see and listen to a new voice in the affairs of race development.</p>
                  <p>But where do all these alert, accomplished and sufficient women come from? This question was happily answered for your correspondent in visiting several towns in Alabama. A hurried visit Tuskegee, Montgomery, Selma, Marion, Greensboro and Birmingham of that state gave a new sense of pride and confidence in our women. At each place you will be welcomed by women who have been touched and strengthened for noble activities by the better spiritual and social forces of our day. In each place will be found a nucleus of womanly experience - women who are wide awake to the opportunities and responsibilities of the hour and eager for a larger co-operation of hand and heart in the work of regeneration. If Mrs. Washington of Tuskegee, Mrs. Davenport of Montgomery, Mrs. M.A. Dillard at Selma, Mrs. S.A. Childs at Marion, Mrs. S.A. Christian of Greensboro, Mrs. Ross of Birmingham and their associates are a type of our southern sisters, then those of us living north of the Ohio will need to bestir ourselves to keep pace with their advancing influence for good.</p>
                  <p>It was delightful to note that in this land of the south women of real accomplishments and large sympathies enjoy a more decided influence than
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
one would expect, and are valued by all classes at their real value. A happy illustration of this fact is to be found in the career of Miss M.W. Dillard of Birmingham. Miss Dillard is an alumnae of Provident Hospital and Training School of Chicago. She has exceptional qualifications and graces for her profession. Going to Birmingham with her scientific training she soon won the confidence of the entire medical fraternity. She is not only recognized as the head of her profession in this southern city, but prejudice yields wherever she goes. Wherever she is associated with white nurses in any important case Miss Dillard is always senior in management and responsibility. The respect and deference paid to this successful young woman by the best white people of Birmingham ought to be a helpful example to many of our discouraged young women.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Booker T. Washington spent a week in Chicago last month. That is scarcely a newsy statement, yet to Chicago
people it was an event outranking in popular interest the coming of any other visitor during the season. The clubs representing the culture and wealth of the city open wide the door of welcome to this new man of power and goodness and eagerly declare that they are honored by his presence. All the newspapers print his every utterance and men and women high and low flock to shake hands and give assurances of their respect and esteem. The cause of the American Negro becomes a theme of serious and respectful consideration in every community where Booker T. Washington is present speaks.</p>
                  <p>"I will not permit any man to drag me down by making me hate him," is the subtle way Mr. Washington has of making the enemies of the colored race ridiculous and defenseless in their meanness.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Washington addressed the I.B.W. Woman's Club and graciously acknowledged the club's interest in the work ot Tuskegee by its contribution of $50 to the support of one girl in the institution for one year.</p>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chicago Interocean</hi> happily surprised its readers a few days ago by the announcement that its $50 Btory prize had been won by a young colored lady in the person of Miss Anita LaForce. Miss LaForce is a teacher in our public schools. Her success in the <hi rend="italic">Interocean</hi> contest entitles her to a generous recognition among the few who have shown literary cleverness.</p>

                  <docDate>February 1896</docDate>
                  <p>A little industry will bring you ONE YEAR AT EMERSON COLLEGE, BOSTON<lb/>
AN ELECTROPOISE<lb/>
A TYPEWRITER<lb/>
FREDERICK DOUGLASS' BIOGRAPHY</p>
                  <p>Do You Want Either of These? THEN READ THIS:</p>
                  <p>The WOMAN's ERA offers another of its unparalleled premium lists.</p>
                  <p> 1. To the person sending fifty subscribers by June 1 to the WOMAN's ERA we will give a special course in the Emerson School of Oratory. In this course a choice of the following studies may be made Oratory, Dramatic Interpretation, English Literature, Singing, Pedagogy, Art and Aesthetic Culture or Physical Culture.</p>
                  <p>This offer is open to men or women of any age and appeals especially to those preparing, to preach or teach, to lawyers or public speakers. The Emerson School is too well known to need any endorsement from us. Its large patronage speaks for its worth.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies' Home Journal makes similar offers, but with this difference: MANY MORE subscribers are required. This offer is better than any magazine has yet made.</p>
                  <p>2. To any and all persons sending us thirty subscribers we will send an Electropoise, for home treatment. The Electropoise gives safe, reliable treatment by atmospheric oxygen for all ordinary ailments. It has been successfully used for years, and can be used for one's own self or one can give treatment to others. Its great expense has been the drawback to its more frequent use.</p>
                  <p>3. For twenty subscribers we will give a World's Typewriter. This speaks for itself. Cut may be found on another page.</p>
                  <p>4. For five subscribers we send a copy of the "Life of Frederick Douglass" and a year's subscription to the ERA.</p>
                  <p>The WOMAN's ERA begins its third year with many new subscribers. To encourage these and to celebrate its second anniversary, it makes these offers. As a guarantee, it points to its former scholarship premium, which was won by Miss Fisher.</p>

                  <p>The Great Mineral Basin it Pitkin covers an area as large as that of Leadville, Aspen and Red Cliff combined. Professor Sadtler, of the Chair of Metallurgy and Mineralogy of the State School of Mines, speaking of this district, says: "This camp, with proper and systematic development, will be made a second Aspen, if not better."</p>
                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>What, then, shall we expect of Pitkin and the Quartz Creek District, which has a mineral bearing area as large as these three districts combined, when so far the developments there have proved the mineral deposits to be fully as rich and extensive?</p>
                  <p>We can come to but one conclusion: Its wealth is limitless, and no more safe or profitable field for investment can be found.</p>
                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>The ore is high grade, netting from fifty to one thousand dollars per ton, average two hundred and fifty.

NEW ENGLAND FARM AGENCY.</p>
                  <p>There are in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut many good farms that can be purchased for a reasonable sum of money, and on easy terms of payment</p>
                  <p>We offer our assistance in aiding colored farmers to leave the South and to come and make their homes in the North.</p>
                  <p>We propose to procure farms in any of the above named states for as many of our race as desire, to come North and make their homes among us. We shall give them all the aid in our power, and be only too glad to look them over and see that they obtain all the advantages possible in the respective neighborhoods, until they become accustomed to their new homes and neighbors.</p>
                  <p>It is our intention in procuring these farms to have them near cities and towns in various states, so as to be convenient to school houses, railroad stations and churches.</p>
                  <p>The farms of the North differ from those of the South in that they are more compact, better cleared and attended to in general. Being smaller they are easier to care for. About anything that can be raised on farms in the South can be raised in the North.</p>
                  <p>On these farms are comfortable frame houses, cottage style. Terms of payment will be made to suit.</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">CURE WITHOUT MEDICINE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A SIMPLE HOME TREATMENT OF UNEQUALED VALUE, administered by attaching an instrument to the flesh which aids the system to take on oxygen from the atmosphere, to the utmost amount the system can use.</p>
                  <p>IN SIMPLICITY. Those of ordinary intelligence can use it, even in very serious and severe sickness, like diphtheria, pneumonia, scarlet fever, etc.</p>
                  <p>IN EFFECTIVENESS. It is always curative and eradicative of disease to a degree never before attained by the highest skill in other methods of treatment in like cases.</p>
                  <p>NEVER DANGEROUS OR INJURIOUS, as the treatment is simply an assistance to nature to do its work effectively and in its own way.</p>
                  <p>IT IS A TREATMENT OF THE BLOOD, and by purifying, revitalizing and loading it with Nature's Nerve Food, ejects disease by removing its causes. It applies of necessity to all diseases as no other treatment ever has.</p>
                  <p>THE OXYGEN COSTS NOTHING, the price of the instrument being all the expense necessary for years. It can be used by the entire family.</p>
                  <p>IT IS NOT A NEW THING. It has been in use in New England nearly seven years, and is endorsed by thousands, many of them among the most intelligent and influential citizens.</p>
                  <p>AS A RESTORATIVE OF VITAL ENERGIES in enfeebled and exhausted physical conditions it has no equal within the limits of human knowledge.</p>
                  <p>THE ELECTROPOISE IS A DISCOVERY of hitherto unknown effects of well known natural laws, which are always active in the ordinary progress of physical life.</p>
                  <p>DURING THE SEVEN YEARS that the Electropoise has been before the public, it has been met by criticism and disbelief, which it has answered by facts and cures of the most remarkable and permanent character, and has made its way, step by step, until probably 12,000 persons in New England alone have made use of it with greater or less success, according to the faithfulness and perseverance of using.</p>
                  <p>THE UNANSWERABLE PROOF of the extraordinary success of this treatment is furnished by the endorsement of its patrons, among whom will be found judges, lawyers, clergymen, physicians, professors, business men, and many others, whose names would be given only on account of exceeding merit.</p>
                  <p>The following extract is from <corr sic="an">an</corr>editorial in the "Christian Witness" of September 3, 1891, by Rev. Dr. McDonald, editor:</p>
                  <p>"AND NOW, AFTER A YEAR, we have this to say in its favor: (1) We have taken no medicine for the year. (2) All traces of la grippe and our old sunstroke troubles have disappeared, and no symptoms of either remain. Once or twice, from severe overwork, we have found it necessary to hold up for a few days, but in no time for fifteen years have we been better than during the past year.</p>
                  <p>"We have seen testimonials of most remarkable cures, and they can be seen by calling on the agent, 36 Bromfield street.</p>
                  <p>"This notice of the 'Electropoise' is without solicitation and entirely gratuitous. We do it for the good of the afflicted. We have no personal interest in it, and are not paid for what we say in its favor."</p>
                  <p>Another writes:</p>
                  <p>"I SOUGHT THE AID OF A DOZEN of the best physicians I could find, but they helped me very little. I also tried Compound Oxygen thoroughly, and the electric battery, but they helped me very little. On December 17, 1891,  commenced using the Electropoise and continued it about four months. During this time my disabilities were greatly removed. In this course of year from the time I commenced using it, I enjoyed almost perfect health, which has continued to this date. I know persons who were afflicted with quinsy sore throat, rheumatism, general debility, nervous prostration, and liver trouble, who have been greatly helped by it. It have great faith in it.</p>

                  <p>The war was over. Peace and quiet were restored to Northern homes. But what of our brother? He has his freedom and that is all. Willing hearts and hands came to his aid, and schools were soon established by the government.</p>
                  <p>In a home in New York a young girl was sitting one day, looking very thoughtful.</p>
                  <p>"Mother," she said, "I believe I'll go south and teach in a Freedman's school."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, my child; if you feel called to that work, go," her mother replied.</p>
                  <p>Ellen was only eighteen, but her clear brown eyes showed that her purpose was a fixed one. Her mother looked up, as she spoke, and noted that the color in her daughter's cheeks had deepened into a crimson. Then she felt and knew that the call had been given.</p>
                  <p>"God's ways are mysterious, and past finding out," she thought, but said nothing.</p>
                  <p>Ellen Dungee was one of a large family of children. Her parents were religious, and the
<pb n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
father, a minister, and a good, pious man, who "loved his neighbor as himself," gave his consent to her mission. Preparations were made for her starting. Their friend, Frederick Douglass, readily gave a recommendation to the brave young girl.</p>
                  <p>As money was needed for the long journey, Ellen, who possessed a musical soprano voice, in connection with other friends gave concerts throughout the state, also in New Jersey. But a strange fact always presented itself to her mind, that, although the Music Hall would usually be filled, or the church in which the concert was given be crowded, the receipts would never amount to more than three or four dollars over the expenses. Alas! who can tell? Certainly, Uncle Josh and Uncle Jerry never did tell; and if not they, who could, for were they not the doorkeepers?</p>
                  <p>Ellen visited her aunt in New Jersey a few weeks. Her uncle, a man well to do and owning considerable property, was one of the close fisted kind. We have all met him.</p>
                  <p>"Well, niece, I hear you are going south to teach the Freedmen," he said, at parting. Ellen's heart beat faster in anticipation, and the color rose to her cheeks. "Here is it present for you.; it will help you along a bit." And he handed her two rustling paper dollars. Ellen's countenance fell, but she thanked him. She had enough money for her traveling expenses, so she said her prayers with a light heart that night.</p>
                  <p>And now she must say goodbye to her home, her kindred, and all that were most dear, and turn her face toward a strange land, as it were. But her heart was brave, and her trust in God was strong.</p>
                  <p>From New Jersey she went to Cincinnati and took the boat to Louisville. Here it was that Ellen first feel the difference between the north and the south. Living far away, the war seemed like a dream, but here was it stern reality. She stopped at the teachers' home, which was guarded by soldiers.</p>
                  <p>"How shall I reach my school?" Ellen inquired of Colonel Caxton, the next day.</p>
                  <p>"I will escort you there, my young lady," the Colonel replied, as it is too far for you to go alone."</p>
                  <p>The next day how the rain did pour! But the Colonel and Ellen started in spite of the rain. A few miles on the railroad, and they stopped at a little country town.</p>
                  <p>The tavern was the principal lounging place for the villagers and all who came to hear the news. Dogs and children seemed to have the right of way.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel returned to the city and Ellen was left alone. No one spoke to her; no one offered her food. A, colored man and his wife were working around the kitchen. They dared not. There she sat, hungry, tired and heartsick, all that dreary day. And the rain poured down.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, for one word of human sympathy! If some one would only speak to me!" thought the poor girl. But the steady drip, drip of the rain was the only response.</p>
                  <p>That evening the school was to be organized, and someone was sent for Ellen. The little church, where they were going, was a long distance out on the pike. Still it rained, and all was mud. That muddy, clayey road! Will she ever forget it?</p>
                  <p>Arriving at the church she was treated with great respect by the people who had gathered there. The organization went on quietly, when suddenly from the outside a stone was hurled through the window, then another, and another, 
until most of the window panes were broken. Then shots were fired in-quick succession.</p>
                  <p>Ellen looked at the stalwart men, whose faces were blanched with fear, but not one of them stirred. Her blood boiled with indignation. She could not understand it then. She did ere long. Who will take the teacher to board?</p>
                  <p>The question was put, but no one answered. At last a brave little woman spoke up and said, "I will. She is welcome to come and stay at my house." So that night poor, tired Ellen rested comfortably in Aunt Ann's soft featherbed.</p>
                  <p>The plain little schoolhouse was soon filled with the bright earnest faces of children. And what a hive of industry it soon became! Ellen soon learned to love her work and gained the hearts of all the people. But her life was not all sunshine -- ah, no!</p>
                  <p>"Tell Uncle Mose to be on his guard tonight. The Ku Klux are around," a neighbor would whisper, one day. "They are after the teacher. They say she must go."</p>
                  <p>That night there was not much sleep at Aunt Ann's humble cottage. Before the fire were sitting Uncle Mose and three or four men who had offered their assistance in case of trouble. There they sat dozing, with their guns ready at a moment's warning.</p>
                  <pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>Will they fight? Yes, to the death. For is not all that they hold most dear under this roof and their protection? The women and children were gathered in a back room.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly Uncle Moses awoke. He listened intently, his face turned to an ashen hue.</p>
                  <p>"Tom," he whispered to a young man next to him, a very Hercules of strength, "they're coming."</p>
                  <p>Tom sat up. Faintly in the distance could be heard the sound of horses' hoofs rapidly approaching. Tom set his teeth. No coward was he. Hastily awakening the others, he prepared for the coming danger. He smiled as the sounds drew nearer. Afraid? No! Did a Spartan ever know fear? Did Leonidas at the pass of Thermopylae know fear?</p>
                  <p>As they felt the nearness of the enemy, they all with one accord aimed at the door. Suddenly a volley of shots was fired, which was returned with equal velocity. Then there was a silence.</p>
                  <p>"Are they gone, Tom?" whispered Uncle Mose.</p>
                  <p>"I am going to see," said Tom, as he smiled grimly to himself.</p>
                  <p>He went outside, and returned with something in his hand.</p>
                  <p>"What is it, Tom? " and Uncle Moses' voice shook.</p>
                  <p>"A note of warning, signed 'K. K. K.' We all know what that means, sighed Tom. "She will have to go."</p>
                  <p>The next morning they gave Ellen the warning, and there were tears in Uncle Moses' eyes as he handed it to her. But Tom gritted his teeth. Ellen read the note, and as they all watched her breathlessly, she said, "They say if I do not leave in twenty-four hours they will burn the schoolhouse over my head."</p>
                  <p>"Child, you must go," said Aunt Ann.</p>
                  <p>Ellen sat silently, and after a few thoughtful moments, she said in her quiet manner, and with a look of resolve upon her face, "Uncle Mose and Aunt Ann, as long as you will give me shelter, I will stay."</p>
                  <p>Tom's face beamed. He loved courage, and he quietly applauded the little school teacher.</p>
                  <p>"Honey," said Uncle Mose, with streaming eyes, "as long as we have a roof over our heads, you shall share it with us." And he and Aunt Ann joined hands and bowed their heads in prayer.</p>
                  <p>It was a beautiful Saturday morning. The sun shone bright and the air was fresh and balmy.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Ann," said Ellen, "I believe I'll go over to Eliza and the children, as I have promised her so often to make her a visit, and today is so pleasant."</p>
                  <p>"Child, don't go today," said Aunt Ann. "I have had a warning."</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense, Aunt Ann!" Your warnings are just bad dreams, that's all."</p>
                  <p>But Aunt Ann shook her head sadly. Ellen felt her spirits rise, in spite of the night before, so she went along quietly, listening to herself. Her path lay through a dense growth of trees and underbrush. About half way through the woods and she stopped. The air was still; not a sound could be heard; not even a leaf stirred. She listened. A feeling of deep fear came over her, as she remembered that not long since a man had been found not far from this very spot, shot through the heart. He had been warned by the Ku Klux. This feeling was not to be shaken off, and she slowly retraced her steps.</p>
                  <p>Was it Aunt Ann's warning? Did Aunt Ann possess that same power that caused "Old Allan-Bane" to foretell the coming of the Knight of Snowdoun, James Fitz-James?</p>
                  <p>On Sunday Ellen met all her pupils in the Sabbath School. They were all there, over fifty of them, from the little tot on up to those who were entering manhood and womanhood. How their songs did ring out! And with what zeal they studied their Bible lesson! Today we are trying to teach the necessity of the virtues of honesty, thrift and economy. What book teaches these better than the Bible? Look at the honest, rugged character of the Scoth, and what people know their Bibles better?</p>
                  <p>Monday morning, Ellen started for school as usual. It was about two miles away, and as most of the children came from five to six miles from their homes, she met them on the way. They walked on talking pleasantly of home affairs, but as they were turning a road that led to the schoolhouse they saw a dense smoke ascending.</p>
                  <p>Ellen's heart failed her. A boy came running to her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Miss Ellen," he said, "our schoolhouse is all burned!"</p>
                  <p>When Ellen reached the spot she found the children standing round crying, and the schoolhouse was in ashes. Ellen tried to comfort them, but her heart was too heavy, so she wept with them. She sent a dispatch to Colonel Caxton the same day, but it was intercepted.</p>
                  <p>She now felt that the time had come for her to
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
go. And how they all did gather around her at the parting! Strong men wept, and the children clang to her. It was more sad than a funeral. Uncle Moses and Aunt Ann gave her their blessing, and as the train steamed up, she tore herself away. The children waved their hands until the train was lost to their view.</p>

                  <p>One more club report and the work of the year will be completed. With the coming election of new officers for another year will come, no doubt, new plans and ways and means for renewed effort in the immediate work of the club as well as its auxiliaries.</p>
                  <p>During the year, in devising plans by which the club might reach the people of the town of Tuskegee to lift them to a higher moral atmosphere in church life, a plan was hit upon whereby members of the club became interested and three ladies, Mrs. Sara Peake Greene, Miss Mary Melvin and Mrs. Estelle Penny, have accomplished much. The work of the latter in her club of Ministers' Wives has been reported during the year. The work of the former has been miscellaneous, but will be reported with the year's report of the club work.</p>
                  <p>The departments of the club are not growing aweary in well doing. The monthly reports of the Vesta Club, Current History, Ministers' Wives, W.C.T.U., Women's Conference, Band of Mercy, social purity clubs, Dorcas Society and the Ednah Cheney are cheering. One of the charges of the Ednah Cheney was laid to rest by them on the 14th. The tried old Christian, who had been cradled in slavery, beaten and crippled by her cruel taskmasters, and deserted in her aged helplessness by her relatives, has been tenderly cared for by the members of the Ednah Cheney for a year.</p>
                  <p>"The Negro in Business" was the subject for discussion on the evening of March 20. Miss Sara Hunt read a paper that gave in a witty way a clear description of the average Afro-American in business. Quite an interesting discussion was provoked and the general opinion expressed was that the average business man needs more promptness and attention in his dealings with others, while those of his own race, who are liberal in giving their patronage, should not expect more indulgence in matters of weight, length and time than they would from their business brothers in white.</p>
                  <p>"The Negro in Politics" was the subject of a paper by Miss M. Childs, who opened the discussion on the evening of April 3. The writer agreed with others of the club that the future of the Afro-American in politics should depend upon his thoughtful consideration of a platform -- Free Coinage, Bimetalism, or what not, and not on the old question of obligation for certain liberty that was merely one of the results of the late unpleasantness.</p>
                  <p>The president made a vigorous appeal for our club organ, the ERA. The club decided to pay for twenty copies each month and the presidents of club departments promised to interest their members in the purchase of a certain number of copies monthly. We hope to swell the order to fifty copies.</p>

                  <p>Services in memory of the late James Hawley were held recently in St. Paul Episcopal Church, Portland, Me. Mr. Hawley was for many years an honored member of this church. The services, conducted by Rev. Joseph Shepherd, pastor of the church, consisted of morning prayer, singing and an address from the text, "Be thou faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life." The church was filled with citizen friends and members of the Bosworth Post G.A.R., of which the deceased was an old member.</p>
                  <p>The hymns sung were "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and "Soldiers of Christ, Arise."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. A.C. Sparrow, who went down to be present at the meeting, writes: "It was evident that the service was strange to most of the veterans present, but, at the first stanza of that material hymn, every man rose to his feet as if in answer to a call to defend the cross of Christ . . . His was the burial of a soldier and a Christian.</p>
                  <p>"And this is the lesson of it all to me. Mr. Hawley's life being what it was in the community where he lived and worked so impressed itself as to gain not only the respect but the tenderest love both for himself and family, as many a tearful eye gave evidence."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hawley leaves a devoted family, consisting of a wife, two daughters and a son, to whom the warmest sympathy of a large circle of friends all over the Union is extended.</p>

Mrs. Williams leaves Chicago May 25 on a lecture tour to extend from Boston to Minneapolis. She will speak in Boston under the auspices of the WOMAN'S ERA, and many clubs in the Massachusetts State Federation will be represented in the audience, which will turn out to see and hear this erstwhile bone of contention in the Chicago Woman's Club.

                  </p>
                  <p>Dear Madam: -- We, the members of the Ada Sweet Club of this city, earnestly desire that the National Federation of Afro-American Women meet in this city for the convention appointed for July, 1896, for various and sufficient reasons. Among these are that the national meetings of societies of our race have usually met in the eastern and southern sections of our country, and an expression on the part of the various societies composing the newest Federation would greatly increase the desire for development and progress on the part of the people of our section, which would mean no small amount of much needed co-operation.</p>
                  <p>The advantages to be gained by such a meeting in this place are all those which can be obtained from an encouraged and already anxious people, whose thoughts are for the upbuilding of our generation and coming generations, united with the unanimous support of a wealthy and benevolent white population.</p>
                  <p>Any influence that you may use to bring the success of our effort we feel will greatly repay you and help all concerned.</p>
                  <p>Hoping to receive a favorable expression and earnest support from you, I am</p>
                  <salute>Yours respectfully,</salute>

                  <p>The club has made application to enter the National Federation of Afro-American Women and will be represented at the annual meeting in July.</p>

                  <p>For the benefit of the clubs in the National Federation, the corresponding secretary publishes this mouth a list of the clubs in the Federation, with names of presidents and secretaries.</p>
                  <p>For many reasons the list is not complete, clubs often omitting to send names and addresses of both president and secretary, and in some cases send names of recording instead of corresponding secretary.</p>
                  <p>For the convenience of the secretary all clubs in the Federation, that have not as yet done so, are requested to fill out application blanks at once and forward them. These blanks are the most convenient form for registering the facts.</p>

                  <p>One of the matters to come before the Federation is the founding of an orphan's home as a monument to John Brown. This matter is spoken of in Miss Matthews' letter, but the following article will explain it more fully and is published now that intelligent action may be taken upon it at the time of the convention:</p>
                  <p>For many years I have been deeply interested in the life, character and great deeds of our illustrious martyr, John Brown, and, in the long list of names of persons who have suffered and died in the cause of freedom, find there is not one who was as Christ-like as he. His boldness and willingness to be sacrificed for the deliverance of the oppressed is marvelous, and historic facts prove conclusively that the Harper's Ferry insurrection was the prologue to the national tragedy which resulted in
<pb n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the ensanguined washing away of that hideous blot, human slavery, from our country's otherwise fair escutcheon.</p>
                  <p>Mark well the continued train of events.</p>
                  <p>John Brown's insurrection and his ignominious death occurred in 1859; in 1860 the Republican party was born and Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States; he was inaugurated in 1861; secession followed, and the establishment of a Southern Confederacy, with slavery as its chief cornerstone, was attempted; in September, 1862, President Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect in January, 1863; in 1864 the colored troops fought nobly, and in 1865 "Old Glory" floated over our reunited country.</p>
                  <p>Thirty-five years have elapsed since the curtain was rung up for the prologue in which the martyred hero, John Brown, like Arnold Winklereid, "made way for liberty," and twenty-nine years have passed since the curtain fell on the last act of the tragedy, and yet the people of this country, which may now hold up its head among the nations and boast of being "The Land of the Free," have not honored the hero of the prologue with a "curtain call." Even the 8,000,000 of Afro-Americans, for whom John Brown gave up his life and also the lives of four of his sons, have not, hitherto, conceived the grand and glorious idea of erecting a monument to mark the grave where this martyred hero lies buried. Not unwept, not unhonored, not unsung, but still in a neglected and sunken grave at North Elba, N.Y.</p>
                  <p>The John Brown Monument Association, which was organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota, August 17, 1894, for the purpose of erecting a marble shaft over his neglected grave, have changed their plans, for after I visited the Women's National Congress at Atlanta, Ga., and spoke on the subject, "Should Afro-Americans honor John Brown?" that intelligent body, after considering the needs and conditions of our race in the Southland, decided to help this association to honor him by the erection of an orphan's home in his memory somewhere in the Southland, and efforts are being made now to raise funds for this purpose. If the movement is successful, whatever credit is due must be bestowed proportionately upon all Afro-American citizens, and we feel assured that there is not an Afro-American in this country who would not help to honor our dear old hero, John Brown, by giving something for this worthy cause; for, after his arrest, imprisonment and conviction, yet on the march to the scaffold, he paid the last benediction to our race when he stopped to kiss the Negro child. And my prayer is that the hearts of every Afro-American of this country may be united to show their gratitude to this martyr by helping to erect an orphan's home to the memory of John Brown, the grandest warrior that ever buckled on a sword, and the greatest hero of the nineteenth century.</p>

As will be seen by Mrs. G.'s letter, the matter now rests with the authorities who shall be in power when the Nashville Centennial takes place.</p>

                  <p>N.B. -- I waited to receive the "definite reply," but heard nothing from the officers of the National League. When I reached Washington, D.C., May 1, I was informed by disinterested parties of the announcement in the <hi rend="italic">Colored American</hi>. It seemed incredible. After assuring myself that the information was correct, I made all haste to make up for lost time by accepting the natural logic of such maneuvering. Washington was chosen as the place for the First Annual Convention of the National Federation of Afro-American Women on account of the "cut rates" that city for the month of July. A committee was appointed to secure a place of meeting and make proper arrangements for the comfort of delegates. As the "cut rates" extend over the entire month of July, providing the tickets are deposited with the company's agent on or before July 14, and for other reasonable considerations, the date was fixed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, July 20, 21, 22, the meeting to take place at the 19th Street Baptist Church. All clubs are hereby notified to rally their members to the support of the National Federation of Afro-American Women. We cheerfully submit the objects of our organiza-

tion and our methods of work to all broad-minded women. We invite their co-operation.</p>
                  <p>Beside the very important work required to perfect our organization and the enacting of such laws as will place it on a par with similar bodies, three very grave questions will be brought before the convention, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>,</p>
                  <p>(1) The part the Afro-American women shall take in the great Paris exposition.</p>
                  <p>(2) The advocacy of the placing of first and second class coaches on the lines of railroads operating under the separate "coach law."</p>
                  <p>(3) The necessity for active interest in the "John Brown Home Farm" for refractory and delinquent children. It will be remembered this association was incorporated as the John Brown Monument Association of St. Paul, Minn. Its president, Mrs. T.H. Lyles, after conferring with other leading women, accepted the proposition made at Atlanta that such an institution as above mentioned was more needed than a marble shaft or other sculptured memorial. It was decided to invite the women of the entire country to become interested; further, that the memorial farm should go to that section which succeeded in raising the most money. Acting upon this the magnanimous women of St. Paul, under the leadership of their noble, great-hearted president, consented to a revocation of the original charter and the securing of a new one which should cover the above object; and the fund hitherto raised will or rather has been deposited with the proper authorities for the founding and maintaining of a home farm for refractory children, said institution to be a memorial to John Brown.</p>
                  <p>In union there is strength, so we cordially invite all women to attend the coming convention on the date given above. All woman's clubs and societies, religious or secular, are most cordially invited to attend. An invitation is herewith extended till clubs or societies desirous of joining the Federation to come in now. There is as yet no tax for membership, but will in all probability be one after the convention. Any club may become a member by filling out the following application and forwarding the same to the National secretary.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. T.H. Lyles, national president of the John Brown Monument Association and one of St. Paul's leading citizens, who is always doing something for the upbuilding and advancement of her fellowmen, invited a number of ladies to her beautiful residence, 782 Selby avenue, on last Monday afternoon, April 20, for the purpose of' organizing two clubs for intellectual, moral and temperance work. The result of the meeting was the organization of the above-named club, with twenty-five charter members and the following officers: Mrs. T.H. Lyles, president; Mrs. F. Huston, 1st vice-president; Nlrs. F.H. Griswold, 2d vice-president; Mrs. NeIlie Griswold Francis, secretary; Mrs. M.D. Pettis, cor. secretary; Miss Lizzie Anderson, fin. secretary; Mrs. W.B.

                  <p>It is well that we should realize and express our appreciation for the splendid and tireless work done by Mrs. Victoria Matthews, as the chairman of the executive committee of the N.F.A.A.W. Without the aid of any financial appropriation, through long and expensive trips, unceasing correspondence, much thought and much talk, Mrs. Matthews has made and developed plans, aroused and sustained enthusiasm, and now as the time of the annual convention approaches, places the Federation, its aims, its scope, before the world in the dignified, earnest attitude, which is impressive and convincing.</p>
                  <p>The Federation in its first year has grown rapidly in number and strong in enthusiasm. At the dissolution of the first convention there was little -- in fact, nothing of a material nature to bind the forces together. The organization itself was not even complete, and but for the devotion and earnestness of the president, Mrs. Washington, and that of Mrs. Matthews, the Federation would hardly have found itself where it is today.</p>
                  <p rend="divider"/>
                  <p>The cordial invitation of the Ada Sweet Club of Minneapolis, published elsewhere, to the convention to meet in that city, was received with much gratification. It came, however, after arrangements had been perfected for a meeting in Washington. In hospitable western style the club offered to bear all expenses, and offered such alluring prospects as to cause us a pang, before relinquishing the idea of accepting it. The Ada Sweet Club is of recent fruition, but full of life and enthusiasm. May the invitation hold good for another year, and may our officers have a leaning toward the west.</p>

                  <p>BOSTON.</p>
                  <p>Anniversary week this year is looked forward to with even greater interest than usual by members of the Era Club. It is expected that Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. F.B. Williams and Mrs. R.H. Terrell will be in the city at that time. Mrs. Matthews comes from New York for a talk with the New England presidents of clubs in the National Federation, over the program of work for the annual meeting. Mrs. Williams comes to lecture and be present as speaker at one or more of the meetings of that week. If Mrs. Terrell is present she will also be heard from some of the platforms. Much interest is expressed to hear both of these ladies by members of the Massachusetts State Federation. One is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Mrs. Williams of the Chicago Woman's Club, while Mrs. Terrell, beside being one of the only two women ever honored with an appointment as public school supervisor in Washington, is said to be an eloquent platform speaker. The visiting ladies will be guests at the suffrage banquet in Music Hall and other festivities. The Era Club will take advantage of the presence in the city of so many of the co-editors of their club paper to tender a reception to them.</p>
                  <p>Boston people are to have an acquisition in the persons of Miss Alice Ruth Moore and her sister, who will come to Boston in June, Miss Moore as the wife of Mr. Young, the Cambridge caterer, and Miss Alice Ruth, who comes to enter Radcliffe. The gifts of the latter young lady are known to us all, and it is hoped and expected that her promise in a literary way will develop under such favorable conditions into a rich fruitfulness.</p>
                  <p>The Easter ball, managed by Mrs. J.H. Lewis, brought out a large crowd. Copley Hall was idealic in its rich decoration, and everything went off with much spirit.</p>
                  <p>Miss Kate Smith, of Brooklyn, came on to the ball, and stayed over a few days to some minor festivities.</p>
                  <p>The death of Miss May Rice of Newport was not unexpected, though just as sad to her many friends. She was a girl of especial sweetness of looks and character, and her mother, who has passed through similar experiences many times, has the sympathy of a large circle of friends.</p>
                  <p>Messrs. Fred. Dickerson and Stanley Ruffin
<pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
went down to Newport to the funeral of Miss Rice.</p>
                  <p>Mr. W. Appo Johnson, after a relapse of a few days, has recovered sufficiently to return to his home in Washington.</p>
                  <p>Misses Eva Lewis, Pauline Hopkins, Medora Gould and Louisa Lewis are filling comfortable and lucrative positions in the new State House; and the Bulfinch front will remain intact.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Elizabeth (Johnson) Tatum, who was compelled by failing health to resign a most desirable position with Balch Brothers, publishers, having recovered her health, has returned to her old place, to the great satisfaction of her employers and friends.</p>
                  <p>Delegates from nearly all of the colleges in the Massachusetts Intercollegiate Prohibition Association were present at the annual convention of the association, which met in the Y.M.C.A. building in Worcester, Mass., April 24. At the evening session interest centered in the intercollegiate oratorical contest. The judges unanimously awarded the prize to Charles S. Morris, Frederick Douglass' grandson-in-law, and he received the twenty-five dollars in gold, and will be sent to Cleveland to represent Massachusetts in the national convention.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Grant held the Winning number in the birthday cake at Sister Catherine's bag party the other evening, but although the doctor walked off with the silver candlestick, the representative of the ERA took the cake, and has been enjoying it 
ever since.</p>
                  <p>Miss Bessie Baker was one of a large class confirmed at St. John P.E. church, Wednesday evening, May 13.</p>
                  <p>The Rev. Wm. H. Scott has resigned the pastorate of Calvary Baptist Church and will enter the political arena, it is said. The reverend gentleman has one requisite for a good campaign orator, a voice that can compel a hearing.</p>
                  <p>T.T. Fortune, the <hi rend="italic">N.Y. Age</hi> editor, is still traveling around with his Afro-American chip on his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>Miss Bertha Williams of Chicago is a notary public, a graduated stenographer, and runs a successful typewriting establishment on 27th street, Chicago. She is 22 years old.</p>
                  <p>Miss Annie Blanchard of Salem, Mass., after a year's special training in Christian missionary work at the Northfield Training School, has been teaching through the winter in the State Industrial Normal College, Tallehassie, Fla. Miss Blanchard writes enthusiastically of her work in the academic department, of the climate and. the people. Of the fragrance and luxuriance of the flora of that section we can testify from receipt of a bountiful box of choicest blossoms sent by Miss Blanchard to this office at Easter time.</p>
                  <p>Secure your tickets early for Mrs. Williams lecture. The gathering on that occasion will afford an opportunity for meeting some of the most intellectual, philanthropic and charitable women New England can produce.</p>
                  <p>The members of Co. L, 6th Reg't, recently presented a check for $200 to the Sisters of St. Margaret, for the special work of St. Monica's Home. This is the proceeds of the concert given for the benefit of the home by charitable Co. L, led by their handsome young captain.</p>
                  <p>The series of concerts projected by Miss R.M. Washington for the amusement of the aged inmates of the home on Myrtle street has been a most pleasing success in every way. The thirteenth in the series, under the direction of Mr. G.L. Ruffin, was "An Evening with Longfellow," with readings by his daughter, Miss Alice Longfellow, and singing by Miss Ayers, Mr. Ruffin and his choir of boys from St. Augustine P.E. Church. Nearly all of the selections were from the poet's works, and a fine engraving of him on the cover made of the program a desirable souvenir.</p>
                  <p>The 14th and closing concert was carried on by Miss Washington herself, who opened with a brief paper on the "Foundation of the Musicales." She also read a letter of thanks from Miss Lucy Parsons of Beacon street, secretary for directors of the home, thanking all who had contributed to the success of the entertainments. The musical part of the program for this evening was rendered by Mrs. A.C. Sparrow, Mrs. G.C. Harris, Mr. W.H. Nott, vocalists, and Miss S. Shepherd and Mr. Franklin, pianists. Miss Washington introduced a new aspirant for historic honors in the person of Miss Harriet Latimer, who recited with dramatic effect in a voice of so much natural sweetness and beauty as to make one feel that a ripe field awaits Miss Latimer as reader among refined, sensitive invalids. There the other ways of using a sweet voice to financial advantage besides singing and reciting on a stage. By the thoughtful

                     <p>Though the air is ripe with the political situation, and men, women and children think, talk or concern themselves with little else beside the discussion of parties in the municipal fight, yet the Woman's Club found time, in the midst of
the turmoil, to hold its regular April meeting.</p>
                     <p>There were many things brought before the house. The committee having in charge the affair of the ward in the Charity Hospital reported the result of their interviews with Dr. Lewis and Mother Agnes. It was found that under no circumstances whatever would colored doctors be permitted to practise in the hospital, but the women of club were urged, as they loved and respected the unfortunates of their race and sex, to hasten in their work of endowing the special ward. Each member of the club pledged herself to raise a certain amount by a fixed date, and it is hoped to complete the arrangements by June.</p>
                     <p>Dr. L.A. Martinet, who was to have lectured on "The Legal Status of Women," in Louisiana, was detained by a political caucus, but promised to hold good his engagement "after election," the refrain of all promises made these days.</p>
                     <p>It was, perhaps, significant that in the second day's session of the annual convention of the Woman's Relief Corps, department of Louisiana and Mississippi, that the prayer should be offered, "that our husbands, brothers, fathers and sweethearts may do their duty Tuesday as true citizens and men." It is still more significant to notice how much the public opinion of the colored women has had to do with turning the tide of political opinion this way or that; so much so that one of the subterfuges adopted by an unpopular faction to catch the Afro-American vote was the opening of a new public school in the rear of the Third Ward.</p>
                     <p>The W.A.C. Convention was held Friday and Saturday, that is, all business transaction, elections, etc., were completed late Friday night, leaving Saturday afternoon and evening for installations, talks from the Commander of the N.A.A. and officers, and the banquet. At the Friday session Miss Henrietta Vinton Davis, the reader, was present by virtue of her interest and membership in the order, and spoke in quite a captivating manner for several minutes. On Saturday the pleasantest feature of the day's proceedings was the presentation of a gold and silver cup and saucer to the out-going president; Mrs. Josephine B. Lewis, who had held the office for six years. It was a touching scene and one that will long be remembered.</p>
                     <p>The officers elected for the ensuing year are, Mrs. Selina B. Gray, department president; Mrs. J.H. Taper, senior vice; Mrs. May B. Williams, junior vice; Mrs. Lavinia Dubose, dept. treasurer; Mrs. Victoria Johnson, dept. chaplain; Mrs. Louisa Mouton, dept. inspector; Mrs. L. Porche, Baton Rouge, instituting and installing officer; Mrs. D. Swan, counselor; Alice Ruth Moore, dept. secretary; delegate at large, Mrs. Laura Remage of Jennings, La.; alternate, Mrs. Carrie Devezin.</p>
                     <p>The department of Louisiana and Mississippi is unique in more respects than one, It has come up out of hardships, trials, sneers and opposition, through sheer force of energy and stick-to-a-tiveness, and in all the immense National organization of W.R.C. it is the only colored department. In the two states there is but one white corps, that at Jennings, La., a little settlement of northerners who are fighting bravely to preserve their individuality in the face of southern prejudice and sneers. A delegate from this department to the National Convention always has eyes turned upon her from the very strangeness of her representation and the stern labor that her badge represents.</p>
                     <p>So much has been said and written about the

musical prodigy, Eddie Moore, whom the New Orleans people had sent to Germany to study, that almost everyone must feel an interest in his welfare. It was a great undertaking for a committee of women and men to take in charge, with no capital or backing save abundant energy and a cheerful determination to accomplish what they had set out to do. There has been no rest for four years, and it seemed that the fruition of their labors was at hand. Eddie had been sent to Stuttgart, his passage paid, his piano purchased, and twice a year the tuition and other incidentals paid. He completed the regular course last summer, and as his health was poor was begged to return. But he pleaded for another year, in order to acquire a repertoire that his friends might be justly proud of his playing. The graduation was to have been in June, and July would have seen Eddie in New Orleans, when a short while ago a letter from the American Consul to Professor Nickerson announced the child's death. It was a cruel blow to his mother, his friends, and to the entire community who had builded such bright hopes upon this young musician who was to be forever an example of New Orleans grit and benevolence. It seems an irreparable loss; a loss in which all members of the race must feel a part. It brings tears to the eyes to think of the slender little follow, whose hands were small and waxen as a girls, asleep beneath the cold German skies, thousands f miles from home, old friends and his mother. But it was God's will.</p>
                     <p>The Teachers' League has in rehearsal a drama, "Doomed for Life," to be presented at Globe Hall on the 15th of May. It is a production from the pen of Mr. Alcest Campbell, a promising and popular young man of Opelousas, La., who is now in the city superintending the rehearsals. Front all accounts, the production promises to be an artistic success.</p>
                     <p>And the weddings! Every other girl in town is going to be married "as soon as the school term closes." Some can't wait until then but are going to rush off in the lucky month -- June. Next to politics, the most talked of thing is weddings and wedding garb and gossip.</p>

                     <p>THE INFLUENCE OF ART ON HOME LIFE.</p>
                     <p>"Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not." -- Emerson.</p>
                     <p>How much inspiration the artist finds in the things that are of every day interest to all of us. We may now rejoice in the fact that the great pictures are not, as they once were, walled in from the gaze of the common people, but can be seen in copies and obtained at prices lower than we often pay for the most ordinary things in use. In fact, art seems as eager to come to us as we are to be influenced by its ministerings. Beside, the great artists of today gladly loan their choicest productions to gratify the taste of every art-loving community.</p>
                     <p>What does this growing prevalence of art influence mean to our home life? I think it is not too much to say that art inspires every sanctity of feeling that lifts women from drudgery to loveliness; that makes men more chivalrous, and children more beautiful. Among the Greeks from whom we inherit everything that is perfect and of good taste in art, there was in every home a household god that watched over the destinies of the family. We might, with profit, borrow from this religious sense of the Greeks, the suggestion that art, in the form of sculpture, painting, etching, or engraving, may furnish each household amongst us some hero or heroine or sentiment that shall be to us the saving influence of home blessedness.</p>
                     <p>How much the pictured face of that divinest of all madonnas, the Cistine, on our walls, would minister to the reign of love in every home! If mothers would teach their children to he gentle and humane, more effectively than by words, place on the wall for their inspection the kindly face of Rosa Bonheur, with her caressing arm about the neck of a domestic animal. And if they would inspire their daughters to be womanly and strong in all the virtues of perfect womanhood, place before them the faces of women who have done so much to glorify womankind. Let art also give to the boy's the inspiration and companionship of such heroes as John Brown, Phillips, Lincoln, Douglass, Edson and Watts.</p>
                     <p>What portraits do for some, all forms of the beautiful in art may do for all of us. Many of us
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
are never touched with the mystic beauty of a flower until art interprets it for us. It is said that the German poet, Schiller, never saw the ocean, and yet he described it with such power and accuracy that old seamen saw more in Schiller's verse than they had ever thought of in the overwhelming presence of the ocean itself.</p>
                     <p>Scientists tell us that there are melodies in the earth sweeter than the human ever has yet heard; that there are exquisite tints of color too delicate for discernment by the ordinary eye; and that there is a fragrance of the rose never yet extracted by the human sense of smell. Only the tiniest insects of God's great kingdom of life realize these hidden beauties of the universe. Thus it is the mission of the artist, with his finer sense, to reveal to us what we would fail to recognize with our ordinary senses.</p>
                     <p> *  *  *  *  *  *</p>
                     <p>The announcement by the chairman, Mrs. Matthews, of the Executive Committee of National Federation of Afro-American Women, in the last issue of the ERA, is a statement of extraordinary interest to the colored women of the country. Well may the chairman call the work before her "grave and serious." The thought of a Federation that shall embrace the best intelligence amongst the colored women of the country is an inspiring one and should bring to the amiable chairman a hearty co-operation. The bringing about of such a union is a work requiring infinite labor, patience, tact and good will. These federated interests are results of growth and development. It is only through the process of education and the force of example that these widely separated organizations are brought to see the power of union and feel the sweet spirit of helpful affiliation.</p>
                     <p>It was a distinct gain in the progressive life of American colored women when the first suggestion came at a gathering in Washington of our women from all parts of the country that the essential interests of one club were the identical interests of all clubs. It gave us our first bracing touch of self confidence and our first inspiration to the larger duties and responsibilities of American womanhood. From the time of this first note of sisterly interest of colored women in each other, the sentiment has grown to a point where it has become a "grave and serious work" as to how we may have one instead of several National organizations.</p>
                     <p>There is no concealing the fact that there was a wide spread feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment that the National Federation of Afro-American women organized in Boston did not achieve the wished for unity. This feeling was accentuated by the further failure of the Atlanta Congress in a similar purpose. The Boston and Atlanta conferences were remarkable in the number of capable women assembled. Nothing properly within the purposes of those gatherings seemed to be too large or too difficult to be grasped by these newly found women. The names of Mrs. Cook, Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Mrs. Ruffin, Mrs. Matthews and their associates have been and still are a guarantee that the interests of our women will be conscientiously and capably guarded and guided toward unity and high purposes.</p>
                     <p>The moral effect of the union of the National Colored Woman's League, the National Federation of Afro-American Women and the Atlanta Congress could not well be measured. Nothing would so thrill our women everywhere with the wholesome sense of importance and responsibility, and nothing could so quicken into practical helpfulness the sympathies of all women for each other as a well organized federation of the best intelligence and worth of our women.</p>
                     <p>With such women as leaders and with such high purposes for inspiration it ought to be possible to find a basis of union. Fortunately for us, the personal ambitions that have been so fatal to all the large efforts of our men are not dangers to be feared in our efforts toward unity. There seems to have been a most happy freedom from the petty jealousies and envies that inevitably wreck social organizations. To those of us on the outside, there seems to he nothing substantial, nothing reasonable and nothing conscionable that can stand between the necessity for union and its joyous consummation. The opportunity is at hand for admittedly capable women to organize one of the most interesting and important parliaments of women ever attempted for the social amelioration of womankind in this country.</p>
                     <p>Let us beware lest the strife for triumph obscure the larger claims of universal truth and righteousness.</p>

                  <p>The Great Mineral Basin it Pitkin covers an area as large as that of Leadville, Aspen and Red Cliff combined. Professor Sadtler, of the Chair of Metallurgy and Mineralogy of the State School of Mines, speaking of this district, says: "This camp, with proper and systematic development, will be made a second Aspen, if not better."</p>
                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>What, then, shall we expect of Pitkin and the Quartz Creek District, which has a mineral bearing area as large as these three districts combined, when so far the developments there have proved the mineral deposits to be fully as rich and extensive?</p>
                  <p>We can come to but one conclusion: Its wealth is limitless, and no more safe or profitable field for investment can be found.</p>
                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>The ore is high grade, netting from fifty to one thousand dollars per ton, average two hundred and fifty.

                  <p>There are in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut many good farms that can be purchased for a reasonable sum of money, and on easy terms of payment</p>
                  <p>We offer our assistance in aiding colored farmers to leave the South and to come and make their homes in the North.</p>
                  <p>We propose to procure farms in any of the above named states for as many of our race as desire, to come North and make their homes among us. We shall give them all the aid in our power, and be only too glad to look them over and see that they obtain all the advantages possible in the respective neighborhoods, until they become accustomed to their new homes and neighbors.</p>
                  <p>It is our intention in procuring these farms to have them near cities and towns in various states, so as to be convenient to school houses, railroard stations and churches.</p>
                  <p>The farms of the North differ from those of the South in that they are more compact, better cleared and attended to in general. Being smaller they are easier to care for. About anything that can be raised on farms in the South can be raised in the North.</p>
                  <p>On these farms are comfortable frame houses, cottage style. Terms of payment will be made to suit.</p>

                  <p>The most important feature of this number, after the programme of the three days' convention, will be the advertisements of men and women of business in the different cities. Many of the agents interested in this Souvenir, are asking for a whole page upon which to show up the successful business people of their section, and all are taking a local pride in the result. As this number is to have handsome covers, and fine cuts, it will be a lasting ornament, as well as a good business Directory for future reference. All our business people failing to be in evidence in this triumphant showing of successful effort, will have cause for regret when too late to remedy. All orders for space <hi rend="italic">must be in the Boston office by July 10th</hi>, to insure insertion ill this great <hi rend="italic">free</hi> edition. Among the cuts promised is one of Harriet Tubman, of the latest statue presented to the city of Boston, that of John Boyle O'Riley, and in reception of which Mayor Quincy said, "it is the fittest piece of sculpture erected in all Boston," of the building where the first convention of women was held in Boston, and the church where the first annual meeting will be held in Washington, in July.</p>

                  <p>The WOMAN'S ERA, now in its third year, is published monthly in Boston; it is the organ of the N.F. of A-A.W. which organization extends over a dozen states including fifty Clubs, whose united memberships reach far into the thousands.</p>
                  <p>At the first Annual Convention of this national organization to be held in Washington, D. C., July 20, 21, 22, the WOMAN'S ERA SOUVENIR NUMBER, will be distributed free, as it will also at the Christian Endeavor Convention, which immediately precedes this.</p>
                  <p>This number containing the Program of the Convention, many cuts of prominent people and places, original sketches and stories, will be a desirable Souvenir and consequently an unusually valuable advertising medium.</p>
                  <p>A mammoth edition will be issued and will not only be mailed its usual to regular subscribers, but will also be sent in large batches to local agents for FREE distribution in their respective localities and scattered broad cast among delegates and visitors at both conventions.</p>

                  <p>The Loyal Union of New Bedford has all the health and vigor of youth. We believe it was the fittest to respond financially. Its president, Mrs. Soulis came to Boston to help form the N.E. Federation and together with Miss Scarborough
will go as a delegate to Washington.</p>
                  <p>The women who will come together at Washington are representative in every way; north, south, east, and west will have full and intelligent representatives -- Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Dr. Butler, Mrs. Maples from the south, Mrs. Tyler, Mrs. Napier Kemp, Mrs. Wells Barnett from the west, Mrs. Dickinson, Mrs. Soulis from the east, and numbers of bright women from New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. This shows what the character of the prospective convention will be.</p>
                  <p>Beside the two delegates to be sent by the club (the president, Mrs. Ruffin, and the Secretary, Mrs. Hannah Smith,) six members will represent the club at their own expense. This is a good showing.</p>
                  <p>Since the last issue of the ERA several new clubs have applied for admission into the Federation. Among the number are the following: The "Ida B. Wells Club," Chicago, Ill. The "Woman's Club," Los Angeles, Cal. The Julia Hooks School, Memphis, Tenn. The Woman's Club, Buffalo, N.Y.</p>
                  <p>Clubs are requested to send their list of delegates with name of the delegate who is to make the club report to Mrs. Matthews, 9 Murray St., New York.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. R. Jerome Jeffrey, president of the Woman's Club of Rochester, N. Y., will represent that body at Washington.</p>
                  <p>All business men find women should advertise in the Souvenir number -- there will be a splendid showing by cities. Send your business cards at once. The Souvenir Number will he distributed free.</p>

                  <p>During the past winter, in Boston, there was organized and conducted a class for the study of the novel. A few of the best novels were selected and studied carefully, the aim being not quantity but quality. Each member of the class was given a set of questions on the novel to be taken up, to which answers were to be formed according to one's opinion after careful reading. These questions and answers were afterwards discussed in the class. The chief benefit derived from the study was through this discussion and being able to form and hold one's own opinion . The questions used in this class will be presented to the readers of the "ERA" from time to time as an incentive to pleasant and profitable study. No answers will be given, for many can simply be a matter of personal opinion.</p>

                  <p>The long anticipated lecture by Mrs. Williams of Chicago was given at Gilbert Hall, Tremont Temple on June 20. Mrs. Williams lectured on "The Strength and Weakness of the Christian Religion as Believed, Preached and Practised in the United States" and spoke in her usual thoughtful and finished style. Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney presided and the lecture was listened to by a fine sized audience. Unfortunately the afternoon selected was the one upon which the closing exercises of the "Perkins Institute for the Blind" was held; as this is one of the pet institutions of Boston it drew away a large number who would otherwise have attended the lecture, among them Mrs. Julia Ward Howe who personally expressed her disappointment at not being able to hear Mrs. Williams. On this afternoon also, the Cantabrigia Club held open house in Cambridge in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of that city. All these kept away a large number who met Mrs. Williams and regretted the circumstances which deprived them of the pleasure of hearing her.</p>

                  <p>The last week in May was a full and delightful one to Boston club women; the annual anniversaries which are a distinctive feature of New England life and work were carried on in the same quietly delightful way as usual, the intellectual features, were as ever faultless, the best minds in New England contributing to these occasions and, amid sunshine and flowers, music, wit, and beauty, yes <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi>, too, Anniversary Week of '96 took its place in the long line of anniversaries gone before.</p>
                  <p>The Woman's Era Club was fortunate in having in its midst, as guests of its president, Mrs Mathews of New York, Mrs. F.B. Williams of Chicago and Mrs. Dickerson of Newport. Each of the Iadies took part in one or more of the many intellectual gatherings of the week, Mrs. Williams being heard in a lecture in Tremont Temple, at one of' the suffrage meetings and at the Free Religious Banquet, where she and Mrs. Mathews were the guests of Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, while Mrs. Mathews was the speaker at a special called meeting in Charles St. Church, and at the Moral Educational Association meeting at Tremont Temple. All the visiting ladies were guests of Mrs. Ruffin at the Suffrage Banquet in Music Hall. Other social features were, the reception tendered the ladies by the Woman's Era Club at the house of the president. This was in every way a delightful success in spite of the throng which filled the house from chamber to basement, and overflowed on to the porch for air. There was some very fine vocal music by Mrs. A.C. Sparrow, musical director of the club, and recitations by Miss Florence Williams of Newton. The committee having the reception in charge took possession of the house early in the day and literally banked the parlors with potted plants, wild flowers and ferns. The following ladies served at the different tables: Mrs. E. Benjamin, ices and cake, Mrs. Bailey, lemonade and Mrs. Foster, frappe; Miss Eva Lewis, Mrs. Lottie Sampson, Mrs. Dandridge and Miss Etta Tolliver acted as ushers. Memorial day was spent in driving around beautiful Mt. Auburn visiting the tombs of distinguished dead. The last day the visitors were guests at the Cantabrigia Club Reception in the "Newtown Club House" and took part in the festivities consequent upon the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Cambridge as a city.</p>

                  <p>Our readers need not be told that the paper has been very irregular, doubtless, many of them have expressed their opinion of this irregularity in a more or less vigorous manner; however, we beg their favor and ask further indulgence. In attempting to do the work of the Federation and to adequately represent that body, the management took upon itself new and great responsibilities, and until the Federation has had its first convention and gets into better running order, everything concerned is necessarily more or less irregular. We know this condition is irritating but it is always one of the necessary <corr sic="concommittants"> concomitants</corr> of young and struggling institutions. With the Federation well started, with the work running smoothly so that workers will not be "run to death" and then criticised because some things have been omitted, we hope to do better things. Until that time we ask that indulgence which we are obliged to exercise in large measure in doing what we can in carrying on this work for our women and our race.</p>
                  <p>Institutions like the Federation, papers like the ERA, not only call for self-sacrifice, devotion and enthusiasm on the part of those who conduct, but also a large charity, patience, and sympathy on the part of those who "stand and wait."</p>

                     <p>That the Federation of colored women should have in one year grown to twice its original size, that it should awaken interest in, and receive responses from the women all over the country, speaks well, not only for the future of organized work among us, but also for the energy, intelligence and self-sacrifice of the officers.</p>
                     <p>The convention promises to be a remarkable one, not only for the characters of the women who will assemble and be represented, but also for the scope of the work which has been planned.</p>
                     <p>*      *      *      *      *      *  </p>
                     <p>The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the Separate Car Law, comes as a disappointment, but hardly as a surprise to millions of loyal American citizens.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denied that sentiment against the Negro and his rights is growing rapidly. As the black man acquires money and education new barriers are raised against him, sometimes old obstacles which pity for helplessness and ignorance caused to be removed are being rebuilt and it is only to a few enlightened minds that the cause of the Negro has any interest at all.</p>
                     <p>In time the problem must work itself, and in the meantime the Negro has got to make himself felt. There is no wisdom, virtue, policy or manhood in bearing everything put upon one. Appeals for justice by voice and pen go very little ways at present, practically no attention whatever is paid to them; the time is come when they must be backed by aggressive action and a physical as well as mental resistance to every abrogation of manhood rights.</p>
                     <p>If laws are unjust, they must be continually broken until they are killed or altered. The thing to do is to force the recognition of manhood by any and all means.</p>
                     <p>The heroes of the South who are meeting cowardly lynchers with a shotgun and the courage of true manhood, the men of the North as well as the South who are meeting insinuations against character and efforts to humiliate them with a strong and ready fist, are doing as much towards the forcing of a right condition as any. The world is turning a callous ear to appeals for justice; it is evident that the only way now to get what we want is to take it even if we have to break laws in getting it.</p>
                     <p rend="divider"/>
                     <p>The need of Christian homes for wayward and erring girls, will be an issue.</p>
                     <p>The Separate Car law will be generally discussed and drastic measures adopted for having it expunged from the Statute of the states in which the system operates, it is hoped.</p>
                     <p>Delegates to the convention are assured of a hearty welcome by the pastor and people of the19th St. Baptist Church, where the session will be held. This welcome will show itself in many substantial and pleasant forms. Among other things, the pastor, the Rev. Walter Brooks will give an address of welcome and the ladies of the church have offered themselves to serve luncheon to the delegates.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Answer</hi>: --- Until after the annual meeting of the Federation in Washington next month -- when it is expected some equable and uniform hasis of support for the official organ will he settled upon -- inquiring Club correspondents are referred to the answer made to the same question from the Los Angelos Club, in the May ERA.

                     <p>The last meeting of the season of the New England Women's Press Association took the form of a June outing at the Ocean Villa of Miss Floretta Vining, at Hull, when Miss Vining opened her spacious summer home for a two days' gathering of the members of the Abbott Academy Club, the Daughters of the Revolution, and the N.E.W.P.A.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. Mary Dickerson, of Newport, Vice President, representing New England, came to Boston the last week of May and was the guest of Mrs. Ruffin. While here, Mrs. Dickerson met the president and officers of New England clubs and
succeeded in forming a New England Federation. This step is a good one, and is expected to be productive of great results. All the clubs represented are already members of the National Federation, interested and enthusiastic supporters of the National body who hope by this special organization to awaken the women of New England to a keener interest in united work and to organize for harmonious, vigorous and united work for the cause in general. In the fall the work of the New England Federation will be pushed with zeal and watched with interest.</p>

                     <p>Once more our city has taken on her summer aspect; the colleges and seminaries have all closed, and teachers and pupils have wended their way home.</p>
                     <p>The commencement exercises of all the schools were exceptionally fine this year.</p>
                     <p>Miss Mamie Mason, one of Spelman's, "Sweet girl Graduates" read a well prepared paper on "The Need of a Reformatory for Georgia." When she had finished there was a most hearty appreciation and approval, not only from the magnificent audience, which filled spacious chapel, but Gov. W.Y. Atkinson rose from his seat on the rostrum, and not only endorsed the sentiments of Miss Mason's paper, but expressed in strong terms, his sympathy for the movement. The next day a reporter from the <hi rend="italic">Atlanta Journal</hi>, (daily) was sent to Spelman Seminary, to secure Miss Mason's paper for publication in its columns; now, this paper, three, yes, two years ago considered it an unpardonable sin, to allow an article from the pen and brain of an educated Afro-American, to appear in its sacred (?) columns. Miss Mason has started the ball, and ere long we hope to have a reformatory for our youthful criminals like the splendid one in Concord, Mass.</p>

                     <p>The regular meetings have been well attended, and full of interest and inspiration. The reports read from the different committees were gratifying. The First Ward sewing circle, with Miss M.F. Pullen as chairman, has been at source of education, to all who have attended. The girls do plain sewing very creditably.</p>
                     <p>The sewing circle in the third ward, with Mrs. Agnes Pitts as chairman, is taught plain sewing and fancy work. The sewing circle in the fourth ward, under Miss Janie Crane now numbers 41; at present the little girls are making a quilt, which is to be sold when finished, and the proceeds donated for charitable purposes.</p>
                     <p>The pupils of these different circles look forward with childish delight to the afternoon when they are to assemble. A most pleasing picture indeed, to see their happy faces, sparkling eyes, and listen to their merry chatter as they "ply the needle and thread."</p>
                     <p>The Lawn Party given by the club at the beautiful residence of Mrs. D.T. Howard, our faithful President, was an agreeable success in every phase.</p>
                     <p>The A.W.C., is an active organization, and is doing much good in many ways. The assessment of $2.00 has been forwarded to Mrs. L.C. Anthony, and a good delegation will be sent to the National Federation.</p>

                  <p>The program for the Convention will be in the form of a "Woman's Era Souvenir Edition;" these will be issued the early part of July and will be for free distribution.</p>
                  <p>Many people labor under the mistaken idea that there are differences between the National Federation of Afro-American Women, and other organizations. Distinct lines of work should not be conflicted with causes for antagonism. We fear this has been done unwittingly by many who have not begun to realize the proportions of the Woman's Movement. We are rejoiced over the moral effect thus far of the efforts to arouse our women the country over. Until the movement inaugurated by the women of Boston, which resulted in the formation of the National Federation was pioneered to success, the colored woman as a factor in club life was unknown, except locally. Not so now, and the National Federation feels justifiably encouraged. At the coming Convention efforts will be made to accomplish tangible results by bringing together the women who have founded homes, orphanages and hospitals, that our coming women may gather inspiration and the public be educated as to the actual work our women are striving against odds to do.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Tyree and Miss Chanie Patterson, Miss E. Nowell Ford, and the members of the Lyceum presided over by Rev. Jesse Lawson will assist in providing music for the Convention.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. F.J. Coppin and Mrs. Frances E.W. Harper will speak for Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>The gifted authoress, Miss Alice Ruth Moore will attend the Convention.</p>
                  <p>Every day reports come of new clubs, aroused to action. The latest to be heard from is two out in Kentucky where Miss Mary V. Cook is doing splendid service in arousing the women.</p>
                  <p>The women of the Northwest are especially interested in the great Paris Exposition. The President of the Ada Sweet Club will open the question. She is the brilliant Mrs. J. Napier Kemp.</p>
                  <p>Our faithful friend Mrs. Lyles will carry on her plucky efforts in favor of the Joint Brown Memorial. Her cause is a noble one and should have the <hi rend="italic">undivided support</hi> of our women.</p>
                  <p>Miss Mason of Atlanta, will treat the Georgia Convict System. By an address delivered some time ago, on this subject in her native city this lady won the hearty congratulation of  Gov. Atkinson of Georgia, on the very able and comprehensive way in which she handled the subject.</p>

                  <p>The Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn, will be represented very largely at the Convention. It has been decided to solid two regular delegates; the possibilities are that a large number will attend from that body.</p>
                  <p>The birthday of Harriet Beecher Stowe, was upon motion of Mrs. K.V. Carmand remembered, and a letter written in that lady's most touching and sympathetic vein was voted sent to the famous author of Uncle Tom's Cabin; also an original poem by Miss H. Cordelia Ray, secretary of the W.L.U. There is something eminently fit in selecting these ladies to perform this pleasing task. Mrs. Carmand's mother was a noted woman -- Mrs. Jennings, -- whose best years were spent, far from the great centres of population, educating the Plantation youth of Virginia.</p>
                  <p>Miss H. Cordelia Ray, a poet by nature and cultivation descends from a family noted for talent and integrity. Her father, Dr. Charles Ray, was long known as one of the most zealous workers for the emancipation of his people in the South. He was especially beloved by Wendell Phillips.</p>

                  <p>Since the publication of the letters sent by the officers of the National League, many persons have written for information as to "why the National Federation refused to unite with National League?" and other questions implying that the officers of the National Federation were cognizant of the plans of the League to hold a separate convention before the announcement was made in public print. As my correspondence is <corr sic="voluminious">voluminous</corr>, and everything connected with this matter is not private but public concern, I am forced to adopt this means of answering many who have requested information concerning the matter. I beg all included under this head of personal correspondents will consider this explanation a personal reply to their queries: -- </p>
                  <p>The facts in the case are simply these. At no time did the officers of the National League notify or invite the National Federation to participate in its convention through any officer connected with The National Federation. The National Secretary, Mrs. F.R. Ridley, having never received any communication whatever. The only intimation Mrs. B. T. Washington had of the date or plans of the National League was from the announcement contained in <hi rend="italic">Colored American</hi> of April 25th. Mrs. Washington nor the Chairman of Executive Committee, was not notified that the League would not meet the Federation in Joint Convention. No notice of this important fact was sent to the official organ of the Federation. No invitation has been sent to the National Federation, to carry out the terms of the vote of the Conference committee, i.e. that a <hi rend="italic">joint convention</hi> be held this summer; a joint session and a joint convention, are two widely differing affairs; lastly the letter published in last issue of THE WOMAN'S ERA, is absolutely the last communication received by the Chairman of Executive Committee, from the officers of the National League. Our coming convention represents not a "difference" of any kind with the National League or any other body. It will be held in accordance with article V of the Constitution.</p>

                  <p>The Phyllis Wheatley Club is doing a lot of work lately. The Sanitarium scheme is taking on what seems to be something of a very definite nature. There was a special meeting to discuss its plans into something like real work.</p>
                  <p>The committee which was appointed to make reports and confer with the different authorities in charge of the Charity hospital relative to the establishing of a Phyllis Wheatley Ward therein, reported at the previous monthly meeting, that Dr. Lewis and Sister Agnes in charge of the Hospital work had stated most emphatically and plainly that under no circumstances whatever would colored physicians and nurses be allowed to practice in the Hospital, even under such conditions as the Club wished imposed. Under such circumstances there was nothing for the P.W.C.'s to do but withdraw their offer of endowing the ward, and turn their attention to other matters.</p>
                  <p>At this juncture, the committee conferred with Dr. Atkinson, president of New Orleans University, and with the Medical Faculty of the New Orleans Medical Department, with the object of placing their funds, and energy in some work for the medical department of this school. To this end, a special meeting was called, and Dr. Atkinson and Dr. Newman invited to address the Club. As president of the University, Dr. Atkinson stated his opinion as to the help the club could give, the needs of the medical department in regard to a sanitarium, clinic, and nurses, gave interesting statistics of probable costs, and suggested plans of management, rules of admission and other necessary little details. Dr. Newman, as one of the principal lecturers in the department, and a physician of wide experience, followed, with supplementary information.</p>
                  <p>The upshot of the whole matter is, that the Phyllis Wheatley club is about to start a sanitarium and training school for nurses to be established in the New Orleans Medical School Building. There are to be pay wards, and free wards, a matron, head nurse, and facilities for the training of a limited number of young women who wish to become perfected in the noble art of caring for the sick. Of course, there will be limitations to the whole affair, at first. The work will begin on a small scale, but it is hoped that when everyone sees the reality of the talked of plans, the public spirited colored citizens of the city will come to its assistance as nobly as they have done in other charitable institutions.</p>
                  <pb n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
                  <p>Dr. Atkinson has promised to have the building ready for the wards and rooms by the early part of September, and now the members of the club have their hands full of summer work in perfecting plans of organization, arranging rules, boards of directors, raising sufficient sums of money, and other such work.</p>
                  <p>The first gift to the new cause was made by the Peabody Alumni, which kindly turned over to the Sanitarium Fund all the ready money it had in its treasury. The corner-stone just laid was highly appreciated by all club members.</p>
                  <p>At the May meeting, the members of the club were addressed on the "Legal Status of Woman in Louisiana" by the Hon. L.A. Martinet. It was an interesting lecture, not only from the earnestness of the speaker, but that it threw some light on darkly mysterious position of woman's legal status in the state.</p>
                  <p>The club has appointed its delegate to represent it at Washington in July.</p>

                  <p>Efforts are now being put forward to bring before the young generation the last of the grand characters identified with the "uprising of a great people." The woman whom the great-hearted Mrs. Sarah H. Bradford of Geneva, said, is "worthy to be handed down to posterity side and side with the names of Joan of Arc, Grace Darling, and Florence Nightingale."</p>
                  <p>"In my opinion" says Wendell Phillips, "There are few Captains, perhaps few Colonels, who have done more for the loyal cause since the war began, and few men who did that before that time, more for the colored race, than our fearless and most sagacious friend, Harriet Tubman. The last time I ever saw John Brown was under my own roof, as he brought Harriet Tubman to me, saying, 'Mr. Phillips I bring you one of the best and bravest persons on this Continent. <hi rend="italic">General</hi> Tubman, as we call her.'"</p>
                  <p>This wonderful woman became famous before the fall of Sumter, by conducting hundreds of slaves to freedom, through the system known as the "Under Ground Railroad." So daring and intrepid was she, that sums averaging from 12 to 40,000 dollars were offered for her capture by the slave oligarchy. During the rebellion, she was employed as scout, guide and nurse, and served all through the war, acknowledged and appreciated by all the great characters having charge of the affairs of state and war at that time. At the conclusion of hostilities, she quietly retired into private life and a short while ago gave her modest dwelling over to be a "home for the aged and homeless of her race."</p>
                  <p>It will be an inspiration for the rising generation to see and clasp hands with this noble mother in Israel! She has attained the advanced age of 80 years, and should God in his providence bless the efforts now being put forth toward having her present at the Convention in Washington, we hope our people will give her a true Chautauquan welcome. We expect to reproduce her photograph on our souvenir programme. This alone will make them valuable. We hope to bring such pressure to bear upon our grate body of Afro-American Women, that a great unrest will seize our women, that the cry, "What shall we do to elevate, purify and upbuild our race?" will burst spontaneously from thousands of earnest hearts, all over this land. All over our country, thousands of women are awakening to the fact that a new day is, dawning of our people, and that a tidal wave of deep heartfelt anxiety for better and purer homes, healthier and better trained children, broader and more helpful educational missionary work is sweeping over the great body of Afro-American Women. So at the very beginning of this new day let us all meet in the benign presence of this great leader, in days and actions, that caused strong men to quail this almost unknown, almost unsung "Black Joan of Arc," to whom the lamented Frederick Douglass once wrote - "Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has been in public, and I have received much encouragement at every step of the way. You on the other hand have labored in a private way. I have wrought in the day - you in the night. I have had the applause of the crowd and the satisfaction that comes of being approved by the multitude, while the most you have done has been witnessed by a few trembling scarred and footsore bondmen and women, whom you have led out of the house of bondage, and whose heartfelt 'God bless you' has been your only reward. The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism.</p>
                  <p>The primary object of the Federation is to bring our women together, we owe it to our children, to uncover from partial oblivion and unconscious indifference the great characters within our own ranks. The fact that we know so little that is creditably and truly noble about our own people constitutes one of the saddest and most humiliating phases of Afro-American life. Every woman who feels that is so, should rally now, and aid the great Cause, represented by The National Federation of Afro-American Women, and so nobly championed by our own Mrs. Booker T. Washington.</p>

                  <p>It will be an inspiration for the rising generations to see and clasp hands with this noble mother of Israel! She has attained the advanced age of eighty years, and should God in his providence bless the efforts now being put forth toward having her present at the Convention in Washington, we hope our people will give her at rue Chatauquan welcome.</p>
                  <p>We hope to bring such great pressure to bear upon our great body of Afro-American women, that a great unrest will seize our women, that the cry, "What shall we do to elevate, purify and upbuild our race?" will burst spontaneously from thousands of earnest hearts, all over this land. All over our country, thousands of women are awakening to the fact that a new day is dawning for our people, and that a tidal wave of deep, heartfelt anxiety for better and purer homes, healthier and better trained children, broader and more helpful educational and missionary work, is sweeping over the great body of Afro-American women. So at the very beginning of this new day let us all meet in the benign presence of this great leader, in days and actions that caused strong men to quail, this almost unknown, almost unsung "Black Joan of Arc."</p>
                  <p>The primary object of the Federation is to bring our women together. We owe it to our children to uncover from partial oblivion and unconscious indifference the great characters within our own ranks. The fact that we know so little that is creditable and truly noble about our own people constitutes one of the saddest and most humiliating phases of Afro-American life.

                  <docDate>July 1896</docDate>
                  <p>THE WOMAN'S ERA has been kept alive only through courage and self-sacrifice. It is now in its third year and speaks for itself. Every man and woman can judge whether there is need for such a paper and whether that need has been met with any degrees of ability.</p>
                  <p>The N.F.A.A.W. takes especial prid ein the conferring of a degree upon B.T. Washington by Harvard College. Through the president, the wife of Mr. Washington, some of the glory depends upon our organization.</p>
                  <p>The advertisements in the souvenir number of the ERA have more than the usual significance. A large number of our principal business men of the different cities are here represented. This is not the ordinary advertising scheme, but was designed for a business showing. Because of the limited time, the showing is not as representative as it might have been, and is, in fact, what might be called a sample only.</p>
                  <p>Never before in the history of our women has there been such deep and widespread interest in club work. The woman of all sections have been aroused and are deeply concerned about the proper disposition of many questions bearing upon the practical upbuilding of character, and all that pertains to home. An effort has been made to bring to the front women who are not only doing good work along philanthropic lines, but those who have founded and maintained orphan asylums, homes and infirmaries for the aged, infirm and unfortunate. In this particular the program is most unique. It also calls attention to the fact that though the Afro-American is recorded as being the most religious of people, yet he does not provide systematically for the weak and erring of the racial family. The women are alive to this great failing, and will not rest until a rescue brigade shall have been inaugurated by black women, for the upbuilding of struggling human kind. The isolated log cabin women and children will have a place upon the program. This is as it should be, for until the masses of our women know that there is such a thing as an Afro-American woman's organization anxious to better their condition, little good will result. The south has been well canvassed, and it is the aim of the National Federation of Afro-American Women to carry sympathy and enlightenment to the masses.</p>
                  <p>The National Virginia Baptist S. S. Union, with over a thousand members, will be represented by delegates. The True Reformers will be represented by the distinguished founder of the order, Mr. W.W. Browne. Mr. Browne and Harriet Tubman will be the romantic figures of the convention.</p>
                  <p>The Hon. John W. Ross, president of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, will deliver the address of welcome to delegates. In reply to an invitation presented him by Mrs. Rosetta Lawson, he wrote as follows:</p>

                           <p>I appreciate this invitation very highly, and assure you that I will be present unless some unforeseen emergency will prevent.</p>

                  </p>

                  <docDate>July 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Miss Beatrice Sumner Thompson was born in Boston, Mass. In 1880 her parents moved West and settled in Denver. Miss Thompson graduated from the Denver High School at the age of seventeen, the youngest of a class of 75 members. In January, 1892, after much difficulty and discouragement, she secured a position in the county treasurer's office as general clerk. Since entering the office she has held the positions of filing clerk, corresponding clerk and in 1895 was promoted on merit to the position of assistant bookkeeper, which position she still holds. Notwithstanding changes in administrations, Miss Thompson has been successful in retaining her position with credit.</p>
                  <p>Miss Thompson is also accomplished, being a pianist and the possessor of a rich contralto voice.</p>

                  <p>Among the notable clubs that have entered the Federation recently is the Richmond Club, which is composed of 250 women, with Mrs. Bowser as president.</p>
                  <p>The Twin City St. Paul and Minneapolis Woman's Era Club and the Phyllis Wheatley Club of Albuquoque, N.M., are among the latest to enter the Federation and show how interest is spreading geographically at least. The Twin City Club is unique; it is formed to support the ERA, one of the provisions of the constitution being that every signer must be a subscriber to our paper.</p>
                  <p>The many  eastern women investors in the woman's mine, "The Bonita," will take an added interest in this woman's enterprise when it is known that Mrs. E.P. Ensley is now one of the directors of the business. Mrs. Ensley's well-known intelligence and business integrity being a guarantee to them of the watchful care she will take of the interest of investors. The following letter just received brings other good news besides Mrs. Ensley's selection to help direct a woman's enterprise that the ERA heartily endorses because it has confidence in the projectors of it.</p>
                  <p>"I was notified this morning by Mrs. Phelps, president of the Bonita (the woman's mine) that I have been appointed one of the directors in place of one who had moved away from Denver. She also showed me a letter from Mr. Phelps who personally superintends the mine, in which he stated that they are near the contact as it is called, will reach it this week and is sure that they are very near the mineral or ore body. There were two rich strikes in the camp quite near this last week.</p>

                  <docDate>July 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Dr. Teed, author of "Solution of the Race Problem," whose portrait is herein presented, was born in Delaware County, New York, in 1839.</p>
                  <p>He served eighteen months in the northern army, after which he practised his profession in Utica and subsequently New York City. At Utica, in the winter of 1869, he projected what is known as the Koreshan System. This is a universal design, embracing physical science as a basis of social construction and government, with such an economic arrangement of society as to equitably distribute the products of industry.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Teed is a friend of the colored race, and includes in his system the purpose of insuring to the race all the rights to which they, as citizens, are entitled, both in the north and south. He has established a number of colonies, among which is one in South Florida, where he has gathered many believers. At Estero, Lee County, Florida, his colony has a saw and planing mill in operation, also a shingle mill, machine shops and ship yards.</p>
                  <p>They are developing on many lines of industry, and his intent is to place his colonist in all branches of industry. Their educational system is of the most advanced order. The colony in Florida is located beautifully on the mainland, and on the islands of Estero Bay, where climate soil and latitude are in every way favorable to the project of building up a great commercio-maratime city. Judging from the progress already made, after an effort of only about two years in Estero, the indications point to the ultimate success of the doctor's plans: and his success implies a great advancement in the moral development, general education, practical mechanical application and social elevation of the people he desires to aid.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Teed is now visiting his people in Denver. Through his visits here an dour acquaintance with his people we have been made somewhat familiar with him and his work.</p>

                  <p>Mr. J.H. Lewis, whose advertisement appears in this issue of the ERA, hardly needs an introduction to our readers. His splendid tailoring establishment on Washington street, Boston, is one of the finest of its kind in the country, and has opened up business opportunities to numbers of colored boys. Mr. Lewis has the genius of business, and has proved that he can successfully run more than one large establishment at the same time.</p>

                  <docDate>July 1896</docDate>
                  <p>The fact that the progressions of racial development depend upon ethnic filtration does not require argument to establish. The only question to the problem is, What are the physiological conditions essential to the amalgamation of the colored with the white races?</p>
                  <p>It is a commonly apprehended truth that in the mixing of the colored with the white blood there is a projective nonviability to progeny which militates against the possible transmission of a vital and viable stamina and that a strict fidelity to the laws of physiology precludes any conscientious effort towards the settlement of the racial problem by amalgamation.</p>
                  <p>The negro race is destined to take a most prominent part in the future civilizations of the world. Its animal viability is pronounced apparent, and the religious and emotional nature carries with it an enthusiasm of power and devotion that scarcely has an equal among any of the nations of the earth.</p>
                  <p>While the religious principle is intense the moral character requires the discipline and development of culture and refinement.</p>
                  <p>This cannot come through example merely. Something must enter the race to impart to it a moral tone which it can only derive through the introduction of a force from a more advanced plane of development. As the blood of the Lord Jesus was transplanted in a spiritual way for the elevation of the Character of those who received him, so the black race must receive in a natural way the essential force for its own elevation. In other words through ethnic filtration the black
race must modify its complexion and ethnic character. This can be done only through the enforcement of a specific understanding and the application of definite principles.</p>
                  <p>These factors in the problem of ethnic development are extremely radical, so much so that it is very questionable whether the colored people themselves are prepared in any measure at present for suggestions in the direction of a scientific modification of the anatomical structure and thence an advancement in functional power and capacity.</p>
                  <p>The Jewish race owes its greatness to the application of the principle and ceremony of male circumcision. The present commercial nations of the world represented by the Anglo-Saxon, owe their commercial greatness to the fact that through ethnic infiltrament the lost Israel was absorbed in Media, Persia and Assyria and thence produced the Germanic family the Anglo-Saxon being one of the principle lines of ethnic progress. The commercial greatness of the Anglo-Saxon comes directly from the Jewish male circumcision.</p>
                  <p>The coming infiltrament of the black with the white will owe its possibility to the application of the principle and ceremony of female circumcision introduced as a scientific religious rite. The character of this ceremony must belong to a mind scientific enough to comprehend it in all its bearings upon female life and the progeny of miscegenation, as the intellectual prescience of the mind who ordered the enforcement of male circumcision comprehended that ritual in all its possibilities for the resurrection of the son of God in humanity. Had it not been for the circumcision of the Israelites the Christ could not have come to the world.</p>
                  <p>This paper is merely suggestive of racial possibilities. It may be influential in causing one man to think. The multitude is not yet sufficiently ripe to comprehend its force.</p>

                  <p>The name of Harriet Tubman (and we say it advisedly and without exaggeration) deserves to be handed down to posterity side by side with the names of Joan of Arc, Grace Darling, and Florence Nightingale, for not one of these women has shown more courage and power of endurance in facing danger and death to relieve human suffering than has this woman in her heroic and successful endeavors to reach and save all whom she might of her oppressed and suffering race, and to pilot them from the land of bondage to the promised land of liberty. She has been a leader and deliverer unto hundreds of her people.</p>

                  <p>Among our advertisers the younger business men of Boston make a good showing. Messrs. Baldwin and Dorsey conduct a real estate business that is complete and first class in every particular. The location, the office appointments, the handsome turnout of this establishment are all the subject of remark and speak for themselves.</p>
                  <p>Most of our readers have probably heard of the inventions of Mr. Joseph Lee. Mr. Lee is not only the prosperous proprietor of' one of the finest suburban hotels of' Massachusetts, but has greatly added to his fame and fortune by his bread-mixer and bread-comber. These machines which are not identical are his own inventions, and because of their practical value and adaptability are being called for by the leading hotels of the United States. (See ad.)</p>

                  <p>The best known preventive to consumption is climate, and it is generally conceded that Colorado has the best anti-consumption climate in America.</p>
                  <p>Hundreds come every year to Denver, hoping to prolong life or regain health; many of them do so who would otherwise meet early death.</p>
                  <p>The climate of Denver, dry, pure and sunny, with its elevation of one mile above sea level, effectually cures all incipient lung diseases.</p>
                  <p>Therefore parents having children predisposed to lung trouble are advised to send them to Denver to pursue their studies.</p>
                  <p>The fine public schools and the Denver University afford unsurpassed educational facilities.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Ensley will take into her home a limited number of girls and young ladies desiring to get the benefit of the climate while attending school.</p>
                  <p>She will give special attention to home training and physical culture, particularly to chest expansion, diet and healthful dressing, while superintending their course at the public schools.</p>
                  <p>When private instruction is preferred the best teachers will be secured.</p>

                  <p>The Great Mineral Basin it Pitkin covers an area as large as that of Leadville, Aspen and Red Cliff combined. Professor Sadtler, of the Chair of Metallurgy and Mineralogy of the State School of Mines, speaking of this district, says: "This camp, with proper and systematic development, will be made a second Aspen, if not better."</p>
                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>What, then, shall we expect of Pitkin and the Quartz Creek District, which has a mineral bearing area as large as these three districts combined, when so far the developments there have proved the mineral deposits to be fully as rich and extensive?</p>
                  <p>We can come to but one conclusion: Its wealth is limitless, and no more safe or profitable field for investment can be found.</p>
                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>The ore is high grade, netting from fifty to one thousand dollars per ton, average two hundred and fifty.

NEW ENGLAND FARM AGENCY.</p>
                  <p>There are in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut many good farms that can be purchased for a reasonable sum of money, and on easy terms of payment</p>
                  <p>We offer our assistance in aiding colored farmers to leave the South and to come and make their homes in the North.</p>
                  <p>We propose to procure farms in any of the above named states for as many of our race as desire, to come North and make their homes among us. We shall give them all the aid in our power, and be only too glad to look them over and see that they obtain all the advantages possible in the respective neighborhoods, until they become accustomed to their new homes and neighbors.</p>
                  <p>It is our intention in procuring these farms to have them near cities and towns in various states, so as to be convenient to school houses, railroard stations and churches.</p>
                  <p>The farms of the North differ from those of the South in that they are more compact, better cleared and attended to in general. Being smaller they are easier to care for. About anything that can be raised on farms in the South can be raised in the North.</p>
                  <p>On these farms are comfortable frame houses, cottage style. Terms of payment will be made to suit.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">CURE WITHOUT MEDICINE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A SIMPLE HOME TREATMENT OF UNEQUALED VALUE, administered by attaching an instrument to the flesh which aids the system to take on oxygen from the atmosphere, to the utmost amount the system can use.</p>
                  <p>IN SIMPLICITY. Those of ordinary intelligence can use it, even in very serious and severe sickness, like diphtheria, pneumonia, scarlet fever, etc.</p>
                  <p>IN EFFECTIVENESS. It is always curative and eradicative of disease to a degree never before attained by the highest skill in other methods of treatment in like cases.</p>
                  <p>NEVER DANGEROUS OR INJURIOUS, as the treatment is simply an assistance to nature to do its work effectively and in its own way.</p>
                  <p>IT IS A TREATMENT OF THE BLOOD, and by purifying, revitalizing and loading it with Nature's Nerve Food, ejects disease by removing its causes. It applies of necessity to all diseases as no other treatment ever has.</p>
                  <p>THE OXYGEN COSTS NOTHING, the price of the instrument being all the expense necessary for years. It can be used by the entire family.</p>
                  <p>IT IS NOT A NEW THING. It has been in use in New England nearly seven years, and is endorsed by thousands, many of them among the most intelligent and influential citizens.</p>
                  <p>AS A RESTORATIVE OF VITAL ENERGIES in enfeebled and exhausted physical conditions it has no equal within the limits of human knowledge.</p>
                  <p>THE ELECTROPOISE IS A DISCOVERY of hitherto unknown effects of well known natural laws, which are always active in the ordinary progress of physical life.</p>
                  <p>DURING THE SEVEN YEARS that the Electropoise has been before the public, it has been met by criticism and disbelief, which it has answered by facts and cures of the most remarkable and permanent character, and has made its way, step by step, until probably 12,000 persons in New England alone have made use of it with greater or less success, according to the faithfulness and perseverance of using.</p>
                  <p>THE UNANSWERABLE PROOF of the extraordinary success of this treatment is furnished by the endorsement of its patrons, among whom will be found judges, lawyers, clergymen, physicians, professors, business men, and many others, whose names would be given only on account of exceeding merit.</p>
                  <p>The following extract is from <corr sic="an">an</corr>editorial in the "Christian Witness" of September 3, 1891, by Rev. Dr. McDonald, editor:</p>
                  <p>"AND NOW, AFTER A YEAR, we have this to say in its favor: (1) We have taken no medicine for the year. (2) All traces of la grippe and our old sunstroke troubles have disappeared, and no symptoms of either remain. Once or twice, from severe overwork, we have found it necessary to hold up for a few days, but in no time for fifteen years have we been better than during the past year.</p>
                  <p>"We have seen testimonials of most remarkable cures, and they can be seen by calling on the agent, 36 Bromfield street.</p>
                  <p>"This notice of the 'Electropoise' is without solicitation and entirely gratuitous. We do it for the good of the afflicted. We have no personal interest in it, and are not paid for what we say in its favor."</p>
                  <p>Another writes:</p>
                  <p>"I SOUGHT THE AID OF A DOZEN of the best physicians I could find, but they helped me very little. I also tried Compound Oxygen thoroughly, and the electric battery, but they helped me very little. On December 17, 1891,  commenced using the Electropoise and continued it about four months. During this time my disabilities were greatly removed. In this course of year from the time I commenced using it, I enjoyed almost perfect health, which has continued to this date. I know persons who were afflicted with quinsy sore throat, rheumatism, general debility, nervous prostration, and liver trouble, who have been greatly helped by it. It have great faith in it.</p>

                  <p>In our city the I.B.W.

The aggressive spirit of this club as well as the gracious personality of its president and associate officers, made it possible for the club to broaden its hospitality so as to enable Mrs. Matthews of New York, Mrs. Dickerson of Newport and your correspondent to be present at the Cantabrigia  Reception, one of the most important and delightful women's gatherings of the Anniversary Week.</p>

                  <p>On the 22nd day of July, 1896, at Washington, D.C., the two large bodies of colored women known respectively as the National Federation of Afro-American Women and the National League of Colored Women united their forces and became the National Association of Colored Women. This union resulted in one of the largest and most significant organizations of women in the world. The WOMAN'S ERA, which had been the official organ of the Federation, was chosen by the joint commission on union as the official organ of the united body with a special department to be edited and controlled by department editors, who were then and there elected by the same committee.</p>
                  <p>In a vast body like ours, numbering as it does two hundred clubs, an organ as a communication is an absolute necessity. Preparation for the next annual meeting should begin at once, on the reassembling of the various clubs in the autumn. To do this systematically and thoroughly the clubs must be kept in touch with each other and in <gap agent="unknown"/> ers of the <gap agent="unknown"/> N.A. of <gap agent="unknown"/> but should <gap agent="unknown"/>  ithly club <gap agent="unknown"/>

The low, time-limit subscription rates will begin with the next number, which will also contain matter of great import to members of the united organization. Subscription blanks for those not desiring to vote can be had upon application to club presidents and at the office of the WOMAN'S ERA, 103 Charles street, Boston.</p>
                  <p>Presidents of clubs are earnestly requested to use their efforts to circulate the ERA in their associations. The reduced rates are for three months and should bring us in many subscriptions.</p>

                  <p>We, the Colored Women of America, stand before the country today a united sisterhood, pledged to promote the welfare of our race, along all the lines that tend to its development and advancement. As the National Association of Colored Women we were christened one short month ago, in the nation's capital, where all lovers of progress and peace and true friends of the race stood sponsors. Surely no one conversant with our present status, and concerned about our future, can doubt that there is a crying need of just such a union of forces as our association represents.</p>
                  <p>As individuals, our women have already accomplished much for the education and cultivation of the race. How much more will they be enabled to effect when, working conscientiously, zealously and intelligently toward the same end, they are one in thought, one in purpose and one in power for good. While as a unit we shall bend our energies to compass the ends for which we have banded together, as diverse and varied will be the plans adopted as are the individualities of the different organizations of which the association is composed. Union of forces is not construed to mean monotony of ways and means, in presenting the work to which we are solemnly and irrevocably pledged. Through the instrumentality of the various members of our united sisterhood, we hope to run the whole gamut of human progress and reform.</p>
                  <p>In leaving each organization to fulfil the mission to which it feels especially called and peculiarly adapted, we feel confident that the greatest amount of good can be accomplished with the smallest expenditure of labor and the least sacrifice of time.</p>

                  <p>Being neither infallible nor omniscient, if we make an occasional mistake, let us rectify it with all the speed and candor of which honest, earnest women are capable. Having overcome as a race and a sex so many obstacles that to the fainting, faltering heart seemed insurmountable in the past, we shall neither be discouraged at the temporary failures of our friends, nor frightened at the apparent success of our foes.</p>
                  <p>In accepting the position of honor and trust which my sisters have seen fit to confer upon me, I am keenly, almost painfully alive to the great responsibility assumed. In myself I am nothing, but with the loyal support of conscientious, capable women, all things are possible to us. The duties of my office shall be discharged faithfully, the friends of the association may rest assured, and efficiently, let us trust, for the sake of our common cause. Forgetful of the past, hopeful for the future, let us work in the present with undaunted courage and untiring zeal. With so many heads that are thoughtful and hearts that are true enlisted in our service, how impossible is failure, how inevitable success!</p>
                  <p>The magnitude of the work to which we seem divinely called and are solemnly pledged, far from affrighting and depressing us, inspires to greater effort, for we feel in undertaking it that <lb/>
Humanity with all its fears,<lb/>
With all the hopes of future years,<lb/>
Is hanging breathless on our fate.</p>

                  <p>One of the most interesting of the ante-bellum articles written by the late Harriet Beecher Stowe was her account of a day spent at "Playford Hall," home of Thomas Clarkson. After giving a most charming pen-picture of the house, and the gracious hospitality of the venerable widow of the great abolitionist, Mrs. Stowe described some of his sacred mementos, gifts from friends and associates in the cause of freedom, treasured by the family, making special mention of the seal used by Mr. Clarkson. She wrote: "His seal attracted my attention. It was a kneeling figure of the Negro with clasped hands, which was at first adopted as the badge of the cause, when every means was being made use of to arouse the public mind and keep the subject before the attention. Mr. Wedgewood, the celebrated porcelain manufacturer, designed a cameo with this representation, which was much worn as an ornament by ladies. It was engraved on the seal of the Anti-Slavery society, and it was used by its members in sealing all their letters. This of Clarkson's was handsomely engraved on a large, old-fashioned cornelian, and surely if we look with emotion on the sword of a departed hero, which at best we can only consider as a necessary evil, we may look with unmingled pleasure on this memorial of a bloodless victory."</p>
                  <p>The great Clarkson's methods in bringing about the emancipation of the bondmen on English soil possess many sterling lessons for us who would carry on the present day work of emancipation among our struggling people, and should be carefully studied. One of his first steps was the formation of a committee of twelve persons for the collection and dissemination of evidence on the slave traffic. We would do well to follow in his footsteps, by the establishment of such committees to collect and disseminate evidence on the legislative enactments inimical to our interests. This could be done with great propriety in connection with the chain-gang system and the separate car law.</p>

                  <p>This is the name adopted by a party of impromptu visitors to Anacostia on the day following the adjournment of the Federation meetings. Perhaps it was from inspiration from the surroundings; certainly it was from no prearrangement that the twenty odd callers suddenly decided to band themselves together to work for the securing of the Douglass homestead for a Mecca to which pilgrimages may be made, and in which an historical collection of anti-slavery literature and other race data may be kept. Mr. Douglass' widow was made president of the new association. A secretary and treasurer were elected, the nucleus of a fund contributed, and each club representative pledged herself to see to it that her own club kept green the memory of Mr. Douglass by fittingly celebrating his birthday on the 22nd of each February. Then the association adjourned to the vine clad porch overlooking the Potomac, and succumbed to the omnipresent and irresistible photographer.</p>

                  <p>The Ladies' Auxiliary Association of Washington, D. C., while one of the youngest members of the Federation, having joined its ranks only a few weeks prior to the assembling of the convention, was notwithstanding one of the most enthusiastic among the large and highly creditable membership of the Federation. The auxiliary felt, in a large degree, that the Federation was its guest, and the pleasure and pride in having so noble a gathering in our home city was evinced on every hand by the ceaseless and untiring activity of our ladies.</p>
                  <p>The local citizens' committee, composed of both ladies and gentlemen, were persistent in their zeal to promote the comfort and entertainment of the convention. The two ladies worked in unison to the best of their abilities, with what results the visitors must decide. We can only testify to the hearty good-will and generosity of spirit coupled with the earnest desire to make every visitor feel perfectly at home</p>
                  <p>The lunches for the three days' sessions, the decorations and the reception held on the closing night were the work of the two named bodies.</p>
                  <p>The citizens of Washington will always recall with unbounded satisfaction the convention of the N.F. of A.A.W. Such a glorious hand of earnest women must always, even in memory, be an inspiration. The great organization, as a whole, as well as the members as individuals, were possessed with the mighty purpose to relieve the stress and burden of life, which continue to exist largely on account of inactivity, ignorance or the disposition to accept whatever is, without
murmuring. The wrongs and injustices which afflict the many spring from a misconception of the relation of man to man. Now, as ever, is it true that,</p>

                  <p>The assistance which is springing up in many quarters, notably among women, betokens a readjustment of mankind's relations, which must consciously or unconsciously go on until the last vestige of inequality has been removed.</p>
                  <p>Such love-laden labor, such devotion to self-imposed duty, so far-seeing a purpose give the assurance, even to the dubious ones, that the women have a cause to which they have brought persistence, resoluteness and intrepidity.</p>
                  <p>The sisterly affection that had grown up in the single year of the existence of the Federation was as marvelous as it was admirable. What wonder was it then that some heads were bowed in silence when the announcement was made of the passing away of the Federation -- its name, not its purpose -- and the ushering in of the new body. The feeling thus exhibited must not be misunderstood; it was not regret because of the union -- not at all -- for I believe that one and all cordially endorsed the principle involved in union, but it was simply expressive of the beautiful devotion to the

                  <head rend="aligncenter">THE BERLIN INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITION.</head>
                  <docAuthor>Helen Elise Villard</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>August 1896</docDate>
                  <p>While Berlin is gradually acquiring the reputation of a European capital well worth seeing, it is nevertheless itself often left out of the traveler's itinerary, despite its manifold attractions.</p>
                  <p>The Industrial Exposition which was opened there on the first of May has, however, brought an unusually large number of tourists to the city this summer. The Exposition is laid out in a suburb of Berlin known as Treptow, which was formerly a playground for children. The most enjoyable way of going there is by mail-coach, although this mode of conveyance is considered too expensive by most of the visitors who visit the Exposition. The approach to the grounds is a long avenue, with booth after booth, show after show on either side, ending up in the night with the Cairo Exhibit, which is decided the most realistic and successful part of the Exposition. It ought to have been called Egypt rather than Cairo, because quite as much of life on the Nile as of life as seen in Cairo is represented there. The temple, like the pyramid, is an excellent piece of workmanship, albeit both have too new and clean an appearance to strongly resemble the originals. The most advantageous time in which to see Cairo is at twilight, or after dark, when the gay bazaars with their wily salesmen, and the well imitated Egyptian horses wear a truly oriental aspect. The Egyptians themselves are unmistakably genuine, and their noisy ways and curious antics, and the camels and donkeys which they tend, render the illusion a perfect one. A truly imposing sight is the Egyptian circus which goes on all the evening in the large arena upon which you look down from the top of the Pyramid. The ascent is made by elevator, the Pyramid being hollow; you unconsciously fancy yourself in the desert, while intently watching the ever moving mass of human beings and of animals, and the motley array of color which stands out so strongly against the gray background.</p>
                  <p>The Cameron Exhibit is both interesting and amusing, but is soon exhausted. The natives show off their hats and the way in which they prepare their meals with great glee. They are particularly proud of their scanty knowledge of the German language which, however, they pronounce uncommonly well. By far the most entertaining inhabitant of the Cameron village is a mite of a baby whose comical ways and friendly hand-shakes win all hearts.</p>
                  <p>The Berliners, of course, think a great deal of their Exposition, but to those who have seen and enjoyed the wonders of our World's Fair, it is difficult not to make detrimental comparisons, even while bearing in mind that this is the effort of one city alone -- since the principal buildings, the lake, the boats and so on are so evidently an attempt at direct imitation, in miniature, of the Chicago Exposition.</p>
                  <p>The industrial exhibits vary in interest and in value, and the pleasure grounds - the Midway Plaisance of this Exposition -- contain but a collection of cheap, bawdy shows. Of these, the hall devoted to automatic machines and instruments is the best, the automatic orchestra being a very musical and ingenious toy on a large scale.</p>
                  <p>Old Berlin is considered a great success. Seen from the water it looks very well, but it is really much inferior to old Vienna of Chicago fame and not nearly as well carried out as the old Dresden part of the small industrial exposition now in progress in Dresden.</p>
                  <p>The Chicago Fair covered so large an area that the throngs of people were no more than groups in the landscape when scattered over the grounds. In Berlin the space used for the Exposition seems so small a one that one is impressed by the vast multitude of people which assembles there on a fine evening. The place to see the fashionable world of Berlin and the foreign element is not Bressel's restaurant which faces the chief building at the other end of the lake, but the whole lake is surrounded by swarms of people full of the enjoyment of out-of-door life that is so pleasant a characteristic of the German people. They sit at tables drinking beer, listening to the music and watching the boats glide about. The weekly illuminations naturally attract the largest crowds of people, who are never other than well behaved. The colors used in illuminating are too gaudy to be beautiful, particularly when compared with the exquisite harmony which made illumination nights at Chicago a never-to-be-forgotten memory.</p>

                  <p>It is the custom of the Institute to fulfil the wishes of its first benefactor by having an address on each 22nd of February upon some distinguished American, and it was thought most fitting that Mrs. Stowe's services be commemorated on the first Washington anniversary following her decease.

                  <p>It is the first time in the history of the Institute that the invitation for the annual address has been given to a woman, and the ERA is glad and proud that the choice has fallen upon Miss Baldwin.</p>

                  <p>The joint committee appointed by the League and Federation respectively to consolidate the two bodies with one aim, was considered the one with the most important duty to perform. The ERA desired to give to its readers the portraits of each member of the two committees, but repeated efforts have thus far failed to locate any of the League members, most of them being teachers spending their vacations away from home. Mrs. Butler and Mrs. Hunton, whose pictures are given this month, represented the Federation on the commission with intelligence and gracious zeal. Both are soft voiced and gentle mannered, albeit they are women of affairs in their respective localities, veritable helpmeets to their husbands.</p>

                  <p>The issue of sound and stable currency, involved in the present national campaign, is of vital importance to the colored people of this country. The success of Bryan, and the subsequent free coinage of silver, would not only affect the purchasing power of the present wages and salaries of the wage earners, to which class the colored people of this country mainly belong, but would decrease by almost one-half the value of the little stock of money that the thrifty among them have been able to lay aside and entrust to savings or co-operative banks. Those of them who, by incessant industry and much deprivation, have been able to meet their payments in life insurance companies, believing that, if anything should happen, some comfort and even some small luxuries of this life would be assured their widows and orphans, should arouse themselves in opposition to threatening legislation of free silver. Their widows would receive just fifty-three cents for every dollar of their life insurance. Under the authority of the United States, in the even of free silver, the savings banks, for an invested dollar of one hundred cents, would pay back a dollar worth fifty-three cents. Are the colored people of this country so rich or so indifferent to their future welfare that they can see their accumulations for a rainy day cut almost in halves, one portion only to remain theirs, while the other be given to the silver mine owners? Yet this is just what the success of Bryan, Tillman and Altgeld means. It is a solemn duty for every mother, wife and sister to arouse their husbands, sons and brothers to a realizing sense of the terrible results that will surely follow in the wake of the success of the free silver heresy. The woman should take as  active an interest in this question as possible. Only a small number are allowed to show their interest by voting themselves, directly, but they all know their power and should see to it that no voter over whom they have any influence is on the wrong side of this question.</p>

Educational work is what the women's clubs are formed for, and the most important educational need just now, among all women, is systematized, careful instruction in American politics. The present campaign, called a campaign of education, offers opportunities for all who desire an intelligent understanding of current issues; and what club woman does not?</p>

                  <p>Now that the new association is launched and all eyes are fixed upon the new officers who are to order the great craft, and all hearts are wishing them success and good weather, it is well that a thought should be given to the old officers, the women of the National Federation and National League who made this thing possible -- the women some of whom have been in their self sacrifice and devotion to the interests of their associations models for all successors.</p>
                  <p>The work that has been done in the last year has been in some ways almost marvellous, and our women should not forget that it did not do itself, but represents intelligence, industry and devotion.

                  <p>Paul Laurence Dunbar is recognized as a true poet by the first critics of America, and his little volume "Majors and Minors" will be welcomed as a contribution to real literature. There is hardly a recent circumstance which means more to the race than this. As Mr. Howells says it is probably through the arts that nations are to be brought together and hostilities and prejudices to disappear. Genius forces recognition and knows neither race nor sex. More poets, more artists, more musicians will develop among us in time, and the world will be forced to acknowledge them and the people from whom they spring.</p>

                  <p>The union of the two great national bodies of colored women, which was consummated at Washington in July, was and is still the subject of much talk of a congratulatory nature. It would seem as if there were little left to be said on the
matter. That union was the general desire, no one can doubt, and that in effecting union many concessions had to be made will also be acknowledged.</p>

                  <p>That union was the ardent desire of all interested in the two national organizations which met in Washington in July was very evident; nevertheless, real tears were shed by some of the Federation members when its consummation compelled the giving up of a name that represented so much done in so short a time. Now with the added strength of the 113 clubs contributed to the association by the National League, the power and influence of the united bodies makes possible a report of even greater results this year than last. Let the mourners comfort themselves with the thought that the name will be to them what they make of it - either a diadem upon their brows, or a millstone about their necks.</p>

                  <p>All Boston went out to Arlington Heights on the afternoon of the 26th to the summer home of Dr. and Mrs. Grant, who were holding a garden fete. The affair was both delightful and unique; the house had been elaborately decorated with sweet ferns and golden rod, and the lawn with lanterns; these, combined with the natural attractions of the place, the fine views, the shady walks, the clear, bracing air, were the foundation for an almost ideal fete champetre.</p>
                  <p>There were the usual features of a garden party - music and red lights, tableaux and dancing, moonlight strolls and flirtation. There were many beautiful light costumes; conspicuous among them were those worn by Miss Param, Mrs. J.H. Lewis and Mrs. McCov. The whole bud contingent was out, augmented by Misses Angelina Grimke, Therese Lee, Mary Lewis and the Misses Baker; and among the visiting gentlemen were Mr. A.H. Grimke from San Domingo, Dr. Wheatland and Mr. Bertram Jamieson from Newport and Prof. George Cook of Washington.</p>

                  <docAuthor>Alice Ruth Moore</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>August 1896</docDate>
                  <p>There was one noticeable feature of the recent convention of the National Federation of Afro-American Women; that was the utter absence of frivolous personalities among the women present. The average cynical man would have expected that in such a large and -- if I may use the term -- varied assemblage of women of all ages and personalities, frivolity and gossip would naturally creep in; but not so. Every woman present seemed to feel that she had gone a long way to discuss matters of gravest importance, and that it behooved her as a representative of other earnest women to stick to her text. The all important question, "Is my bonnet straight?" was never even dreamed of.</p>
                  <p>History is made of little things, after all. It was a pretty little scene in one of the committee rooms, that ought to go down in the history of the Afro-American woman - if one should be written. Mrs. Ida Wells-Barnett, whom every one knows, is positive and determined in her opinions, and her expression of them, gracefully and gently, yielded to the pleasure of Mrs. Lucy B. Thurman when the question of endorsing in an unqualified manner the work of the W.C.T.U. was raised. Considering the differences of opinion between Miss Willard and Mrs. Barnett, and the utterances of the former in regard to the work of the latter, the introduction of such a resolution was somewhat after the fashion of a slap in Mrs. Barnett's face. But she gracefully gave her approval to its passage, and thus added another heroic act to the list of self-sacrificing acts done at Washington.</p>
                  <p>Heroines are not entirely the products of ancient days. Every hour that Mrs. Washington stood on the platform during the days of the convention stamped her as a heroine of the purest type. Ill and physically in no condition to be out, she stood the strain of the entire proceedings, with an unflinching calmness that a less brave woman could not but envy. There is no use denying that it takes great mental, physical and nervous force to preside over any body at any given time, and the fact that Mrs. Washington stood calmly through it all in her illness, is something for which we all should feel it our duty to throw up our hats and cheer.</p>
                  <p>The office of national organizer, which was created by the joint commission from the two organizations, is unique only in its name. It is an office which no national organization should be without. In the Woman's Relief Corps, which is one of the largest of this country, the work is done by a national instituting and instaling officer, who has an assistant in every state, this assistant in turn having assistants in the state corps. The work is thus brought to a finesse which constantly enlarges the ranks of the organization. It was a wise thought on the part of the commission to create such an office, as we need more systematic methods and more enthusiasm in organization. It was, perhaps, as wise, too, that they should have chosen Mrs. Matthews to fill the office, for she is particularly interested in that branch of work, and by her splendid amount of personal magnetism cannot but succeed in bringing into the ranks of the association many new and vigorous clubs.</p>
                  <p>Will we succeed in perfecting the proposed scheme of departmental or state work? Of course it is for the executive and constitution committees to say that, but it is to be hoped that we will, for the present system will soon become, as new clubs are enlisted, cumberson and heavy.</p>
                  <p>This year was the crucial one, and now that the great feat of consolidation has been accomplished, we can draw a long breath and settle into plans and schemes for great deeds to be accomplished ere July, 1897. With such a body of women, all of whom have already shown their power in many different lines, the weight of the organization should be felt in more ways than one. It is to be hoped so.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Tennessee desires to proclaim to the world in general and to the United States in particular that on the 1st of June, 1896, she celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of her admission as a state of the Union. It was at first proposed to celebrate this occasion by the opening of an Exposition, so far reaching as to even become international in its character. For many excellent reasons this plan was not carried out and the opening of the Exposition was postponed until May 1, 1897; it will continue for six months, closing October 31 of the same year. The anniversary was celebrated by ceremonies extending over two days, June 1 and 2, and consisted of the firing of guns, street parades, composed of state and federal troops, federal, state and city officials, social, benevolent and industrial orders, municipal departments, bicycle brigades, citizens in carriages, on horseback and on foot, and exercises at the centennial grounds, in the auditorium and woman's
building.</p>
                  <p>The centennial grounds are already in excellent and beautiful condition and several of the buildings are completed. The management propose to have everything in complete readiness for the opening of the Exposition on May 1, 1897.</p>
                  <p>It has been divided into sixteen departments, each with a chief and working committee, and among this number is the Negro department with J.C. Napier as chief and a committee of sixteen. Chief Napier desires it fully understood that this department is not a case of discrimination but was a choice, that the negroes might secure a better showing and receive full credit for their industry and advancement. It is entirely optional as to whether the exhibitor will place his exhibit in the Negro building or the one designated for his line of exhibits. Since his appointment Chief Napier has not only been supported by the heads of the different divisions and their committees but has met with great encouragement from residents of other states. One of the divisions is designated as a Woman's Board and has a membership of forty of our most energetic women. Mrs. Ella S. Moore is its president; Mrs. C. Napier 1st, Mrs. Preston Taylor 2nd, Mrs. S. J. W. Early 3rd, Mrs. G. A. Shelbon 4th vice-president; Mrs. P. R. Bumes, secretary; Miss J.B. Cheatham, corresponding secretary; Mrs. W.0. Tate, treasurer.</p>
                  <p>The executive committee is made up of the officers of the board and transacts most of the business, but places it before the board for its approval or rejection. A spirit of complete harmony pervades each meeting, and the united desire seems to be the advancement of any aim that will promote the welfare of the Negro building, but more especially make the woman's exhibit the feature of the department. Everything that is skilfully and well made by a female is desired, and the women have no fear as to what they can accomplish. Not only have they the assurance from Nashville and other places in Tennessee, but Mrs. Moore is traveling in the north and east and is never forgetful of the Tennessee Centennial, and Mrs. Napier has received hearty co-operation from many of our leading women all over the country.</p>
                  <p>Many large bodies have been invited and are arranging to hold their meetings here during the Exposition, and among the number will be the second meeting of the Woman's Congress which met for the first time at Atlanta during the holding of its Exposition.</p>

                  <p>From the platform, the auditorium of the Nineteenth St. Baptist Church was a delight to the eye, on the evening of the first day of the gathering of the late Federation of Afro-American Women for their first annual convention. The audience, which was an immense one, was made up about equally of men and women of all colors and ages. As is customary in that latitude in the summer time, many of the ladies came to the meeting without head covering of any kind, radiant in white and vari-colored costumes, trimmed with ribbons and much lace, which seemed to soften and tone down the almost too eager and anxious look of the matrons and maids gathered to be a part of the great object lesson. At Mrs. Washington's request, Mrs. Matthews presided upon this occasion, and in presenting the speakers she was at her best. Her incidental plea, made just here, for greater interest and sympathy for the women and children of the southern cabins, did credit to both her head and heart. The address of welcome by District Commissioner Ross was impressive from its earnest heartiness. The Era Club president was honored by being selected to reply to this eloquent greeting, and embraced the opportunity to tell something of the inception of the one year old movement that was showing such astonishing results.</p>
                  <p>The resolutions adopted were strong, comprehensive and pathetic in the recount of the many needs of a much hampered people. The pathos was emphasized by the reading of them by Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett, in the musical monotone peculiar to that polished reader. The resolutions are to be published in full, with the minutes, in book form. This work was placed in the hands of a competent committee, of which Mrs. Victoria Matthews is chairman, and is now being edited by her.</p>
                  <p>All of the members of the Auxiliary Committee did nobly in their hospitable endeavors to make their guests, the conventioners, comfortable and happy, but Mrs. Rosetta Lawson was so conspicuous for her self sacrificing zeal and courtesy as to merit special mention, and more substantial recognition even by those who profited by her unremitting efforts in behalf of unity and fraternity.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Gray were also enthusiastic workers in the convention. Mr. Gray and Mr. Andrew Hilyer both made stenographic reports of the meetings for leading Washington newspapers.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Jennie Napier Kemp, secretary of the Twin City Woman's Era Club, St. Pau and Minneapolis, was the only lady newspaper correspondent sent to report proceedings. She represented the leading daily paper of' Minneapolis.</p>
                  <p>Miss Georgia Washington's plea for the plantation women, written and delivered by one who is herself an example of what education will do for this class, was the most encouraging feature of the whole exhibition.</p>
                  <p>When the "Boy of the Convention," Master Charles Aked Barnett, was presented to the convention by Mother Harriet Tubman the scene was impressive and thrilling. it was as though one was standing at the intersection of a tiny stream just bubbling from its source, and of a great useful river about to glide with easy fulness into the sea. It was as the clasping of hands of the early nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>
                  <p>If crowded night sessions, an attentive throng of serious faces in the galleries and hearty applause in the right place be a sign of interest taken by the Washingtonians in the proceedings, then indeed was the interest great. Altogether we have stood before the public, attracting an attention on all sides that was perhaps never dreamed of, even in the most sanguine expectations of the projectors of the organization.</p>
                  <p>If there was no downright frivolity during the continuance of the sessions there were many mirth-provoking incidents and personages. The photographer was one of the latter. No one ever thought of asking his name or calling him anything but "the photographer." He was omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. He seemed to have always in his mind the passage in the prayerbook, "Whenever two or three are gathered to-
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
gether in thy name -" for wherever and whenever two or three of the delegates were found at any given point, the photographer was there, camera, battered derby and all, and in less than two minutes perhaps there was a group posing. Even at the last moment when a crowd of us were gathered at the Pennsylvania railroad depot ready to go the photographer was there with a profane suggestion of a parting group. Long rest his piece of mind for the bad pictures he turned out!</p>
                  <p>Some of the most enjoyable moments of the days spent in Washington were those of the noon lunch in the church basement. It was always a lively scene of kaleidoscopic interest. A shifting of faces, forms and an incessant buzz of voices, hungry voices and eager ones. It was during the noon hour that old acquaintances were renewed and new ones made; engagements and parties made up and plans, convention and otherwise, formulated and decided upon. lt was a pleasant little social oasis in the desert of the day's work.</p>

                  <p>The Era Club had the largest number of representatives of any one club outside of the District. Eight members arose and responded to the roll call the first day of the convention.</p>
                  <p>The club will resume its regular meetings on Friday evening, September 4, when the delegates will report.</p>
                  <p>Members are reminded of the necessity of immediate preparation for the New England Hospital Fair. The Era Club table must be a credit to the club. Work for the fair stands at the head of this season's calendar.</p>
                  <p>So many questions are constantly being asked, and so many conflicting statements made concerning the cause fot eh call for the first national convention of colored women, held in Boston, July, 1895, it is deemed advisable to republish the circular letter sent out by the secretary of Woman's Era Club, which plainly states the case, and should set at rest forever the charge, often repeated, that that convention was called to discuss one phase of the race question only.</p>

                           <salute>DEAR SISTERS: --</salute>
                           <p>Accompanying this letter is a circular which will explain itself; we respectfully call your attention to it. Although apparently precipitate, the matter of a conference has long been considered by us an we have been led to set the date because of many and peculiar advantages possible at this time. The Christian Endeavor Society brings to Boston fifty thousand delegates in July, railroad rates all over the country are constantly reduced. Many colored women come to Boston at that time as delegates to this convention. The assured presence in this city of so many representative women is too good an opportunity for a coming together to be missed, and although we do not hope that this our first conference will in all respects meet our ideal, yet we trust that it will be the beginning of a movement for creating a community of interest among al earnest women who love purity and demand justice.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi rend="italic">The letter of Mr. Jacks which is also enclosed is only used to show how pressing is the need of our banding together if only for our protection; this is only one of the many matters upon which we need to confer. We do not think it wise to give this letter general publishing and ask you to use it carefully.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Will you call your society together at once and attend to the appointing of delegates and let us hear from you immediately?</p>
                           <p>Circulars giving program, dates, etc., will be mailed to you as soon as you signify your intention to attend.</p>
                           <p>This invitation is extended to all colored women of America, members of any society or not.</p>

                  <p>Miss Maud Cuney of Texas came to the city the first of August, and was heartily welcomed by her host of friends. Miss Cuney is dividing her time among many friends, Miss Glover, Miss Hare, Miss Duncan and Mrs. Ridley all claiming a portion of her time before her return to New York, when she will again be the guest of Mr. and Mrs. T. B. Francis.</p>
                  <p>The intense heat has caused people to take their pleasure rather mildly this summer. There have been few gatherings of any size. A basket picnic at Downer's drew out quite a number, and a musicale at Miss Glover's was thoroughly enjoyed by the young set.</p>
                  <p>Miss Alice Ruth Moore is with her sister, Mrs. Young, at West Medford. As Miss Moore has been quite seriously ill since her arrival, her
<pb n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
friends as yet have had little opportunity to see her. Accompanying Miss Moore is Miss Allain, another charming New Orleans girl.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Furman Shadd of Washington came through Boston on his way home from Martha's Vineyard, where his family is summering, and waked up his friends in his usual hearty, jovial way.</p>
                  <p>Miss Gertrude Baldwin is spending the month of August at her home in Cambridge, or rather that part of it which she does not spend on her wheel.</p>
                  <p>Great preparations are being made for the centennial celebration or Zion's Church. The event calls for wide and general interest; it is one of the evidences of the strength and character of the race, and a record that makes good our claim to be numbered among true Americans.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Archibald II. Grimke, our consul at Santo Domingo, is spending his thirty days' leave in the U.S., and is at present, together with his daughter, the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Lee of Auburndale. Mr. Grimke evidently carried to his life abroad all the enthusiasm and receptivity of the student of life, and the accounts of his experiences abroad are more than delightful to the friends who hear them.</p>

                  <docDate>August 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Friends will be glad to know of Mrs. Washington's improved health. She has passed through a dangerous ordeal, but is now on the sure road to restoration and perfect health. As chairman of the executive committee, Mrs. Washington had hoped to be ready to announce the names of the twenty-one members of her committee, in the association's department of this issue of the ERA. For obvious reasons this announcement must be deferred for another month. Meanwhile, in accordance with power given her by the commission, six ladies have been appointed by Mrs. Washington to draw up temporary rules for the governing of the organization until the next annual meeting, these rules to be submitted for ratification to the whole executive body.</p>

                  <p>This, the latest news received form the Woman's Mine, will be good news to the many investors in this section of the country. Development work to uncover the ore bodies is now being actively pushed, and there will be no cessation or delay until is an accomplished fact that the Bonita Gold and Silver Mine is a steady producing, dividend paying property. At the suggestion of eastern friends, Mrs. E.P. Ensley has been made one of the directors of the Mining Company, and will faithfully look after the interest of eastern investors.</p>

NEW ENGLAND FARM AGENCY.</p>
                  <p>There are in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut many good farms that can be purchased for a reasonable sum of money, and on easy terms of payment</p>
                  <p>We offer our assistance in aiding colored farmers to leave the South and to come and make their homes in the North.</p>
                  <p>We propose to procure farms in any of the above named states for as many of our race as desire, to come North and make their homes among us. We shall give them all the aid in our power, and be only too glad to look them over and see that they obtain all the advantages possible in the respective neighborhoods, until they become accustomed to their new homes and neighbors.</p>
                  <p>It is our intention in procuring these farms to have them near cities and towns in various states, so as to be convenient to school houses, railroard stations and churches.</p>
                  <p>The farms of the North differ from those of the South in that they are more compact, better cleared and attended to in general. Being smaller they are easier to care for. About anything that can be raised on farms in the South can be raised in the North.</p>
                  <p>On these farms are comfortable frame houses, cottage style. Terms of payment will be made to suit.</p>

Professor Sadtler, of the Chair of Metallurgy and Mineralogy of the State School of Mines, speaking of this district, says: "This camp, with proper and systematic development, will be made a second Aspen, if not better."</p>
                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>

                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>

                  <docAuthor>Anne Dillet</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>October and November 1896</docDate>
                  <p>After the business of the annual meeting was over at the New England Hospital for Women and Children on Tuesday, the 27th Oct., all were invited to the Goddard Home by the president, where light refreshments were served. Many of the graduate nurses were present, and one who could remember when there was no home for the nurses' exclusive use. At that time what is now the nurses' home was used as the maternity. The nurses of that period had no such pleasant evenings as we of '95, '95 and '96 have had in the long hall where the piano now stands. I think they certainly deserved their diplomas, for having the heroic courage to pull through the term without the Goddard Home and the piano, which has added much to our happiness. After a hard day of work and discouragements - which we all have - a whirl around the hall did much to cheer our drooping spirits and tired limbs, giving us new zest for tomorrow's work: and those spreads in the Goddard, when some girl has returned from her vacation bringing the good things from home, such as pickles, jams, cakes, apples, etc., or sometimes brought on half days by the more fortunate ones who have their mothers near by, or from the corner store of "odds and ends." Those delightful summer evening spreads of '95, served on the great table-like boulder west of the maternity wards, with iced lemonade, did much to refresh us for the coming morrow, and to say the least the lively band in the adjacent picnic grounds has done its mission. I try to look back and wonder how the pioneer nurses lived through the term. They surely deserve our admiration and love. I was pleased to have the superintendent of nurses ask me to show the improvements of '95 and '96 to one of our graduates of nineteen or more years' standing - the new heating arrangements for keeping the patients' food hot, new sterilizing room at the maternity, the enlargement of the nursery, new boilers and what not - and tell her of many new methods in our work, such as the "floater," etc.: and our new class pin, which was only ready at the last annual meeting, which is composed of a blue enamel Maltese cross, with a wreath of laurel in gold, "New England Hospital Training School - 1863"; and in the center in gold, the bust of Mrs. Ednah Cheney, the president.</p>
                  <p>It is pleasant to feel on returning to Boston that there is the Goddard Home to go to and spend a few hours or an evening, and see familiar objects and loving friends. I do not think that time nor surroundings will ever alienate my affections from the dear N.E. H. </p>
                  <p>The nurses' rooms looked particularly attractive, with the sun streaming in on this beautiful October day, so homelike, and each so characteristic of its occupant.</p>
                  <p>Now that we have our new dispensary building, I hope that time is not far distant when we shall have our new surgical building, with the hope that many of us who love the work and the hospital will be enabled to take a post graduate course.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">HARRIET BEECHER STOWE MEMORIAL.</head>
                  <docDate>October and November 1896</docDate>
                  <p>Those who turned aside from their ordinary line of duty to attend the memorial exercises of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, given by the Woman's Club of Mutual Improvement at Brown's Chapel, A.M.E. Church, on the 22nd ult., were abundantly rewarded for their labor. The church was handsomely decorated for the occasion. The stage was covered with beautiful plants and flowers. In the center of the platform was a large
<pb n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
portrait of Mrs. Stowe, beautifully draped, and surrounded by pots of green choice plants. Miss A.E. Martin presided at the organ.</p>
                  <p>At 8:15 o'clock the president, Mrs. M.A. Dillard, called the meeting to order. After prayer by Mr. John Sims the club sang, "When the Mists Have Rolled Away." Other selections were also sung, including a solo, "Jesus, Lover of my Soul," which was rendered by Mrs. Benj. Moffett, a member of the club.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately Mrs. J.H. Eason was detained at home on account of illness, therefore the paper which she was to have read had to be omitted. Then the president, after a few preliminary remarks, in which she showed up the falsity of the claims made by those in sympathy with slavery thirty-five years ago, introduced Rev. Charles L. Harris, the orator of the evening, who said in part:</p>
                  <p>"The monuments of Egypt, Greece and Rome, as others of less renown, the temples, religions and superstructures of all nations, are based upon some public benefit, fancied or real, derived from the persons whose deeds they commemorate. The gratitude of mankind stands with uncovered head and weeping eyes and burdened heart at the grave of a public benefactor, whose life, though long, seems but a span when once its beneficent rays are quenched. When beneficence, as boundless as eternity, leaps the barriers of race and creed, every emotion of the human heart dictates that gratitude, unfettered and strong, should embrace good deeds wherever found.</p>
                  <p>"The development of the anti-slavery movement produced no stronger character than Harriet Beecher Stowe. Of strong moral character, clear-sighted, warm-hearted, courageous and talented, her pen was mightier than millions of swords. She never suffers by comparison with others. A woman, yet wielding the most incisive pen of the day - a wife, a mother, untrammeled by caste or shackles, yet not so deeply immersed in her own duties as to forget her less fortunate sable sister. A lover of liberty for herself, she finds no rest while this priceless boon is denied the most humble of mankind. She thought if her people knew the hideousness of slavery they would worship at its shrine no longer.</p>
                  <p>"She had a story to tell - a story of great and grievous wrong unredressed and active, whose agents north an perpetrators south had chained the truth and barred the Temple of Liberty. She sung her song: she told her story. The inspiration of heaven dictated it. The mysterious warrior - 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' -- leaped full-armed from her brain to the battle field. Uncle Tom entered the public conscience as no preacher, orator, statesman or press had ever done. It carried conviction. People read and shuddered. It was published in more than twenty different languages. Millions wept with Aunt Chloe at Uncle Tom's departure, laughed with Topsy, prayed with Uncle Tom, or cursed the brute Legree.</p>
                  <p>Great reforms have their flood-tide. When sudden success seems certain, then they ebb, when all gains seem lost. Then with irresistible force a tide wave floods out all opposition, and victory is assured. A Supreme Governor guides human affairs. He fits instruments, and when He wills the blow falls with unerring certainty, and human sagacity cannot evade it. We must "learn to labor and to wait." Mrs. Stowe labored, she waited; she was crowned with success.</p>
                  <p>"Beneficance is sexless. A woman may not inquire, 'What may I, a poor, weak woman do?' But with willing mind, cheerful hands, and a heart aglow with love, do good under all circumstances, -- cheer the faint-hearted, open the door for the returning prodigal, visit the sick, and held the needy whose just pride prevents public aid. Mrs. Stowe's contribution was needed to advance the cause of freedom. We cannot have another like her; but why should not others carry on the work begun by her? Are we too enthusiastic if we expect a continuation of the good deeds already reported of the Woman's Club of Mutual Improvement? Will you forgive the heart-throbs of contemplation with which we view the National Association of Colored Women? From north to south, from east to west it is pledged to the welfare and development of our women along all lines.</p>
                  <p>"The ashes of Mrs. Stowe are buried, but she is not dead. She cannot die. We need no Peter to raise this Dorcas. Her clothing for the poor need no display: for millions of willing hands and loving hearts, responsive to her good deeds, are emulating them: and these good deeds have clothed countless millions in the impenetrable panoply of liberty. Mrs. Stowe's life and labors demonstrate that one woman that wills, can accomplish  more good than many men who <hi rend="italic">will</hi>not."</p>
                  <p>The club then sang a hymn written by Mrs. Stowe - "Knocking, Knocking, Who is There," after which further remarks were made by Rev. 
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
T.J. Bell and Rev. S. F. Kingston, pastors of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches. Mrs. Dillard also told a story from "Uncle Tom's Cabin" for the benefit of the children in the audience.</p>
                  <p>The whole affair was very enjoyable throughout, and every one went home well pleased with what they had heard.</p>

                  <p>The Golden Rule Club held its regular meeting Wednesday evening, Nov. 4, at the residence of Mrs. Wendell Tucker, 5 Jay St., Cambridge. This organization was formed about thirteen years ago. At that time there were no clubs in Cambridge, and the need was felt of something of the kind to bring about unity and sociability. The Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would they should do unto you," was taken for a motto. A monthly fee is paid, and a sick fund is maintained from which the members draw during illness. They aim to assist charity's cause whenever possible. Their efforts have been crowned with success from the beginning to the present time. The officers are: President, Mrs. N.E. Lewis; vice president, Mrs. M. James; treasurer, Mrs. H.C. Lewis; chaplain, Mrs. D. Hayes; secretary, Miss Adelaide Grandison; assistant secretary, Mrs. E. Wilson.</p>

                     <p>In July, 1896, the National Federation of Afro-American Women and the National League of Colored Women met in the city of Washington, and by means of a joint commission, consolidated their forces.</p>
                     <p>Women in both organizations were wise enough to see that more and better work could be done if the two organizations were united. All personal ambitions and petty jealousies were laid aside, thus making the union possible.</p>
                     <p>The new organization is new only in the name it has assumed. It stands as did the two separate halves, as a whole, for the uplifting of womankind.</p>
                     <p>It was decided by the commission that the executive committee draw up rules for the conduct of the association for one year, and so give the committee on constitution ample time to perfect and make that instrument strong.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">FIRST MEETING OF THE WOMEN'S MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA.</head>
                  <docAuthor>Rebecca J. Cole</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>October and November 1896</docDate>
                  <p>The October meeting of the Women's Missionary Society brought together a large and interested audience. It was the first meeting since the convention, and the long-promised time had come when the delegates would tell about the stirring events of July, 1896.</p>
                  <p>They lived it all over again while recounting something of the women who came together to tell the reason of the faith that is in them; how through a torturous course of addresses, papers, debates and business meetings they reached the grand conclusion that even a Negro's life is worth living, and that the tendency of all things, even
<pb n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the Negro's history, is toward the ideal. An important feature of the occasion was the presence of Dr. Du Bois of the Pennsylvania University, who came to tell us something of the work that he has undertaken in Philadelphia for that institution. He gave a rapid sketch of the steps that have developed the science of sociology, and he showed us what is to be gained by the colored people of this city by permitting a free investigation into their sociological condition, that the causes of certain dangerous tendencies may be discovered and, if possible, averted.</p>
                  <p>He has been furnished with a number of figures which say that the Negro contributes an immense disproportion of deaths from consumption, and that he crowds the police courts as does no other class in the community.</p>
                  <p>Now who made these figures but men of a class who are so warped by that strange American disorder, colorphobia, that before accepting their verdict we must be excused for saying we are not ready for the question.</p>
                  <p>On the point of deaths from consumption, I would say this: hosts of the poor are attended by young, inexperienced white physicians. They have inherited the traditions of their elders, and let a black patient cough, they immediately have visions of tubercles. Let him die, and though in the case there may be good reason for a difference of opinion, he writes "tuberculosis," and heaves a great sigh of relief that one more source of contagion is removed.</p>
                  <p>And who makes up the police records? To what class do most of the men in this department belong but to Irish democracy? Who can tell how many white offenders go free, either by bribery or by their own aptitude to escape the consequence of their actions?</p>
                  <p>You see it is the question of disproportion that I am answering. There can be no doubt that the number is large and is steadily increasing, and hence we are glad that a man whose sympathies are with us is seeking to gain information which will answer, among many other things, these two important questions: 1. Are colored people largely forced to live in unsanitary districts, and are they more ignorant and careless about the laws of health, or are they suffering the fate of all exotics?  2. Are the streams of poor and shiftless Negroes that are constantly pouring into Philadelphia responsible for the high criminal records, or do all classes contribute to fill the penal institutions?</p>
                  <p>While I have not implicit faith in these statistics, I recognize a state of affairs which needs the thought and help of those who belong to this accused class.</p>
                  <p>We must teach these people the laws of health; we must preach this new gospel, that the respectability of a household ought to be measured by the condition of the cellar; that to prolong the hours of toil or study or pleasure habitually into the night, when we must be up betimes in the morning, is to rob our offspring of vitality, and invite epilepsy, consumption, and a train of other evils.</p>
                  <p>We must attack the system of overcrowding in the poorer districts by urging our men to contend for laws regulating the number in one dwelling - "Cubic Air Space Laws," we can call them -- that people may not be crowded together like cattle, while soulless landlords collect fifty per cent on their investments.</p>
                  <p>These are the things that we can do to attack vice, disease and crime in their strongholds, for they have no complexion and they always yield to such and to no other treatment.</p>

                  <p>In the latter part of July of this year of our Lord, there assembled in Washington two bodies of women, a few days intervening between the meetings. Both bodies were composed of earnest women, who were working along different lines to accomplish the same result, the betterment of the women of the race, physically, morally and intellectually. It was something new under the sun to see assembled in convention two bodies of intelligent colored women, who had no axes to grind, who were not seeking their own advancement to the utter disregard of the masses that were behind, below or beneath them. It was not only a new, but refreshing sight to see women imbued with higher thoughts, motives and aspirations, than personal aggrandizement. There was only one thing lacking to make the harmony perfect. There were two bodies with the same aims and purposes. Why two bodies and not one was the cry that went up all along the line. Why divide our strength, when the union of our forces will mean the accomplishment of so much more good for the ones we are trying to help? So earnest, so pure of motive were the leading mem-
<pb n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
bers of both organizations, that they were willing to yield to the demand for union, if by so doing the women of the race might be benefitted. So the union was consummated; that there was dissatisfaction, some disappointment, goes without saying. There never yet has been any organization so perfect, that every person connected with it was perfectly satisfied with everything pertaining to it. It is human nature to think and feel that we could have done it so much the better than A or B; that under the same circumstances results would have been different.</p>
                  <p>But we feel no loyal women to the cause will cease her efforts in this great work because everything did not go as she would have wished. That if the work is dearer to her than <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, she will buckle to with renewed energy, and next year there will be one grand Te Deum filled with triumphs of the past year. Nothing was every accomplished by sulking or complaining of what some one else has not done. The thing that should concern us most is, what am I doing? Let us profit by the example of our brothers; too much ambition, self seeking and "ways that are dark" have been the death of every organization gotten up by men for the good (?) of the race, and yet they would advice us what and how to do to make a success of our organization - Physician heal thyself. The summer is past: we are all once more back at our various occupations. Have we brought back to the work renewed strength, zeal and enthusiasm? Did our meetings last summer mean anything to us? Let us begin the practical work at once, let our efforts be redoubled. Let us begin to spread the work, start the sewing schools, the mother's meetings, the kindergartens, the efforts to raise means for charitable work, the literary clubs, everything that means work, earnest, helpful work. If we do this we will forget that there is anything that does not exactly commend itself to us as individuals. Our success or failure depends on the individual: there is no one without his influence and following. Let your influence be wholesome, broad and liberal: let charity take possession of every woman in the organization, and we can write success in bold, glowing letters for the coming year.</p>

Many of Dr. Courtney's political associates were also present.</p>
                  <p>The bride was attended by Miss Miriam Woodbury, assistant treasurer of the American Missionary Association, and was given in marriage by Dr. Beard, secretary of the association. Dr. Courtney was attended by his brother, Mr. Henry Courtney.</p>

                  <p>In the Atlantic Monthly for September is a most excellent article by Mr. Booker T. Washington, "The Awakening of the Negro." It is a very graphic picture of the present condition of the race, its weakness, its progress, its ambition, and its great needs. In reading it, one is impressed not only by the broad and practical common sense of the author as the institutor of the great work now being carried on, but also by his deep insight and keen observations. One of' the best thoughts or suggestions in the article is this:</p>
                  <p>"Let us go on for a few more years knitting our business and industrial relations into those of the white man, till a black man gets a mortgage on a white man's house that he can foreclose at will. The white man on whose house the mortgage rests will not try to prevent that negro from voting when he goes to the polls."</p>
                  <p>Dodd, Mead &#x0026; Co. are about to publish a volume of poems by Paul Lawrence Dunbar, with in introduction by William Dean Howells. Mr. Dunbar is a full-blooded American Negro. He has a pleasing, manly and refined face, and until recently was an elevator boy in Dayton, Ohio. His best work is in the dialect of his race. A few of his verses have been appearing occasionally in the magazines, and coming to the attention of Mr. Howells, he discovered in him a poet of undisputed talent. Mr. Howells says of him: "What struck me in reading Mr. Dunbar's poetry was what had already struck his friends in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. They had felt as I felt, that however gifted his race had proved itself in music, in oratory, in several other arts, here was the first instance of an American Negro who had evinced innate literature . . . . So far as I could remember, Paul Dunbar was th only man of pure African blood and American civilization to feel the Negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically. It seems to me that this had come to its most modern consciousness in him, and that his brilliant and unique achievement was to have studied the American Negro objectively, and to have represented him as he found him to be with humor, with sympathy, and yet with what the reader must feel to be with entire truthfulness. I said that a race which had come to this effect in any member of it, had attained civilization in him; and I permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to vanish in the arts; that these were to be final proof that God had made of one blood all nations of men. I thought his merits positive and not comparative, and held that if his black poems had been written by a white man I should not have found them less admirable. I accepted them as evidence of the essential unity of the human race, which does not think or feel black in one and white in another, but humanity in all."</p>

                  <p>The sensation of the hour in Massachusetts politics is the election (altogether unexpected) of a colored man, Mr. Isaac Allen, to the Governor's Council. If the evidence against Mr. Allen can be trusted, it would seem that his election is not creditable to his race, his party or his state. Yet distressing as is this aspect of the case, public attention will hardly fail to note another view a thousand times more deplorable. It is of far less significance that the councilor-elect may not be fit than that the political management of the state should use her highest offices for such questionable ends. It makes it no better that in this case the nomination was supposed to mean nothing. The motive is as contemptible from this point of view as it is from any other. Whatever the election of Mr. Allen may prove, the political "power that be" must shoulder it.</p>
                  <p>The WOMAN'S ERA club table at the N. E. Hospital for women and children will be a stationary table with photographs and autographs of distinguished women and men. A feature will be a collection of the best books and photographs of colored authors. Notably those of Frederick Douglass, Dr. Wm. E. B. Duboise, Hon. Archibald Grimke, Paul Dunbar, Miss Alice Ruth Moore, Miss Rachel Washington, Mrs. Casneau, Dr. Wm. W. Brown.</p>

                     <p>At the last meeting of the year, ending May 15, 1896, all the old officers of the club were reelected for the year ending May, 1897. For president, Mrs. Booker T. Washington; vice president, Miss S. Helene Porter; secretary, Miss Elizabeth E. Lane; treasurer, Miss Sarah Hunt; librarian, Miss Mattie Childs; executive committee, Mrs. Josephine Turpin-Washington, Mrs. Adella Hunt-Logan, Mrs. Emma Garret-Young.</p>
                     <p>Owing to the enforced absence of the president, who has been in an invalid state for four months, the vice president presided at the first club meeting of the year, on Friday evening, Sept. 14.</p>
                     <p>Miss Elizabeth Morse, of Framingham, Mass., Miss Lilian Rochan, of New Orleans, and Miss Lizette Pinn, of Zanesville, Ohio, are valuable accessions to the faculty of the school this year, therefore to the club, and they delighted hearers, seen and unseen, with instrumental and vocal solos.</p>
                     <p>The executive committee had presented a subject of vital importance for the discussion of the club, and many members, new and old, were there to carefully consider "The Mortality of the Negro." Miss Lilian Heywood of Boston talked in an impromptu way on intemperance as a cause; Miss L. Rochan discussed the subject from the point of negligence; Mrs. A. M. Craig, who comes to us as a voter from Kansas, and a bride of a member of the faculty, gave some very suggestive and telling remarks on poverty as a cause. Miss Estelle Penney, in a touching manner, spoke of the alarming rate of infant mortality among the colored people, and urged each member of the club to sound the alarm among the many inhumane mothers who, from causes for which they might find a cure, bring into the world so many weak, puny infants, born to die before a few months pass over their heads. Miss Pinn said that she was sure that the root of the matter lies in the dense ignorance of the masses, and the alarming rate of mortality will be lessened wherever they are in
large numbers, north, south, east or west, when they have taken the advantage of education and heeded the laws of health.</p>
                     <p>Along this line Mrs. Josephine Turpin-Washington gave some opinions of Prof. F. L. Hoffman on "Race Traits and Tendencies of the
<pb n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
American Negro." There are doubtless some prejudices existing in the mind of the author, still he gives some facts that are startling to the sober mind, and yet some of the traits and tendencies should be brought home to the mind for consideration and extraction, if necessary.</p>
                     <p>The discussion was intensely interesting and profitable, and will doubtless result in good seed being sown in the departments in the club.</p>
                     <p>Mrs M. F. Melvin will devote her spare moments in the interest of the ERA this year. Plans for the year's work for the club are in abeyance until the president, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, has returned "to her own again." In the meantime the executive committee will be planning a literary program for the current quarter.</p>

                     <p>One beneficent result of the July conventions is the general awakening created. Human nature will always be human nature, and it needs a little prodding now and then. The spirit of emulation has been thoroughly aroused, and the desire to do something worth while is in many quarters, plainly evident.</p>
                     <p>The certainty that the time when we must give account of our stewardship will soon come around again furnishes the stimulus for increased activity. If this were the only result the conventions were not held in vain.</p>
                     <p>Washington clubs are all astir again. Plans are being laid and are put into execution as rapidly as possible.</p>
                     <p>The Ladies' Auxiliary has held two interesting meetings and has projected work along several lines. One branch of the charity work will be mothers' meetings. In this city, where there is so much suffering among the poor during the cold months of the year, there is no calculating the good that is done by gathering in the older women from homes of desolation and strife into a warm room to receive a work of cheer and advice. Necessary garments are cut for them, and they are taught in many cases how to put them together. The cup of coffee and biscuit which furnishes the repast is thoroughly enjoyed by them, and no doubt these meetings help many to better ways of life: at any rate a little sunshine is thus thrown into their empty lives. That somebody does care for them is in itself an uplifting thought, and eases many a worn and weary soul. I believe in helping the children, but there is a wonderful amount of satisfaction in doing something for these older ones. This branch of the work falls under the Loving Service Section. The literary feature for the winter will be to study the lives of characters of our own race to whom only casual attention has been given: as for instance Sojourner Truth, Phyllis Wheatley, Crispus Attucks, Harriet Tubman and others. This is a matter which should commend itself to all, but it is of especial importance to the rising generation that they should be familiar with the valorous lives and self-sacrificing deeds of those in their own ranks, so that in an interchange of views, a Douglass may be placed beside a Washington, a Harriet Tubman beside a Joan of Arc, and so on to the end.</p>
                     <p> This lack of knowledge of our own distinguished people was forcibly impressed upon me on one occasion when in a company of highly intelligent women the name of Amanda Smith was mentioned, and of them all only the one who mentioned the name had ever heard of Amanda Smith.</p>
                     <p>In addition to the two sections named there is a Social Purity Section and a Culture Section, the work of which will at some future time be outlined.</p>

                     <p>[Extract from a paper read at the first Sunday afternoon meeting of W. E. C. by Mrs. F. R. Ridley, Secretary.]</p>
                     <p>The woman's club, that broad institution devoted to general advancement and cultivation, has made itself so much a part of the life of today that the time will soon come when we will accept it as it necessary adjunct of our civilization, and forget that there was ever a time when we were clubless. And yet the movement is almost <hi rend="italic">fin de siecle</hi>. Fifty years ago the average woman knew nothing of life save as she saw it from her own fireside, and her participation in public affairs was extremely limited. Today the average woman is studying the currency question, and has an active interest in at least one home or hospital. A movement so comprehensive, so spontaneous and so general must necessarily be grounded upon deep and vital principles and have grown out of actual needs and necessities. As much as the club movement means in the way of new opportunities and privileges for women, it has a deeper meaning and a higher significance: it is in its way a recognition and realization of the oneness of the race and of our common brotherhood. In this respect it is a worthy movement of the time and of the country, founded upon the principles of the democracy; it is in line with the great movements and one of the steps toward the time when man shall love his neighbor as himself.</p>
                     <p>Consider the scope of the subjects considered and work undertaken by the woman's clubs of the country: Better homes for the poor, more <sic corr="homes">Homes</sic> for the unfortunate, shortened hours and better sanitary surroundings for laborers, temperance reform, moral education, domestic economy, the spread of general culture. To all these questions the women are bringing enthusiasm and interest. They are questions which especially appeal to them, and which they are fitted by nature and by enlarged opportunities to consider. Thoughtful consideration along these lines cannot but have great influence upon public sentiment, and in time bring about the desired reform. How shallow, how without thought the criticism that the woman's clubs mean nothing but "talk, talk." "Why don't they do something?" Some people's measure of good is an entirely material one; they recognize little that cannot be seen or handled, and consider nothing an advantage that does not add to material prosperity. We are all too much under the control of material things, and too slow to recognize the power of thought. A woman's club may not build a home for the unfortunate, but if it opens the eyes and the hearts of its members to the condition of these unfortunates, if it considers ways in which their misfortune might be averted, if it extends its intelligence and influence over the conduct of those who have the institution under management, it is fulfilling its mission, and a noble one, too; and the woman who cannot see it is sadly in need of the enlightenment she could find in the club. The essence of club life is talk, but it is talk that is the result of thought, and it is peculiar, to say the least, that those who will talk most assiduously about nothing should make such objections to the talk, which is of something, and it is a tribute to the intelligence of women that she has come to a realization of her power and is using it along the line of her greatest talent, her ability to talk. It is almost an inspiration that has opened up club life to her and given her the opportunity to use her influence through her strongest medium, her general felicity of language.</p>
                     <p>It is true the club is all talk; it was created to furnish opportunities for talk, but it is talk that means something: it may be pure fun or wit, but never vapidity.</p>
                     <p>However, in the conduct of life, each must he largely a law unto himself. Our needs, our duties are varied, and it is possible that in some lives clubs should have no place, and yet clubs tire so broad in spirit and catholic in taste, and elective in subjects of study, that it would seem that through them every woman might be reached, and surely a woman could receive little from them that is not beneficial. There are those who will carry anything to extremes, and because some abuse their privileges and neglect other duties for club work, it does not prove that club work is not beneficial. In considering the value of woman's clubs, we have dwelt largely with the more direct and apparent advantages. It is well that we should give some thought to club life in its deepest significance.</p>
                     <p>We are all children of our Father, traveling, one road dependent upon one another, not only for social life and diversion, but for inspiration, education and an opportunity to call into life and activity the virtues that are dormant within us. This getting out and mingling together is bringing us to a realization of our common humanity; it brings us face to face with our own deficiencies

and the worth of others. It is one of the longest steps toward our salvation.</p>
                     <p>There is no factor in modern times so active in bringing about a universal brotherhood or sisterhood. It is supplementing the work of the public school and the church, for the clubs have opened the doors of the homes and found a common meeting ground based on worth and a common humanity.</p>
                     <p>There are still those who consider exclusiveness a virtue and are proud of a limited acquaintanceship. Women's clubs are helping to bring us to a recognition of the truth that true dignity does not need barriers in order to preserve itself; that snobbishness is a vice, and that while friendship should be bound by congeniality, neighborliness should know no bounds. The club means the spirit of neighborliness with the world, the recognition of our duty toward our neighbor, and not only of our common humanity but our common divinity; the club helps us not only to make the best of that within us, but to see the best of that in others. In this aspect it is the embodiment of a great principle; a principle which may not be always worked out in this form, but which nevertheless will never die; a principle with which we are to enter in and partake of everlasting life.</p>

                     <p>The club continues to grow in interest, work and numbers. At every meeting for the last two months there has been from one to three applications for membership.</p>
                     <p>At our last regular meeting, Sept. 22, 1896, the club discussed parliamentary rules and usages. The club meets in its own club rooms.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. E. S. Clenlans, the treasurer of the Woman's Club, gave a delightful reception in honor of Miss Baker and Miss Haynes. Miss Baker is a graduate of Omaha, and is now principal of one of the schools in Corsicana, Texas. Miss Haynes is a teacher at Beatrice, Neb. There are few homes more perfectly appointed for the giving of a large afternoon or evening party. Assisting Mrs. Clenlans were the president of the Woman's Club, Mrs. Craig, the recording secretary, Mrs. Coleman, the corresponding secretary, Miss Sley, Mrs. Wade, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Danna.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Clenlans wore a rich costume of black satin, trimmed with passementerie.</p>
                     <p>Miss Baker appeared in an elaborate toilette of old rose silk, trimmed in thread lace.</p>
                     <p>Miss Haynes graced it lovely costume of white brocaded satin.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Craig looked particularly beautiful in a costume of corn-colored silk with pearl trimming. Mrs. Coleman was gowned finely in a Paris creation of emerald green velvet.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. Spencer wore a dainty gown of red silk.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. Wade looked charming in a black and white satin.</p>

                     <p>The inauguration of a new feature in the work of the Woman's Era Club was a complete success. The first of a series of public Sunday afternoon meetings was held on the 17th of October at the Twelfth Baptist Church. It was a novel feature in its way, and drew a large crowd of women interested in the work, and men, curious to know just what the work meant. The latter were skeptical and quite prepared to smile with superior indifference, but changed their minds before the afternoon was over.</p>
                     <p>After the opening prayer Mrs. Ruffin spoke, explaining the scope, ends and aims of club work among women, the work of the July convention in Washington and the winter plans for the Woman's Era Club. Mrs. Hannah Smith and Mrs. Agnes Adams, delegates to the Washington convention, presented each an able and interesting report.</p>
                     <p>The main feature of the afternoon, however, was a paper by Mrs. Florida Ridley on club life among women. It was a splendid effort and was deeply appreciated by the audience. Mrs. Ridley's paper did more, perhaps, towards <sic corr="dispelling">dispeling</sic> from the minds of the cynically disposed present, all doubts as to the efficacy of woman's clubs than any other feature of the meeting.</p>
                     <p>Music was furnished by a well-chosen choir under the direction of Mr. George Ruffin. The collection taken till was turned over to the church.</p>
                     <p>The next in the series was held Sunday afternoon, Nov. 15, in the interest of the Manassas Industrial School. Miss Jennie Dean, the principal, and Mrs. Whitman from the Lend-A-Hand Club, spoke, and Mrs. Nellie Brown Mitchell
sang gloriously. A generous collection was given Miss Dean.</p>
                     <p>The Phyllis Wheatley Club of New Orleans, after laboring earnestly during all the heated summer term, have succeeded in opening their sanitarium and training school for nurses in connection with the medical department of New Orleans University. The opening exercises were largely attended and quite interesting. The members of the P.W.C. deserve great credit for having, in so short a time, succeeded in establishing a work that must eventually grow and prosper.</p>

                  <head rend="aligncenter">CHICAGO'S PROVIDENT HOSPITAL AND TRAINING SCHOOL. - SOCIAL MATTERS.</head>
                  <docAuthor>Fannie Barrier Williams</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>October and November 1896</docDate>
                  <p>One of the most notable events in local affairs is the completion of the new and beautiful building for Provident Hospital and Training School for Nurses. The existence and noble purposes of this institution have been mentioned more than once in the ERA, but people not living in Chicago can scarcely appreciate how much it means to the progressive spirit of the colored people of this great city.</p>
                  <p>Provident Hospital and Training School was conceived in the brain and heart of Dr. Daniel H. Williams, now Surgeon in Chief of Freedman's Hospital, Washington, D.C. When he suggested the idea of such an institution six years ago, he instantly had the co-operation of many of the very best people of the city. But at best, Provident Hospital was but an experiment. It began modestly in a small rented building. Soon, however, the importance and noble usefulness of this institution was recognized by all Chicago. By clean, careful and economic management, the institution grew in favor and demand beyond the most sanguine hopes of its generous founder.</p>
                  <p>Among the friends attracted to it are such men as P.D. Armour, Geo. M. Pullman, H.H. Kohlsaat, Geo. H. Webster and Marshall Field. It is a splendid evidence of the shrewdness and
<pb n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
efficiency of the management of the institution that they were able to win the interest and confidence of these men of wealth.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Armour became so much interested that he gave $20,000 for a new building, ad the other gentlemen gave nearly $20,000 more for furnishing and endowment. The building was completed and turned over to the people October 29th.</p>
                  <p>The building is four stories in height, constructed of red brick and terra cotta, in the style of the Italian Renaissance. It is pronounced by architects, engineers and physicians to be the most perfectly equipped and most beautiful institution of its kind in the country. It is no exaggeration to say that, outside of schools, no institution in the country, owned and managed by colored people, is so thoroughly up to date in all of its appointments and possibilities as Provident Hospital and Training School. The opportunity offered for the training of nurses as a profession and for young colored physicians is unexampled. Many of the best physicians and surgeons of both races are on the medical staff. Indeed, the institution is so broad in its aims, sympathies, and opportunities that it is something more, even, than a colored hospital and training school.  It has served an excellent purpose in bringing both races together, and has been one of the best modifiers of race prejudice in the city.</p>
                  <p>The opening celebration of the new building, on the 28th inst., was a great social event. There was such a mixing up of millionaires and poor people in terms of social equality as is seldom witnessed outside politics. The officers of the institution are Lloyd G. Wheeler, president; Dr. C.E. Bentley, secretary; and J.S. Madden, treasurer. These well known business men, together with other representative citizens of Chicago, have been connected officially with Provident Hospital ever since its creation, and to them belong the credit for its remarkable success.</p>
                  <p>I scarcely know how to write about social matters in Chicago. Mere personalities and society functions are not very safe things to indulge in by correspondents. It may be said, however, that Chicago is peculiarly independent in social matters. Here there is more of sociability than "society." The conventionalities and artificialities of society life generally are less important in Chicago than in most cities. This condition seems to be due to several distinct causes; among them are the churches, clubs and other organizations that have sprung up in response to new duties to civic interests. We are particularly fortunate in having an exceptionally progressive and intelligent ministry. The majority of our city ministers are college-bred men. They have all been in touch with the very best forces of the day. They are all liberal to the extent of making their church influence important and salutary in every thing in which the people generally are interested. It is not an unusual thing to see representative laymen, and even non-church going men and women, occupying the pulpits in behalf of some cause which, while not exactly religious, yet needs the moral helpfulness of church influence.</p>
                  <p>Then such clubs as the women's clubs, the King's Daughters, and the women's auxiliaries to the hospital are all doing much to infuse into the social life a more inclusive spirit of sympathy and fellowship among all the people. In no community will personal worth alone give a person better social recognition than here in Chicago.</p>
                  <p>The passion for education and culture among our young people is a matter of much gratification. In nearly all the professional schools, in medicine, law, theology, in both the great universities, in the business colleges and conservatories of music, art and oratory, may be seen young colored men and women diligently at work. To Miss Cora Jackson belongs the distinction of being the first of the colored race to receive a university degree from the Chicago University. Her work in the university has been a matter of great pride to us all, both because of its influence and of her personal worth and charm as a young woman.</p>
                  <p>Miss Mabel, the winsome daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L.G. Wheeler, expects to follow Miss Jackson by entering the university in December. She has had exceptionally good preparation for university work, and we bespeak for her a sure success.</p>
                  <p>Her many friends throughout the country will feel like extending greetings to Mrs. Theodore Lee Purnell of Washington, but formerly our own Theodora. Interest in her as a proud young mother will be no less cordial than was the interest in her as the most charming and popular young woman in the western Metropolis.</p>

                  <p>Mrs. F.P. Clary of Cambridge was agreeably surprised by her many friends at her home, Baldwin street, Oct. 27, 1896, the occasion being her 80th birthday.</p>
                  <p>Miss Ethel Lewis, recent graduate of the Cambridge Latin School, is attending Bryant &#x0026; Stratton Commercial School.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. G.W. Lewis and Miss E.M. Clary will give their first assembly on Nov. 19, 1896, Roberts Hall, Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>The WOMAN'S ERA Eminent Women Series should be in every household.</p>
                  <p>All members of the National Association, as well as many others, will be interested to know that a daughter was born to the president, Mrs. Mary Church Terrell.  We are sorry that we are obliged to add that the little stranger only lived a couple of days. Mr. and Mrs. Terrell have the sympathy of hosts of friends.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. B.R. Wilson are receiving congratulations on the birth of a son.</p>
                  <p>"Noah's Ark," the coming entertainment by the Charity Club, is expected to be a brave social function as well as to put lots of money into the treasury for the Charity Hospital. Jos. Lee, of Woodland Park Hotel, who catered for the Food Fair just closed at Mechanic's Building, will also serve the more select host of charity workers in the same place.</p>

                  <p>Did You Ever Make Money Easy?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Editor. - I have read how Mr. C.E.B. made so much money in the Dish Washer business and think I have beat him. I am very young yet and have had little experience in selling goods, but have made over eight hundred dollars in ten weeks selling Dish Washers. It is simply wonderful how easy it is to sell them. All you have to do is to show the ladies how they work and they cannot help but buy one. For the benefit of others I will state that I got my start from the Mound City Dish Washer Co., St. Louis, Mo. Write to them and they will send you full particulars.</p>
                  <p>I think I can clear over $3,000 the coming year, and I am not going to let the opportunity pass. Try it and publish your success for the benefit of others.   J.E.C.</p>

                  <p>The Great Mineral Basin it Pitkin covers an area as large as that of Leadville, Aspen and Red Cliff combined. Professor Sadtler, of the Chair of Metallurgy and Mineralogy of the State School of Mines, speaking of this district, says: "This camp, with proper and systematic development, will be made a second Aspen, if not better."</p>
                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>What, then, shall we expect of Pitkin and the Quartz Creek District, which has a mineral bearing area as large as these three districts combined, when so far the developments there have proved the mineral deposits to be fully as rich and extensive?</p>
                  <p>We can come to but one conclusion: Its wealth is limitless, and no more safe or profitable field for investment can be found.</p>
                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>The ore is high grade, netting from fifty to one thousand dollars per ton, average two hundred and fifty. The Company has undisputed title to the entire property, which is free from any <sic corr="encumbrance">incumbrance</sic>, and will be kept so.

                  <docDate>January 1897</docDate>
                  <p>The failure of Mr. Joseph Lee, the proprietor of Woodland Park Hotel, Auburndale, Mass., has carried consternation all over the country.  This failure is one to be particularly deplored, and it is in the nature of a public calamity.  For twenty-one years Mr. Lee and his wife have put money, brains and industry into their work, and this hotel had become one of the famous ones of this neighborhood.  In every respect it was first class and entertained many distinguished people.  In its way it was unique, for it is seldom that a suburban hotel, with all the accompaniments of parks, tennis grounds, stables, etc., can find a large winter patronage, but so attractive was the table and inner appointments that rooms were in demand here throughout the entire year.</p>
                  <p>The Woodland Park Hotel was a source of pride to the whole race, and the large number who have been entertained there cannot but feel a personal loss in this failure.</p>
                  <p>However, Mr. Lee has a couple of lucrative patents upon the market, and these together with his name and fame as a caterer must offer opportunities for the future.</p>
                  <p>In the restaurants conducted by Mr. Lee in several large fairs recently, it was decided novelty to see the help mixed, colored and white waitresses, clerks, cooks, etc.  The work that was being done by him was so valuable that we feel, to repeat, that his failure is a great public calamity.</p>

                  <p>At the fair for the New England Hospital for Women and Children, a Woman's Era Table helped in a modest way to make up that grand total of $13,000, which has gone into the treasury of the hospital as the financial result of many weeks of preparation by enthusiastic charity workers all over New England, and one delightful week of barter, sale and social intercourse in Tremont Temple, where the fair was held. The Rhode Island was the banner table, turning in to the treasurer of the fair about $1,700 net.</p>
                  <p>Following immediately upon the heels of the Hospital fair came the Woman's Era's special effort for St. Monica's Home, for sick and destitute colored women and children, tht was held in the lecture room of St. Augustine Church for three days only.  Nevertheless and despite adverse happenings (for the fair), in the shape of big weddings and other parties coming upon each evening the fair was running, the receipts were more than sufficient to supply the Home with all of its fuel for the year.  An Ednah D. Cheney Table was a feature of this fair.  This table was named in recognition of the large interest taken in and contributions given to it by Mrs. Cheney.  The articles from this table still unsold are to e used as a nucleus for still another effort for St. Monica's benefit.  Some time during the winter a supplementary sale will be held in the parlors of the Home, when it is expected that a good sum will be added to that already standing to the credit of the W.E. sewing circle.</p>

                  <p>SISTERS:</p>
                  <p>With the hope of establishing a truly National Association, representing all conditions of, our women, a department of organization was created, when the National Federation of Afro-American Women and the National Colored Women's League united, last July, in Washington, D. C. The object of the National Association of Colored Women is the development and protection of our womanhood, our homes and our history, as an integral part of the great American nation. The department begins its work burdened with many obstacles. In the first place the expense of carrying on necessary correspondence, printing and numberless incidentals pertaining to active and conscientious work must be borne personally by the national organizer during this first year, and those who shall, for love of the work, and what in the providence of our Heavenly Father we hope it may mean to us as race, volunteer to help her. It is too early in the history of the association to expect it to be otherwise. It will take at least a year to get in regular order to begin taxations for departmental work. This must be apparent to all. Women have been taxed only for the maintenance of local clubs, and the expenses attached to the holding of annual conventions, consequently there is no money in the treasury for this work. Therefore, I beg our loyal, race-loving women to rally to this call, and assist in putting our association on as firm a basis as any among American women.</p>
                  <p>The honor and dignity of our cause will permit no hesitation or lack of interest without entailing upon us the sneers and contempt of those who have preceded us in movements of this kind. As .I partially organized body, we can have no hope of permanency. Without state organizations we are not representative. As we stand today, we represent about five thousand members -- the nucleus of a splendid force. We are too far apart -- we must be concentrated, as to purpose and method of procedure. The work of the Department of Organization is ten-fold. It must not only strive to add new clubs to the National Association, but must labor wherever practicable and consistent for the deepening of the interests and activities of the women already within the fold. As a means to this end, every club in the National Association will receive a copy of this open letter, which is addressed to them as a personal appeal urging upon their officers the great necessity of engaging in some form of practical work that the same may be done in an orderly and business-like way, and the details of any successful undertaking to be sent to the WOMAN'S ERA, our official organ, so that others anxious to work may be benefited in the matter of method and starting. Every locality needs a woman's club -- there can be no question about that. The vital question is, will the women do the work that they see is needed close to their very doors in every locality where our people live?</p>
                  <p>Owing to the absence of regular appropriation to cover traveling expenses, the work must be carried on by correspondence, except in instances where women will call meetings and raise traveling expenses for organizer, either state or national. In no case will charges be made for personal service. As fast as women can be found who are willing to undertake state or section organization, such will be appointed. Advice and suggestions on this head will be gladly received. Where no state organizer has been appointed, the officers of any club in good standing may be of great assistance to this department. Any energetic woman desirous of aiding the work can call a number of women together for the purpose of organizing them. After the officers are chosen and the object decided upon, a correct list of members'
<pb n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
names, officers' names and addresses, with object, should be mailed to national organizer, who will supply application blanks for club membership in the National Association.</p>
                  <p>It is a matter of very grave concern, not to say humiliation and discouragement, that a great number of our women, favored in many ways beyond the masses, thus far seem inclined to regard indifferently the advantages accruing from thorough and harmonious organization. There can be no doubt that in organization woman has come into closer contact with woman, which unquestionably leads to the more perfect development of the useful woman, and through the intermingling of the universally united sympathies, a nobler, broader-minded woman. The latent activities of our women must be aroused, the almost universal indifference of our young people to things uplifting and ennobling must be checked, and the true missionary spirit must be developed and encouraged for the good of future generations. Organization dominated by judgment and necessity must be our watchword. We know the evils threatening the welfare of our people. Systematic organization will not only afford relief but will prevent retrogression, by the establishment of new and wholesome interests among our young people. It is the hope of your national organizer to report, at the convention of 1897, a vigorous club in every state in the Union, and in a majority of the cities and towns, and to that end I call upon my sister women throughout the country to help by a mighty exhibition of' womanly determination and race pride. Sisters! in all earnestness let me ask, will you actively take hold with heart and brain and place our association on a foundation second to none in America? We can do it if we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> to do it! Any communication addressed to me at 9 Murray street, New York City, will receive prompt attention. I beg aII before whom this letter falls will consider it in the light of a personal communication.</p>

                     <p>From the October and November ERA I gleaned the fact that clubs are still being formed in different sections of the country. I am more than proud to add to the list another organization of women in our city, trying to work along the lines you are working.</p>
                     <p>After hearing a lecture by Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett of Chicago, in our city, last September 25, we resolved to form among us a woman's club. So, calling a number of ladies together, we organized what is known as "The Woman's Improvement Club," electing Mrs. Frank L. Williams, pres.; Mrs. Jno. Birney, vice-pres.; Mrs. J. J. C. McKinley, sec.; Mrs. William Kelly, assist. sec.; Miss A. M. Bowman, treas.: Miss S. E. Bell, cor. sec. Miss G. A. Nugent has been elected secretary on the reception of Mrs. McKinley's resignation. We number between thirty and forty, and are thriving.</p>

                     <p>The questions on the literary program for discussion for the past. quarter have been: "Mrs. Harriet B. Stowe. Sketch of Her Life," Miss Caroline Williams.  "Influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin," Mrs. J. D. McCall.  "Child Study," by Misses Hunt, Porter and Mrs. Estelle Penney.  "Strength and Weakness of Public Schools of Alabama," by Mrs. Louise Jenkins and Adele Hunt-Logan.</p>
                     <p>Music has been exceptionally good.  Misses Hadley, Morse and Rochan are artist in this particular, and members of the club have enjoyed musical treats given by them and other members of the club who assisted them.</p>
                     <p>The last club meeting of the quarter, held November 20th, was presided over by the president, Mrs. B.T. Washington, for the first time this year. The exercise was unique in its way, for it was wholly devoted to the presentation of "motions," "rules," "amendments," bills nonsensical and otherwise.  They were "ruled out,"
<pb n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
and "tabled," "passed," etc., by strictly parliamentary usages that gave credence to the proceedings as being "a Parliamentary Drill," as had been planned by the executive committee. Much benefit and pleasure were derived from the exercise.</p>
                     <p>The questions for discussion the present quarter are: "Is Woman Suffrage Desirable?" "The Separate Car Law," "Social Life Among Afro-Americans," "Paul Dunbar and Poems," "Training for Domestic Service," and "Frederick Douglas."</p>
                     <p>The first program for this quarter was given on December 4th. Miss Mary Melvin and Louise Cooper discussed the suffrage question.  The discussion brought out many reasons why our women should be encouraged to agitate the question among the clubs.</p>
                     <p>The reports of club departments show an increase of the number over last year, and advance in the line of work done. Some have not been reorganized for this year. Two Social Purity Clubs and the Club of Ministers' Wives are in this list. The Vesta Club of thirty-five town girls is being trained in domestic economy by Mrs. N.B. Young. This club has a charity fund from which members drew to give a Thanksgiving dinner to twelve old ex-slaves whose cabins are being made comfortable by these young women and their teachers.</p>
                     <p>The Ednah Cheney Club, under Mrs. F.B. Thornton, numbers forty young women who are working in the same direction as the Vesta, and whose results bespeak conscientious work. </p>
                     <p>The Department of Band of Mercy, Humane Society, under direction of' Miss L. L. Chapman, numbers fifty young people who are as readv to protect their friends "in feathers and fur" as themselves.</p>
                     <p>The W.C.T.U. gained fresh impetus from the visit of Miss Frances Willard; and the president, Miss S. H. Porter, has been exceedingly successful in enrolling seventy-five members to wear the white ribbon badge.  The semi-monthly meetings do not lag, nor has the outside work among the "hard drinkers" been without effect.</p>
                     <p>The Woman's Conference held weekly in the town of Tuskegee by Mrs. B.T. Washington has its weekly sewing classes among the members this year.  Facilities have been arranged for baths in rooms rented for the work.  Night school is being carried on for the boys, old men and young.  Cooking classes are being taught, a regular course being given in the kitchen that has been fitted for the purpose. Members of the Dorcas Club, an offshoot of conference, attend these classes. Three graded classes are taught here in sewing once per week. A Penny Savings Bank has been established. Depositors are not allowed to draw but once a year. The bank has a number of depositors who seem bent upon having a good "stock."</p>
                     <p>The Margaret Murray Washington Club, under Miss E. E. Lane, is composed of thirty young women to meet the obligations that they have willingly undertaken for the year. The Current History Club, under the direction of Mrs. Adele Hunt-Logan, was not reported because of' her absence.</p>

                     <p>In a staid and respectable old burg like Newport there is little or no reformatory or charitable work demanding the attention of that much overworked party in other and more frisky communities -- the woman with a mission - consequently the Woman's Newport League, after doing all its hands find to do for the public weal, has still time to devote to cultivating and encouraging more social life among all classes in that community. To that winter "sleepy hollow," the League is a most beneficent institution in more ways than one.  The next effort of the League is to be a social one

of roseate color, "a leap year pink tea."  Mrs. Dickerson, the organizer of the League, is also general promoter of all the good efforts made by it.</p>

                     <p>The Woman's Club of St. Louis held its regular meeting Wednesday evening, December 2, at St. Paul's Chapel, Mrs. Haydee Campbell presiding. The meeting was well attended and enthusiasm ran high. Very glowing reports were read
from the five sections into which the club bas been divided, viz: the industrial, charity, study of child nature, literary and social.</p>
                     <p>We wish that each reader might see and feel how far reaching has been the work of this new organization. It has made glad the hearts of many, who have just come to realize how easy it is to broaden out into united usefulness. The industrial section has gone to work with might and main to secure a home. The charity section has given quite a substantial donation to the Colored Orphan Horne from the proceeds of their entertainments to that end. The study of child nature calls for ready interest and co-operation from the hearts of scores of mothers. From our literary work we are hoping to gain much intellectual development. The social section is ever alert to the pleasure of our home friends and the entertainment of all strangers who are lending a hand in the elevation of our womanhood all over this broad land. This section deserves special mention for the efforts they put forth in the reception tendered Mrs. Lucy Thurman, our beloved and honored guest. Mrs. Thurman addressed the club on this occasion, and in her speech made some very graceful remarks on Frances E. W. Harper, whom the club, as a mark of appreciation, made an honorary member at its organization. The next meeting of the club will be on Feb. 14, 1897, to commemorate the birthday of Frederick Douglas.</p>
                     <p>We hope from time to time to drop a word to your excellent paper, in order that we keep in touch with the important work women everywhere are doing.</p>

                     <p>The festivities of the Xmas season "flung their shadows" long before.  On the highways and byways, on the city's crowded pavements, and in the country poultry yard, were seen and heard the avant couriers of this great holiday.  Everywhere hearts were stirred and pulses quickened by the pleasant anticipation.  At this time everybody keeps holiday but the cook, and all sounds known to the human ear seem mingled in a merry paean - save the gobble of the turkey.</p>
                     <p>In the earlier half of the century the pageantry of feasting at Christmastide was carried to its greatest degree of splendor. At the time Christmas was celebrated from All Halloween, October 31, until Candlemas Day, February 2, and the houses of gentry were, during this time, open to all the countryside. The expenses of such entertaining and festivity were enormous.</p>
                     <p>In the diary of the Reverend John Ward, Vicar of Stratford-on-Avon, from 1648 to 1679, it is stated that the Duke of Norfolk expended twenty thousand pounds in keeping Christmas.

Later the good old customs languished, and in Ben Johnson's "Mask of Xmas" is found:</p>
                     <p>"An hue and cry after Xmas. -- Any man or woman that can give any knowledge or tell any tidings of an old, old, very old gray-bearded gentleman, called Christmas, who wanted to be a very familiar guest and visit the rich and the poor -- whosoever can tell what has become of him, or where he may be found, let them bring him back again to England."</p>

But his home is now here, and when the earth silently wraps herself in her white mantle, symbol of immortality, the fires of' hospitality are lighted on the hearths of countless homes, and the spicy odor of the burning Yule log creeps upon the frosty air, mingled with the savory odors of the</p>

                     <p>We have organized a Woman's Club in this city with the following officers: President, Mrs. C. S.

                     <p>Our first work will be to send in a petition to the legislature to repeal the "Jim Crow Car Law," or to make first and second class fares. If we do not succeed in having the law repealed, we shall at least show them we are not satisfied with conditions as they exist. Pray for our success.</p>

                     <p>EDIT0R OF WOMAN'S ERA:</p>
                     <p>Dear Madam: -- We have among us here what was originally known as the Douglass Circle. We organized with the object of cultivating an interest in intellectual work among our women. So far we have progressed <hi rend="italic">very</hi>well; with the money collected from time to time we have entertained our friends who were interested in the work. But we have thought to do other work instead of benefitting those with whom we are immediately connected. With this idea in view it was thought best that we connect ourselves with others, that we may no longer be strangers to other workers in the good cause.</p>
                     <p>We have read with <hi rend="italic">much</hi> interest of the National Association of Colored Women, and seeing that it was made up of local clubs, desired to connect ourselves with it. We at once wrote Mrs. B. T. Washington requesting that she would instruct us as to what steps we must take by which to make application for membership. Mrs. Washington wrote us to send for a copy of the WOMAN'S ERA, the organ of the Association.</p>
                     <p>We therefore write for a copy of' the same, with terms of subscription, and if there be need for any further information, that it may be given.</p>
                     <p>We shall appreciate it <hi rend="italic">very</hi> highly.</p>
                     <p>Assuring you of our interest in the work and our desire to unite with the effort, we are,</p>
                     <salute>Very truly yours,</salute>

                     <p>The Suffrage Club No. 2 held a meeting on Thursday night, December 17, at 2606 Mill street. We had a very interesting meeting, having Rev. S. W. Bachlor to give us a short talk on 'Woman Suffrage. Meeting every first Thursday in the month. Mrs. Maggie Still, 2606 Mill street, president; Mrs. L. V. Carter, 2843 Montgomery street, secretary.</p>
                     <p>The Phyllis Wheatley Club has organized a Sewing School for the children. We have fifty children enrolled on the book; and we have amongst the children a Band of Mercy, not only learning them how to sew, but to love and serve one another. We are not going in our own strength. We remember that the Scripture says, "Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord."</p>
                     <p>A consecrated meeting is held at the residence of Mrs. Carter, 2843 Montgomery street, every Thursday afternoon. The Lord has wonderfully used us as his missionaries. The work is carried on by Maggie Still, Sister Shavous, Sister Comb, Sister Robinson, for visiting the jail, workhouse, hospital, and anywhere duty calls us.</p>

                  <docAuthor>Chicago Conservator</docAuthor>
                  <docDate>January 1897</docDate>
                  <p>In good time for the holiday season has come the issue of Paul Dunbar's new volume of' poems entitled "Lyrics of Lowly Life." The work is issued by Dodd, Mead &#x0026; Co., of New York, and contains an introduction by W. D. Howells. It is to be regretted that notice was not made in our race journals of its expected appearance, for a host of colored people who love their race and who believe in encouraging aspiring manhood would have been most glad to include this book
in their holiday purchase.</p>
                  <p>We do not forget that we owe much to one another. If a colored man writes a good book he should find a large reading constituency among his own people. We should make our patronage so certain and remunerative, that publishers will be glad to put our books upon the market.</p>
                  <p>In that way we can open a way for our aspiring young men and women, which to them thus far has been practically closed. The volume under consideration contains the latest and best of Mr. Dunbar's poems. With only a few years spent in tempting the muse, he spreads before us a feast of poetry and song, inspiring, comforting and satisfying. He has a range which wins commendation from the most severe critic, and gives to the searcher after genus a bounty to draw upon. While his dialect poems constitute a distinctive feature of his work, they by no means overshadow in point of merit the other contributions to his book. His English is chaste, his sentiment exalted, and his verse finished in point of literary excellence. "Lyrics of the Lowly " is destined to hold a high place among the best poetical contributions of the year.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of the new book, the <hi rend="italic">Inter-Ocean's</hi> literary critic says" "Scarcely has a book of poems come to our table during the year more profoundly entertaining than is "Lyrics of Lowly Life."</p>
                  <p>Mr. W. D. Howells writes the introduction to the volume, and says he makes no prophecy for the future, "but if Mr. Dunbar should do nothing more than he has done, I should feel that he had made the strongest claim for the Negro in English literature that the Negro has yet made." Mr. Howells adds: "Had these poems been written by a white man I should not have found them less admirable. I accepted them as an evidence of the essential unity of' the human race, which does not think or feel black in one and white in another, but humanly in all." The poems are elegant in construction, and ringing and musical in every line. The dialect poems are more remarkable and flow so easily and naturally from his pen as to be masterpieces of their kind.</p>

                  <p>In the passing away of Mrs. Rachel Smith, who for twenty-five years was the matron of the Home for Aged Colored Women, the Woman's Era Club has lost a loved co-worker, the Home an intelligent, devoted Christian head, and the community a useful and ornamental member. At the regular meeting of the club immediately following the death of Mrs. Smith, the tributes of respect were paid her memory by the president and other members of the club, followed by five minutes of silent prayer and contemplation of' the virtues of  the deceased. The club's floral offering was a
large bunch of white chrisanthemums and English violets, tied with violet satin ribbon, which was laid upon the bier by a committee from the club in attendance upon the funeral ceremonies.</p>

                  <p>Councilor-elect Isaac B. Allen continues to vindicate the judgment of those who regret that he was ever put forward as a representative of his race for a high station.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">-- Boston Sunday Herald.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a well known fact that if Isaac B. Allen was put forward "as a representative of his race," it was never intended that he should represent them in the governor's council; he was set up as a man of straw to encompass certain ends and then be knocked down. His election is due to a miscarriage of a game of bluff - an old game played against the colored people so often successfully  that the political wire pullers had become reckless and this time got caught in a web of their own weaving. It is the legitimate outcome of a pernicious practice of using unfit candidates simply for effect, before election, with only the shortlived notoriety gained of having been a <hi rend="italic">candidate</hi> for their reward, after election. The result justifies an "I told you so," to the "Napoleon of politics in Massachusetts."</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless and in spite of the alleged moral shortcomings of Mr. Allen and the altogether discreditable exhibitions he has made of himself since his election to a "high station," he is undoubtedly elected, and therefore entitled to the honors and emoluments of the office to which he was chosen; and as the recount and the appeal to the supreme court have failed to prevent his receiving his credentials, it would seem that the latest move of the other contestant and present occupant of the place -- that of carrying his case to the incoming legislature -- will not avail to keep Mr. Allen from taking his place among Governor Wolcott's councilors, not as a "representative of his race," however, but as an unexpectedly successful tool of political tricksters of both parties. That the situation is in embarrassing one all round cannot be denied. There is but one right way out of it, and we predict that Massachusetts will not stultify herself by refusing to adopt that way. She cannot afford to set a dangerous precedent that will some day redound to her confusion, and at once bring down upon her the sneering comments of a waiting, watchful south, to whose methods ill matters political the throwing out of Allen would give encouragement, and countenance by the greatest endorsement possible -- that of imitation.</p>
                  <p>Let it be emphasized that this is no "race issue," and demagogues black and white, north and south, should be thwarted in their attempts to make one of it. It is simply a painful political episode.</p>
                  <p>"Work before Our Women" is the title of a circular issued by the national organizer of' the N. A. C. W., Mrs. Victoria E. Mathews. In it an eloquent appeal is made for activity among all the clubs in the union along all the lines  of work projected and recommended by the two national conferences, the one held in Boston in July, 1895,  and in Washington in July, 1896.  Clubs in the union, and those desiring to become part of it, not having received the circulars, should  send at once to Mrs. Mathews, 9 Murray St., New York, for copies.</p>

                  <p>By letters recently received and printed elsewhere, it will be seen that at last, direct and correct information of the whereabouts and condition of the only daughter of old John Brown has been obtained. An article in the last issue of the ERA brought out letters supplying the desired information in time for the Woman's Era Club of Boston to do its share in the pleasant duty of assisting the daughter of the one modern martyr, but not in time to carry out the plan devised by them upon first hearing of Mrs. Adams' needs. Of the letters and their writers, Mrs. Adams tells the whole, pathetic story. Mr. Allen's but emphasizes the well-known, long-continued interest taken by him and all his family in all anti-slavery, anti-justice, humane measures. Mrs. Lyles is the energetic president and founder of the John Brown Memorial Association, and it is suggested that each club in the National Association of Colored Women send to her five dollars, to be forwarded by her to Mrs. Adams. The Woman's Era Club of Boston will immediately forward their contributions  to the fund.</p>
                  <p>Miss Lyles will return receipts to club secretaries for the monies received from them.</p>

                     <p>Please permit me a little space to answer an inquiry of the ERA, of November, about the whereabouts and conditions of Anna Brown Adams, the daughter of old John Brown, who kept house for him, and with Martha, the girl-wife of Oliver Brown, went down and helped in the preparation for the raid on Harper's Ferry. Martha died shortly after.</p>
                     <p>Anna is now living in Petrolia, Humboldt County, California. She wrote to me and told me about losing her home by fire a short time ago, and is now in want.</p>
                     <p>She is now an old woman, who gave the best of her young life for the colored people, and I feel that we have a right to help her for the sake of her father, brothers, and the other friends who gave their lives for the liberation of the slaves.</p>
                     <p>I am proud to say that my club, the "John Brown Woman's Loyal Union," gave an entertainment and sent her fifteen dollars, and a large box of clothing, bedding, etc. I earnestly hope that other clubs will do likewise.</p>

                     <salute>MY DEAR MRS. LYLES:</salute>
                     <p>I have just received yours of November 9th, with the <sic corr="enclosed">inclosed</sic> fifteen dollars, also the package and pictures so kindly sent. Please accept my most sincere thanks for yourself, and also express my gratitude to the others who so kindly helped.</p>
                     <p>I should be pleased to comply with your request for a picture of myself, but I cannot indulge in such luxuries as having pictures taken.</p>
                     <p>You asked me to tell you how many children I have, and their ages. My two oldest are girls, aged twenty-six and twenty-four years, then two boys, aged twenty-three and nineteen years, then two girls, aged sixteen and fourteen, and two boys aged ten and twelve years, making eight living and two little girls who died, makes ten in all. My oldest daughter works in an overall factory in San Francisco. The next one is working at a hotel in Petrolia. The youngest one is with me. The boys all work all the time, and earn all they can to help along. They have split out timber and built a small sort of a house, but it is not near large enough to accommodate us, and is so full of cracks that the "wind  bloweth as it listeth," through it. I have 300 acres of land, but I owe a debt that will soon yawn and swallow it. I have offered all my letters, pictures, and little keepsakes for sale, to raise the money to pay this off, but as times are hard, people can do without old relics. </p>
                     <p>Our crops were almost a perfect failure last year, so we neither had anything to sell, nor have we seed for planting next year's crops. Please accept my thanks for the offer to send a box of clothing, but as the winter rains have set in early, we are shut out of the world for months to come. It would not reach here until late next spring. We live five miles from town and one mile from the nearest neighbor, in a wild, moutainous country, nine miles back from the sea shore. It has rained nearly all this month, so the roads are now impassable to the nearest seaport town, which is about sixty miles from here. We are so shut in from all the rest of the world that any reading matter is welcomed and duly appreciated by us. I will enclose a slip from a paper sent me by my old friend, H.K. Rust. He was an acquaintance of my father's, and has been a good friend of our family for a great many years.</p>
                     <p>The weather has been so cold and stormy that I have been unable to finish this letter and send
<pb n="10 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
it to the post office. Please pardon the delay. Nothing can now reach me, except through the post office, for several months to come. It is weeks and sometimes months at a time that I never see a woman during the rainy season, and seldom at any time in the year, so I have no social life whatever.</p>
                     <p>I would be pleased to see some of the Afro-American papers once in a while, that I might know something of the progress the people are making. My children have all had to go to work as soon as they were old enough to earn anything, so they have to be satisfied with small wages, and any kind of work they can get.</p>
                     <p>The money you so kindly sent has bought me a much needed pair of stout shoes to keep my feet dry, and will help me to get some more things that I need. God bless you all.</p>

                     <p>In reading the WOMAN'S ERA, just received this evening, I noticed on pages 14 and 15 the inquiry concerning the location of Mrs. Anna (Brown) Adams, daughter of John Brown of heroic memory and world wide known. </p>
                     <p>When in Pasadena, Cal., in 1893, visiting my friend, Prof. T.S. C. Lowe, projector and chief owner of the electric railway from the foot to the summit of Mt. Lowe, by which one can pass, in thirty to forty-five minutes, from orange laden groves to a sleigh ride upon the summit. Professor Lowe introduced me to Hiram Brown - I think his name was Hiram -- a younger brother of the famous John Brown, who (Hiram) was an <sic corr="employee">employe</sic> of the professor. I had quite a conversation with Hiram, both Professor L. and myself having been Garrisonian abolitionists, sympathizers with John Brown, fully as cordial as with Lafayette in his heroic efforts in our country's behalf during our revolution, notwithstanding my peace principles.</p>
                     <p>If I remember correctly, I learned that John Brown's widow, or other members of his family, were living in California, near Pasadena. By communicating direct with Prof. T.S.C. Lowe, at Pasadena, Cal., the whereabouts of the person you sought can no doubt be ascertained <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, if Hiram still lives, and if dead, through Professor Lowe.</p>

                  <p>One of the most delightful receptions of New Year's day was that held at the home of Mr. and Mrs.  William Lee, Beacon street, Brookline, where ex-Queen Lilioukulani was the guest of honor. The old colonial mansion house was bright with flowers and full of guests during the reception hours from 3 to 5. The receiving party formed a pretty picture, as, grouped in the bay window, they greeted with charming cordiality the many friends who expressed so much pleasure at the opportunity offered to meet a charming woman, who was most womanly and cordial in her greetings in this lovely home.</p>
                  <p>In the receiving party were ex-Queen Lilioukulani, with Mrs. Lee on her right, Mrs. Kia Nahsolelin  on the left, with Mr. Lee, Miss Lee, J. Haleluke and Capt. Julius Palmer in the line. The ushers were Misses Flora and Donalena MacDonald and F.M. Goss. Most delightful music was rendered during the afternoon by Miss Sarah MacDonald, harpist. </p>
                  <p>The ex-queen wore a gown of black velvet, with thread lace garniture, caught with rare jewels, and prominent was the badge of the Mystic Shrine, of which she was made a member in 1887. Mrs. Lee was radiantly beautiful in a costume of French gray and lace, with a circle of gold on her arm, which the guest presented as a token of friendship, a golden band with the letter "L" in plain gold, a dainty trifle which Lilioukulani wore during the days of her recent imprisonment, and Mr. Lee also wore a New Year's gift from the same source, a heart-shaped pin of pearl, with centre of amethyst.</p>
                  <p>The tea room was very dainty where Mrs. Walter M. Farwell poured tea. Mrs. F. M. Goss of Melrose presided at the chocolate table, while Miss Annie Morse served frappe.</p>
                  <p>Another and larger New Year's reception was that of Catabrigia Club, held in Odd Fellows Hall, North Cambridge, when six hundred gayly dressed women and a few men turned out to listen to a charming lecture on Michael Angelo, by Prof. Wm. G. Ward, of Harvard College, and incidentally to shake hands with Mrs. May Alden Ward, vice-president of the club, Professor Ward, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Estelle M. Merritt, and the handsome and genial ex-Mayor Bancroft, of Cambridge, all of whom made up the receiving party, and then to partake of dainties served by the lovely girls of the club. The University City
<pb n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Club is distinguished for the recognition given it by the husbands, sons and brothers of its members. At every social function of this club a considerable number of' Harvard professors and other cultivated gentlemen are always in evidence.</p>
                  <p>South Carolina has an Afro-American novelist. His name is Kennett Young. Mr. Young is 36 years old and is a barber by trade. "Silene " is the title of his book, and thrilling is an adjective that can be applied to every chapter from the first to the last.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Anna E. Walker, a graduate of the New York Art School, who went to Paris, France, to further perfect herself in the art of painting, has returned to her home in Washington, after a most successful course in one of the highest art schools in Europe. After Mrs. Walker had studied in Paris only four months she painted a picture from life, which was accepted by the French Salon, where it was put on exhibition, and it must be remembered that an art student is considered fortunate to get a pastel into the Salon, after having studied for years.</p>
                  <p>Messrs. Jolm F. Cook and M. M.Holland, of Washington, have been given places on the executive committee for the inauguration ceremonies, while  the following have been appointed to the committee on public comfort: R. H Terrell, chairman; E.E. Cooper, Wyatt Archer, L.C. Bailey, R.S. Smith, L.H. Douglass, Major C. A. Fleetwood, Captain James Perry, Wm. H.A. Wormley, W.C. Martin, Major F. Revells, Dr. T. Lee.</p>
                  <p>Miss Azale Thomas of New Orleans, a recent graduate of Hampton, Va., will be in Boston two years for the purpose of taking a course at the Posee gymnasium. Miss Thomas is a fine gymnast, and is junior centre rush in the basket ball team. After finishing her studies here Miss Thomas will return south and have charge of a gymnasium for women. She is boarding at the Y.M.C.A. on Berkeley Street.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Luther Dandridge has returned from her extended trip through the south, made for recuperation from a long siege of physical prostration. Miss Dandridge, among other places, visited Hampton and Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C., and is loud in her praise of the systematic way in which work is carried on in both institutions. Mrs. Dandridge, being an active Era Club woman, gave a little talk and a solo to the Phyllis Wheatley Club.</p>

                  <p>Tom stuck his toes into the warm mud and laughed for very joy. The sun beat down upon the brown earth and baked it hard in wagon furrows that could cut small toes and cause <sic corr="woeful">woful</sic> stumbles. But Tom didn't care for that; he blinked up at the yellow orb in the cloudless skies and hummed a ditty carelessly, the while he swung his small body to and fro on the fence.</p>
                  <p>Tom was a small, black boy, one of the brood which was like that of the unfortunate old shoe woman of undisputed fame. His small life of ten years had been passed about Harvey's Canal in Jefferson's parish, just across from and within sight of the big city. The small, fussy, inconsequential ferryboat laboriously puffed and tooted its way from Louisiana avenue over to the landing every hour, and occasionally landed someone besides the blackberry merchants who lived in and about Amesville. The canal lay peacefully green and placid, reflecting huge oaks and lazy boats on its surface, and rippling with a knowing wink over the occasional flip of a fish's fin. There
<pb n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
were never such fish in the world as those that glided lazily through the green waters of Harvey's Canal.</p>
                  <p>"Hey diddle de diddle, de fiddle am broke<lb/>
Oh, what am I gwine to do?"</p>
                  <p>crooned Tom, blinking in the hot December sun and wondering when he was going to ride on the
crab-like ferry to see the wonderful Christmas windows in New Orleans. Then he slid from his perch on the rail fence and danced away, his heterogeneous garments flapping in the soft, damp breeze.</p>
                  <p>Tom's cabin, or rather the cabin this latest old shoe woman, marked the southern boundary of the great sugar plantation which had formed the town of Amesville. Beyond, the blue smoke of the sugar house curled into the bluer skies, and the odor of the kettles reached in succulent deliciousness far and wide. Like waving billows of promised sweetness the fields of cane extended far, green topped, red stalked, rustling vaguely as they whispered together of molasses and <hi rend="italic">la cuit</hi>. The dusty road that wound in dazzling, furrowed whiteness along the levee, was bordered by rustling weeds, with wonderful feathery heads, and an occasional giant oak with tender acorns. Tom's bare feet carried him swiftly by the snake fence toward the overseer's house. An idea had struck him.</p>
                  <p>A half hour later Aunt Mina, looking from the window of her cabin, saw a sight that made her heart stand still. On the narrow plank bridge which spanned the canal at the foot of the levee sat Tom and Nellie, the flaxen-haired little daughter of the overseer. Black feet and white ones, bare alike swing gaily over the placid waters, and black hands and white ones alike gaily trolled long strings of baited cord, with pin-hook attachments; tousled gold and crinkly black heads alike eagerly peering into the water after the recreant fish.</p>
                  <p>Tom and Nellie had been chums from the time that the big turkey had chased the little  girl down the field and Tom had valiantly stood before him, alone, unaided, and heroically driven him into the sugar house yard, there to meditate grimly on an ignominious defeat. From that day, Nellie had been Tom's especial charge and confidential advisor, and though her years were fewer, she was none the less a most matronly and self-possessed little person. There was no secret about it; your plantation <hi rend="italic">child</hi> knows no white or black, even in these days.</p>
                  <p>The pin-hooks trailed in the waters; the crab ferry tooted its arrival;  and the big French steamer anchored just outside the levee in the yellow waters of the Mississippi heaved lazily, while the sailors bristled about getting the ship trim for the Christmas day's festivities.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Mina stood holding her breath; one turn of the foot, one gesture too violent, and the unconscious children might fall into the canal, placid, green, beautiful, but fatally deep. Singing down the road, now lightened by the first pink premonitions of sunset came Nellie's father and two hunters, cheerful under empty game bags. Around the bend which curved about Aunt Mina's cabin they trudged, then paused in horror.</p>
                  <p>With one bare white foot upon the rude bridge and the other swinging free, Nellie was pulling with all her small might at the pin-hooked line and</p>
                  <p>"Nellie !" cried the overseer. His voice beat against the skies and rang around into every bush and tree in anguish indescribable.</p>
                  <p>The child turned her head in fright, the string loosened suddenly, and she fell, a white curled-up heap into the water.</p>
                  <p>There was an awful moment of shrieks and curses, of running and boat getting, of moans, low, and of sobs, and wails. Then Tom was seen with the sobbing white form in his arms, manfully swimming to the post of the bridge. The overseer caught them both in his arms and rushed into the shoe woman's cabin, his face white, haggard.</p>
                  <p>It was Nellie who spoke first; "You see," she volunteered between sobs and shivers,  "me'n Tom wuz goin' to ketch fish and sell 'em, so's we could buy things in town. Tom wuz goin' to buy Aunt Mina an' me a present, an' I wuz goin' to buy papa and Tom somethin', an' - an' I fell in."</p>
                  <p>But Tom's little form lay gray and still save where a patch of red clotted in his curly hair showed the cut of the bridge post as he jumped in the water. Outside, the crab-like ferry tooted goodbye to the hazy ocean steamer, while the setting sun crimsoned alike with caressing fingers the yellow water of the river and the green canal. A mocking bird  called one long note of wailing sweetness from the reeds by the bridge. The gathering shadows in the cabin shrouded the curious forms of the shoe woman's family, and
<pb n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
veiled the uncovered heads of the overseer and the hunters.</p>
                  <p>"Poor Tom," sobbed Nellie.</p>
                  <p>And who knows but what it was best?</p>

                  <p>The Great Mineral Basin it Pitkin covers an area as large as that of Leadville, Aspen and Red Cliff combined. Professor Sadtler, of the Chair of Metallurgy and Mineralogy of the State School of Mines, speaking of this district, says: "This camp, with proper and systematic development, will be made a second Aspen, if not better."</p>
                  <p>The output of the Leadville district has been, up to the present time, in value over $200,000,000;  that of Red Cliff more than $35,000,000, and that of Aspen, $100,000,000, or more, and the mines of these places show no signs of exhaustion.</p>
                  <p>What, then, shall we expect of Pitkin and the Quartz Creek District, which has a mineral bearing area as large as these three districts combined, when so far the developments there have proved the mineral deposits to be fully as rich and extensive?</p>
                  <p>We can come to but one conclusion: Its wealth is limitless, and no more safe or profitable field for investment can be found.</p>
                  <p>The property of the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company consists of three groups, in all nine claims, or a little over ninety acres, located in the most favored portion of this great mineral basin. Special care has been taken in the selecting to cover apexes, timber and water, all of which are of such vital importance in any mining property, and the greater portion of it lies only from one-fourth to three miles away from the railroad and the town of Pitkin, with good, down-hill roads leading from every portion of it, accessible every day in the year.</p>
                  <p>The ore is high grade, netting from fifty to one thousand dollars per ton, average two hundred and fifty. The Company has undisputed title to the entire property, which is free from any <sic corr="encumbrance">incumbrance</sic>, and will be kept so.
