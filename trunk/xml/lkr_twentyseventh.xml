      Of the Willie Hunt Smith Chapter of Daughters of the Confederacy,<lb/>
      Organized by Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers as the Barnesville Chapter,<lb/>
      On the 27th of March 1896<lb/>
      </head>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>One day as glorious Spring time came</l>
	<l>to scatter Winter's gloom away,</l>
	<l>A faithful circle pledged their name</l>
	<l>To honor due them shall be paid,</l>
	<l>Their wondrous fame shall never die!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>The ship was launched.  The valiant crew</l>
	<l>Moved onward toward the shining goal,</l>
	<l>And day by day its numbers grew,</l>
	<l>Till three score glorified the roll!</l>
	<l>Then Georgia's great and gifted men,</l>
	<l>As April brought Memorial Day,</l>
	<l>Renewed each patriot soul again</l>
	<l>With memories of "The Gallant Gray."</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Instructors, preachers, merchants all,</l>
	<l>And brave cadet with pride unite</l>
	<l>In heeding thus the bugle call,</l>
	<l>To honor chivalry and right,</l>
	<l>And there with loyal hand each year,</l>
	<l>I placed the rose and violent,</l>
	<l>Till sorrows came with parting tear</l>
	<l>And broken home!  Can I forget?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>And then the "Old Guard" bade adieu,</l>
	<l>As gentle faithful Mrs. Neal</l>
	<l>Assumed the duties ever true </l>
	<l>With love and hope and earnest zeal.</l>
	<l>Alas!  She has gone! but far above</l>
	<l>Her spirit still is hovering o'er</l> 
	<l>United there in Heavenly love</l>
	<l>With our faithful members gone before.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Amid the shadows came a gleam </l>
	<l>Of radiant light!  That ship most brave</l>
	<l>Each cloud of fate, each flickering beam,</l>
	<l>And should ne'er be gulphed in stormy wave,</l>
	<l>So one was chosen then to steer,</l>
	<l>Whose love and beauty in her youth</l>
	<l>Brought in their train sweet smiles of cheer,</l>
	<l>And from her life the gems of Truth.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Willie Hunt Smith!  Bring flowers bright,</l>
	<l>To wreath upon sunlit prow,</l>
	<l>While o'er the wave a holy light</l>
	<l>Illumes with love each patriots brow.</l>
	<l>The kindly word, the smile that cheered</l>
	<l>Can never from our soul depart</l>
	<l>And features fair by love endeared</l>
	<l>Will ever live within the heart!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Full twenty-seven years have passed,</l>
	<l>Our monuments have sprung to view,</l>
	<l>And yet the fields ahead are vast</l>,
	<l>With much we hope in time to do.</l>
	<l>With Mrs. Peacock, faithful guide</l>
	<l>And pilot o'er the summer sea,</l>
	<l>With Loyal heart we will abide</l>
	<l>Forever true to U. D. C.</l>
