THE BATTLES OF GEORGIA.
BY MRS. LOULA KENDALL ROGERS, POET LAUREATE GEOGIA DIVISION, U.D.C.
Dark night had cast her somber veil
Adown the battle plain,
And here and there the moonlight fell
Upon the gallant slain.
O, Chickamauga! “Stream of Death!”
Seest thou the watcher there
Who comes with soft and gentle tread 
To seek her boy so fair?
She finds the trail his young feet trod 
‘Mid hillock and dell,
Where grew sweet flowers brought for her
‘Ere clouds of war befell.
And there beneath the towering oak
Her precious darling Lay,
The dreams of life all wrecked and dead –
Where fell her boy in gray!

The sun in golden splendor rose 
On Allatoona’s height,
And Autumn’s regent poured her wealth 
Enshrined in radiant light.
When – but list! the bugle far away,
The cannon’s thunder roar,
Announce the carnage-blighted homes 
In darkness evermore!

On Kenesaw’s immortal crest
The flames rose high and higher
Till Marietta seemed herself 
A Krimlin pile on fire.
There kingly Bishop-General Polk,
With grand heroic love,
Exchanged the soldier’s earthly crown 
For a crown of stars above!

Brave Johnston held the assailant back,
And hope once more came nigher,
When lo! a message quickly sped –
“Atlanta is on fire!”
O, can it be? Can human foe
Be so devoid of soul?
Could Sherman scorn a mother’s plea
Intent to reach his goal?

His guns we heard on Upson Hills,
Full sixty miles away,
“O, God,!” I cried, “avert the storm 
And spare our boys in gray.”
Still nearer-nearer comes the roar
Toward Ocmulgee’s tide,
And Macon, queen of lovely homes,
The vandal hosts defied.

Old Wesleyan like Gibraltar stood,
And ruffians would not dare 
To desecrate its classic halls,
So blest each day with prayer.
Her graduates in every State 
Irradiate with Light
And spread abroad the word of God 
For Justice, Truth, and Right.

At length Columbus was besieged,
Her flower-gemmed courts destroyed,
Her factories burned, and orphans left
Where thousands were employed.
‘Twas there that Mary Williams planned 
Beside her Husband’s grave,
To scatter roses every spring
Near Chattahoochee’s wave.

The work then spread all o’er the South
Memorial Day we keep,
And every spot is honored where
Confederate soldiers sleep.
Then hail, all hail, to the woman true 
United in this way,
They’ve pledged to meet and work and pray,
In memory of the gray!
