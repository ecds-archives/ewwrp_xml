      <byline>BY MRS. LOULA KENDALL ROGERS, POET LAUREATE GEOGIA<lb/>
      DIVISION, U.D.C.</byline>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Dark night had cast her somber veil</l>
	<l>Adown the battle plain,</l>
	<l>And here and there the moonlight fell</l>
	<l>Upon the gallant slain.</l>
	<l>O, Chickamauga! "Stream of Death!"</l>
	<l>Seest thou the watcher there</l>
	<l>Who comes with soft and gentle tread</l>
	<l>To seek her boy so fair?</l>
	<l>She finds the trail his young feet trod</l>
	<l>Mid hillock and dell,</l>
	<l>Where grew sweet flowers brought for her</l>
	<l>Ere clouds of war befell.</l>
	<l>And there beneath the towering oak</l>
	<l>Her precious darling Lay,</l>
	<l>The dreams of life all wrecked and dead -</l>
	<l>Where fell her boy in gray!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>The sun in golden splendor rose </l>
	<l>On Allatoona's height,</l>
	<l>And Autumn's regent poured her wealth</l>
	<l>Enshrined in radiant light.</l>
	<l>When - but list! the bugle far away,</l>
	<l>The cannon's thunder roar,</l>
	<l>Announce the carnage-blighted homes</l>
	<l>In darkness evermore!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>On Kenesaw's immortal crest</l>
	<l>The flames rose high and higher</l>
	<l>Till Marietta seemed herself </l>
	<l>A Krimlin pile on fire.</l>
	<l>There kingly Bishop-General Polk,</l>
	<l>With grand heroic love,</l>
	<l>Exchanged the soldier's earthly crown</l>
	<l>For a crown of stars above!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Brave Johnston held the assailant back,</l>
	<l>And hope once more came nigher,</l>
	<l>When lo! a message quickly sped -</l>
	<l>"Atlanta is on fire!"</l>
	<l>O, can it be? Can human foe</l>
	<l>Be so devoid of soul?</l>
	<l>Could Sherman scorn a mother's plea</l>
	<l>Intent to reach his goal?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>His guns we heard on Upson Hills,</l>
	<l>Full sixty miles away,</l>
	<l>"O, God,!" I cried, "avert the storm</l>
	<l>And spare our boys in gray."</l>
	<l>Still nearer-nearer comes the roar</l>
	<l>Toward Ocmulgee's tide,</l>
	<l>And Macon, queen of lovely homes,</l>
	<l>The vandal hosts defied.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Old Wesleyan like Gibraltar stood,</l>
	<l>And ruffians would not dare </l>
	<l>To desecrate its classic halls,</l>
	<l>So blest each day with prayer.</l>
	<l>Her graduates in every State</l>
	<l>Irradiate with Light</l>
	<l>And spread abroad the word of God</l>
	<l>For Justice, Truth, and Right.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>At length Columbus was besieged,</l>
	<l>Her flower-gemmed courts destroyed,</l>
	<l>Her factories burned, and orphans left</l>
	<l>Where thousands were employed.</l>
	<l>'Twas there that Mary Williams planned </l>
	<l>Beside her Husband's grave,</l>
	<l>To scatter roses every spring</l>
	<l>Near Chattahoochee's wave.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>The work then spread all o'er the South</l>
	<l>Memorial Day we keep,</l>
	<l>And every spot is honored where</l>
	<l>Confederate soldiers sleep.</l>
	<l>Then hail, all hail, to the woman true</l>
	<l>United in this way,</l>
	<l>They've pledged to meet and work and pray,</l>
	<l>In memory of the gray!</l>
