                        <p>WHEN a child, I visited my grandmother, who lived on the banks of the Ohio River, a short distance below Parkersburg, Va. It was in the--
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <l>"Early times 'Out West,'</l>
                              <l>Fifty years ago,"</l>
                           </q>
and there were few who had the slightest compunctions of conscience against buying and selling "God's image" in the form of man, woman or child of African descent.</p>
                        <p>While making this visit, I happened to see a little girl, a playmate of my own, not quite as light complexioned as I; but having pretty dark curls and dark blue eyes, torn from the arms of her mother and tossed headlong into a flatboat, among hundreds of coffle slaves, that were en route down the river to be sold on the sugar plantations of Louisiana.</p>
                        <p>The shrieks of Minta, for her child, rang in my ears from that hour. "Oh, my child, my child I Give me back my child!"</p>
                        <p>I ran terrified to my grandmother, and fell fainting at her feet; When restored to consciousness, I was told, to soothe me, that little Fanny was a slave, and must be sold. I must not be silly and be frightened and cry about it. 'What is a slave?" I asked and what they told and what I comprehended made me an Abolitionist for life.</p>
                        <p>At ten, I was fond of reading. Books were rare in that new country,
<pb n="2 The Woman's Advocate."/>
and books for children were not often to be found in farmhouses; but my father, a New Hampshire man, had a small collection of choice. works, Addison, Shakespeare, Milton, Butler, Young, Johnson, Sterne, Blair, etc. All these, I pored over with childish avidity. Among them I found Blackstone's Commentaries--rather dry reading for a little girl--until one day I received therefrom the startling intelligence that "In Common Law, husband and wife are one; that during coverture the wife has no legal existence; that she cannot buy, or sell, or make a will, or do business in her own name." That "a wife may be whipped with a stick no larger than a man's thumb," be "gently coerced." These were difficult words for a child, but the dictionary was at hand and my curiosity was excited. My mother was a wife; had my father a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to whip her? I knew old Jones, the shoemaker, whipped his wife, and turned her out of doors with her children, and everybody blamed him, and the boys threated to give him a ducking in the creek if ever he did it again. I knew that Gibson took all the money his wife could earn by weaviog and bought whiskey with it, while his children went barefoot in the snow. Mother and other ladies had talked very much about it, but why should they? It was <hi rend="italic">Law.</hi>  Might not every one do lawful things? Not for my best gown would I have asked any questions, for I was already spoken of as a "queer child " always prying into things that did mot concern me.</p>
                        <p>These laws troubled me; so did the restrictions put upon me as a girl. Why might I not go into the shop on my father's farm, and make barrels? I knew I could, for I had tried it once and succeeded, and got my ears boxed for being so smart and going among the hired men; had the satisfaction of having my father say, "Pity she wasn't a boy, she would be good for something." He said the same when he found me curled, up in the corner of his study, reading law. "France"-- he always called me France-" If you were a boy, I would send you to College." When I plead the cause of a delinquent workman one day, I was dismissed with, "You ought to be a lawyer. I wish you were a boy."</p>
                        <p>When I asked to go to school, the answer was, "Girls don't need much schooling. You must spin, and weave, and sew, and cook." Little by little came the conviction that woman, as maid, wife, or mother, was
<pb n="3 Looking Back."/>
unfairly dealt by, and circumscribed in her sphere of activity and influence. And when, at the age of fifteen, I dared complain and speak of the wrongs done to my sex, as well as to the slave, I was looked upon as strange, almost insane, an infidel, talking blasphemous things which any girl should be ashamed of. </p>
                        <p>Not one human soul, far or near gave me a word of sympathy on my peculiar ideas. The intemperance of men, seemed to me to be terrible--I did not then know one drinking woman--but every outspoken word for the slave, for woman, or for temperance met with stern reproof, as unbecoming a girl of my years, from those I held most in reverence. So I closed my lips and bided my time. I had not then sufficient moral courage to speak out the thoughts, burning within me for utterance.</p>
                        <p>At twenty, I married. My husband was a lawyer. One day, years after, a woman called at our home to see him. Her husband had been intoxicated, and had beaten her and turned her out of the house, and kept her children from her. She had married him while he was poor. Her father, dying, had bequeathed her a farm and house, horses, cattle, sheep and money. Into this house the husband moved. Into the comforts and use of the money he installed himself as master, and she soon found herself a pauper dependent on his bounty. He starved her, beat her children, and compelled excessive labor from, her and them. She had come to my husband to learn what she should do.</p>
                        <p>Leave him," said he.</p>
                        <p>"But he won't let me have my children."</p>
                        <p>No, in law, they belong to him."</p>
                        <p>"The property is mine."</p>
                        <p>"In law, not one cent of it except enough for your necessary support."</p>
                        <p>"Well, if I could have my say about that--and my children ?"</p>
                        <p>"But you cannot. He can keep the children. You must have an, arbitration of men to say what ought to be enough for your necessary support."</p>
                        <p>"I Didn't my father give it all to <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>"</p>
                        <p>"Certainly. But the law gives it to your husband."</p>
                        <p>"Can't I sue him for beating me?"</p>
                        <pb n="4 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"Not in your own name."</p>
                        <p>Suppose you sue him for me, could I then get damages?"</p>
                        <p>Any damage that would accrue, would go to other parties. If you will leave him, and the children with him," continued my husband as she sat utterly silenced, "I will do all I can for you. But I warn you. He has money and you have none, and public opinion here allows a man to whip his wife out of the house and whip her in again, especially if he is drunk. Are you strong enough to leave your children and abide the issue?"</p>
                        <p>"My God, no! The youngest is a baby.'</p>
                        <p>"Then I cannot help you unless you sue for assault and battery, and have him bound over to keep the peace."</p>
                        <p>"If I should do that, he would kill me." </p>
                        <p>"I suppose he might maltreat you."</p>
                        <p>Slowly the poor woman rose from her chair. and in a voice that went to our souls, said, simply, as she went out, "I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go to my children."</p>
                        <p>Then I resolved to speak, and in private circles--no woman spoke in public then--said my say; upon Slavery, Woman's Rights, and Temperance; bore the cold abuse, the ostracism of social life, the slander of the low and vile, and, most cruel of all, the persecution of the church and the church-going community. For had not God "cursed Ham?" and was it not written that Eve was the first to sin, and had not the edict gone forth, "Thy desire shall be unto thy husband and he shall rule over thee?" Did not Christ turn water to wine, and Solomon give strong drink to those that were ready to perish; and Paul advise a little wine for the stomach's sake?" I was denounced as an infidel, a blasphemer. I answered them:--" If your Bible sanctions slavery, the oppression of woman, and the drunkenness of man, I will have none of it. My Bible does not, and I will think for myself."</p>
                        <p>As years passed, friends came to my support. I read of Garrison, Lucretia Mott, Abby Kelly, Samuel J. May and kindred spirits at the East. I lived in sound of the voices of Stone, Putnam, Smith, Emerson and others, at the West. My husband thought with and sustained me on all these points of great interest. A little leaven seemed to have been dropped into the great, cold lump of worldly selfishness, and was working slowly.</p>
                        <pb n="5 Looking Back."/>
                        <p>Remember, dear reader, we were in the West and on the borders of slave soil, and lives and fortunes were in danger. Men and women were imprisoned and whipped--their places of business torn down, and, printing presses thrown into the river. About this time Lovejoy was murdered,; Pennsylvania Hall was burned down; Amos Dresser was whipped; Marius Robinson was tarred and feathered; Torrey died in prison at Washington, and public attention was aroused. Much actual work was accomplished, and thousands rejoice, to-day in freedom whose fathers and mothers were guided towards the North Star by heads, hearts and hands that were never suspected, even by their nearest neighbors.</p>
                        <p>The leaven of Anti-Slavery working thus well, the-loaf at last was ready for the heated oven, and wars dread necessities put an end to the accursed system.</p>
                        <p>All this time the hearts of the people here and there stirred in behalf of Woman. Great politicians said her claims to Equal Rights before the law could not be gainsaid, although it was not expedient to press them. Men and women, seeing the great wrong said, "Let us remodel the law. Do not ask for the ballot." I replied, "that the slaveholder, the oppressor of woman, and the drunkard are voters, and they are all men. They may repeal these laws to-day; but we have no security, that they will not re-enact them to-morrow. All just governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed, and, taxation without representation is tyranny, and women are governed and taxed." Conventions were held, speeches made, newspaper articles written, and for twenty years the leaven of "Woman's Rights" has been working. Let us omit farther notice of these years, (they are known to this generation) and take a brief glimpse of the last four.</p>
                        <p>During that time, leading Radicals have been saying to women: "Your claim is just, but we ask you to wait until we have settled the question of the negro. This is his hour." But literary men and women have written and lectured, conventions have been held, and the question has been fairly and unfairly thrown before the public, until now liberal and educated people are with us. The best journals of the country allow us to plead our cause in their columns, and others devoted to the work are springing up and meeting hearty support.</p>
                        <pb n="6 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> and its noble and generous editors have for three years sustained our Cause; more recently the Harpers' and a few kindred publications have aided, and now the <hi rend="italic">Tribune </hi>and its editor, wielding an immense influence with the people, admit our claim to justice and equal rights. What may we not hope when such paragraphs as the following find their way into its editorial columns? Commenting on the New England Suffrage Convention it says:</p>
                        <p>"The enterprise is timely. The Negro question is virtually settled, and no other great question of social reform has the floor. Good society has shown a disposition to take it up. Yea, a veritable Cambridge Professor compromised his order by signing this call. The new converts and the old believers seem to be of one accord in regard to principles and methods--wisdom, eloquence, zeal, courage, practical talent, social respectability, all on one side, and only ignorance on the other!"</p>
                        <p>We should have rejoiced had the greatest of editors left the party of ignorance sooner; but with outstretched hands we welcome him into our ranks sure that be will enjoy himself better and be more useful in company with the wisdom, eloquence, zeal, courage, practical talent and social respectability; than on the side of <hi rend="italic">ignorance.</hi>

                        <p>THE "Woman Question" will not be put to silence. It demands an answer of Western legislators. It besets college faculties. It pursues veteran politicians to the fastnesses of so-called National Conventions. Under the sacred sounding-boards of New England pulpits has its voice been heard, and its unexpected ally, the London Saturday Review, introduces it to the good society of English drawing-rooms. That this Introduction comes in the form of diatribe and denunciation is a matter of the least moment.

                        <docDate>VOL. I, NO. I. JANUARY, 1869.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>Henry B. Blackwell</docAuthor>
                        <p>THE transcendent magnitude and significance of the issues involved in the Enfranchisement of women are not yet appreciated either by its friends or enemies. When they are, the Movement for Woman Suffrage now in progress will assume a character of Epic dignity. The War for the Union will seem to Posterity a stern and terrible prelude to a beneficent and comprehensive Reformation. The years that follow the surrender of Lee and the assassination of Lincoln will be held in sacred remembrance as the Era of Reconstruction. The winter of 1865-6 will be conspicuous in History; an epoch memorable in the political progress of the human race. Then, for the first time, the Rights of Woman were brought into the political arena. The Senate of the United States devoted two entire days to their discussion, and the Legislature of Kansas submitted the question of Woman Suffrage to the vote of its white male citizens. The question has thus become a practical political issue, never again to be ignored until Woman is finally and forever recognized as a citizen of the great American Republic.</p>
                        <p>It is true that in 1776 the enlightened Quakers of New Jersey induced the Constitutional Convention of that young State to erase the words of the Colonial charter restricting suffrage to male freeholders worth &#x00A3;50," and to substitute the words "all inhabitants worth &#x00A3;50," as the new qualification for suffrage. It is true that in the "laws regulating elections," framed under that Constitution until 1807, the words "he, or she" and "his, or her ballot" recognized and affirmed in unmistakable language the political equality of Woman. It is true too that, every year, the Women of New Jersey appeared at the polls in increasing numbers; that, in 1800, Jefferson was defeated and the electoral vote of the State cast for Adams, in consequence, as was generally believed, of the conservative sentiments of the Women; that, as a natural result, the old Democratic party of the State, in its struggle against property qualifications, conceived a repugnance to Women as voters
<pb n="8 The Woman's Advocate."/>
and that in 1807, the irregularities of a hotly contested "Court-house Election" in Newark were made a pretext for excluding Women and Negroes by an act of the Legislature. So far from believing with more modern opponents that "Women do not want to vote," the complaint of the New Jersey Solons in 1807 seemed to assume that the ladies "voted early and voted often." </p>
                        <p>Yet, so irresistible is the tendency of modern Civilization in favor of the extension of suffrage, that the very same unconstitutional Act, which thus excluded more than one-half of the People on account of Sex and Color in defiance alike of Constitution and usage, proceeded to set aside the property qualifications in their bearing upon poor white men and provided that all whose names appeared upon the tax list should be construed to be worth &#x00A3;50. </p>
                        <p>But this exceptional political liberality towards women in the early history of New Jersey only extended to women of property. The &#x00A3;50 qualification applied equally to both sexes and colors. The government, like that of Holland, knew no political distinctions among the freeholders, but after all it was only an aristocracy of wealth. The Reform was not the legitimate product of an enlightened public sentiment. It was in fact the political expression of the creed few enlightened Quakers. Slavery existed. Women were not geneerally educated. Nor did the anomalous right of suffrage remove, or modify the legal barbarities of the English Common Law, which continued to oppress the wives and mothers and widows of the State, even while they were voters.</p>
                        <p>Far different was the spontaneous movement of the Women themselves, which gave rise to the Conventions of Seneca Falls, New York, in 1847; of Salem, Ohio, and of Worcester, Mass., in 1850, and which has been prosecuted ever since with heroic ardor and persistency.</p>
                        <p>During the War for the Union this movement was necessarily suspended. Amid the clash of arms, the utmost efforts of American women were enlisted in the homes, the business, the hospitals and the Sanitary Commissions of the Republic. But with Peace came the inevitable question of Reconstruction. The sudden enfranchisement of 700,000 colored men, most of them recently emancipated slaves, was demanded by one of the great parties of the country as an imperative political necessity. When the opponents of
<pb n="9 The Era of Reconstruction."/>
the measure urged that the negroes were an inferior race, or at least that they were ignorant, servile and degraded, the Republicans might indeed have based their advocacy of "Negro Suffrage" upon arguments of mere political and party expediency. They might have frankly admitted the actual mental deficiencies of the colored population, and yet have urged their admission to the ballot as a lesser evil than the continuance of military despotism. They might have said, "The Southern population must govern the Southern States, if they are to be States in the Union and not mere conquered Provinces. Unfortunately this population is made up whites, as a class, one degree less ignorant indeed than the blacks, but almost universally disloyal--and of blacks, one degree more ignorant indeed than the whites but almost universally loyal to the flag. The alternative is Ignorance and Loyalty, or Prejudice and Treason. We prefer the former!" They might have enlarged on the necessity of party divisions in every free State as a basis of good government. The Southern whites being almost to a man Democrats, they might have insisted on bringing in the blacks because the latter are almost all Republicans, trusting that one element would be a check on the excesses of the other. They might have justified Negro Suffrage as the only conceivable method of vindicating Loyalty and stigmatizing Treason in communities where Capital, Social Position and Public Sentiment were all in the hands of the Rebels, and where State sovereignty and Patriotism were synonymous in the minds of men. They might have demanded Negro Suffrage as the only means of saving the dusky Defenders of the Union from unutterable outrage and cruelty. And finally they might have insisted on the measure as the only means of putting an end to the fatal controversy between North and South by annihilating at one blow the political Aristocracy of Race.</p>
                        <p>But in the case of Parties as of Individuals Instinct is wiser than Logic. The Radical Republicans were unwilling to admit the facts and to treat the measure as a choice of evils, because to have done so would have been political suicide. At first the Conservative wing of the Party unwillingly consented to submit the question of Negro Suffrage, to the States upon the basis of expediency. They were beaten, as they deserved to be, in Wisconsin, in Connecticut, in Ohio, even in Kansas. Negro Suffrage, as a
<pb n="10 The Woman's Advocate."/>
distinct question was annihilated utterly and forever. Learning wisdom by defeat, the great Republican party rose to the level of the emergency. They ignored the Negro, and remembered the Man. Now, adopting the old Jeffersonian theory, they stand or fall as the champions of "Manhood Suffrage" as a personal right inherent in the human nature of the citizen.</p>
                        <p>The Democrats, too, while protesting against the proposed upalatable influx of dark-skinned Southern Republicans, are themselves forced to become the champions of a disfranchised class. They demand suffrage for the white men lately engaged in the Rebellion, who happen to be all Democrats. When the Republicans argue that it is inexpedient and unsafe to admit the disloyal element to the polls, the Democrats also rise to the old Jeffersonian level and with virtuous indignation denounce disfranchisement even for Crime as a violation of the rights of citizenship.</p>
                        <p>But it so happens that Women also are citizens. There is an  old proverb that "when rogues fall out honest men get their dues." In this case "Man's extremity" is likely to prove " Woman's opportunity." Both parties are compelled by the exigencies of their position to advocate an extension of Suffrage. In all probability they will try to compromise their dispute in Washington this Winter by enfranchising both the Negro and the Rebel.</p>
                        <p>But the matter cannot end so. No woman of intellect and common-sense can regard the modern dogma of mere "Manhood Suffrage" without indignation and disgust. No man with a spark chivalry in his breast can say Amen to Reconstruction on such a basis. That the Negro and the Rebel should vote may be wise and right. We are heartily in favor of both. But when even the basest and meanest men are admitted <hi rend="italic">merely because they are men,</hi> if all women - are excluded <hi rend="italic">merely because they are women,</hi> it is an insult to every man's mother! It is a direct reproach upon Womanhood. It is a stigma upon the feminine half of Humanity.</p>
                        <p>The spirited Call, recently issued by the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association expresses with great force and distinctness the present situation of the Suffrage question:
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>THIS IS THE WOMAN'S HOUR. The Presidential election is settled. By Republicans and Democrats the respective claims of the Negro and the Rebel to the ballot are vehemently urged.</p>
                              <pb n="11 The Era of Reconstruction."/>
                              <p>Prominent leaders of each party propose to compromise by conferring Suffrage upon both.</p>
                              <p>Shall Woman alone be omitted in the Reconstruction?</p>
                              <p>Shall our own Mothers, Wives and Sisters be ranked politically below the most ignorant and degraded men?</p>
                              <p>Let the friends of Virtue, Intelligence, Loyalty, Temperance and Justice answer!</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>No political axiom is more certain than that the representatives elected by any class do, on the average and in the long run reflect in Politics the tastes and principles of their constituency. A certain Ward in the City of New York with great unanimity sends to Congress a conspicuous gambler and prize-fighter. Why so? Because a gentleman of these peculiar gifts and graces is the natural leader and representative of a constituency of "roughs." If such a constituency have a right to be represented at all, why complain that they consult their own preferences and not ours in their selection? That they should do so is the very purpose for which they cast their votes, and our institutions not only justify, but presuppose this very result.</p>
                        <p>So, if any man imagines that any body of voters, ignorant, or intelligent, South or North, will send other than average specimens of their own mental and moral quality to represent them in the National Councils, he is blind to the lessons of experience. Nor can we hope from these hundreds of thousands of ignorant men who are to be made voters, respectively by the Republican! and Democratic programmes, any especially elevating or ennobling influence upon our politics. Quite the reverse. <hi rend="italic">They will protect themselves by their votes</hi> against intolerable oppression. That is much, but that is all we have a right to expect.</p>
                        <p>Far different is the case if Women are made voters. Women, as women, differ from men. "Mind has no sex," but in Soul and Character men and women differ. As a class, women are more peaceable than men, therefore Woman Suffrage will be influential for Peace. They are more temperate, therefore their vote will strengthen the cause of Temperance. They are more chaste, therefore the interests of Purity will be promoted. They are more alive to moral and religious considerations, therefore the interests of Morality and Religion will be advanced by their vote. As mothers
<pb n="12 The Woman's Advocate."/>
they will always feel a deeper interest than men in Public Education. Removed by their position from the corrupting influences of the outer world--occupied as a class by domestic and family duties, they will always bring to "the consideration of great public questions a freshness and purity of Spiritual Insight to which men are less keenly sensitive.</p>
                        <p>Above all, the influence of women upon men, and of men upon, 1 women is reciprocally good. They restrain, yet stimulate each other. God has made them to be <hi rend="italic">helpmates </hi>in all the varied pursuits of Life. As there can be no Home without both no Society without both, no Church without both, so there can be no State really free and perfect without both.</p>
                        <p>To meet the vast influx of ignorance and degradation, foreign and domestic, which is daily forcing itself into our politics without adequate preparation, there is one remedy and one only. We must neutralize it by bringing in the counteracting influence of the Wives and Mothers and Sisters of the Republic. Any other Reconstruction will be a disaster and a snare.</p>
                        <p>Well and truly does Lucy Stone exclaim:</p>
                        <p>"There is no other name given under heaven among men whereby this Nation can be saved politically except the name of Woman!"</p>

                        <p>IN the Convention held a few weeks ago in Boston, for the promotion of Woman Suffrage, one of the most noteworthy features was the immense power of persuasion exercised by Lucy Stone. There is nothing remarkable in the fact that the great audience listened attentively as often, and as long, as she chose to speak; three-quarters of them were pledged to the idea before they went there; but the comments of the other quarter on what they heard, and the comments of the secular press on the part taken by the lady above mentioned in the proceedings, show an eminent success on her part in producing those changes in public opinion in regard to the condition, capacity, rights and duties of women, which have lately made such marked progress.</p>
                        <p>Next to her thorough acquaintance with every branch of the subject, and her ability to speak intelligently upon it at all times and in all places, I think this success is mainly owing to Mrs. Stone's combination of gentleness with earnestness in speaking. She never trifles with the subject; she never gets angry about it. How simple seem these two qualifications ! And yet it is they which prepare the hearts of the hearers for a favorable reception of the truth she has to offer them. If there is any one thing clearly established by the public lectures of women for a few years past, it is that scolding does not make conversions. A termagant on the right side very closely resembles a termagant on the wrong side; and in both cases the hearer is far more impressed by the manner than the substance--by the scolding, than the thing scolded about. Of the scolds in private life, very few belong to the class popularly called "strong-minded;" Very few bear the marks either of an intellect naturally superior, or of successful mental cultivation. <hi rend="italic">Their</hi> vituperations pass, with those who hear them, simply as manifestations of one sort of feminine character; and some husbands, no doubt, suppose that their private experience is a fair specimen of the common lot, and that thunder-storms are as natural to women as to summer. Yet, as soon as a woman lecturing on woman's rights, or woman's wrongs, falls to scolding, three-quarters of the audience immediately jump to the
<pb n="14 The Woman's Advocate."/>
conclusion that this demonstration is the natural result of her taking an interest in that subject. This is what comes, say they, of a woman's wandering out of her "peculiar sphere;" as if the habitual dwellers in the peculiar sphere had never, no, never, given vent to their complaints in that manner!</p>
                        <p>And yet, when one thinks of it, it must be very difficult to preserve the desired and desirable golden mean, while speaking of such a subject. If oppression maketh a man, even a wise man, mad, how strong must be the impulse in a woman, more mobile, more intense, more under the sway of emotion, when speaking of some of the legal restrictions and disabilities still imposed upon her, vehemently to denounce the oppression, and assail the oppressors with bitter invective. If, besides, she sees that her audience, men and women, lulled by the benumbing influence of custom, hear those things as if they had no reality, or no importance, the more will she be tempted to speak intensely, and the more will, her energy appear to them exaggeration. We can hardly comprehend the amount of patience, long-suffering and forbearance, it requires in a woman to hear the repetition of the same old objections, childish and absurd in the beginning, and already answered a thousand times, and to be expected to answer them as if they were original and substantial. And yet this is not the worst. When the answers are given, and given unexceptionably in matter and manner, they do not at once convince. And the reason is plain; that which was not reasoned into a man cannot be reasoned out of him; and <hi rend="italic">no</hi> force of reasoning will remove the persuasions that belong to a man's mental condition. The ideas now current respecting woman's peculiar sphere are the product of tradition, feeling, custom, habit. They are a constituent of the atmosphere in which we have always lived. One cannot at once shake off this influence; and moreover, it requires time to form a habit of thinking and feeling otherwise. The new conviction, even after having been received by the understanding, must be digested and matured before it can enter into and form a part of the character. If a dread of ghosts has been instilled into our childhood, that dread will be felt pervading our flesh and bones -when we encounter the predisposing circumstances, long after our reason has understood its groundlessness. So in the matter of woman's sphere, her rights, her duties, her relations
<pb n="15 Gently and Firmly."/>
to man and to Society. However needful may be a change in the prevailing ideas, time is required to make that change and yet more time to confirm it; and all that time the, woman who clearly sees the whole matter must wait, wait, while working with such patience as she can command, for the rising of the popular tide to her level.</p>
                        <p>There, is another difficulty in the way of the lecturer on woman's rights. The inequality between women and men established by our laws and customs is in many particulars so groundless, so unreasonable, and so open to ridicule, that there is a strong temptation to treat it with severe sarcasm, especially if the lecturer be naturally inclined, to the use of that weapon. And why should she not take this course? If man, claiming higher powers of reason, has made absurd pretensions and drawn false conclusions in regard to woman--if, pretending to give care and protection to her, as "the weaker vessel," his arrangements have been made with a selfish regard to his own convenience and advantage--if, in marriage, he has managed to acquire and monopolize her property in the very act of pretending to "endow her with all his worldly goods"--and if the result of his rulership has been, and now is, that the children she bears are his exclusive property, to be disposed of at his will, irrespective of hers--why should not these monstrous proceedings be openly treated with the scorn they are suited to inspire?</p>
                        <p>It a woman has prepared her lecture under the impulse of this very natural conclusion, she will (probably) not only fall of the desired result, but will produce two <hi rend="italic">un</hi>desirable results; she will cause herself to be classed, by the majority of the audience, among the strong-minded scolds, and she will leave upon their minds the ludicrous aspect of her cause instead of the impressive one. There is ample material for merriment in the subject; but purposely and elaborately to appeal to that element would be an error because it would be adverse to the production of that serious thoughtfulness which the subject requires. For this reason, while it would make the thoughtless laugh, it could hardly fall to make the judicious grieve. A grave and earnest treatment of the subject is the one best fitted to secure good results, both immediate and future.</p>
                        <p>If, when a horse shies at some unaccustomed object by the wayside his driver scolds and beats him, and so passes on, the horse will have
<pb n="16 The Woman's Advocate."/>
double occasion for fear the next time he goes that way. The judicious man stops, soothes his beast, and spends a little time in persuading him to approach the dreaded object, make acquaintance with it, and see that it is harmless. Then the future as well as the present will be provided for.</p>
                        <p>It is a common impression that man is a rational being. It may be so but it is very certain that he does vast numbers of irrational things. He has freaks, takes notions, imbibes prejudices, and often sticks to the wrong as persistently as to the right. But whoever would offer him reasonable ideas in place of those prejudices will do well to accost him precisely as he does the skittish horse. Since men, and women too, are frightened at the very name of "Woman's Rights," let us feel a humane consideration for their state of alarm, and forbear to aggravate it. Let our approaches to that dreaded subject be gentle in manner as well as firm and persistent. If this can be kept in mind, present appearances indicate a more rapid movement towards success than any object of such magnitude ever before obtained.</p>

                        <p>WOMAN is a thing of accident and spoiled in the making says the greatest the schoolmen, but we are far from denying her right to vindicate something more than an accidental place in the world. After all that can be urged as to the glory of self-sacrifice, the greatness of silent devotion, or the compensations for her want of outer influence in the inner power which she exerts through the medium of home, there remains an odd sort of sympathy with the woman who asserts that she is every bit is good as her master, and that there is no reason why she should retire behind the domestic veil.--<bibl>

                        <docAuthor>Richard J. Hinton</docAuthor>
                        <p>[FIRST PAPER.]</p>
                        <p>UNDER the wittily sarcastic heading of "The Suppressed Sex," the October <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> has an admirable article setting forth the condition of the "Woman's Movement," both in Great Britain and the United States. It has special application to, and an historical statement of, the progress made in Education, and the successful conquest, by Woman, of admission to higher branches of study, and her admittance into what are termed the "learned professions." In the same number there is an article on the "Property of Married Women," which discusses the Shaw-Lefevre Bill;--a measure introduced into the British House of Commons under the auspices of Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, Mr. Russell Gurney (the Recorder of London), and John Stuart Mill, designed to abolish the atrocious barbarisms of the Common Law with regard to the Property Rights of Married Women, and put that unfortunate (legally so, at least) class upon the footing of person's having rights in what belongs to them, like those who are fortunate enough not to belong to the "Suppressed Sex."</p>
                        <p>No two other articles could have been written better calculated at once to show what has been and what remains to be done. Much as there remains to be accomplished towards the equitable adjustment of such laws, still there is healthy agitation, and a marked forward movement on this, as well as kindred subjects in Great Britain. The "tidal wave" of Democratic opinion is making itself felt in the Land, <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> of social proscriptions, traditions, and oligarchic privileges. How far Great Britain has yet to travel in this direction can be seen by reference to the Debate on the bill already referred to. Mr. Lowe, recently elected member for the London University, speaking on the Shaw-Lefevre Bill said:
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>"The question is simply this: Ought the common law with regard to the property of married women to stand or not? There is not the slightest necessity for going into minute details or technicalities. It is that large
<pb n="20 The Woman's Advocate."/>
question which we have before us. Now the common law is this: That the personal property of a married woman, whether possessed before or acquired after her marriage, is not hers at all, but is the absolute property of her husband; and that the land of a married woman is for the benefit of the husband during her life, and, in the event of his surviving her, is his property in case there are children of the marriage till his death. Is that right or not? The question is not that which was stated by the honorable and learned member for Colchester (Mr. Karslake, a Chancery barrister), whether this can be traced up to a long succession of ages. In the most barbarous times of which history gives us any account, and whether it has been confirmed, and consolidated, and built into an edifice. The question is, On what is that edifice founded? Is it founded on justice and righteousness, equality and fairness, or is it founded on injustice, tyranny, oppression ? That surely is a very simple question; and there is no need to talk about disturbing social order in families, and about destroying the husband's influence over the wife, which is saying in so many words that, unless you put the whole property of a married couple into the hands of the husband, and give him, like this House, the power of stopping the supplies whenever he thinks proper, there is no chance of concord and agreement in the married state. Let us dismiss considerations of this kind, because we have to go to others which are much more elementary. The law holds that, when a man or woman has got property, they are not bound to show that they will make a good use of it, so it will conduce to social good, or to any body's good. They have got it, it is their possession, and it is respected as such, with the single exception of married women. If a married woman possesses property, the law, being no doubt afraid the husband might tyrannically take it from her, puts that temptation out of his reach by taking the property and giving to him all at, once. That is the simple state of the Law."</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is very gratifying to know that the measure intended to do away with this cruel anomaly (one which I regret to say, exists with but light modifications in several States and in the District of Columbia);--is likely to obtain prompt attention in the Reformed Parliament, and that its chief supporters and framers, with the exception of Mr. Mill, are returned to it and in a position to give it effective support. Mr. Gladstone, the new Prime Minister, gives the Property Rights Bill a cordial recognition, and the supporters of the old order of things fear the new Premier more even than they do John Bright. The very uncertainty of that Statesman's stopping place causes the alarm. Mr. Gladstone, unfortunately for the class referred to, but fortunately for the people,
<pb n="21 The Woman's Movement in Great Britain."/>
is remarkably receptive of new ideas, and being gifted with intellectual and political conscientiousness in a large degree, when once an idea is accepted by his mind, only those few who see its results from inception to full stature can, tell where the English Premier will land. Paradoxical as it may seem, it is the possession of a political conscience in Mr. Gladstone, and the absence of such a function in Mr. Disraeli, that constitute two remarkably important elements in present English politics.</p>
                        <p>One evidence of the growth of Mr. Gladstone's views, forcibly illustrating his character, is found in letters which he has written at different dates upon the subject. Early in the late canvass, the Liberal leader wrote as follows, in reply to a Mrs. Butler of Liverpool:--
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>"Madame--Pray be good enough to inform my constituents on whose behalf you write, that I am favorable in general to an effective protection of the earnings of married women, and that I think it deserves consideration in what way property in female hands can advantageously be represented in the constituencies. Beyond these points I must ask to reserve, my full discretion."</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Later he writes in reply to a communication from the London Ladies' Club, and, in a prudent English way, approves generally of the Movement for the legal protection of Woman's property, and is quite emphatic in expression of a belief that women having the requisite property qualification should also have the electoral rights. Now that he is Premier and the real head of the British Empire, a large measure of reform may fairly be expected in the direction we are discussing. In his Cabinet there are Statesmen who are prominent as advocates, of both the Property and Political Rights of Woman.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. Disraeli is in opposition, and it is becoming more evident daily that large numbers of intelligent and responsible Englishwomen are in earnest in their demand for the rights now denied, we may expect that brilliant and able leader to take ground in its favor. Besides, the Movement in England, although sustained largely by Liberals is emphatically, non-partizan, and almost non-political in its character. The late Premier has shown, in his way, as conspicuous devotion to a noble wife as John Stuart Mill himself. The refusal of a peerage for himself, and the bestowal
<pb n="22 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of it upon his wife in itself, an act as remarkable and noteworthy as the tribute which the greater Englishman we have named, pays to the memory of his beloved companion, in that grand and eloquent dedication of his "Essay on Liberty."</p>
                        <p>All things being considered the "Woman's Movement" stands well before the British Parliament, and even better before the British Public. If there is any drawback in the character of the new House of Commons, it is to be found in the preponderance of merely rich business men who have been able to secure seats therein. Some of the ablest Liberals have been "left out in the cold."</p>
                        <p>Let us look at the details and salient feature of the Agitation--summed up as Protection for Property Rights and Earnings of Married Women; increased facilities for Education and an higher order of Occupation, and the resumption of their Political Rights. These are the principal strategic points aimed at. They stand related in the above named order, although they go forward together if not abreast. With regard to the first, there exists little doubt but that it will become law within a reasonable time. Though it only reached a second reading in a House of 242 members by the affirmative vote of the Speaker, the discussion which has been going on over the question ever since has benefitted the measure greatly. Men who never thought upon the subject are now aroused to a sense of its injustice. Besides, Parliament, in authorizing a code prepared for India, has sanctioned the right, and substituted equity and equality for organized prejudice and cruelty. The necessity of protecting the property and earnings of a married woman, is made plain to all sensible men, when they learn that out of the 3,200,000 wives in Great Britain (as per last census) there are more than 8,000,000 engaged in trade, manual labor and various business and professional occupations, and that all they earn and ought to own, under the common law, is the absolute property of their husbands, no matter how infamous and brutal they may be in conduct. It is no reply to say, that the husbands as a rule are not of bad habits, or of infamous character. Slavery was none the less "the sum of all villainies" because the slave-owners were more often than not persons of kindly dispositions. It was well, for humanity's sake
<pb n="23 The Woman's Movement Great Britain."/>
that this should be so, but none the better for the slave that the atrocious legal wrong remained.</p>
                        <p>In the line of Educational advancement a great deal has been done, though much more remains to be accomplished. Unlike the ideas of popular instruction underlying our own efforts, the progress of England in this direction has not been very broad, though thorough as far as it goes. It, reaches as yet only the governing classes, and in reality but few of them. The presentation of Miss Becker's paper before the British Association at its recent session in Norwich, is considered, by writers in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> and other reviews, as an event of sufficient importance to be regarded as an era in the Agitation. The paper itself is a vigorous protest against the assumption by man of an intellectual superiority over women which he will not submit to all the ordinary tests by which such claims are justified or rebuked. It claimed for woman a mental capacity, for either the acquisition or expression of knowledge, fully equal to that of man, measured by whatever standard there might be erected. It denounced the persistent exclusion of woman from academic advantages and proved her ability to reap their. full benefits whenever they have been made available, by a variety of illustrative evidences; notably among which were the reports of the Cambridge Examiners, before whom, within the past two or three years, female students have been allowed to appear. Following the reading of this paper by its author, was an earnest and animated discussion, in which a number of able men participated. The. salient fact permeating it was this: that the most intelligent and best educated among women are profoundly dissatisfied with the relations in which, as a sex and as individuals, they stand to law and in society.</p>

                        <p>With these definite articles as the basis of organization, the Club has become an accomplished fact. The list of officers comprises the names of women of the best intellectual as well as social standing. Honoring itself in selecting as President Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, who has devoted the leisure of her life to every benevolent appeal, the Club has for its Vice-Presidents:--Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, Mrs. William Claflin, Mrs. James Freeman Clarke, Mrs. Otto Dresel, Mrs. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Miss Lucy Goddard, Mrs. ~ Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Horace Mann, Miss Abby W. May, Mrs. Samuel Parkman, Miss Elizabeth P. Peabody, Mrs. Josiah Quincy and Mrs. Williarn B. Rogers.</p>

                        <p>On the sixth day of November took place the Club's first social assembly, when, upon calling the meeting to order, Mrs. Severance made the following brief remarks:</p>

                                 <p>"Friends: It becomes my duty to give you a formal welcome in behalf of the officers of our Club, to the quarters, which, as you see, we have selected for our social rendezvous. I bid you welcome in their name, as guests or as members, to the privileges and companionship of our organization. It has no historic past to recall--only a brief record which will be given you in its season; but to its generous and cultivated society, and its great expectations, I may confidently invite you. For, we count among us enthusiasts who dream of finding here the matronly and manly experience and wisdom, the youthful vigor and hope, with which to confront the vexed problems and difficulties which beset woman's daily life, under its best and its worst conditions, enthusiasts who dare to dream that

from hence, in crises of social or national peril, heroic voices may go forth as those which now thrill over the 'olive plumed plains' and hills of Spain, the thousand echoes of a woman poet's inspiration.<ref target="wa1.115n1">*</ref>  Our organization is a novel one, but we do not claim it as the prophecy of a new era. It is the natural outgrowth of the vital, robust, earnest age in which we find ourselves. We do not expect to give the world unanswerable demonstration of the truth of our poet's words, that

                                 <p>But we do indulge the hope that we may humbly illustrate our faith, that the united heart and brain, after the divine order, in counsel and action will help to usher in the coming of the earth's 'great bridal chaste and calm'--'the crowning grace of humankind.'"</p>

Her executive ability is unquestioned, and her devotion to the New England branch of the sanitary commission during the war can never be too highly commended. Miss May said:</p>

                           <text id="wa1.133" n="Address by Miss May">
                              <body>
                                 <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the Club: It seems appropriate at this first general meeting that you should be informed of the present status of the Club, of what it has already accomplished, and what it is prepared to do during the winter; and, in behalf of the executive committee, it gives me pleasure to make such a statement. * * * * Organized in May last, the officers at once set about to secure a 'local habitation.' After duly inspecting all the apartments that offered, these were taken as promising--by their central situation, general convenience and pleasantness of aspect--to answer the immediate need as well as any that came within our reach, pecuniarily. They consist of two parlors, in which we are now assembled, an adjoining pantry, and a lodging room on the floor above. The moment an increase of members renders them too small, we shall by that very increase be justified in having ampler accommodations.</p>
                                 <p>"During the summer, the rooms have been open daily, including Sundays, from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the comfort of a quiet resting-place has been frequently enjoyed. The lodging room has been often used, and many impromptu lunches have been served. Beyond this, we did not expect to go, and our success gives us reason to be satisfied. * * * * To-day, as we begin the first winter of the Club, we number one hundred and eighteen members, and seventeen associate members, whose names are recorded alphabetically in a book always open for inspection. Our treasurer reports that she has received $1,479.63; has expended for rent $350, for salary of clerk $100, for incidentals $366.77; and so has

                                    <pb n="28 The Woman's Advocate."/>
in hand $672.86. This sum we hope to increase steadily by the addition of members.</p>
                                 <p>"Our working organization consists of three sub-committees. The first is of 'art and literature,' with six members, Mrs Julia Ward Howe, in the chair. It is charged with the arrangement of receptions, as well as of literary and other entertainments. The second committee is of 'work,' with five members, Mrs. C. M. Severance in the chair. It has charge of the registry and presenting and arranging any other work which may seem to belong to the Club. ,The third committee, on 'business,' has six members, Miss Lucy Goddard in the chair, and has charge of all affairs connected with carrying out the plans of the other committees, and the general management of the Club. These committees are happy to receive suggestions, each in its own department, from their fellow-members.</p>
                                 <p>"The committee on 'art and literature' presents the following as its plan for the winter: On the first Monday of every month a literary entertainment will be provided at 7 1-2 o'clock. The ever-welcome names of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry James, among others, are upon their list as having promised papers for these occasions. On these evenings the reading will begin promptly at 8 o'clock. * * * Discussion and conversation will follow, if the company is so inclined, and the rooms will remain open until the usual hour of closing. On the third Monday of every month a discussion will be had, on a subject previously announced, to be conducted by some person especially appointed to that duty for every occasion, who will perhaps open the discussion with a brief paper, or a few remarks. These afternoons are intended to be less formal than the evenings, but the discussions will be upon subjects of real importance and interest. We hope for many a word of instruction, enlightenment, encouragement and good cheer. On the other Mondays of the month the executive committee will hold receptions of a quite informal character, from 4 to 9 o'clock p. m. From 6 to 7 tea and bread and butter will be in readiness for the convenience of those who wish a simple tea at a moderate cost. It is hoped that from the better acquaintance which must spring from these afternoons, much pleasure and profit may result. The members are, for the most part, workers; and though the Club was organized largely for individual pleasure and convenience, it was hoped that good would result from it to a far more extensive circle than its own members If there should occur need of cooperation in any general work, as there was during the war, and as there may be again--let us hope, however, from a different cause--we feel that the acquaintances formed and the relations established at these afternoons, will help essentially in the doing of good work. But let me say that, at present, no work is proposed, and whenever there is, no one is in the least involved in it, because of membership. Some of you look forward to new opportunities for exertion here; others, already overburdened with the cares and responsibilities of life, seek relaxation. We trust both tastes will be met and gratified. Our ideal for the Club is, that it shall be a pleasant extension of home-life, never a substitution for it. And let us not forget that the word 'home' implies duties as well as satisfactions. We hope to combine here the freedom of home, with due restraints. Our large family circle gives us many advantages--it requires from
<pb n="29 The New England Woman's Club."/>
as corresponding considerations. A small household may lay aside restraint almost entirely, and yet keep within the bounds of courtesy and order; while similar regardlessness here, would surely bring discomfort and disorder. The member of a small family has the rights and privileges of a few to remember and consider; here we have to share our own comfort and convenience with many. We are trying a new experiment for women; and, we have full faith that it not only may but will succeed. Your committee on 'art and literature' invite you, therefore, to set apart your Mondays for 'Club days,' assuring you that they will use their best efforts to make them red-letter days.</p>
                                 <p>"The rooms, as heretofore, will be open day 'and evening for the use of members and associate members. The clerk will be present constantly, to answer questions, take charge of parcels, and in other ways, to contribute to the comfort of members. She is prepared to furnish tea at any time, and will provide hot oysters, chops, or steak, at short notice. The lodgings and bath-rooms are for members only. * * * Each person, on entering the room, is requested to write his name and address in the visitor's book. It involves, nothing, implies nothing except that the person signing, has visited the rooms.</p>
                                 <p>"You will be interested to hear a word about the registry. Our intention is that it shall contain the names, addresses, and references of all women offering service of a higher order than 'house-servants. Like the well-known barber, we feel compelled to draw the line somewhere. The registry is open free of charge to all members and associate members. Friends of members may use it on payment of one dollar for each satisfactory employ&#x00E9; secured.</p>
                                 <p>"We hope to keep a list of charities here, such as may be of use and of interest, and will be prepared to answer questions in reference thereto, for the benefit of those of you who may be comparative strangers in. Boston.</p>
                                 <p>"Checks have been issued at one dollar for a package of ten, by which members may admit children or lady friends to the rooms, the member being responsible for the good conduct of the visitor whom she thus admits. Thus ladies not members may avail themselves of the conveniences of the Club. It is understood, however, that these checks are not for persons living within such reach of the Club as would presuppose membership.</p>
                                 <p>"This statement is only of our plan for the immediate future. Many schemes are in our minds, which may be carried out as our numbers increase and good fellow ship prevails; but then, as now, success must depend upon the good will and assistance of the members. Chiefly must we depend upon individual exertion to increase our numbers. When we can count five hundred members, we shall feel able to carry into execution all the plans that promise to be valuable for ourselves and others. I will not detain you to specify what these may be. No doubt many plans for usefulness and for employment will have already presented themselves to your minds. We bespeak your good word, your counsel and your friendly co&#x00F6;peration. With these, we feel confident of success."</p>

                        <p>Miss May's frank address was succeeded by the reading of several original poems by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe who, since then, has proved the bravery of her soul in accepting the Presidency of the New England Equal Rights Association. An acknowledged leader in society, Mrs.
<pb n="30 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Howe had much to lose and little to gain in becoming so prominently associated with a movement ignored by the world of fashion. That she has thus identified herself with the cause of Woman, bespeaks for her the gratitude of all such of her sex as are sufficiently intelligent, to appreciate the noble stand she has taken.</p>
                        <p>Among the poems read by Mrs. Howe was the following, inscribed to the Woman's Club:</p>

                        <p>Since this first social meeting, papers have been read by members on the condition of the Freedmen, on the Woman Movement in Europe, and on Kindergartens. On the first Monday in December, Mr. Henry
<pb n="31 The New England Women's Club."/>
James, author of "Substance and Shadow," an author who stands deservedly high in the Republic of Letters, was the essayist of the evening. Mr. James is so intensely individual in his ideas and in his mode of expression, that no one unless born for the purpose and then steeped in Swedenborg, can adequately report him. The following resum&#x00E9; therefore, gives but a very thin skeleton of a well filled out essay evolved from much thought:--</p>
                        <p>The subject of Mr. James's Essay was the historic significance of Woman. He began by saying that a man of fervid intellect whom he knew in his youth, and who was run away with by the idea of Woman, used to say to him when he (Mr. James) appealed to history in their discussions: "No more of history if you please; we have had vastly too, much already of <hi rend="italic">his</hi>-story, for a very disreputable one it is; what we want now is <hi rend="italic">her</hi>-story alone, and if you can't give us that, pray be silent." It was <hi rend="italic">her</hi>-story then that Mr. James proposed to tell in his essay. He set out by sharply discriminating between woman in the abstract and woman in the concrete, or between woman and women. There was more in man and woman than there was in all men and all women. The more you multiplied those latter the further away you got from the former. Man and woman are both infinite with all God's infinitude; while men and women are finite--the former with all nature's finiteness; the latter with man's finiteness superadded thereto. Man expresses that descending movement of the creative providence which results in nature or the world; woman that ascending or return movement of the same providence which results in history or the Church. Woman expresses what is private, sacred, divine in our nature; man what is public, secular, merely human. Man's distinctive activity is physical and moral, being more particularly identified with the civic consciousness of the race. Woman's action is of a higher or more spiritual scope, being identified with the social and aesthetic life of the race. It would be absurd of course for women to claim to be woman in any such sense as to exclude men for woman herself presupposes man, or starts from the low level of his personality, to lead the consciousness of the race up to God again, whence man has previously brought it down. In short men are nothing but <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> forms of life, reflecting each in his puny degree that divinely created man who is one with all
<pb n="32 The Woman's Advocate."/>
mineral, vegetable and animal substance, being identical in fact with <hi rend="italic">nature:</hi>  and women are only like forms of consciousness, reflecting each in her petty measure that divinely <hi rend="italic">redeemed</hi>  man, who is one with all regenerate human form, being identical in fact with spirit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. James found it necessary to remove from the way of his thought a deep-rooted prejudice in regard to creation, which, wherever it is operative, hopelessly enfeebles the mind's action. He said we were wont always to put the cart before the horse. In our estimate of spiritual or divine things,, by making what is first in creative order--the creature--last; and what is last--the, Creator--first. He went into an argumentative detail, the purport of which was to prove that the objective or formal element in all our familiar life and action, which is what we outwardly <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> rightfully controls or determines its subjective or substantial element, which is what we inwardly <hi rend="italic">are;</hi> and hence that the great epic of creation, which we call nature and history, amounts after all and at most only to a <hi rend="italic">revelation of the creative name in the created nature,</hi> and has no manner of claim consequently to exist absolutely or in itself. Having demonstrated this to his own satisfaction, Mr. James proceeded to apply it to the interpretation of nature and history. Creation was not a simple but a composite effort of the creative energy, what we call nature or the world, meaning thereby Man, constituting its downward or centrifugal tendency, its tendency to go out of itself; what we call history or the church, meaning thereby Woman, constituting its centripetal or return tendency, its tendency to abide in what is not itself; and finally what we call human society or fellowship being the grand synthesis of these opposing tendencies, the grand unitary result in which they become eternally reconciled or married. We have had no true society as yet upon earth, for society means the ample and exact harmony of the universal and the individual life. We have had only the two memorial pillars of such society, in the State and the Church; the former proving itself void of all positive worth, and instinct, with only a typical virtue, in making one man rich at the expense of penury to a thousand others the latter by blessing a small minority of mankind, at the expense of cursing to the vast majority. All this disorder has come out of the fact that the masculine or material and generic force in life has dominated its feminine or spiritual and specific force. Accordingly when
<pb n="33 The New England Women's Club."/>
true society comes it will reverse this state of things, by giving primacy to the feminine element in existence, and reducing the masculine element to a subservient Place. Mr. James begged not to be misunderstood. In exalting woman's historic function above that of man, he had no intention to take part in the petty altercation which was springing up between <hi rend="italic">men</hi> and <hi rend="italic">women.</hi> He thought that men would probably continue to claim the highest place in the synagogue, because in Man himself we see the infinite dragged down and obscured under finite conditions; and that women would continue to accept the lowest seats, because in Woman herself we see this conceited finite restored to its right mind, and exalted to infinite dimensions: and surely what is high always gives precedence to what is low. Nothing could be smaller than to keep up the statutory disabilities under which women now labor, and which subject their material interests so much to the abusive control of men.</p>
                        <p>Mr. James would have every barrier destroyed to women's freest activity in any line they themselves pleased. He had a firm conviction that if woman had been womanly in the past in spite of man's degrading tyranny, she would be much more womanly in the future, when relieved from it and left to her own divine instincts.</p>
                        <p>The only possible stumbling block in the way of the New England Women's Club, is the most important one of money. Emerson has said somewhere, I think, that no woman is as rich as all women ought to be, and there is a solemn truth in this dictum, however foolishly money may at times be squandered. The majority of the women composing this Club are poor; the majority of those women who are most valuable to the Club and for whom it is organized are poor; for this reason the fees have been reduced to a minimum, in consequence of which the Club must necessarily slowly crawl when, were it properly endowed, it might take wing and soar. That any wealthy man or woman of radical proclivities should come to the rescue and make hundreds of women happy by giving them the, means of doing unto others as they would be done by, is a consummation' as unlikely as it is devoutly to be wished.</p>

                        <p>OUR native cicerone conducted us to the palace, and left us at the entrance of a spacious court, in the charge of an attendant upon the household who spoke French.</p>
                        <p>By him we were shown into an ante-room, where we waited until he had announced us. We then followed him into a small room, with alcoves upon three sides. In these alcoves, reclining upon couches, were the inmates of the Harem. They were variously occupied, one in adding an extra touch of henna to her finger nails; another in cutting the designs from bits of flowered silk; a third was at their favorite occupation--preparing candy. A brazier stood upon a tripod before her couch, and she was lazily shaping the sweet compound with more the air of a time-killer than that of one desiring to accomplish aught.</p>
                        <p>Their gross, uncouth figures were covered with illy-shaped robes of thin material; the braids of their black hair were disheveled; the barbarity of barbarism was typified in the massive appendages that dangled from their ears; bracelets were upon both wrists and ankles; rings in profusion were upon their fingers; their bare feet were carelessly slipped into sandals;--making a <hi rend="italic">tout ensemble</hi> indicative, in the highest degree, of vulgar, low-bred luxuriousness. Upon being presented to them, they expressed much cordiality, and beckoned us to sit beside them on their couches. The red hair of one of our party gained for her the greater share of attentions. They were curious to know if any application would convert their own jet black locks into so beautiful a color. From the surprise and admiration they manifested, it seemed they had never looked upon the like before. Our complexion, features, and dress were marvelous to: them, and we thought to add to their surprise by telling them we were from America, but the name had evidently no significance for them. They made no inquiries respecting our country, our home, or our customs--only our apparel excited their inquisitiveness.</p>
                        <p>The effect of this aimless life was visible upon all the inmates of the Harem. Not a countenance was lighted with intelligence. Large, lustrous eyes; long, silken lashes; arched eyebrows, pearly teeth, alabaster complexion--these fairest daughters of Circassia were to me, compared with thinking women, as wax fruit to nature's own sun-ripened. Had our journey been direct from busy American homes, whose labors and interests are shared equally by women, the sense of these luxurious surroundings, so wanting in all that make of life, living
<pb n="35 A Visit to a Harem."/>
would have seemed even more appalling, but sojourn in the centre of so-termed European civilization had prepared us to meet more stoically serfdom of soul as well as body. Swaddled in the wrappings of ages of degradation, of ignorance and superstition, shall we ask of these women, bought with a <hi rend="italic">price,</hi> if they will accept freedom and education? And if they say No, must they still bear the sacred name of Mother, when every tendril they give forth adds to the Upas shade that makes the whole land pestilential?</p>
                        <p>Yet, with heaven's own approval stamped upon its face, this Eastern land only awaits a regenerated government to become an earthly paradise. And this it will be when Mothers worthy of the trust rear noble sons; a principle holding true with Christian as well as Mussulman nations. Ye who would have the stream pure, so make ye also the fountain!</p>

                        <head>WOMAN A VOTER.</head>

                        <p>AMONG the hitherto unrecognized rights of Woman, the most important is her right as a citizen, to vote. Unjust usage closes against her many avenues of labor wherein she ought freely to enter, and accords to her unequal and inadequate compensation for work well performed. Her opportunities for industrial and scholastic training are restricted and inferior. In the home, to which she is assigned as pre-eminently her "sphere," she is less frequently an equal co-partner, than a subordinate and menial. In important particulars pertaining to her own, and, if a mother, to her children's rights, she is the victim of gross and semi-barbarous legal inequalities. But underlying all, the most aggravated of her wrongs, that which is most fruitful in sorrow to herself and most damaging to both sexes in its general results, is the denial of her right, as an equal citizen, to participate directly in public affairs, to vote and to hold office. This radical wrong is the parent of many others which involve the common welfare of both men and women. What the exclusive, selfish club life of men is compared with the symmetrical, well-ordered home wherein the two sexes constitute a natural unit, that is a government made up of, and administered by, men alone. Men and women are naturally appointed helpers of each other. When they go counter to this law they are each sufferers and losers. The affairs of State are no exception. Nor is there any necessary conflict between woman's rights politically, and her-- duties in the home. The best type of home-life demands the very superior personal qualifications in woman which would add to her strength and usefulness as a member of the body politic.</p>
                        <p>The value of the ballot ought neither to be over-estimated nor under-rated. It is not claimed that it is a sovereign universal
<pb n="37 Woman a Voter."/>
panacea for all the ills of either men or women. In the hands of either, however, it is the symbol of power. It gives to the opinion of the holder additional weight of authority. From whomsoever it is withheld, he or she is dependent -upon the will of others, and without the means of the most effective protest. One may have the recognized right to vote, and yet, in a given contingency, be disfranchised for conscience sake. In such case, though the ballot be not used, the right freely to employ it acknowledged, lends special strength and significance to the individual protestant. Whether all women would avail themselves of the ballot at the polls or not, it is quite beyond the lawful province of any number of men to deny their right, or to withhold from them the opportunity to use it. The ballot is the representative of both opportunity and responsibility. These belong as fully to women as to men. <hi rend="italic">How</hi> valuable they will prove to either, must depend upon individual use. The right to make the best or poorest use of it ought not to be withheld from any not guilty of crime. The better the quality of individual character the better will be the type of the truly democratic government, wherein all men and women are fully and equally represented.</p>
                        <p>The signs of the times are full of promise for Woman's early enfranchisement. To the help of a faithful, earnest few who have given years to the advocacy of the measure many are now coming forward. Mr. Wilson in the Senate, and Mr. Julian in the House, have each recently presented bills, substantially alike, for the enfranchisement of the women of the District of Columbia. Mr. Julian has also presented a bill to the same end, concerning the Territories, wherein the jurisdiction of Congress is complete, as in the District. This is an advance step in the right direction, in good faith, and of great significance. It is important that the friends of woman's enfranchisement in all parts of the country should aid by petitions, memorials, addresses, public meetings, discussion and communication with Senators , and Representatives the speedy
<pb n="38 The Woman's Advocate."/>
triumph of the measure in the District. What is done here will be a precedent for the country at large. With equal suffrage for women and men attained in the District, the national victory will have been three-fourths won.</p>
                        <p>Beside the bills now before both the Senate and House pertaining to Woman Suffrage is the highly encouraging fact of the pending propositions in each for such Amendment of the National Constitution as will if adopted and ratified, enfranchise the women of the Nation. Embodied in these proposed Amendments, as offered by Senator Pomeroy and Mr. Julian, is, however the question of race as well as sex. The question of race is an old one in politics, and upon it party lines are distinctly drawn. That of sex is comparatively new. It has friends and opponents in both parties. That each question may have the benefit of all the strength that properly belongs to it, and detract nothing from the other, and that the interests of both may be best promoted, each should be presented in a distinct, separate Amendment. There are those, whose sincerity may fairly be doubted, who, if the two questions are embodied in one Amendment, will, as heretofore, endeavor to so use one to embarrass the other. This opportunity for political tricksters may and should be avoided by the division of the questions as herein suggested.</p>
                        <p>To thus amend the National Constitution, so that by its plainly expressed terms Women may vote, and be eligible to office, in every part of the Union, is the objective point to which the Woman's Rights Movement should be mainly directed. There is a strongly marked tendency of public opinion to uniform suffrage. This is as it should be. A recognized Citizenship in one State or Territory should be a guarantee of all its privileges in any and every other State and Territory. It is well for the friends of Woman Suffrage to address their respective State Legislatures for State action, as a good method of agitation, but it is of more moment for speedy, practical results, to concentrate upon the District of Columbia and
<pb n="39 At the Grave of the Year."/>
secure, if possible, this winter, a precedent there; then an Amendment which shall bring the question simultaneously before all the State Legislatures and the people of the whole country.</p>

                        <p>EVERY boy follows some occupation. He never dreams of getting through life without having some calling to which he must devote time and energy. From his babyhood up he expects this and looks forward to it, and often he begins at an early age to cast about him the right vocation. Now if every girl could have the same stimulus, or something as nearly akin to this as possible, it would remake the whole type of present Womanhood.</p>
                        <p>The question with which we are concerned is would this be desirable? Would it be a good thing to make every girl; expect to follow some distinct craft or profession, and go steadily forward to fit herself for it exactly as her brother does? I should say, yes. Let custom and public opinion enjoin this upon her just as imperatively as it does upon the boy, and let her be as thoroughly fitted for her calling. It should be understood that if she remain unmarried, the respectability of her position will be called in question unless, like her brothers, she follow some occupation. If she marries and takes upon herself the duties of housekeeper and perhaps also of a mother, she only changes the character of her occupation, or perhaps she simply adds this also to her former pursuits.</p>
                        <p>Most men and women marry sooner or later, and it is every way desirable that they do so. Each family, at least in the present state of society, usually desires its own separate home, and to keep this home in order and harmony is a distinct business in itself. It is as honorable and as useful as farming, or manufacturing, or selling merchandise, or practicing law. If to this be added maternal duties, then no calling is more noble or possesses more beautiful compensations! The good, faithful mother of a family is not an idler, and though she may not be herself a money-maker, yet as partner in the matrimonial firm, she is justly fully entitled to an equal share in all profits. The theory that a wife who thus bears her fair share of their joint burdens is yet <hi rend="italic">"supported"</hi> by her husband, been the bane of all society. It has made women feel that it is their right to be dependents, and non-
<pb n="42 The Woman's Advocate"/>
producers; and it has fostered mans conceit of his own independent sovereignty. It has taught women, where this is possible to fold up their hands and complacently give their proper duties over into the keeping of others.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for women, all work has until lately come to be regarded as a degradation, or at best as a misfortune, to be evaded as far as is feasible. While the fine lady disdains all useful occupation, her example must be closely imitated in every grade of society. The humblest servant girl feels bound to leave a good situation, to live in comparative idleness and unthrift as soon as she is married, because she thinks that as a wife she has a right to be supported. The pair may not jointly have saved a hundred dollars from their meagre earnings, yet her credit with her class is at stake. "If he can't keep me I won't marry him at all," is her steady declaration, and as it is supposed to disgrace the husband if he hesitates to bear this burden, his mouth is closed against protest. So, regardless of possible rainy days and the probable small mouths to be fed hereafter, they at once set up housekeeping upon nothing. Afterwards' when she has learned more wisdom and less pride, she is forced to leave her half-dozen children to care for themselves while she goes out by the day as washerwoman. This, public opinion about them says, is no disgrace, since it is merely helping along in the family; but the poor thing now is overwhelmed even with her home-duties.</p>
                        <p>There is never a time when healthy men or women may honorably give up work, either of hands or brain, for any longer period than a good holiday. On the other hand, certainly no one has a moral right to be wholly absorbed in his business. "Man shall not live by bread alone." We need both change and recreation. The real workers work too much, and the idlers play or dawdle too continuously. Almost every one mould be better if he had far more variety in his life, and to women the monotony becomes often most pernicious. Many a housekeeper could give some hours every day to a steady outside pursuit with both pleasure and profit; and to her life-long gain also, physically and mentally. Let the popular sentiment stimulate woman's energies equally with man's and all this will regulate itself. Women generally will then choose callings which are not incompatible with their probable domestic
<pb n="43 Industrial Reconstruction."/>
engagements, and yet none need grow up as now without some fixed aim or purpose.</p>
                        <p>At present the energies of a large class of women are sadly overtaxed--of a far larger class, I suspect, than of men; and the evil prevails to a much more alarming extent. Therefore are there so many nervous, fretful, and feeble mothers! Therefore are there so many children early motherless!</p>
                        <p>No eight hour or even ten hour system can prevail in the nursery! Some supervision is necessary here for twenty-four hours of every day, and the care of the steadily increasing group of little ones often occupies as many as twenty-four of the best years of many a woman's life. Would a merchant who lived all day and all night in his store, ever on the alert either for customers or for burglars, be likely to live through a term of twenty-four years and come out of it at the end much better than an "atomy?" Women fade early, it is said. So do over-worked shopmen and all-shaded house-plants generally.</p>
                        <p>"Haven't women, then, enough to do at home?" we are triumphantly asked. God forbid! While they are surrounded by little ones they imperatively need assistance in these nerve-wearing, unceasing parental duties. It was easier for Job to be patient than for Job's wife who had had all those children to take care of until she was thus suddenly bereft of them. No woman can bear the unending strain on heart and nerves with impunity, and very few will continue either to be saintly or brilliant. Let there be hours when the mother can safely lay down her burdens and enter into a new world, either of work, or rest, or of recreation as her necessities dictate! Whoever would be a thoroughly good mother must be something more than a mother! Then she may hope to have still another quarter of a century of vigorous life after her nursery is tenantless; echoing only now and then to the merriment of her grandchildren.</p>
                        <p>We bring up our young girls in effeminate idleness, and we quiet our old ladies into premature second childishness; but perhaps the majority of women in middle life are enfeebled and prematurely aged by over work. The husband never dreams of this: he must serve a month's apprenticeship in nursery, kitchen, and parlor successively, before he can be made to credit this fact. Women have as much natural
<pb n="44 The Woman's Advocate."/>
right to continue to live in good health to the end of their days as men have.</p>
                        <p>Exceptional women may follow special callings steadily for life, but the majority will never do this. Of even that small class who are predetermined for specialties, or for eminent success in any of the higher avocations, where great men also make their mark, the larger half may expect to reap their highest success after they have attained the full benefit of ordinary middle-life experience and discipline. The added years bring not only wisdom, but a softened and broadened character, to an extent that no young person will ever realize, until a long experience has been undergone of this steadily modifying process.</p>
                        <p>Youth is eager and brilliant, and the American nation, which is especially in love with these qualities, is foisting its young men everywhere into positions of prominence. But the nation itself is yet in the first flush of its youthful strength; there will come a reaction when older and wiser men will be oftener chosen to fill our positions of public trust. Then our women who are their peers in age, wisdom, experience, and in the imperative essential to all success, established good health, can find time to be their co-workers in these outside avocations. Every nursery suffers when bereft of the <hi rend="italic">paternal</hi> influence, and every human calling suffers if deprived of woman's cooperation.</p>

                        <p>WOMEN ask for relief because they are growing with the growth of the civilized world. Fetters do not gall their limbs because the fetters are heavier, but because their limbs have grown larger. They ask a larger liberty because they are coming to powers which cannot have full exercise without an extended sphere. Indeed, there is good reason for finding fault with the phrase, "woman's reform," as if there was an effort to start women out of their sphere. On the contrary, it is an effort to enable women to keep up with the general changes which are going on everywhere under the cope of civilization.--<bibl>

                        <p>WHEN Anna E. Dickinson announced her lecture, "Idiots and Women," many people for the first time learned that the one class of persons whom each State had selected to add to its Idiots, as utterly unfit to use the elective franchise was--Woman.</p>
                        <p>Some States included Lunatics and Paupers; others Felons and men guilty of bribery; but all rated women, with idiots politically. After the war, it was gravely proposed, from high places of power, to add Rebels to this list of persons incompetent to vote. They were traitors against our Government. They had violated all the rules of civilized warfare. They had burned and slaughtered our soldiers, when taken prisoners--witness Fort Pillow. They had starved them in the prisons of Andersonville and Belle Isle. If hunger, thirst or despair tempted the soldier to the dead line, he was shot, and his bones cut up for ornaments.</p>
                        <p>Civilization stood aghast at such atrocities. The Government asked, what punishment was mete for crimes like these? The people with one voice replied, "That which most disgraces an American citizen is to deprive him of his right to vote. Therefore, let these Rebels forever after neither vote nor hold office." Women who had borne in silence their humiliating classification with idiots, were stung to sudden agony by this new insult to every man's mother. Women who, with noble self-forgetting, had been down in camp and hospital, to dress the wounds of the crippled soldier, or to serve as nurses where fever and pestilence reigned:--women whose hearts would forever wear widows' weeds for husbands dead for their country:--mothers whose brave, young sons, after many a well-fought battle, starved at last in some rebel prison:--sisters whose busy fingers, early and late, had wrought supplies for the Sanitary Commission, all, looked with instinctive dread for some
<pb n="46 The Woman's Advocate"/>
door of escape from the ranks of the disfranchised, if these Rebels, who had made their lives forever desolate, were to be added thereto.</p>
                        <p>This mute appeal bad scarcely time to shape itself in words, when, from all quarters, began to come the, clear, distinct claim for "Universal Suffrage and Universal Amnesty"--meaning <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> only for the male sex. "Let the late Rebels have their full share in the Government." Let us show that we can forgive if we cannot forget."</p>
                        <p>Thus the aristocratic sex settled the question for itself. Women, Idiots and Lunatics, remain subjects as before, and few, the worst, of the Rebels, share their disfranchisement.</p>
                        <p>Imagination now busies itself in sketching the outline of the picture which is being "photographed by the historians above:"--Down the long perspective, on one side, stand rank after rank of men; rebels and loyal, black and white, native and foreign, wise and ignorant. The Goddess of Liberty is there. There, too, are the American Eagle and the American Flag. On the other side, are no emblems of liberty or protection. In close political proximity are gibbering Idiots, raving Maniacs, unpardoned Rebels, and millions of American Women.</p>
                        <p>Does this picture wait only for the little moment of time which will fix its lines in ineffaceable blackness to tarnish forever the honor of those who were charged with the duty of reconstructing the Government upon the one true basis," the consent of the Governed?" We hope not. Already in the present session of Congress have bills been introduced for Woman Suffrage; in the House of Representatives by George W. Julian, in the Senate by Henry Wilson and S. C. Pomeroy.</p>
                        <p>We are told too, that so soon as the great body of Women make visible sign that they are not contented with their present political status--that if we petition the powers that placed and hold us on a political level with those who are too wicked, or too
<pb n="47 Rebels and Women."/>
worthless to govern themselves--our petition will, no doubt, be granted. Now then, however we may feel moved to say with the old Roman-"Let them come themselves and fetch us out;" nevertheless let us forget the twenty years during which we have petitioned our respective State Legislatures. Let us redouble our efforts to secure justice. Let us scatter petitions like the leaves of Autumn. Let us gather up not only the names of Women who wish to vote, but also the names of Men who are willing they should vote. Let us never again be told that men hold us in political companionship with Idiots and Rebels because we have not asked them to relieve us from such a pillory of shame. Multitudes of women all over the country speak their gratitude for the noble work now begun, in Congress in their behalf. Multitudes more--

                        <p>According to certain rules of society, women are required to look upon labor as a degradation and a disgrace, and to disrespect the remuneration they get from manly toil. It is different among the male portion of the community. The schoolboy is trained to be a workman, and if society shuts her door on him, he has still mechanical skill which brings plenty to rejoice him. The female is not so; she depends upon marriage. You hear a woman say to one who asks her does her daughter work: "My daughter work! Never. My daughter did not do a single piece of work in all her life; she shall marry some day." When it is asked of the painter will he bring his boy up to his own trade--"Bring my boy up to my own trade," says the painter, "Never! he shall be brought up to no labor; he shall be a gentleman," as though a gentleman could mean anything in America but a pure heart, a clear mind, and an unsullied conscience and manly life.--<bibl>

                           <p>FRIENDS! with the birth of the year, 1869, dates the existence of THE WOMAN'S ADVOCATE.</p>
                           <p>In its creation, heed has been, given to the urgent need of a Journal which, specially devoted to the Cause of Woman, should present, not alone the fleeting expression of the moment, but embody within its pages the loftiest aspiration--the best thought of the Nation.</p>
                           <p>This is our ideal. Not in any narrowing sense political--not to be organ of clique or party--not to further any interest save that of the Right, THE ADVOCATE has existence; it will be single in purpose, unswerving to a principle, bestowing all it may of support to Woman, in the struggle which the aroused of the sex are making, at this critical hour, for a birth-right heritage of human duties and responsibilities not in America alone, but in all portions of the civilized World.</p>
                           <p>That the standard it would erect will never be sullied by lower considerations, let its pages speak. Itself a demander of a larger share of freedom, it will be a medium for the freest expression of legitimate thought; while clearest intellects and ablest pens are under pledge to furnish articles, which in literary merit, will render THE ADVOCATE second to no periodical offered to the public.</p>
                           <p>Relying, for support, on the appreciation of the public of such a journal; profoundly impressed by the sympathy already extended, we send our first greeting and warm hand-clasp to the Friends of Progress, over all the land.</p>

The opening paper, "Looking Back," by Frances Dana Gage, will be read with the interest which that honored name awakens; Henry B. Blackwell contributes a vigorous paper on "The Era of Reconstruction;", Richard J. Hinton writes pleasantly of "The Woman Movement in Great Britain;" the brilliant, versatile pen of Kate Field furnishes us with a specially prepared "Report of the New England Women's Club;" Antoinette Brown Blackwell deals with "Industrial Reconstruction" in her unaffected, charming manner; Aaron M. Powell treats, thoughtfully, of "Woman as a Voter;" Lucy Stone institutes a graphic comparison between "Women and Rebels;" while such well-known writers as Frederick Douglass, W. J. Linton, Rev. J. W. Chadwick, Charles K. Whipple, George S. Burleigh, Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford and others add variety and interest to the number. As THE ADVOCATE is printed from stereotype plates, orders for back numbers can be promptly supplied, and subscriptions, at a date, commence with the beginning of the year. </p>

                           <p>ELEVEN States of the Union, all in the North, have now formed Suffrage Associations.</p>
                           <p>The Chicago <hi rend="italic">Legal News</hi> is a valuable paper, edited by Mrs. Myra Bradwell. We will be glad to be furnished with a correct list of all the papers in the country similarly conducted.</p>
                           <p>The box which received the ballots of 172 Women of Cumberland County, New Jersey, at the late election, has been preserved by the Historical Society, together with the ballots and the names of those who deposited them.</p>
                           <p>Senator Wilson said, at the recent, Boston Convention that he would vote for Woman Suffrage in the District of Columbia if the question came up this Winter in the Senate. He has, since then, introduced a bill for that purpose.</p>
                           <p>A witty writer, in the <hi rend="italic">Providence Journal,</hi> says:--"The best speeches at the recent Convention were made by women and a colored man. Does

not this go to prove that both women and negroes might use the ballot as well as white men now do.</p>
                           <p>At the recent very successful Convention in Providence, a Suffrage Association was formed, and petitions extensively circulated for an Amendment, both of the Constitution of the United States and of Rhode Island, securing to Woman the right to vote.</p>
                           <p>Petitions to Congress for an Amendment to the Constitution forbidding disfranchisement or proscription from office on account of race, sex or color, are being extensively circulated throughout the country, to roll, we trust, in an irresistible avalanche upon Congress.</p>
                           <p>Not one of the least pleasant features of THE ADVOCATE, and one which will render it even more acceptable to the friends of the Cause, is the fact that the composition is under the entire charge of the present efficient forewoman of the NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD, Miss Emily Peers, a compositor of several years standing.</p>
                           <p>Every thoughtful mind will rejoice to learn that a recent Congressional enactment declares that the women in the employ of the Government, shall hereafter receive the same compensation as men for the same labor. The bare justice of this is self-evident, and furnishes evidence to hope that Suffrage will be the next step in the work of reformation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Advocate</hi> published at Dayton, Qhio, gives promise of being a valuable paper, and an able assistant to the cause of Woman Suffrage. The odd chance of sponsorship, in the bestowal of a similar name, makes us incline kindly to our Western brother, and across the Alleghany we send our greetings and best wishes for its prosperity and years of usefulness.</p>
                           <p>The proposed Women's Social Club in London promises no interferance with any one's opinions, and as few regulations as possible. We understand that it will open this month. Like the Boston Club, of which we present a report elsewhere, the plan contemplates lodging-rooms for respectable women, as well as dining and reading-rooms. We trust, at a later date, to present some account of its organization and results.</p>
                           <p>During the recent Women's Suffrage Convention at Boston, there was nothing more impressive than the expression of a wish to vote on the part of a hundred female teachers of that city. The evident respect for their calling and the weight conceded to their convictions, were not
<pb n="52 The Woman's Advocate."/>
only a fine tribute to women engaged in a noble work, but unmistakable evidence of a change of public sentiment which must ere long demand that Suffrage know no limitation of race, sex, or color.</p>
                           <p>Shortly after the Chicago Convention, Schuyler Colfax sent a telegram to his mother announcing his nomination for the Vice-Presidency the Nation, because she "would be glad to know it." Yet that same mother can neither vote nor hold office, nor have a trial by a jury or her peers. She is taxed, and has no representation; she is classed politically with idiots, lunatics, paupers and felons;--many women would be glad to know what the Vice-President elect will do about it.</p>
                           <p>At the last meeting of the Sorosis in this city, Mrs. Jennie C. Croly, one of the high authorities of fashion, introduced a series of resolutions in favor of independence of dress, stating that while the Club "neither condemns nor ignores fashion, its members desire perfect freedom in following or discarding its dictates." This is an excellent recommendation, one which we trust will receive the general sanction of the Society. The good will be greatly augmented if Mrs. Croly, who is fashion editor for a number of the leading papers of the country, will improve the opportunity of presenting her convictions to the public.</p>
                           <p>Nowhere has the cause of Suffrage advanced more rapidly than in Iowa. As long as the Republicans advocated Negro Suffrage on grounds of party policy, the people there, as elsewhere, manifested great indifference, but no sooner did the Party adopt "Manhood Suffrage" for the citizen, as a principle, than the people responded by wiping out political distinctions of race by 30,000 majority. Many of the leading newspapers and influential citizens of the State are now advocating Woman Suffrage with earnestness and ability, and, we doubt not, that liberal Iowa will soon present as untarnished a record for Sex, as now for Race qualification of Citizenship.</p>
                           <p>A Convention remarkable for numbers, character and enthusiasm, was held on the 22d and 23d of December in Concord, New Hampshire. Many very prominent and influential citizens of both political parties participated. A State Association was organized, and Mrs. Armenia S. White was made its President. On the list of officers are some Of the first men and women in New Hampshire. The <hi rend="italic">Springfield Republican</hi> anticipated opposition from the Clergy. Instead, six ministers of the Gospel, representing four denominations, sat on the platform at one time, and all spoke in favor of suffrage for Woman. Addresses were made by

Lucy Stone, S. S. Foster, Mrs. English, Rev. W. T. Savage, Mrs. Harper, H. B. Blackwell, Rev. Rowland Conner and others.</p>
                           <p>A little more than a year ago, nine thousand radical Republicans of Kansas, aided by about one thousand progressive Democrats, voted in favor of Woman Suffrage. The vote astonished even the friends of the measure. Six thousand more votes would have won the battle. It is probable that those six thousand would have been given, if the result could have been foreseen. - In opposition to the political machinery of both parties, and in face of the ridicule and denunciation of those who claimed to be the especial friends of the negro, more than one-third of the entire vote of the State was given in favor of Woman. The votes to strike out the word <hi rend="italic">male</hi> were only about one hundred and fifty less in number than the votes to strike out the word <hi rend="italic">white;</hi> although the latter received the undivided support of the leaders of the dominant party. The struggle resulted in creating a compact body of earnest men and women in Kansas known distinctly as "Woman Suffrage Republicans," comprising a majority of the earnest Radicals, and almost all the original Free-State men. Now that Grant is elected, another effort will be made to induce the Legislature to submit the Woman question to the people of Kansas. The newspapers of the State are full of editorials and communications in its favor. Our friends are sanguine of success. We are allowed to make the following extract from a recent letter of the Hon. Charles Robinson of Lawrence--the first Free-State Governor, and a consistent friend of Freedom and Justice:
<q direct="unspecified">
                                 <p>"The Suffrage question is vigorously agitated here, and a lively time may be anticipated before the Legislature.</p>
                                 <p>"I am glad your New England Convention came off so finely. It is a relief to see the old Reformers taking hold of the Cause. Should our Legislature submit the question next year, we shall welcome the aid of distinguished speakers from the East. The growth of public sentiment in its favor among our people is steady and rapid."</p>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thanks, for radical Kansas! May she lead in the Woman's Rights as she did in the Anti-Slavery Reform, and be the first State in America to establish a truly "Republican form of Government!"</p>

                           <head>THE BOSTON WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.</head>
                           <p>THE closing of the year, 1868, was remarkable for the number of Conventions held in various sections of the Union. At Boston, Providence and Vineland were large assemblages, holding sessions of the most gratifying character, and awakening the deepest interest in the Movement. Perhaps, of all, the most important, considered in a national point of view, was the Woman's Suffrage Convention held at Boston on the 18th and 19th days of November, pursuant to a Call numerously signed by women and men largely representing the culture, art and letters of New England. The Meeting was called to order by Mrs. Caroline M. Severance; and an organization effected by the election of Rev. James Freeman Clark, President, assisted by numerous Vice-Presidents and other officers. The sessions continued throughout two days, comprising six in all; with a decided increase of attendance and deepening of interest to the close. Among those well-known, whose presence lent strength to the Movement, were John G. Whittier, L. Maria Child, William Lloyd Garrison, and Henry Wilson. Letters were received from George William Curtis, Gov. Bullock, John Neal and others. Addresses were made by Rev. James Freeman Clark, Henry Wilson, Lucy Stone, William Lloyd Garrison, Henry B. Blackwell, and many friends or strangers present. On the second day a permanent organization was formed entitled:</p>

                                    <p>1. Believing in the national equality of the two sexes, and that Women ought to enjoy the same legal rights and privileges as men, and that as long as Women are denied the elective franchise they suffer a great wrong, and society a deep and incalculable injury, the undersigned agree to unite in an association to be called the "New England Woman Suffrage Association."</p>
                                    <p>2. The object of the Association shall be to procure the right of suffrage for Women, and to effect such changes in the laws as shall place women in all respects on an equal footing with men.</p>
                                    <p>3. The officers of the Society shall be a President, thirteen Vice-Presidents, a Treasurer, a Corresponding and Recording Secretary, and an Executive Committee of nine persons beside the President, Secretary, and Treasurer, who shall be members ex-officio. All the officers shall be chosen at the annual meeting, to continue in office for one year and until others, are chosen in their place.</p>
                                    <p>4. Any person may be a member of the Association upon the payment of an annual contribution as a life-member by the payment of twenty dollars.</p>
                                    <p>5. The President shall preside at all meetings of the Society, or, in his or her absence, the Senior Vice President.</p>
                                    <p>6. The Treasurer shall collect and take charge of funds, make all payments, keep regular accounts, to be audited by the Executive Committee.</p>
                                    <p>7. The Recording Secretary shall keep the records, and the Corresponding Secretary shall conduct the correspondence of the Association.</p>
                                    <p>8. The Executive Committee shall manage the business of the Association, may elect honorary members, call meetings of the Society, prepare petitions to the Legislature, issue publications, and employ lecturers and agents, and take any measures they may think fit to forward the objects of the Association, and fill all vacancies that occur prior to the annual meeting.</p>
                                    <p>9. The annual meeting of the Association shall be held on such day in the last week in May, in Boston, and at Such an hour and place, and be called in such a manner as the Executive Committee may appoint.</p>

                                    <p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I am entirely unprepared to address you, and can scarcely attempt more than a gesture of politeness and sympathy. I must treat what I have to say much after the manner in which a surprised housewife serves up a hasty dinner, bring out such things as she has, without much form or order.</p>
                                    <p>I may as well begin by saying how glad I am to be here. Women are sensitive, and I think rightly so, about being out of place. But none of us need fear, in coming here, to be out of place. I might hesitate about going to this ball--to that great dinner. I might fear not to be fine enough--ready enough. But here sincerity must be the wedding garment, with which we shall all hope to be adorned.</p>
                                    <p>I am glad to be made to feel that we are to begin our deliberations on a peaceable platform. One of the features that have trained me in the earlier advocacy of the extended political efficiency of Woman presented itself in the unkind suggestions made and entertained concerning the opposite sex. I do not to want to hear abuse of my father, grandfather, uncles, and male relatives in general. I do not even wish to hear my husband hinted at as a Satan behind the scenes. If we look round in this assembly we shall be convinced that the friends of man are the friends of woman; and I see with pleasure that we are to discuss the present question not on the basis of division, but of a larger and more perfect unity.</p>
                                    <p>My earliest objections to the entertainment of the question of Woman suffrage were founded upon the idea of separation suggested by it. "Woman's rights?" I asked. "We have no separate rights; no rights other than those of humanity in general." Further reflection showed me that disabilities are also a source of separation.</p>
                                    <p>I have written many things in a sense very different to that of this convention. I have quite a number of ingenuous essays written to prove that Women should not vote. The fact of her inability to perform military service seemed to me to exclude her from the franchise. But the coming in of more peaceful manners, changes voting from a military to a moral function, and it thus becomes in my opinion, one which can properly be administered by Woman.</p>
                                    <p>There have been so many solid and logical arguments built up on the other side, that writers and thinkers ate naturally reluctant to forsake such respectable fortresses of logic and tradition. This reminds me of a poem of Browning's, in which a band of adventurers, seeking some promised island of the blest, land in the wrong place, but after building there their beautiful crystal statues, cannot tear themselves from the place.</p>
                                    <p>We cannot leave our work, they cried. But we are obliged to leave out work,

and we find in time that we do not love it. We lose the form, but not the experience nor the spirit. History developes new revelations, and we must leave our synagogues, no matter how well swept and garnished they may be; we must leave them, and hold a meeting on the mount or beside the lake.</p>
                                    <p>I first became converted to the right of woman suffrage on finding that the negro was inevitably to receive the franchise. Voting thus became fundamental human right and function, from which women could no longer be excluded. And I am glad that we shall come in after the negro, whose wrongs and sufferings, patiently borne, have made him in our eyes an august, a heroic personage. I hope and believe that we shall make as good a use of our newly accorded powers as I am sure that he will make of his.</p>
                                    <p>One word more. Let me say in conclusion that women are rare. The numerical majority of thirty-five thousand in Massachusetts to the contrary notwithstanding, women are rare.</p>
                                    <p>A doll is not a woman. A toy is not a woman. A poor drudge, with all soul and thought driven out of her, is not a woman. She would be glad to be one, but it is not allowed. I think and hope that the object and action of this convention will do something to hold up before our own eyes and those of the world that ideal of womanhood which all men revere, and which all women must desire to attain.</p>

                                    <p>DEAR MRS. SEVERANCE:--SO much has been said, and said so well, on the subject of universal suffrage, that there seems little left for me except the expression of my hope and belief that your Convention will prove a powerful agent to help on the progress of the world. Every step of human advancement has been marked by an enlargement of woman's sphere of action; and it has long been my conviction, a conviction which deepens with the thoughtfulness of years, that society can never be established on a true and solid foundation so long as any distinction whatsoever is made between men and women with regard to the full and free exercise of their faculties on all subjects, whether of art, science, literature, business or politics.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
                                    <p>I hardly feel like condescending to argue the question whether women have a right to exert direct influence on public affairs in the form of voting. It seems too ridiculous to undertake to prove that you and I are as well qualified to vote intelligently as the ignorant hordes which Great Britain annually sends to our shores from her almshouses and prisons.</p>
                                    <p>The salutary effect which the exercise of this right would have on the characters of women has doubtless been over-estimated by some. Still it must be admitted that no element of education is so powerful as a feeling of personal responsibility with regard to subjects of serious interest.</p>
                                    <p>I see little force in the plea that women could not keep themselves well informed concerning public affairs and take part in elections without neglecting their household duties. Think of the hours devoted to the dreary monotony of worsted work, to the capricious frivolities of fashion, to the ever-pouring flood of
<pb n="59 Cheer."/>
sensational novels? Quite as truly might it be said that men could not discharge the duties of citizenship without neglecting their counting-rooms, offices, work-shops, farms and manufactories.</p>
                                    <p>It is said that women do not want to vote. Doubtless a large portion of them do not. But there is a minority who do wish to have a voice in the laws by which they are governed, and that small proportion are by no means the least qualified. I am glad that your Convention gives them a chance for utterance.</p>

                        <p>I was leaning over the taffrail, watching a long, low line of light, which told of coming dawn. On my right, were Fort Moultrie and Sullivan's Island; on my left, the naked walls of Sumter--mute witnesses to strength and desolation. Afar--beyond the sands of Morris Island, was Fort Wagner, where more than one I loved had fallen--where one fair-haired, noble and ambitious, had dared and met a fate the world might envy. No longer <hi rend="italic">"buried with his negroes,"</hi> but risen with them into the light of God's love and man's esteem!--for had I not seen yesterday, the walls of the "Shaw Memorial School" with those proud words written on their front, and challenging the forgetfulness of South Carolina?</p>
                        <p>It seemed like a dream that I was there! Were those receding palaces, really nothing but the houses that studded the battery? Were those walls, twenty feet high, and set along the top with broken glass or complex spikes, really intended to hem in the restless slave, as well as to secure  the aristocratic seclusion of his master? A "black State," they call it, this South Carolina--and a black city, they might add, for, in the streets of Charleston, white faces are very rare. Those
<pb n="64 The Woman's Advocate."/>
palmettoes, at the foot of which a rattlesnake lay coiled on the very first secession flag, are ugly enough to harbor such inmates. The motto was "Let us Alone;" and the prayer is answered. A long solitude will give the people of the State wholesome time to meditate on this flag. It is a poor stick, however, that cannot find its own place in the world and the soft spongy wood of the palmetto, is the only wood that resists the worm in these southern waters! The low line of light had grown broader. It was seven o'clock in the morning. . The boat began to toss, and as I gazed, still with wide-open eyes, I wondered how many feet short, and how many feet narrow it was? Just at that moment, the sun rose, and its first rays fell on the form of the chambermaid, a woman whom I had not seen before, but whose warmly tinted face--broad, happy and mother-like--seemed to gaze at me from some far-off Egyptian time.  She answered my uplifted eye and drew nearer.</p>
                        <p>"How long have you been on the boat?" I asked gently.</p>
                        <p>Her brow grew darker, and the lines about her mouth stiffened with a strange pain.</p>
                        <p>"It is only my second trip," she answered without any perceptible accent. "Only a hard necessity drives me to it."</p>
                        <p>"But is it not as pleasant a way to earn one's bread as any?" I persisted.</p>
                        <p>"Not to me," she said curtly, and we both fell into silence which I was the first to break, quite sure that our hearts had not wandered far from each other in the interval.</p>
                        <p>"Where were you born?" I asked.</p>
                        <p>"In Charleston, Madam. I belonged to a man named Smith. I was married when I was eighteen, and then my husband bought me. He wanted his children to be free, and be brought up with the <hi rend="italic">'knowledge of things.'</hi> We were very happy for a while, but when I had brought him two children, he died, and I had to take care of myself. I was a first rate hand at my needle, and I opened a little shop and took in work. When the war broke, out, I had saved $3,000. I didn't have it myself, you know. Of course they wouldn't let me do that, but I had a white man, a <hi rend="italic">guardine,</hi> who took care of it. The war took all he had of his own, and mine. It left us both penniless"--and here, silent for a moment, passion got the better of her breeding, and she broke into the
<pb n="65 Two Women--A Picture."/>
vernacular of her race--"It all went to pay for their <hi rend="italic">cussed</hi> war! They had no business to a took <hi rend="italic">my</hi> money! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> didnt' want no war! When Johnson talked about giving the property back the Rebs, he neber, said nothing about the colored people! Why didn't he give my money back to me? There neber was no justice for colored folks!"</p>
                        <p>"What sort of sewing did you do ?" I asked.</p>
                        <p>"Real, old-fashioned, fine sewing Ma'am."</p>
                        <p>"But why did you not go North? That is the sort of sewing we all want, and can never get, for love or money."</p>
                        <p>Well, Ma'am, when, the Prince of Wales was in Boston, I did go North-just for a visit, you know. I felt pretty rich just then, and it was lucky I went, else I'd have had no good at all of the money I'd earned <hi rend="italic">so hard!</hi> I had no right to go without asking my <hi rend="italic">guardine,</hi> but I said nothing, just slipped away with my money. I stopped in New York, and in Philadelphia. It appeared to me we wasn't wanted there any more than here."</p>
                        <p>"Where are your children?" I asked.</p>
                        <p>"We all keep together, Ma'am. My son is married, and my daughter is at her trade; she can cut and trim a dress beautifully, but nobody wants nothing in Charleston now."</p>
                        <p>"I am sorry to hear you speak so sadly," I said, pointing to Morris Island; "that low shore, with its scanty fringe of trees, looks to me like one long grave, so many of those I loved, struggled there to help your people to their rights. Some of those who went there never came back. Others left there their limbs, their reason, or their sight, and one dear friend of mine lay there in the hot sun till he lost all his memory, and when I see his wife patiently toiling in his stead, I like to think that you blacks were also willing to suffer--that he did not lose memory in vain."</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Madam," she said, starting up, "that is another way to put it! You must not mind me. I am old; I don't like to lose all that money that I earned <hi rend="italic">so hard.</hi> - I grudge it to them that made the war, but you musn't think I am ungrateful--that I don't know the worth of what I've got. The children, bless the Lord--the children will see the good of it, and poor as I am, Madam, <hi rend="italic">I keep a child at school.</hi> As soon as I was married, Ma'am, I began.' It was 'a thank offering' my
<pb n="66 The Woman's Advocate."/>
husband said, and when he died, I still kept it up. After the war I didn't like to stop. It was true I had little, but then I had a free school, and when I couldn't buy the food and clothes, I begged them. First and last <hi rend="italic">I've given six girls their schooling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A couple of weeks had gone by, since I talked with Marianne, leaning over the taffrail, as we floated over the bar. Soon after my landing at Beaufort, I discovered that I had left my hood in the state-room of the little steamer. Now, that I was about to turn North, my friends were a little uneasy. That smutty little snarl of Berlin wool, served for my nightcap in travelling, and had saved me many a rheumatic twinge. It was impossible to replace it, and everybody was vexed, because I felt sure I should find it safe. I had been more than two months among this people, and they not only had made no attempt to cheat me, but they would not allow me o cheat myself. I would not begin by doubting my brave Marianne. As I came out of the Charleston Hotel, I handed a dollar to Marcus, the old "secesh" porter, who has been there for twenty-five years, and has more sympathy with the old condition of things than the new. I turned at the same moment to a black boy, who held back the door, and offered him another.</p>
                        <p>"You mean it for Marcus," said he.</p>
                        <p>"No," said I, "I mean it for you. I have given Marcus his dollar. Were you not my waiter at the table?"</p>
                        <p>"No, Madam," he replied.</p>
                        <p>"Excuse me," I began, and was going to add, but won't you send my waiter to me? when he made a sudden movement and exclaimed, "very excusable, Ma'am," and half shut me out! Did I think a woman of the same race as that boy would purloin a hood? So when I went on board in the tender twilight, the soft glow of sunset just fading over <hi rend="italic">Charlesfort,</hi> and, the ripples of the <hi rend="italic">Chenonceaux</hi> glowing like opals under the light, Marianne brought my hood at the first word. We had a great deal of freight to take on board, and the scene was lovely--Lady's Island and St. Helena, lying so touched with color, that they seemed the very visions of a dream. I was not sorry that the hours passed, and still we did not quit the wharf. When the beauty was hidden, by the gathering shadows, I turned toward the shore, and watched the
<pb n="67 Two Women--A Picture."/>
characteristic groups of negroes, occupied with their various tasks.</p>
                        <p>Sitting sheltered in a corner I saw a young black woman with two children come on board. I say black woman advisedly; she was neither brown nor yellow. I looked at her closely, for she was petite, and exquisitely formed. She led two little children by the hand. As they crossed the plank, the group would have caught any artist's eye. Mine lingered on it because they were so well dressed. The children in plain stuff frocks and sacks, the mother in a calico dress and blanket shawl only; but I could see that her collar was white and everything about her fresh. A colored man saw her on board, seated her near me and said, "I hope you will find the boat comfortable." "That is Robert Small's wife," whispered a bystander, and I stole another look before I sought the warm cabin.</p>
                        <p>Within, there was a far less agreeable picture. A white woman with her three young children, going from Savannah to Charleston, sat near the stove and kept Marianne occupied with their varied wants. One was a baby; and an up-country man from North Carolina, tried also to ease the mother's cares. Her social position it was difficult to decide. She took pains to let us know that her destination was the most aristocratic part of Charleston, nothing less, in short, than its very Fifth Avenue; but all the evening, and half into the night, she entirely engrossed the services which all needed.</p>
                        <p>We had a lucky run, and shot up to the wharf before four in the morning. We might have staid quietly in our berths, but for some reason or other none of us did. We dressed, and in the darkness, gathered round the lamp and stove. All the passengers, but three, were intent upon a comfortable nap before breakfast, and hurried off to the Hotel. I waited until it was time for the North Eastern Depot to open; the mother waited till it should be late enough for her to seek her fashionable friends, she said; and our up-country friend waited, pdrhaps, because he was loth to leave us. At last he broke the stupid silence.</p>
                        <p>"It was a pity they didn't let that colored woman stay aboard last night!"</p>
                        <p>"What?" I ejaculated, with more surprise than courtesy.</p>
                        <p>Yes, didn't you see her?" persisted the man. "She was Robert Small's wife, going up to her husband at Colomby. He's in the
<pb n="68 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Legislatur. She wouldn't go with the lousy crew between decks, and they wouldn't let her in here.</p>
                        <p>"But why did none of us hear of it?" I interrupted. "Why did you not speak?"</p>
                        <p>"Twas none of my business," he went on. "She was to go some round-about way this morning, that would cost her seventeen dollars instead of five."</p>
                        <p>"It is just as well," drawled out the lady by the stove, rocking her baby. "If she had come in, I should have gone ashore."</p>
                        <p>"It is a pity the passengers had no opportunity -to decide whose company they preferred," I continued, "at all events, if I had chosen to engage Mrs. Small as my servant, and had given her a berth in my stateroom, you could not have helped yourself."</p>
                        <p>"I don't approve of mixing," drawled out the same slow voice.</p>
                        <p>"There was no mixing in the case," I retorted, you kept Marianne at your side long after she would have been glad to go to rest; Mrs. Small was not likely to intrude on you."</p>
                        <p>"I don't want colored folks in the same room with me," she persisted.</p>
                        <p>"Don't keep the chambermaid at your side all night then; but you know very well that is not what you mean. You cannot have too many 'colored folks'--if it is their business to wait on you. It only displeases you when they have money to buy the same accommodations. Mrs. Small's money is as good as mine."</p>
                        <p>"That's what I think," said the up-country man, showing his flag at last, and holding out his watch to the baby. But the mother drew the child away as if she feared that it would be contaminated; and forgetting the dark morning, walked hastily down the stairway and out upon the wharf.</p>
                        <p>Marianne had listened with dilated lips and eyes. She now proceeded to air the cabin. "<hi rend="italic">She</hi> have the face to talk about <hi rend="italic">color,</hi>" said she, "and leave such a state-room as that behind her. Faugh! Color! What's color? The great God will answer that question one day!"</p>
                        <p>It is not unlikely that both these women will some time have the right to cast a vote. If the educational test is to be applied, which of these two will be found best fitted for the grave responsibility.</p>

                        <docDate>No. II. FEBRUARY, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <p>ONE of the latest phases of this melancholy war may be said to have been heralded by the brief of the Pope to Archbishop Dupanloup, in the spring of 1868, on the subject of "Female Education." Pio Nono asserts in it that an attempt is being made "to deprive Woman of her native modesty, to exhibit her in public, to turn her aside from domestic life and its duties, and to puff her up with false and vain knowledge." Since then, this serious attack has been followed up by a series of articles in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review,</hi> coarsely criticising her as a Mother, Wife, and even as a School-girl. It is to be feared that the papers referred to truly reflect the opinions of the majority of the male portion of the upper classes in Great Britain, and it is not surprising, that, having such antipathies, two-fifths of their women (as their census informs us) are unmarried.</p>
                        <p>Neither are we ourselves entirely disconnected from this miserable broil, in which it may truly be said that both sides lose the battle in every encounter for the degradation of man is the only price by which a victory over woman can ever be purchased. The impolicy of marriage has here been advocated in an article in <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Magazine,</hi> entitled "Why Women don't get Husbands," by one who calls himself a Friend of Woman. This "Friend of Woman" tells us that her function is to be a loyal wife and loving mother, and sagely defies the world to prove that man can fill those parts in the economy of nature. But, if such were the opinion of the "Friend," how could he write an article manifestly intended to dissuade young men from marriage, and consequently decrease the number of those females who alone carry out (in his opinion) the design of their creation. That he should thus seek to undermine his own theory is both inconsistent and indefensible.</p>
                        <p>What is still more to be deplored is that these belligerent ideas are now progressing into actions. Persecution is producing resistance. Copying the evil example set them by men, the women, in their turn, both here and in Europe, are organizing themselves into clubs on the separate system, a logical sequence of their now unrecognized position.
<pb n="70 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Politically slaves, and consequently rarely noticed, save as criminals, by the law, they thus seek practically to prove the justice of their claim to the natural right of self-government. Subservience to the Present ruling of fashionable society, which ignores such demand, may cause them to deny any such intention, but their actions in establishing Sorosis societies speak louder than words. In the meantime the poorer "sisters" are being herded together in our cities in separate establishments, and probably fearful necessity partially justifies this innovation. But our condition is preferable to that of England where (as beforesaid) two-fifths of the women are single, and where an impious Act of Parliament has long been passed, which, without condemnation from the Established Church, has been and is now daily used to separate married couples who are guilty of the crime of poverty.</p>
                        <p>It is not difficult to trace the causes which have produced these effects. Wealth and poverty alike are the destructive elements of human societies. They are both artificial creations of evil laws. Crime and consequent decay usually enter into communities through the gates of luxury and misery. The palaces of the rich as well as the crowded hovels of the poor are the generators of the moral and physical malarias which destroy nations. The pictures of human depravity, in the latter, which, during the past Summer, harrowed the souls of the community, are matched by the former, for Commissioner Acton informs us, that "in the lewd dance-houses of the city, Fifth Avenue is more than represented." It is no wonder, therefore, that vices, peculiar to the war, are constantly on the increase; that marriage is shunned; or when consummated, in many instances, wilfully rendered barren. That divorces are common; and marriage vows, to use the words of Hamlet, "as false as dicer's oaths." With the wealthy, the club supercedes the home, and children are a torment; with the poor, the tavern not unfrequently supplies the means of enabling fathers, for a while, to forget them. At the same time, for the evil instruction of all, the press is largely subsidized to advertize means for the prevention of increase.</p>
                        <p>The strong quadrilateral of Virtue, the fortresses of husband and wife, parent and child, being thus stormed, crimes of the deepest dye spread themselves over the community. Those who were created a little lower than the angels, become degraded lower then the beasts

which perish. When mutual respect between men and women is lost, order, harmony, and happiness, will also terminate. As in other wars, so in this battle of the sexes, the weakest are the first to suffer. Nations like France, and States like Massachusetts, cease to increase. City governments, subservient to the demands of property, sacrifice life to uphold them. Classification commences, and hatred on the one side is met by contempt on the other. These are by no means the worst phases of the war. Dr. Lankester, the able coroner for Middlesex, asserted his belief that in London there were twelve thousand mothers who had murdered their children; and a correspondent of <hi rend="italic">The World</hi> more than doubles that amount in estimating the number of similar criminals in New York. Crimes, which the Pagan Romans deemed impossible on account of their peculiar atrocity, have latterly been added; and filicide, patricide and even matricide fill up the cup of our iniquities.</p>
                        <p>Assuredly this dreadful state of affairs has mainly arisen from the sequestration of woman from her place in society as a help-meet for man. From childhood to old age, her place should be by his side. In the school, she would modify his ferocity into firmness, retaining the surplus to elevate her weakness into dignity. Place her in the workshop, and she would bring order and harmony into the dark holes in which the masses of our people are condemned to pass the greater portion of their lives. . At the bed of the sick who so fit to administer help to the afflicted. Without her the seat of justice is without its complementary part, for Shakespeare tells us--

Her presence in our legislative halls would insure decorum, and suppress the brutalities which now too often degrade them. It is in her absence that our feasts degenerate into debauches. Is not her presence needed in the Government itself, to insure proper attention to the claims of the poor, the weak, and the maimed, who have there now no advocate?</p>
                        <p>Is it any wonder, that, reflecting on her condition, and having no fixed legal status, she seeks to claim the position given her by the Creator, but of which the superior force or craft of man has cruelly

deprived her? Is it also not painfully evident, that, in many instances, she is totally defenceless, and is she not justified in demanding from her oppressors the means, political and legal, whereby she may protect her own interests?</p>
                        <p>To conclude: In order to reverse the present system which has proved itself to be prolific of evils, it is necessary to begin at the home, and begin with the young. Palaces and hovels are frequently unworthy the name of homes, and therefore often the women of our cities have none. Parents commonly love their children, but cannot expect to rear them rightly either in the tenement houses of the poor, or the hotels of the wealthier classes. But the germs of law and order must be planted in the youth of our Nation, and the material circumstances which develope their characters can and must be improved. Light, air, and space must be evoked in our cities, to drive out the evil demons which are tormenting us, and daily, by pestilences moral and physical, demanding fresh victims. The Declaration of Independence asserts that governments are ordained for the protection of life, wisely placing it before liberty itself. The pursuit of happiness, and incidentally the rights of property follow, as secondary to and dependent upon the former. On the healthiness, security, and sanctity of one homes, and on the conservation of the purity of the conjugal and parental relations of our people, we must rest our hopes for the termination of this unnatural war, and the duration of this Republic. If we permit these to be sapped by neglect, or destroyed by crime, the best form of government and the most faultless of Constitutions will not save us; we shall deservedly fall, and the sacred temple of our Liberties will crumble into hopeless ruins.</p>

                        <docAuthor>Richard J. Hinton</docAuthor>
                        <docDate>No. II. FEBRUARY, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <p>[SECOND PAPER].</p>
                        <p>AMONG illustrations of progress in the matter of professional education and occupation is noticeable the success of Miss Elizabeth Garrett, who recently succeeded in obtaining a diploma from Apothecaries' Hall. Like the Faculty of Geneva Medical College, after Miss Blackwell graduated with such distinguished honor, the Apothecaries' announce that the accidental door through which Miss Garrett passed is hereafter to be closed, and, as these unwise disciples of Galen believe, to remain hermetically sealed against any like daring innovator of the strong-minded order. Another movement is meeting with good success, though as yet it has been unable to obtain a Charter. It is the "Female Medical Society," founded in 1864, and of which the Marquis Townshend, a man of noble character, devoted to philanthropic labors, is President. Fourteen female pupils were entered immediately on its being organized, and the number is now quite large. Recently an effort was made to obtain leave for these students to "walk" the London Hospitals and attend the anatomical demonstrations. Though it failed, still the existence of a very liberal spirit was made manifest. The Farmingdon Dispensary, one of the largest of those medical charities for out-door relief and advice which abound in London, admitted ladies for several months to the advantages it afforded for practical study of disease. A short time since the, trustees withdrew the privilege, but testified in doing so to their belief in the benefits that had already and would continue to result from its exercise. Their reason for a withdrawal was a fear of its injurious effect on their subscription lists. A female medical mission was lately organized in London and sent to Delhi, hoping to perform thereby a double duty--to cure the bodies and minds of the Hindoo women.</p>
                        <p>It may be as well to notice here some of the evidences of Continental progress also. In St. Petersburg, a University for Women has been organized under Imperial patronage. Two Rus-

sian ladies have applied to the Imperial College of Medicine at the Muscovite Capital, and pending their admission, the Emperor directed a Russian Medical officer, then in the United States, to make an investigation into the education and practice of our lady physicians and report thereon. Among other institutions he visited, was the New York Infirmary for women and children, with which Dr. Blackwell and other eminent female physicians are connected. Two Russian ladies have been admitted to the Zurich (Switzerland) Medical University.<ref target="wa.wa1.206n1">*</ref> The Women's Educational Movement in Prussia, so far as it connects itself with the University of Petersburg, rests with the proposition to establish in that institution, Professorships or "Faculties" of History, of Philology and of the Natural Sciences for the benefit of Woman.</p>
                        <p>Madame De, Gall is now lecturing in Paris, on all medical topics, and her classes are quite well attended. Recently the Minister of Public Instruction permitted a French woman to graduate at Lyons, provided she practiced Medicine only in Algeria from whence she came. There are many other evidences of the breaking away of the barriers, but they need not now be referred to.</p>
                        <p>Society is slowly le'arning the truth of Madame Sirault's warning: "Every career from which woman is steadily repulsed by man is, by this fact alone, marked with the seal of death. The very repulse stigmatizes it. Man may not be conscious of what be does, but the career which is too vile for women to enter, has already outlived all chance of reform, and must perish with its abuses."</p>
                        <p>This pregnant paragraph is fit introduction to such reference as will be made to the political aspects of the English agitation. If Politics are too corrupt for women to think and act upon, then it is at once evident that the State itself is corrupted through the continued exercise of political power even by the male citizens thereof. Though those English women, who placed their names on the registration lists, and succeeded in passing the Revising Barristers, were ultimately stricken off by the decision of a Puisine Judge, still the result of that effort, and the very general interest,
<note id="wa.wa1.206n1" anchored="yes">*I am indebted for these and other facts, to a very interesting paper in the December <hi rend="italic">Galaxy,</hi> in which the medical phases of the subject are fully treated.</note>
                           <pb n="76 The Woman's Advocate."/>
it proved to exist among the women themselves, made the Movement a great success. The chief rebutting reason presented by the learned Judge against resumption of their electoral rights by female property-holders was, that they had permitted them to remain so long in abeyance, as to have caused them to lapse entirely.</p>
                        <p>Several curiously interesting historical facts were brought out during the discussions before the various Revising Barristers, and in the press, pending the decision on the right of registration. Among other things was the undenied statement that ladies of title had formerly occupied seats in the House of Lords, when they were entitled as peers in their own right, or when their lords were dead and the heirs were in their nonage. They also held the office of high sheriff (which must be filled by one possessed of the electoral qualification) and other similar dignities. It has also been stated that the same investigations tend to show that the Parliaments were originally founded on the idea of universal suffrage, the manifestation of which was the "showing of hands"--a custom in England which now would be more "honored in the breach than in the observance"--as it is an utterly useless and generally disgraceful ceremony.</p>
                        <p>There could not have been less than twenty thousand applications made for registration by women, possessing every requisite qualification, (except sex), for the exercise of suffrage, which the British law requires. But Privilege-sick man of Europe though it is--is still too strongly entrenched in Great Britain to yield at the first assault in this direction. Nearly six thousand women applied for registration in Manchester; as many more in Lambeth; a large number in other Metropolitan boroughs, and some persons in the majority of boroughs in England and Scotland. The movement is sure to succeed. It has the logic of the English system in its favor. That requires a property qualification for the franchise. Many women have that, and the general legal interpretation of the word "Man" has always been deemed inclusive of both sexes. It strains the rule and precedent to decide otherwise, simply because the case is that of a demand for the right to vote.</p>
                        <p>During the recent election in Great Britain many ladies took an active part in the canvassing. Mr. Bernal Osborne was frank
<pb n="77 The Woman's Movement in Great Britain."/>
enough to affirm at Nottingham that the efforts of his opponent's wife largely contributed to his own defeat. Active among these lady politicians was Lady Amberly, Earl Russel's daughterin-law, and known favorably in America. She is said to have spoken from the hustings, where Lord Amberly was a candidate.</p>
                        <p>In Manchester eight women, whose names by accident were left on the Registry, voted at the late election. Eight others, freeholders, voted in south-east Lancashire. At Ashford, East Kent, fifteen out of thirty-five who were registered, recorded their votes.. In Finsbury the same number also went to the Polls. In Dublin one woman, and at Leicester three women voted.</p>
                        <p>The First Annual Report of the Manchester National Society for Woman Suffrage, speaks hopefully of the Progress of the Movement, though conceding that a mistake was made in carrying an appeal from the adverse decision of a Revising Barrister to the Court of Common Pleas, where the appeal was morally certain to be thrown out contemptuously. The Judges were hardly respectful in their treatment of the case. The Executive Committee have since determined to make a direct attack on Parliament. Circulars were sent to all candidates at the recent general election, informing them that a bill would be offered in the Reformed Parliament placing woman on the same footing politically as man, and asking what action they would take on it. At the last advices over one hundred letters had been received, of which fifty-three were favorable. The Edinburg Committee have also received favorable answers from many of the Members from Scotland.</p>
                        <p>It is quite common among even well informed persons to suppose that the right of suffrage is nowhere possessed, in representative forms of Government, by women. The only general exception to this belief would be the case of the British Australian colony of Victoria where, as most persons are aware, the right of suffrage is now possessed by women. They universally assumed the right there some four years ago, having found that the law had, probably inadvertently, been so framed as to permit them. It works admirably, according to all reports.</p>
                        <p>In Sweden, chiefly through the exertions of the late Fredericka Bremer, an indirect right of voting was, in 1862, granted to all women possessing specified property qualifications. In 1865, by
<pb n="78 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the passage of the Swedish Reform Bill, the election of members of the Upper Chamber was given to organized county and municipal bodies. In the election of these latter, unmarried women and widows possessed of an annual income of four hundred rix-dollars and over, are allowed to vote.</p>
                        <p>By the Fifteenth Article of the Italian Code, a widow or wife, separated from her husband, who pays taxes, is allowed to vote through such child or other relative as she may designate.</p>
                        <p>In, Holland, widows and single women possessed of property, are entitled to vote on all questions of taxation, etc., likely to effect its value. Mr. Blackwell, of New Jersey, stated at the recent New England Convention that a lady from Holland now visiting here, was required before leaving to designate some fit person to represent that property franchise during her absence.</p>
                        <p>In 1867, Moravia granted the franchise to all widows who pay taxes. </p>
                        <p>In many towns of France women possess and exercise the right to vote in municipal affairs, and in one of them, Mrs. C. H. Dall states in her valuable work, " The College, the Market, and the Court," (to which we are indebted for many facts)--the entire council was recently composed wholly of women.</p>
                        <p>In Austria women can vote as nobles; in their corporate capacity as nuns, and as tax-payers. In some cases, however, they vote by proxy. It does not speak well for the genuine liberalism of the Magyar, revolutionists, when it is known that up to 1848 widows and single women, who were landed proprietors, possessed the right to vote. They were deprived of it by the revolutionary government, and they are now petitioning in large numbers for the restoration of this right.</p>
                        <p>In Canada, as in several of our own States, women, are allowed to vote for, and serve as, school trustees. In Pitcairn's Island--inhabited by a community descended from the Mutineers of the Bounty, the <sic corr="government">goverment</sic>, which is based on a written Constitution, is shared on equal terms by men and women alike.</p>
                        <p>This rapid resume of the position of the Woman's Movement, both in Great Britain and elsewhere, cannot be more appropriately closed than with the eloquent words of the writer of the article in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> on "the Property of Married Women:"
<pb n="79 The Woman's Movement in Great Britain."/>
We hail the movement which has brought us thus far as a promising sign of the times, for it surely indicates the growth of a truer and wiser conception of the destiny of woman than has hitherto prevailed among us. As we know of a past in which she was destitute of any recognized right, so we may hope for a future in which she will be endowed with all the privileges justly pertaining to her as the equal counterpart of man in the social organism. The great and immediate work of our generation is to realize that future--to elevate woman, the <hi rend="italic">slave,</hi> into Woman, the citizen, and to place her in a position of perfect freedom, and independence, in which alone she can attain to the full and harmonious development of her essentially noble nature as a moral, intellectual and active being."</p>

In those earlier ages when authority and assent had the ascendancy over reason and belief, and even when the latter had in a large measure displaced the former, and philosophic ethics and politics were more employed in the discussion of social organization and civil government, there was not infrequently an attempt to establish for any given custom or institution the higher sanction of Divine authority, distinctively so-called.</p>
                        <p>This mode of appeal, however natural it may be, has given rise to serious evils;--for instinctively certain that the minds of men are involuntarily influenced by the idea of Divine sanction to a greater degree than by any lower authority, and that if the Divine and human reason be adroitly made to appear at variance the power of intimidation is on the side of the former, those who have aimed at the establishment of systematic authority, civil or ecclesiastical, have everywhere insisted upon the recognition of the supremacy of this appeal. So the Church of Rome appealed for her power over the bodies and souls of men. So the advocates of kingly absolutism, and so, on the other band, those who rose up to resist these systems, appealed to Divine sanction.</p>
                        <p>We smile at the course of those inquisitors who decided that the Copernican theory of Astronomy was contrary to the Scriptures, but have we not seen the same principle at work to set Geology and the Scriptures at variance? In the former case, the world has settled it that the proof of the truth of the Copernican system is a question not included within the scope of those writings--that its establishment or its rejection in no way affects their claims, nor their poetry its mathematics. It is then worth while to consider what questions shall be subject to this appeal, and to determine the mode of decision under the appeal, as well as the method of con-

ducting the inquiry into the Divine law, however expressed. This investigation I will endeavor to make for our social question--the status of Woman. And I do this the more willingly because the Scriptures are a weapon more apt to be seized upon by the Conservatives, on any question, than by the Reformers. Do we get any help in the decision from these writings? What is their position and bearing upon it? The question will be elucidated most readily by a historic method. In the beginning, how came it that the human race was created of two sexes?, It may be said that man as an animal but follows the constitution of all animal life, and therefore no special reference was made to sex in his creation more than in that of other animals. The account does, however, tell us that but for the creation of woman, man would have been alone, <hi rend="italic">i. e. unmated, and without a helpmeet for him--without one suited to his special nature and needs--</hi>Gen. ii., 20. Yet, though thus created for companionship, there is an express assertion that in regard to spiritual personality they were created alike--Gen i., 26, 28. It was not the man alone who was made in the image of God--it was not he alone of whom it was said, "let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth." The personality and pre-eminence here asserted must be common to both sexes of the race or their relation would be monstrous, and the assertion of <hi rend="italic">matehood</hi> absurd. The argument for subjection and inferiority has, however, been usually drawn from the passage which gives specific detail Gen ii., 21, 22; but the whimsical interpretations which are the foundation of such arguments are inconsistent with the simple statement of v. 18 just before--"It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make him a help-meet for him."</p>
                        <p>The next point is that contained in Gen. iii., 16--the basis of the rabbinical views which, in later times, excluded women from religious services, and the basis apparently of St. Paul's argument 1 Tim. ii., 11, 14. Both of which interpretations, when taken as the sense of the passage in Genesis, or when applied to the general doctrine of Woman's absolute subjection, are inconsistent with the tenor of the Scriptures in general, and with certain precepts of the Jewish law, as well as with certain Acts of Jewish history. It would seem as though but for prejudice its -simple and special
<pb n="82 The Woman's Advocate."/>
application could scarcely have been misunderstood. It expresses clearly a subordinated sexual relation, dependent upon the special relation of husband and wife; and where the latter relation does not exist, is necessarily absent. The terms of the passage are specific not generic; husband and wife, not man and woman. It is a declaration of relativity, and of that under specific conditions.</p>
                        <p>These two points are all--earlier than the national institutions of the Hebrews, and the glimpses of Woman's condition in patriarchal times--which indicate that man quickly changed the primal constitution of things, by his "dynastic reasons." Whether we suppose the Hebrew code, to be of immediately Divine origin, or whether, we regard it as the work of human legislators its provisions are of the same value. They show us the status of woman in that earlier time. The existence of the Laws respecting purification, show that a preservation of her rights as a member of the religious commonwealth was intended as well as the accommodation o society. She was permitted to present her offering to the priest; to make religious vows; to engage in the general worship of the congregation; to hear the reading of the Law, and to partake of the religious feasts. All these, under the Hebrew system, were rights of citizenship, for it was part of the <hi rend="italic">law</hi> of all sacrificial feasts that "no stranger" might -eat thereof. In their enslaved condition the domestic institution of marriage had been abused. Wives were taken, and left at convenience. But women were protected against this injustice by the law of divorce, Deut. xxiv., 1, which provided against careless or unjust desertion.</p>
                        <p>Neither the civil law of Greece or Rome gave Woman the right of property; but the Hebrew law, made to meet the special condition of the family of Zelophead gave them the right of inheritance when there were no male heirs, apparently without the condition of wardship, as under feudal law, but simply with the condition that they should not marry out of their tribe.</p>
                        <p>Laws like that of Num. xxx., 6, 7-15 were regulative simply under the parental or marriage relation. The first were similar to our laws for minors; for the second we have no parallel unless perhaps in requiring the husband to pay debts contracted by the wife, which rests upon the assumption that he has permitted her
<pb n="83 The Scriptures versus the Woman Question."/>
to contract them; so the husband unless he disallowed the vow of the wife in the day that she made it, could not, later, forbid her fulfilling it.</p>
                        <p>However limited the rights of Woman may seem to us under these laws; relatively considered, they were an advance upon the previous condition of Hebrew women, and gave them a civil elevation not found among the Oriental nations generally.</p>
                        <p>Whoever traces the later Jewish opinions, will find them sufficiently conservative on this question, and will understand why in the well-side scene at Shechem, <hi rend="italic">"they marvelled, that</hi> HE <hi rend="italic">talked with a Woman."</hi> Indeed, one may stop far short of any such inquiry, and understand it, when among the thanksgivings of the synagogue liturgy is found this: "I thank thee, O, Lord God! that thou hast not made me a Woman." Before any such ascription could have been framed, the whole spirit of the national thought must have changed from what it was in the days of Miriam, the prophetess, the sister of Moses;" or the days when "Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth" judged Israel under her palm tree, and, inspired the national revolt which delivered her people.</p>
                        <p>Let us turn to what some may, regard as more positive authority on this subject--the teachings of the New Testament. All the direct and positive precepts we find there may be ranged under two heads: Those which relate to the connection of Woman with the public ministry of the church and those which refer to the specific duties of husband and wife. The two sets of passages are usually regarded--so far as I have seen them used--as if they belonged to the same set of relations, and, involved precisely the same ideas. In order to obtain a clear statement of the case they should be considered apart. The most important of those which refer to the relation of husband and wife are: Eph. v., 22, 24; Titus ii., 4, 5; 1 Pet. iii., 1, 3. They consist of exhortations to those moral duties of love, patience and wifely respect which receive the absolute approval of Christendom, and which are so far incorporated with all our habits of thought and feeling that we regard the violation of them with horror, and can hardly conceive of the relation under any other conditions. But precepts regulative of specific obligations are not regulative of others than those
<pb n="84 The Woman's Advocate."/>
specified, and we might as well argue the social subordination of Woman from the Fifth Commandment as from these advisory precepts in the Epistles. It seems also to be forgotten, in that species of argument from them, that there is a counterpart series of precepts from which it might be possible to argue that men owe certain duties to all women, because they are there said to owe them to their wives. Both sets of precepts are of equal force, and both enjoin the mutual consideration, gentleness and honor which make up the civilized ideal of the marriage relation--nothing more.</p>
                        <p>The second class of passages to be examined consists of those which are taken by some to define the relation of Woman to the ministry and service of the Christian Church. They are, I Cor. v., 16; 1 Cor. xiv., 34, 35, 1 Tim. ii., 11, 14--and compose the whole body of passages bearing on the subject. The first two are given to the Corinthian Church, and would seem, from their general tenor, to be intended to regulate disorderly doings, and unbecoming extravagances in their assemblies for worship, instead of teaching that a woman is not to pray or speak publicly, the implication of the language, in 1 Cor. xi., 5, 13, is that she may both pray and prophesy, but not unveiled. Whatever stress may be laid upon 1 Cor. xiv., 34, 35, it would most evidently come under the general idea of the maintainance of order and propriety according to the Jewish conception of the duty of women in public assemblies. If we have any hesitation in adopting this local interpretation of these passages, we may consider that if not so taken but received as a law for the whole Church for all time, they must also be taken in a more literal and stringent sense in all respects, and deny that women shall either entertain their own judgment or instruct others in any truths of the Christian religion. But so rigid an interpretation would be at variance even with apostolic usage, for St. Paul says, "Help those women who labored with me in the Gospel;" Phil. iv., 2--just as much implying their praying, instructing and prophesying as he does when, in the same epistle, he declares of Timothy, "he bath served with me in the gospel;" or in 1 Thes. iii., 2, calls Timothy, "Our fellow laborer in the gospel." So, however literal and consistent, this interpretation is not likely to be favored, since it would deprive the Church of more than half
<pb n="85 The Scriptures versus the Woman Question."/>
its most active and successful laborers, not simply of those who minister to the material wants of the poor or sick, but of those who instruct in religious truth, from its simplest elements to its highest verities.</p>
                        <p>Such are the direct and special precepts we have found in our examination. As to what the general relation of the New Testament is to this subject, may best-be shown by its indirect influence on social relations. That this is, in respect to the status of Woman, always ameliorative, and in its freest activity elevating, only those who are blind alike to the history of the Past, and the conditions of the Present, can possibly deny. It is a principle of interpretation that the parts must follow the tenor of the whole, and if this general view be correct, then our previous construction of specific precepts will be found in entire agreement with it. There, also, is a rule of legislation that no special statute shall controvert or defeat the intention of any general provision. Either the special shall be in agreement, or <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> and not the more comprehensive, shall be disallowed. In both the Hebrew and Christian systems there is an office, personal indeed rather than ritualistic, which men and women have held in common. It is that of prophecy. Its power is derived from that mysterious communication of the Divine, which we name Inspiration. Its special work is to reveal and teach. Under the Hebrew ritual, Woman was excluded from the Priestly, but not from the Prophetic office. The instances of its exercise, indeed, are not numerous, but they are yet sufficient. Miriam, Deborah, Huldah stand on record in the Hebrew history, and in the days of the national decadence, there was "one Anna, a prophetess." That under the Christian system the same principle was retained may be seen from Acts xxi., 9--" And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy"--a text in which it is quite indifferent whether we take the word prophesy in the sense of <hi rend="italic">revealing,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">teaching.</hi> It would not, indeed, be unreasonable to expect that in the present adjustment of the Divine and human, the presence of the Divine power in the human spirit would be more usual than in the Hebrew Church, since these are the days spoken of by the prophet Joel, Acts ii., 16, 17; of Joel ii., 28, 29--and so doubtless it should be, understood--only we have not been careful to receive such understanding.</p>
                        <pb n="86 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Truth comes to the human from the Divine, and that by the very interpretation as it were, of the Divine. On this wonderful but most glorious idea all distinctively spiritual religions agree, be they far as the poles asunder in all else. And while some give it more open recognition than others, it has been wholly excluded from none--unless it be that latest theory of materialism which roots all religion in a primitive fetishism.</p>
                        <p>Our historic analysis may be summed up in these formulas:</p>
                        <p>I. There was a primal equality of the sexes of the race in the very act of Creation.</p>
                        <p>II. That when this primal equality was lost, the Hebrew Legislative took initiation steps towards its restoration.</p>
                        <p>III. That when a system of Divine truth for mankind at large was given, the whole spirit of its founder and of its teachings renews those initiatives of restoration, and more or less, as men comprehend their application, they are worked out in history.</p>
                        <p>Where, then, the Scriptures stand on this question let each answer for himself--"I speak as unto wise men, judge ye what I say."</p>
                        <p>A word of caution to those who, accepting the authority and jealous for the honor of Christianity, represent it or its oracles as adverse to the freedom of humanity. They endanger, as far as human folly can, that which they hold most precious. God is in the written word, but God is no less in human history. To create a real conflict in the activity of the Divine will is not possible, for, it is not "a house divided against itself." To conjure up an apparent one may be easily possible, and will, temporarily at least, work on the side of the rejection of written Revelation--for in spite of its mistakes, its weakness, its hinderances, ultimately the motto of the human spirit will be--"above all things, liberty!"<ref target="wa.wa1.208n1">*</ref>

                        <head>REMEMBRANCES OF MOSCOW.</head>
                        <p>ON the steamer going from Stockholm to St. Petersburg we made the acquaintance of Madame Z----. She had been to the German Springs to regain her health, and now, with her husband, General Z----, was returning to Siberia, where he was stationed. In his early manhood General Z---- had spent a few days on American soil, and had gleaned, and retained in memory, a dozen or more English words, which he took great delight in using, though not always appropos to the occasion. Madame Z---- had five languages at fluent command, the majority of which she had learned from the study of books.</p>
                        <p>They were, both so cordial, so kind and agreeable, and had so at heart the best interests of our then distracted country, that I kept company with them to Moscow, where they spent several weeks preparatory to the long, wearisome journey that was to take them across the Steppes to the interior of Siberia. They spared no effort, while we were together in Moscow, in making known to me the interests of the City; which are scarcely glanced at by the majority of American <sic corr="travelers">travellers</sic>, who, taking the Kremlin as the center of attraction, radiate to the most noted of its 330 churches; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> up its chief palaces; drive through <sic corr="bazaars">bazars</sic>; look with wonder upon the <sic corr="height">hight</sic>, depth and breadth of the great bell, and leave, fancying that they have seen Moscow.</p>
                        <p>One of the most interesting of days was one we spent among the Educational and Charitable institutions of the City. First we visited the University of Moscow, which has the glory of being the oldest institution of the kind in Russia. It was established in 1755 by the Empress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great. Noble woman, to have left so rich an inheritance to the sons of Russia! The pay for a scholarship is but a trifle, and a large number of students are accepted free, so that all who will--save women--may share its benefits. The mothers and daughters contribute to science only, as patients in the Medical Hospital, connected with the University. Its library, of nearly 200,000 volumes, is choice in historic and scientific lore. The Anatomical, Microscopical and Geological collections are rare and complete. With
<pb n="90 The Woman's Advocate."/>
seventy-two professors and lecturers, endowed with the highest qualifications for instructors, one is not surprised to learn that the University of Moscow has been the <hi rend="italic">Alma Mater</hi> of some of Russia's most celebrated scientists and men of letters. Each student is educated with an especial aim in view, and hence the knowledge he gains becomes a living truth.</p>
                        <p>We next visited an Institution of Learning for girls, which, besides educating the daughters of the nobility, takes a few from the humbler walks of life, who may hope to become governesses in aristocratic circles. The system of instruction, and the discipline, was much the same as is found in Convents of other countries. They enter at about twelve years of age, and remain till they are fifteen or sixteen, and, in the meantime, become versed in the rudimentary branches connected with their own, and the French language. They also acquire skill in embroidering, and in playing on the piano. They learn to bow with grace, and to manage a trail, of prescribed court-length, with a tact only to be acquired. The library has a goodly collection of books relating to the lives and miracles of the Saints of the Greek Church, and a few of the standard French novels. Their cabinet of curiosities is limited to ornamental toys--the handiwork of the pupils. Their physical development is dependant upon a morning and evening walk, in rank and file, each squad led, and followed, by a teacher.</p>
                        <p>We said to a man of letters who accompanied us, "there is a meager record of Russian women who have made themselves known to the world through literary, artistic or scientific attainments."</p>
                        <p>"Yes," he replied "our <hi rend="italic">strong-minded</hi> women have mostly worn the crown, and not having always succeeded well in that, we think it best to adapt their education to the sphere they will occupy."</p>
                        <p>"Do all women in Russia marry?" we asked. "And are all mothers competent to assist in, and direct, the education of their sons and daughter?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh no," he rejoined, "we do not expect that of them. Others are left to perform that duty"--(and to stamp their youthful souls with indelible impressions, we threw in parenthetically). "In fact," he said, we consider women only as flowers scattered along the highways and byways of life, to cheer the thorny paths of men."</p>
                        <p>"To be plucked by them," we suggested--"worn for a day and then
<pb n="91 Remembrances of Moscow."/>
cast aside, if only their bloom attracts. But what of the spinsters, those who are left in the market, on the hands of anxious friends, or who are alone in the world?"</p>
                        <p>"We will visit an Institution for such unfortunates if you like," he replied.</p>
                        <p>We entered a large yard, and, under, the shadow of venerable trees approached the building and entered its spacious, sombre halls. Madame, the Director, was sent for, who soon appeared, and learning our wishes amiably consented to gratify them.</p>
                        <p>The inmates of this Institution belong to noble families-there are establishments of a similar kind adapted to the necessities or women occupying less exalted positions in life. Each contributes a certain amount to the Institution, which secures to her a place in this secluded life retreat. We had always looked upon the beatified condition of the Saints, seated upon thrones and singing an unending round of hallelujahs--so often represented by the Old Masters--as exceedingly monotonous; but now to behold human beings, endowed with a double force of <hi rend="italic">body</hi> and <hi rend="italic">soul,</hi> unoccupied by any thought or act save that which benefited self, seemed an <hi rend="italic">unpardonable</hi> waste of God-given strength.</p>
                        <p>We greatly desired to converse with the inmates of the Institution, but our limited time forbade it. The lady Superintendent assured us of their contentment and happiness. She told us that their chief occupation consisted in the rigid observance of the multitudinous feasts and fasts in the Church Calendar. We fancied that we read unrest in more than one face that we beheld, and we thought that there must be smothered yearnings and aspirations in their souls for something better than they had known.</p>
                        <p>"We will close tile interests of the day," said our cicerone, by a visit to the Foundling Hospital."</p>
                        <p>One of the House Physicians guided us through the Wards. "This," said he, "is the room where the children are received, and this cradle--placed upon a turn-table set in the wall so that the depositor is not seen receives the little stranger;" and while he spoke, there was awhirl, and with it a wail which announced that another germ of life, eternal, unknown and unknowing, was launched upon the great world. Sometimes a dozen are thus daily received. If they have been christened, their name is attached to them, inscribed, upon one side of an ivory ticket
<pb n="92 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the reverse side bearing the form of a cross, truly emblematical, we thought, of the opening chapter in this little outcast mariner's life. A number, corresponding to that on the ticket, is turned back to the depositor; and by, presenting this, the claimant can take possession of the child at any time within three months.</p>
                        <p>About 13,000 children are annually received here. We were shown 2,000, and none seemed over three months old. Each was covered by one garment--a slip, tied about the neck. Whether it was the time appointed for, them to cry--for in these wholesale institutions each hour has its duty--or whether they always thus bemoan their fate, we could not say. As we passed through the spacious rooms, up flight of stairs above flight, nurse and baby, bed and cradle, alternated on either side. With a sign from the physician, as we entered each well-ordered Ward, nurses with babes in arms, arose and stood like so many soldiers on parade, bowing in a most servile manner as we passed along the ranks.</p>
                        <p>As a rule, the nurses were poorly clad, the only uniformity observed in their dress being that of a high-crowned, red flannel cap. They were an overworked, ignorant, stupid-looking class of women. The majority are peasants from the country, many of them have been serfs, and are attracted there by the wages paid them--one dollar per month, or double that, if one woman supplies nourishment to two children. It is believed that they often deposit their own child, and then obtain the place as nurse to it, thus securing the child, the pay, and, for a limited time, comfortable support. If the child come nameless, his claim upon eternal life is immediately made sure, by admittance within the pale of the Church, and he is given the benefits that may be derived from the name of the saint who presides over that day in the Russian Calendar. The effects of vaccination recovered from, if the child be strong and healthy, he is sent, with the nurse, to her home, and henceforth for the care she bestows upon him she is paid one dollar per month.</p>
                        <p>In one Ward we entered, there was a general bundling up of babies preparatory to  transporting them to the country. Fifty per cent of the children received by the Institution, die before they are one year old. Those who reach the age of maturity are disposed of as seems good to the Government. Many of the boys become soldiers, and the girls are retained as servants in the hospitals or elsewhere. Formerly the
<pb n="93 Remembrances of Moscow."/>
hospital was supported by donations, and for reasons best known to themselves, doubtless, the nobility were its most liberal patrons. Now the Government has it in charge, and grants for its support, a yearly stipend of $1,000,000. One wing of the building is appropriated for the treatment of unfortunate women. 2,000 are yearly admitted to its secret Wards. The proportion of illegitimate births in Moscow is 37 3-4 per cent., more than 10 per cent above that of Paris.</p>
                        <p>We could not but be impressed with the belief, that this increase of crime is in a great measure due to the covert, easy manner in which it is passed over. If there be no higher law stamped upon the conscience, and nothing within the soul to strengthen it against temptation; then let us not blind the Cyclopean eye of the world, while with its searching gaze it may have power to arrest the vices of men and women, whose condemnation before God, and society, must be meted out in accordance with the transgressions of each.</p>

                        <p>OTHER races have made woman beautiful, the Greeks made her divine. Undoubtedly in ancient Greece, as in modern America, the actual woman was stunted, subordinate, disfranchised. But nations, like men, have a right to appeal from their degradation to their ideals. Tried by this standard, the Greeks placed woman at the highest point she has ever reached. The six primary Greek goddesses may well be considered as six symbolical representations of woman, at six successive periods. We have her whole career depicted, as girl, maiden, lover, wife, mother, and the housekeeper or genius of home. These are represented--to give both the Greek and the more familiar but misleading Roman names--by Artemis or Diana, Athen or Minerva, Aphrodite or Venus, Hera or Juno, Demeter or Ceres, and Hestia or Vesta. * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>That wonderful mythology is gone; the great race shed it, lightly as leaves in autumn, and it went its way into some other sphere. Not till the world is rich enough to have another race more ideal than the Greeks will there be another harvest of anything so beautiful. Nature is rich as ever, and the life of man has grown more practical, more judicious, more sensitive to wrong, more comprehensive in sympathy--common sense has been the gainer, so has common virtue; it is only the ideal which has grown dim. But it may be that we are laying the foundations of a nobler temple than the Greeks ever dreamed of, and we toil among the dust and the rubbish waiting for the goddess and the shrine.--<bibl>

                        <head>SUFFRAGE.</head>
                        <p>THERE is only one great political question now before the country. But that question is fundamental. It is the greatest of all questions, because it underlies all others. It is SUFFRAGE.</p>
                        <p>What is suffrage? It is admission into the political partnership. It is participation in the Government. It is a share, in a corporation the franchises of which are all-embracing and unlimited. Every shareholder in that corporation is a sovereign. He is a peer of the realm. Literally, and not as a figure of speech, his will is Law. Every man who casts a ballot may exclaim with Louis XIV: <hi rend="italic">L'Etat c'est Moi!</hi> "I am the state!"</p>
                        <p>What is Disfranchisement? It is political slavery. It is exclusion from the political partnership. It is subjugation to the government of others. It is the precarious enjoyment of Life, Liberty and Property, not as a right, but as a privilege. It is passive obedience to an omnipotent Corporation in which we have no share, from whose deliberations we are excluded, from whose decision there is no appeal, and from whose power there is no escape.</p>
                        <p>This is no idle, theory, no trick of rhetoric. It is a very inadequate statement of an inexorable political law.  All history testifies to its truth. No man, no woman, while excluded from a share in the government ever did or ever can fully enjoy the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Yet these rights are inalienable in human nature without distinction of Race or Sex. For Government, being only a political partnership of Voters, its direct profits and advantages are appropriated by the class that votes. Disfranchised classes are always subjects and dependants. They always suffer under positive disabilities. They are always intellectually dwarfed, morally debilitated and physically depressed.</p>
                        <p>To this rule there may appear to be individual exceptions. But there are no real exceptions. Because, however exceptional the positive well-being of an individual citizen may be, however unusual his comparative advantages--this well-being and these advantages must have been
<pb n="95 Suffrage."/>
Indefinitely greater if a nobler development had been the common lot of all. Even "Dives is cursed in his palace, while Lazarus languishes on his dung-hill!"</p>
                        <p>"Unfortunately, the most intellectual nation in the world only progresses unconsciously, or even in spite of itself," says About. This is eminently true of America.  When our fathers broke the yoke of Great Britain and "fought seven years for a vote," it is doubtful whether they fully realized its value. The haughty patrician leaders of Massachusetts and Virginia little dreamed that in their struggle for independence they were abdicating their seats of family preeminence and wiping out for ever from American society the traditional Aristocracy of Birth.</p>
                        <p>When Jefferson led the Democracy in that long crusade against property qualifications which only ended with the Dorr Rebellion, neither he, nor the poor white men who were enfranchised, fully realized the glorious consequences of "a white man's government." John Neal said, twenty years ago, that the poor man's vote was worth fifty cents a day to every laboring white man in America. But that was only the minimum material result to the most unenlightened laborer. To millions in this country the ballot has given education, fortune, lucrative political offices and high social position.</p>
                        <p>There has been in America a disfranchised class of Negroes. Excluded from the political partnership, they have been excluded from its profits. They have been subjects and dependants. They have been robbed of wages, education, children, even of personal freedom. Their actual condition was stated by Chief Justice Taney, "black men have no rights that white men are bound to respect."</p>
                        <p>But when the exigencies of the War wrung from a reluctant President as a military necessity the Proclamation of Emancipation, no one dreamed of giving Suffrage to Negroes. Few realize, even now, how partial and incomplete, Emancipation would have been without Suffrage. We should have had a black Ireland festering in our vitals for centuries--a race of paupers tolling beneath a race of land-owners, mutually corrupting and, corrupted.</p>
                        <p>Yet we owe negro suffrage only to that sublime concurrence of circumstances which men call Providential. The result of the War has made it a Political Necessity. <hi rend="italic">Without it, the Union cannot be main-</hi>
                           <pb n="96 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <hi rend="italic">tained.</hi> Even this would not have sufficed. One thing more was needed. It has become a Party necessity. Under our system, no geographical party can hold power. In the South, with scarce enough exceptions to prove the rule, the white men are all Democrats. Therefore the Republicans must have the emancipated slaves as voters. To the Republican party the alternative is Negro Suffrage or Annihilation.</p>
                        <p>Yielding reluctantly to the logic of events, Congress set aside the Provisional governments of the South, excluded the disloyal element from voting and conferred Suffrage upon the freedmen. A concerted effort was made to erase the word white from the Constitutions of the loyal states.</p>
                        <p>But there is a profound prejudice against the African Race in the minds of the American people. Democrats avow it. Republicans share it. In many cases this prejudice is embittered by a cruel personal antipathy. Every effort to enfranchise the Negro by popular vote proved abortive.</p>
                        <p>What was to be done? To go back was ruin, to stand still, impossible, to go forward became again imperative. The Party advanced from the quicksands of Expediency to the solid rock of Principle. The result is "MANHOOD SUFFRAGE."</p>
                        <p>There is still a disfranchised class in America--one only. It is the class of Women.</p>
                        <p>In their minds and persons, in their legal, industrial and social relations, Women manifest the sad results of political oppression. They are subjects and dependants. They are limited in their range of occupation, the victims of fashion, debilitated in health, contracted in mind. They move in moral and material fetters. In proportion to their strength American women work harder and more continuously than men. There is no eight hour law for Women.

                        <p>Too much importance must not be attached to the recent decision in the English Court of Common Pleas declaring that the common law of England gives women no right to vote. This judgment, at the worst, only closes one of the issues raised by the advocates of Woman's Suffrage--it only declares that a woman is not endowed, <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> and by the common law of the land, with the franchise. Many other issues remain. Women did once vote in England at political elections; it will have to be shown how they have lost that privilege. Women do now vote regularly at parochial and some municipal elections--that is to say, a person possessing certain qualifications of property and residence, whether man or woman, votes for the election of poor law guardians and other representative functionaries.--<bibl>

                        <p>We ask Woman's political recognition in the Reconstruction, not merely on account of the laws which afflict her, but because her exclusion is a direct violation of the principle that "Government -is just <hi rend="italic">only</hi> when it obtains the, consent of th governed"--of the principle that political power <hi rend="italic">inheres</hi> in the people.</p>
                        <p>A self-evident <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>--a principle which God has made true--it is not only safe to apply, but it is dangerous <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to apply it. Our fathers omitted its application for the Negro and for the Woman.</p>
                        <p>For the Negro, the rejected principle has just now avenged itself by a war which has wasted our treasure, desolated our homes, and filled countless graves with brave young men, whose blood was shed for the remission of our fathers' sin.</p>
                        <p>For women too, the violated principle is avenging itself. The non-voting class is always a dependent class. Women are excluded from remunerative occupations. Colleges, which freely admit men of every nationality and of every color, close their doors on Woman. She is taught that great questions of State and National interest do not concern her. Thus her mind is made narrow, and her arm, weak. Dwarfed herself, she gives dwarfs in return--

                        <p>THERE is no plainer lesson taught us by the Past than this: that breadth of base and integrity of material give strength, and guarantee endurance, in social and governmental, as in other structures. The weak spot in abandoned theories has appeared where the data were too few. The totter and fall of old empires, like the collapse Of Isabella's dynasty the other day, came of slenderness of root. A patrician order, a scholarly priesthood, an illustrious family, a monied class; institutions based on these may arise and rule, yet cannot but decay. Because they draw vigor from a narrow interest, not from a general need, while the aim of their being is to absorb not to diffuse. They are but trespassers on a domain deeded to universal good.</p>
                        <p>The line of progress on the chart of history runs where general and abiding interests have gained expression, fed by perennial forces. The Reformation individualized the Church, the State and, the School. The leaders of the world, always comparatively few, were in the old days very rare, and without facilities, they died almost without achievement. But they have since drawn recruits, by hundreds, by thousands, from the inert followers of imposing rituals, arbitrary governments and tradition-haunted cloisters. That strange awakening of the modern world--a surprise of Providence--has, in three hundred years, colonized the remotest lands, explored the obscurest wildernesses, measured and charted their mysterious extent; dislodged, analyzed and utilized their minerals; assorted, labelled and acclimated their plants; imported and cross-bred their animals. It has bridged chasms, tunnelled hills, and generated from unknown sources of power, the Mercury of the telegraph, and the Hercules of steam.</p>
                        <p>How have these things been done? By multiplying leaders. The timid scholar of the Past, no longer distrusting the effect of truth, has called for volunteers. In each department of man's life there has been a striking forth of the root. It is more plainly seen by each successive generation, that the eyes and brains of a hundred men, instead of one, will multiply results far more than a hundredfold. Nothing can live by
<pb n="100 The Woman's Advocate."/>
accumulation alone. Growth without diffusion is impossible. This is eminently true of what most dignifies and enriches life. As water responds to heat, in myriad-fold activity and power, so Thought, our great prerogative, is developed by communication: "giving doth not impoverish, nor withholding enrich" in the world of mind where man's wealth is won.</p>
                        <p>All improvement, abiding gain and sure advance, arise from a constitution, quite beyond our deepest mining or most towering architecture. What Providence teaches us is rather to get out of the way and to cheerfully cooperate, to cease to hinder and to work by nature's side.</p>
                        <p>I accept with hearty greeting, the Movement, so evidently "on this line," which in our day and beneath our eyes, is breaking through and shedding off unwise and hurtful prejudices about Women. The thought of antagonism between man and woman is preposterous; as though we can be advanced by her discouragement. The theory that the activities of mind, which prompt to this or that enquiry, to this or that career, should be recognized and aided in a man, but ridiculed and curbed in his sister, is illogical. The dread lest knowledge, equal facilities and the ballot, while they ennoble him may ruin her, is timidity. The conception that we shall less love or admire one whose character and pursuits more challenge our respect, is blindness. The assumption that the Creator's objects can be contravened by removing disabilities from women, is infidel. These are chimeras I cannot credit. They are certainly prejudices, or at best illusions.</p>
                        <p>If asked to decree privileges or to urge desirable undertakings, we may doubt the necessity or wisdom of factitious stimuli. But who should withstand the repeal of unequal laws, the removal of disfranchisement?. Who would not take away impediments, and, instead of discouragement, extend a helping hand? In this, as in other matters, we ought not to fear the result of leaving to nature and to Providence unfettered play.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that, as a matter of fact, the condition of women does change with that of men. Look at the Catholic, the Quaker, the Calvinist. There are women with us side by side; Guyon and Fenelon, Elizabeth Fry, and Joseph Gurney, Lyman Beecher and his first wife, of whom he says, "She was the only person I ever met whom I felt to be quite my
<pb n="101 Large Roots--Ample Fruits."/>
equal in argument!" The same society is represented by de Stael as by Constant; beside Samuel Johnson there is Hannah More. Why not accept and welcome nature's fiat? It seems to be the Creator's plan; can we hit upon a better?</p>
                        <p>It is impossible that a Government, professedly and in fact, existing by "consent of the governed," can long exclude from its Constituency one-half its people. Nor is it credible that our industrial system, whose characteristic motto is, "The tools to him who can use them," will long refuse to women the incentive, "Try," or its supplement, "A fair day's wages for a fair day's work." As to political action while women are certainly possessed of intelligence and conscience, we not only ought not but cannot afford to decline their contribution to "the common sense of most" on which we rely to "hold a fretful realm in awe." And we need not fear that many women, among those whom a constituency of both sexes <hi rend="italic">may</hi> select as fitting representatives, will make themselves ridiculous or betray their trust. Political enfranchisement and eligibility for our women are measures of mere justice, and no doubt, like other concessions to right, will prove wholesome. The basis of our common-wealth will be the broader therefor; its roots, of doubled length, will elaborate better fruit; of which, doubtless, the State has abundant need. So far as woman is concerned, governmental reforms are valuable only as they may protect more perfectly the pursuit of happiness which, for man or woman, lies in alliance with Providence. All industrial opportunities to which we can welcome women, will contribute to the first requisite of a better life--personal independence. What an intolerable fetter <hi rend="italic">we</hi> should feel exclusion from all pursuits but those of the cook, the tailor, and the schoolmaster! Each undeniably useful, but Oliver asks for "more." To ensure the best fruit, the roots of womanhood must not be cut off at the "dead line" of so small a patch as this. Every child, boy or girl, has a new sense of power, when able to do well a new thing. A chest of tools, and the knowledge how to use them, is more than a source of pleasure; it is a source of self-reliance, of usefulness, and so of happiness. The woman who has made a bureau, or who has brought vegetables and fruit to perfection, is not likely to starve, and is strong in the comfortable conviction of her ability. <hi rend="italic">Skill</hi> in architecture or in landscape gardening, would not make a woman less admirable; it certainly
<pb n="102 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Would make her less helpless. <hi rend="italic">Comprehension</hi> of principles, and practice too; in physiology or law, would not make her home less attractive, and might well help to furnish it. And the fruit born of every useful art and harmonizing science will be bettered by this spreading of the root.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto women have been impelled to varied handicraft,or scope of thought, mainly by cravings of the mind for objects of interest. Pursued without encouragement, or despite disapprobation, they have been acquired with difficulty and have led to no recognized career. Knowledge or skill, by no means convertible into bread and butter, has been its own reward. Of course that reward, as against those discouragements, has been sought, by few. Ought we not to withdraw opposition, to share facilities, and, so far as our sentiment contributes to "public sentiment," ought we not to favor the natural supplement to skilled labor or faithful study, namely, recognized avocations which shall make them available to women in the commonwealth of life? When this incentive shall exist, women will develope talent of mind and hand hitherto unimagined. The terms mechanic, artisan, artist, physician, counsellor, scholar, philosopher, will carry no thought of sex, but only of handicraft and mental life. We shall not hear of "blue stocking" or <hi rend="italic">rara avis,</hi> and derision of "the strong-minded" will have lost any point it ever had. By the side of a more generous manhood will thrive a calmer, abler, healthier Womanhood. The strength and grace of society will be increased, nor will its chivalry decline.</p>
                        <p>The Hebrew lawyer's common sense may be as pertinent as ever: "Take heed what ye intend to do as touching these women; if this counsel be of men it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</p>

                        <head>HOW TO TRAIN GIRLS.</head>
                        <p>THE idiosyncrasies of the body give tone to the individual mind. The upholders of the belief in the inferiority of Woman would do well to remember that in the very beginning of girls' lives, dress, preventing the free use of the limbs, false rules of propriety, prescribed "sphere," all, commence the dwarfing of a true physical development. That girls, so treated, should grow, up poor, stunted creatures, developing only some of the attributes of the human mind, and, often, those few in a morbid condition, is in accordance with certain physiological laws which, were they better understood by humanity, would scarcely be treated with such impunity.</p>
                        <p>Let us give nature a chance to do for our girls all that she does for our boys, and they will have more of the same strength and self-reliance to break through barriers, and bear the burdens of this life. God does not exemplify all his laws of life in any one creature, or species of creation. But no single one has he made a more perfect image of himself than Woman--a fact which should be borne constantly in mind in the training of our girls. Let them run, walk, dance, swim, row and skate until every muscle is strong and under perfect control. Let them be taught every manual dexterity whereby we provide for the comfort of the household; and above all let them be taught some trade or occupation whereby they can make a fair exchange with the world for a living. Make them feel this their <hi rend="italic">right</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> as much as we make boys feel it. The failing to do this is the greatest mistake of the present generation, for if girls be capable of nothing but morbid sentiment or what we term flirtation, they will naturally look to matrimony as their destiny and as a means of support--a self-abasement from which no woman can fully recover, even under the most favorable circumstances.</p>
                        <p>To give vigor and tone to the body and, consequently, to the mind; to give general and special training, is to make girls feel that all the attributes of the human understanding are a part and parcel of their rightful inheritance, and that there is no such thing as truthfully giving their lives into the keeping of another beyond the power of self-control.
<pb n="104 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Let us prove that of nature we have no idiosyncrasies which make us such dependant creatures as the lovers of power and dominion would make us out to be.</p>
                        <p>In this and for many former ages, it has been admitted that Woman has a soul, but when it is declared that "every man must work oat his own salvation" is it safe to trust to others the keeping of Woman's? In a Republic like ours, every man may master some Art whereby he may work out his own immortality--for though his name perish from the earth, yet if he serve to transmit, from generation to generation, some science, craft, art or principle, in the best sense he is immortal; so, too should every Woman have her place as a worker in the great social structure--one that can not be wrested from her when she takes, as a true woman must, her life her hands and demands of man not the product of his toil, his treasure, word or worth, but only room and chance to do her <hi rend="italic">best;</hi> to be too "about her Maker's business." Equal is hers the heritage of sky, air and earth ; hers the same thirsting for knowledge the same, blood, brains, limbs and nerves to train and use in His great work who hath created both Man and Woman--why should equal opportunity be denied?</p>
                        <p>Then, perhaps, in the coming time, when we have all learned to do something, will Society complain no longer of neglected homes, nor men despise the workmanship of their own hands, but find us happier daughters, sisters, wives all mothers, ever loyal to love and duty, not indolent, trifling, never again servile and in the bonds of shame--

                           <p>EVERYWHERE the interest in "The Woman Movement," so termed, is deepening. The rapid strides of public opinion within the past twelvemonth, furnish unmistakable evidence that no Rip Van Winkle slumber will be needed for the eye of faith before the labors of earnest men and women will be crowned with complete success, and all legal and political disabilities of sex be removed from our midst.</p>
                           <p>Wherever the eye turns, in America or in Europe, it is greeted with the most encouraging indications. In England, women--the highest and most intelligent in the realm--are boldly entering learned Associations, and discussing questions, the most abstruse in character in a manner challenging the admiration and testing the powers of <hi rend="italic">savans.</hi> In France, in Germany, and in many a hitherto benighted portion of the Continent, women are calling Conventions; organizing Associations for educational or industrial purposes, and knocking--not without avail--at the doors of century-barred Colleges and Universities.</p>
                           <p>At home--stung, perhaps, to activity by such unwonted spectacle and the fear of a Monarchy (!) leading the van of Woman progress--we witness even a more unmistakable expression of public sentiment. The press ever alive to its bidding, gives unerring indication, by the space devoted to its consideration, how wide-spread and pressing is the Movement. Following the example of the ponderous <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> and the more sprightly <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review,</hi> the American press curry favor, and such tried journals as <hi rend="italic">The Independent</hi> find fellow comrades, and even would-be file leaders in sheets hitherto as yelping curs at the feet of every phase of Human progress. The learned in all walks of life, from Senators to writers of magazine articles, follow in utterance, and, daily, a fresh impetus is given to the Movement. At the Boston Convention, a
<pb n="106 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Senator, proverbially cautious, disdained not to lend his speech and presence to its sessions and Governors and officials scarcely less distinguished have endorsed the utterances of it and similar Conventions.</p>
                           <p>But of all encouraging signs the most hopeful is Woman's own awakening. In the early days of the Movement--with the exception of a few noble women whose labors in the Anti-Slavery Cause had educated them for the work--it drew but little strength from Woman herself. Particularly was it weak in names of women of letters. It had Lucretia Mott and Lydia Maria Child--honored names!--but the fashionable writers of the day, the Miss Leslies and Sarah J. Hales kept carefully aloof. We look in vain, over thirty years of eventful history, for names of women, known in literature, giving countenance to reformatory conventions.</p>
                           <p>But now all this is altered. In America, as in Europe, women of culture are identifying themselves with the Question in all its political aspects. Writers, whose pens have brought them fame, no longer shrink from cooperation with their sisterhood for fear their reputation will suffer from the connection. In the call for the Boston Convention, or upon its list of officers, appear the names of L. Maria Child, Julia Ward Howe, Miss Alcott, Mrs. Isabella Hooker, and Mrs. Horace Mann, all well known as authors, and representing, largely, the culture of New England. At the Providence Convention Miss Nora Perry and Mrs. Sarah H. Whitman added to the number; in our own city the brilliant pen of Mrs. L. G. Calhoun may be fairly counted in its favor, while in other localities the Movement has received like acceleration. This is as it should be. The literary women of America are the natural leaders of the Woman Suffrage movement--the true exponents of the sex. With them fully committed in its favor, we may cherish the expectation that the ballot will not long be denied.</p>

                           <p>A convention of the <hi rend="italic">National Woman's Suffrage Association</hi> was held in Washington on the 19th and 20th u1t., A report of the proceedings will appear next month.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Two Iowa young ladies, Misses Emma and Ella Harlan have secured Government lands, under the Homestead law, which they design settling upon and cultivating next season.</p>
                           <p>It seems that Bishop Moore of California was in advance of Plymouth church in Choosing women as deacons. In 1866 he chose two colored women, members of his church in San Francisco, and in the same year ordained a colored woman to preach, in the conference of Zion's Methodist Church, of which he is a Bishop. The intuitions of this excellent man, black though he be, saw the spiritual fitness of woman thus early.</p>
                           <p>Lucretia Mott, who may be regarded as the pioneer and honored exponent of the Woman's Rights Movement in America, completed her seventy-sixth year on the 3d ult. Since that date Mm. Mott, whose health and intellectual vigor remain unimpaired, has attended the National Woman's Suffrage Convention at Washington, over which she was called to preside, and which she addressed with her accustomed clearness of perception concerning the true needs of Woman. We trust next month to present her remarks in full.</p>
                           <p>Since girls have been admitted to a partial course of instruction at Cambridge, England, hundreds have availed themselves of the privilege. The number of those who entered for the December examinations was 401 against 332 of the preceding year. In the London Centre as it is called, it being simply a place for examination the increase has been from 62 to 136 in one year. It is gratifying to learn that English girls are thus standing side by side with their American sisters in the breaking down of the century-created barriers of prejudice.</p>
                           <p>Miss Emily Faithful], the well-known founder of the Victoria Press for the employment of women compositors, recently lectured upon "Women's Work" in London. Miss Faithfull considered that if the real claims of women were understood, there would be but little difference of opinion respecting them. She demanded that they be duly trained to a knowledge of the higher pursuits, as well as the merely physical; that educational endowments be equally extended; that they be thoroughly qualified for the practice of medicine, and that the unjust position of Woman in the eye of the law be at once redressed. Miss Faithfull took strong grounds in favor of Suffrage, declaring that no important ameliorations could be hoped for until Woman had a representation in Parliament. The address, a very able one, was listened to by a large audience, among whom were Lady Franklin and several Members of Parliament.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>The charter of the IOWA University requires that women shall be admitted to all departments of that institution on the same terms as men. It is probable that future classes, in the medical department especially, will be largely composed of women.</p>
                           <p>"Grim Females" is the title of one of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> (London) <hi rend="italic">Review's</hi> latest studies of the sex. Equally flippant in character, it is scarcely up to the literary standard of preceding papers. It is said that this weekly anatomist of Woman, whose articles are so widely copied, is the Marchioness of Salisbury, the brilliant wife of one of the ablest Tory peers in England.</p>
                           <p>A writer in a recent issue of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> strongly condemns the use of the present fashionable "diminutives" or "changes" of names upon the part of young ladies, arguing therefrom an inherent weakness and inferiority of sex. Did it ever occur to the sapient correspondent of the above named journal that inasmuch as the titles, "Honorable," "Excellency," etc., are mainly monopolized by men, of which, by the by, they have seemed not wholly unmindful, the corruption of Jane to "Jennie," or even of plain Martha to "Mattie," should not be regarded as a weakness wholly without the pale of forgiveness. Give our girls incentives to action such as beacon the career of American youth; remove the restrictions of law and prejudice, closing like a coffin-lid above many a maidenly aspiration, and, our word for it, there will be less of this petty wasting of time and power of which the "Hermans" and "Rolands" of the day so feelingly complain.</p>
                           <p>One of our religious journals, whose ear has been alike reached and pained by the recent agitation of the Woman Question, files the following objections to women voting:

The above, written in all seriousness, we lay before our readers, feeling that this Nineteenth Century constrains us from a word of comment.</p>

                           <p>Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell gave a very interesting lecture in Washington on the 15th ult. Their object was to present the claims of "Woman Suffrage, on its merits," before a vote should be taken upon any of the bills for the extension of Suffrage to Women now before Congress. Although a very unfavorable evening, Metzerott Hall was fairly filled with a highly intelligent audience of more an three hundred persons, including a large number of Senators and Representatives. Hon. Henry Wilson of Mass. presided, made a brief introductory speech, and introduced the speakers.</p>
                           <p>In addition to the general arguments, special attention was called by both speakers to the culpable neglect of Congress, from the foundation of the Capitol to the present day, in allowing the ancient laws of Maryland and the old English Common Law to remain in force, unaltered, against the wives, mothers and widows of the District of Columbia. A woman who marries in Washington, loses all her personal property. It becomes absolutely her husband's. She loses the use and income of her real estate, as long as her husband lives. She has no right to her earnings. She has no right to her children. She cannot buy, nor sell, nor make a contract. She cannot make a valid will. When her husband dies, he may will all his personal property, and even what was her own before marriage, away from her, leaving her absolutely without a cent. If he leaves no will, she is entitled to one-third of the personal property, if there are children; or if there are no children, she succeeds to one-half. Of his real estate, she is entitled to <hi rend="italic">the life-use</hi> of one-third, if no other provision for her has been made in the will; or in lieu of this, a sale of the real estate may be made, in which case she is entitled to <hi rend="italic">not more than one seventh, nor less than one-tenth of its proceeds,</hi> at the discretion of the Administrator, etc., etc. This confiscation of property, deprivation of children, and limitation of personal rights was shown to be, in the case of married women under the legislation of Congress, analogous to the condition of the Negro slaves under the old slave code, the cruel result of class legislation by men alone.</p>
                           <p>In regard to the action of Congress in extending suffrage, the speakers urged a separation of the two questions of Race and Sex, as essential to the interests of both. Many Republicans were in favor of suffrage for the Negro, and opposed to suffrage for woman. Many Democrats were in favor of sufrrage for woman, and opposed to suffrage for the Negro. It was doing injustice to either question to complicate it with the other. Parallel Amendments should be submitted to the State Legislatures by Congress--one prohibiting political distinctions on account of Race, the other, on account of Sex.</p>
                           <p>Hearty thanks and commendations were expressed for the Bill extending Suffrage to Women in the District and Territories, introduced
<pb n="111 Notes"/>
into the Senate by Hon. Henry Wilson of Mass., and into the House by Hon. G. W. Julian of Ind., also for the proposed Constitutional Amendments for Universal Suffrage, without distinction of Race or Sex, offered by Messrs. Pomeroy and Julian. After the meeting, the audience-gathered around the platform as if unwilling to separate. Great interest and enthusiasm were manifested. The meeting was a success, and cannot fail to exert a beneficial influence.</p>

                                    <salute>DEAR SIR--</salute>
                                    <p>On behalf of the above society I write to say that we feel, both individually and as a committee, so much indebted to you for what you have done for us and for our case that we could not hear of the result of the Westminster election without feelings of the deepest regret, and we trust you will not deem it intrusive if we venture to express the disappointment we felt at an event which came upon us as a great blow, when we were trusting to your influence in this new Parliament to advance the question of women's suffrage.</p>
                                    <p>Our feelings of pain and regret were not, however confined to considerations connected with our own cause.</p>
                                    <p>We regretted still more that any constituency could have rejected one of such high powers of thought and great attainments. We fear, because of your fearless protest against injustice to a race too long downtrodden by almost every nation as evinced by the great moral courage you displayed, along with Mr. P. A. Taylor, in the prosecution of Governor Eyre--an act for which an enlightened posterity may regard you even more highly than for your eminent intellectual endowments.</p>
                                    <p>We feel that, whether in or out of Parliament, your talents will be actively and conscientiously employed in the promotion of such objects as you have felt it your duty to help on heretofore, so that no constituency or section of men can hinder, by any one act of theirs, the advance of truth and justice.</p>
                                    <salute>Rejoicing in this belief, and hoping you will kindly accept the sincere expression of our gratitude and sympathy, I am, dear sir, yours sincerely,</salute>

                                    <salute>DEAR MADAM--</salute>
                                    <p>Few things could be more gratifying to me than the letter with which I have been honored by you and your committee, and I beg yon to accept and to convey to the committee my warmest acknowledgments.</p>
                                    <p>Of all my recollections connected with the House of Commons, that of my having had the honor of being the first to make the claim of women to the suffrage a Parliamentary question is the most gratifying, as I believe it to have been the most important public service that circumstances made it in my power to render. This is now a thing accomplished, and the cause has a sufficient
<pb n="112 The Woman's Advocate."/>
number of supporters among the best men in the House of Commons to carry on as much of the contest as can be conducted there. It remains for the intelligent women of the country to give their moral support to the men who are engaged in urging their claims, and to open the Minds of the less intelligent to the fact that political freedom is the only effectual remedy for the evils which most women are conscious that Women suffer. Whatever power I may have to promote this cause outside the House of Commons I shall not fall to exert to to the uttermost.</p>
                                    <p>Your expressions of sympathy with my feelings and approbation of my conduct on the subject of the Jamaica atrocities are peculiarly grateful to me; for it has been with especial sorrow that I have seen so many women cold and unmoved at the recital of sufferings which it might have been supposed would at least have aroused some womanly pity and generous indignation against the perpetrators. It is peculiarly among women who are not aware that it is their duty to use their intelligence on matters of politics that the severest condemnation of Mr. Eyre and his instruments should have been found; for if such women had possessed the warmth of heart which all women ought to have, their feelings would have revolted at the tortures inflicted, and they would have considered the reasonings by which these were attempted to be palliated as beyond their province. As it is, the conduct of so many among them has afforded one more evidence that the renunciation of masculine intelligence gives no security for womanly kindness.</p>
                                    <salute> I am, dear Madam, very sincerely yours,</salute>

                           <p>CLOSELY following the Vineland Convention was the Rhode Island Woman Suffrage Convention, which convened at Providence on the 11th of December. The Convention was called to order by Mrs. Paulina W. Davis, and a permanent organization was effected by the election of Mrs. Elizabeth B. Chace, President, assisted by numerous Vice-Presidents and other officers. The Convention was largely attended, and the sessions, continuing throughout the day and evening, were of a highly interesting character. Letters, expressive of sympathy, were received from George Wm. Curtis, Mary L. Booth, James Freeman Clarke, D.D., Rev. Samuel J. May and others. Able addresses were delivered by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Lucy Stone, Frederick Douglass, Henry B. Blackwell, Mrs. 0. F. Shepard, Stephen S. Foster, Dr. Mercy B. Jackson and other friends of the Movement. The President, upon taking the chair, spoke as follows:</p>

sons of both sexes, and in behalf of the women, thus stepping out of the routine of our daily life, I feel justified in saying that it is in no spirit of mere selfishness on the one hand, or of antagonism on the other, that we urge the consideration of this question. With both men and women, it is first, and above all, because of a sincere and well considered conviction, that to every human being belongs every human right. And second, because of what Women suffer from disabilities which grow out of their political disfranchisement, we claim that the ballot, of which men so proudly boast that it is the rich birth-right of every American citizen shall be restored to woman as her birth-right also.</p>
                                    <p>But, we further believe that in the consequences, resulting from the denial of suffrage to woman, she does not suffer alone. As in the dark days of slavery, the master was more corrupted and brutalized by the unnatural system than the slave, so we believe that man, in his moral nature, is more injured than woman by this inequality.</p>
                                    <p>It is a notorious fact that the places to which men resort for the enjoyment of their boasted privilege of American citizenship, are so corrupt that the most common argument against the presence of women at the polls, is that their purity and delicacy will be endangered by going there. What careful mother must not shudder to send her boy of twenty-one years where it is not considered safe for her to go with him.</p>
                                    <p>We believe that this fact itself shows that woman is needed at the polls, and that her presence alone can make these places fit for both men and women.</p>
                                    <p>And further still, we think that in the halls of legislation, her keener moral sense should be exerted. We know that throughout our State of Rhode Island, young men are sinking into the abyss of intemperance, because their mothers and sisters cannot vote to blot out the license law, which disgraces our statutes and shames our civilization.</p>
                                    <p>We trust, therefore, that the discussion in this meeting will lead thoughtful minds all over the State to consider whether the time has not come when the word male should be stricken from our constitution, and women be no longer classed with idiots and criminals.</p>

                                    <p> * * * Woman's right to vote rests on the same foundation that man's right to vote rests upon. There is not a woman in the country who has not political preferences, and why should she not have the right to express those preferences? The women of this nation wanted Grant for President and not Seymour. It would have been glorious if they could have expressed that preference.</p>
                                    <p>I cannot say much about woman's wrongs. The men love them too much to wrong them. They have wrongs on the statute-book, to be sure; but if every wrong enumerated were righted to-morrow, I should be just as strongly in favor of Woman's suffrage as now. Everybody in this country with a conscience and a conviction has a duty to perform towards this government, and that is to infuse
<pb n="115 Home Intelligence."/>
that conscience and that conviction into the government by voting for such men and for such measures as accord with their highest convictions and their highest  conscience.</p>
                                    <p>I expect to see the day when woman shall take her place on the floor of Congress. I believe they would be as likely to be influential in debate on the floor of Congress as elsewhere. I know at any rate, that in every debate that I have ever yet had with a woman I have got the worst of it.</p>
                                    <p>The women and the negroes are just now about equal, and I think that we should go along together. I should like to attach myself to you ladies in the efforts that I make for liberty and progress, for, I see that you have the inside track. You have ways of attaching yourselves to the governing power which we have not. You are beautiful and we are not. Your faces have a charm to the governing power. Our's have not. I believe that a Woman's Rights Convention has never yet been mobbed or had bad eggs thrown at its members. The American eagle laid bad eggs for abolitionism. All you have to do is to go up and take your rights and you can have them. If you will promise to take the negro right along with you, take him under your protecting wing, and see to it that we get our rights as well as you, I am for you; and if you do not I am for you.</p>

                        <p>When I was a little child my father had fifty ships upon the sea. Each ship had its captain, and many of these captains had been in his employ for years. I knew them all by name, and nothing pleased me more than to hear that one of <hi rend="italic">our ships</hi> was coming up the Bay. I know I thought that my father's vessels had a wonderful faculty for getting in on Sunday. On that night I was allowed to sit up late, and, it seemed to me that nearly every Sunday witnessed the arrival of a burly sailor, who came with the ship's papers, on his way to his own home, and snatched a kiss as he put me on his knee--where he pulled my curls at his leisure, and I retorted by diving unrebuked into his deep pockets. I was a favorite with these men--partly because I was their owner's daughter; partly because I listened devoutly to their long stories, and should have believed them if they had told me of an iron mountain or a roc's egg. They liked the unconscious flattery of the little note-book in which I wrote down all they told me; and long after my father's orders for my cabinet were fulfilled, no one of them ever came ashore without
<pb n="118 The Woman's Advocate."/>
a shell or a stone picked up for me on his own account. The distant collections of University College long ago absorbed the cabinet, but I have never parted with the dainty love-gifts of these old friends.</p>
                        <p>It was because we were on such terms that I sat unrebuked, listening to all their business talk, long after my little eyes ought to have been closed. Sometimes there would be a stormy Sunday, when my father would go down to the wharf two or three times, afraid that the pilot would not put out, anxious lest the captain should not "make" the lights, and so on. It used to strike me, even then, that no one ever worried about the <hi rend="italic">pilots.</hi> It was the captain who was thought of, condoled with, and looked out for. Sometimes, on stormy nights, the pilot would bring up a package of papers, mutter a hasty a assurance of the ship's safety and-hurry away, shaking his dread-naught, and never once asked to come in and warm his fingers. If it had been the captain, he would have been set down to hot coffee and oysters. When I remonstrated with my father, he only laughed. "Poh, child!" he would say, "the pilots know what they are about; they don't want any cossetting. Making channels these fifty years, it stands to reason they can't get drowned. And as for cold and, storm, they are their bread and meat."</p>
                        <p>And when, a few hours after, the captain made his appearance, I found to my amazement that he was generally of my father's opinion.  I expected <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would be grateful to the pilot who had gone out in the storm to meet him; but no, he generally scolded because he had come so late. He had not seen the signal, he had tarried to "clear" some other ship, or he had been fall of unnecessary cautions and kept the ship back!</p>
                        <p>"Papa," I said one day, when my sympathies had been greatly excited, "What do they have pilots at all for? Why don't the captain bring in his own ship?"</p>
                        <p>"My dear child," he said turning suddenly, as if he thought I had lost my wits; "don't you know a good pilot is worth a dozen captains. A mate, a supercargo, even a common sailor can take the captain's place if he falls sick and dies, but a good pilot comes only once in a generation, and when he dies he is missed for years. The captain sails under the stars on the open sea; the pilot stays along the shore 'where wave and margin meet,' and where the channel may change in twenty-
<pb n="119 Breakers."/>
four hours. The captain would be poorly off, when he wanted to make land, if it were not for the pilot."</p>
                        <p>"But don't he ever get on ?" I persisted "Will he never have a handsome ship, or be anything but a pilot? Can't he ever stay at home on stormy nights?"</p>
                        <p>"My dear child," said my father again, but with a gathering sadness in his voice, as if he suddenly realized what course my thoughts were taking; "my dear child, I am afraid he will never 'get on' in your sense of the word; he can be nothing but a pilot. When his hair gets very gray he may possibly be a 'head pilot,' but he will never have anything better than his old tug, and the moment that he feels that he can stay at home of a stormy night it will be because his usefulness is over. Nay! my little daughter you had better learn this lesson well. It is just possible the pilot might do the captain's work, but the captain can never take the pilot's."</p>
                        <p>"And nobody loves the pilot!" I said drearily.</p>
                        <p>"Nobody loves the pilot," said my father laughing, and stopped the conversation there.</p>
                        <p>As years passed on, I had many opportunities to think of what my father had said. In those days Boston was a semi-rural town. The cows were still pastured on the Common. At the head of Walnut street Jeremiah Mason's house was still standing, and its neglected pastures swept down Mt. Vernon and over Pinckney street. In Beacon street almost every house stood airily in the midst of a large garden. People had not then begun to worry about summer board; but there were eight of us in the nursery, and my father often took me by the hand in the hot July days, and carried me down to the wharf to spend the day with him. Perched on a high stool at the window of the counting-house, I sat for hours, looking off at the sea; looking at the ships as they loaded or discharged, watching those steering warily out of the bay, or listening to the cheerful chat of the guagers and supercargo. I knew the pilots and many of the captains by sight, and I speculated slowly on the talk I had had with my father, and sometimes asked him a question or two.</p>
                        <p>"The gentlemen don't speak to the pilots," I said once, as I sat watching. "Mr. Norwood walked right by old Ben and never spoke to
<pb n="120 The Woman's Advocate."/>
him, and there he is talking to Capt. Hunt, and making as much fuss as if he had never seen him before."</p>
                        <p>"Perhaps he has not seen him for a year," said my father, for Capt. Hunt has been on a long, voyage, and only got in yesterday. If you want to be prized, little daughter, keep yourself out of sight. One of these days Mr. Norwood may want Capt. Hunt to take a ship, and he must keep on good terms with him."</p>
                        <p>"And why not with old Ben.? I asked in a vexed tone.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, the pilot must work for all the world, whether he likes it or not," said my father. What do you suppose would become of the pilot who refused to drop down for a ship, even if it were the smallest and most worthless? But a captain sails only when and for whom he pleases. Beside the pilot lives on the wharf, and goes up and down the bay as often as wind and wave will serve. Our merchants see him a dozen times a day, and always when they are most hurried and occupied. They no more think of taking off their hats to him than I take off mine to you, little Kitty, whom I love a great deal better than some of the people I treat to that civility."</p>
                        <p>"You never take off your hat to me, of course, papa," I said gleefully, "but then I think you might just speak! Yesterday I walked all the way home from my riding lesson by your side, and you never spoke to me once."</p>
                        <p>"And that should teach you to be charitable, Kitty," my father said. "I dare say I was thinking of some disagreeable thing, and should have been very glad to hear your voice."</p>
                        <p>"But how can you think of disagreeable things, papa, when you make so much money. I heard Mr. Norwood say that you had made a hundred thousand dollars on the last cargo of tea the 'Steiglitz' brought you. Was that true, papa?"</p>
                        <p>My father paused a moment with a weary look, and -then said, Yes, Kitty, it was true, but it was also true that I lost a hundred and fifty thousand by the wreck of the 'Calumet' the week before, and that Mr. Norwood does not know. So you see, though he thinks I am growing rich very fast, I am really poorer than I was two weeks ago; and if the 'Steiglitz' had not made a good voyage, little Kitty, I am afraid to think what might have happened to your riding lessons!"</p>
                        <pb n="121 Breakers."/>
                        <p>"Was it profits you lost, papa, or property?" I asked hastily, for my father had long ago taught me the difference between the two.</p>
                        <p>"It was property."</p>
                        <p>"And may I tell Mr. Norwood," I said eagerly, and not without reason, for I had heard him blaming my father for not subscribing largely to a New Bethel. My father looked astonished. "No indeed, little Kitty," he answered, "merchants must keep their own secrets, and I should not talk to you if I had not learn't long ago that Kitty could keep mine." So saying he went away for a moment, and came back bringing me some ship biscuit and some candied oranges and pineapple, which lay packed in Canton boxes at the other end of the store. I was very fond of these dainties, and so indeed was my father, but I did not like their appearance at this moment, It seemed to me that my father wanted to divert my thoughts, and I was too dignified to permit that. "Papa," said I, giving him a little bit of a nod, and just dropping the sweetmeats, "I should just like to tell you what I would do with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hundred and fifty thousand dollars if I had it." "Suppose I tell <hi rend="italic">you?"</hi> said my father, laughing. I stared silently, for I did not imagine that my father could guess.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said my father, answering my unspoken question. "I rather think I could tell. In the first place, old Mrs. Effinger, opposite the West Church, would be sure to have a new Bible directly, and I suspect it would have to be printed on purpose with letters an inch long, so that she could find the text for herself; and old Mrs. Knowlton, by the mill-pond, would be set up with a pension in tea and white sugar; then the infant-school, down in Baldwin Place, would have a new bath tub, and perhaps--I am not quite sure--but perhaps you would hire a servant to scrub the babies; and then little Elsie Flynn would be sent to the Blind Asylum; and cousin Harry would go to Europe. Should you ask him to send you a new cloak from Paris, Kitty?"</p>
                        <p>I had listened breathlessly to what my father said, but this roused me. "No indeed papa, you know I should not but I can't think how ever you guessed ?"</p>
                        <p>"Because I know what is in my little girl's heart and mind. But, Kitty, what I meant to say is, that although I know what you want to do, yet if you had the money, I am sure you would not do it."</p>
                        <pb n="122 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"Not do it, papa--not if it were my very own?" I exclaimed.</p>
                        <p>No, my child, because all this money would bring with it duties, of which you do not yet dream. I suppose you meant to earn it? Well, you would begin with a very little. Some lucky day you would make two or three thousand dollars. You would want to do some kind thing with it, but you would think, I need this to enlarge my business, I will wait for the next lucky day. As your business increased you would need more and more money, in proportion, You would find the truth of the old proverb, that 'money makes money.' You would not love your money for itself, but your mind would be so occupied with it--you would be so full of all the small cares it would bring, that you would think you could not give the time to these kindnesses. You would keep deferring the execution of our wishes, perhaps you would not even put them into your will."</p>
                        <p>I felt pretty sure I should, but I only said, "about the duties papa, you have not said a word about the duties?"</p>
                        <p>"I must not say much," he answered, "but I will give you one example. You and Mr. Norwood, think I ought to give $5,000 to that New Bethel. I have not so much money in the world, that I can honestly give away! When the 'Calumet' was wrecked, eight of her hands perished also, and they all left families. Two of the women have little babies, and I must take care of them through the cold winter. Besides I feel sure the captain of the ship was not to blame. The underwriters think he was. No one will employ him. If I don't, he will be a ruined man. I must build him a new ship, little Kitty, and send him off again."</p>
                        <p>"But oh, papa," I said, with a great feeling of joy at my heart, why can't you tell Mr. Norwood?"</p>
                        <p>"Tell Mr. Norwood?" exclaimed my father under his breath.</p>
                        <p>My father was a curt and reticent man; he had so much to think about that he seldom talked, and nothing astonished the clerks in the counting-room so much as the happy chatter we two used to carry on in those long, restful, summer days. But my father could always talk with me. I understood him so well, that his words came readily. I know what his exclamation meant, and I said soberly, "papa, if I can't spend my money for the right things, I hope God will never give me any."</p>
                        <pb n="123 Breakers."/>
                        <p>"But what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the right things?" asked my father. You know Kitty, how long I have wanted to keep fifty ships upon the sea together, for one year at least. It was a boy's dream, and I wanted to realize it, but I have never been able to do it. I have often thought I had my fifty ships safe, but a few weeks has always shown me, that at the moment when I launched a new one, somewhere on the wide seas an old one had just changed hands or gone to pieces. Could that be a wrong wish?"</p>
                        <p>"That was to teach you not to keep so many," I said, speaking full and fast upon a subject I had often pondered. "Papa, does God <hi rend="italic">want</hi> you to do so much work?" Isn't he willing you should have a little freedom and pleasure before you die? Papa, all this talk began about pilots and captains, and there is Mr. Norwood now. He won't look at Uncle Ben! Do you know I think you rich merchants are just like captains, you go sailing about wherever you will, or come up the bay with all your canvass spread, but there is something You can't measure for all that; the wind and the wave are stronger than you are, and sometimes, as you said before, papa, the channel changes in a single night--"</p>
                        <p>My father had watched me with a look half serious and half amused. "So you think I want a pilot, little Kate?" he said, interrupting.</p>
                        <p>"Papa, would you take off your hat to one if you saw him?" 1 retorted.</p>
                        <p>"Perhaps I should not know him, he answered. When we are long at sea the faces change."</p>
                        <p>"Well, papa, it is all very well to put the canvass out on the high seas--Captain Hunt told me so himself--but when you near the port, papa? The strongest and fleetest ship has to lie at the dock sometimes."</p>
                        <p>"Shall I take off my hat to you, little Kate?" my father asked gaily, but I saw that his eyes were full of tears. Just then the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> pilot came to have a talk with him. * * * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>It is about two years since the great ninth wave in the tide of human progress--which so lately induced 40,000 women in Great Britain to petition for the franchise--touched our shores. During these two years I have been twice to the Far West, and once to the Far South. I have heard women of all conditions and modes of thought talk of their own

work in this cause. Many have sought my counsel in the study where I now write, either in person or by letter. I have seldom been able to respond with full frankness to such appeals, but what I have never said to any <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> I may safely say to all, and to those whom I wish to address next month, I commend the parable of the preceeding pages.</p>

                        <p>THE women's cause is making very encouraging progress in this State, and making it in the best manner, namely; with moderation, not precipitancy-- and by a wide diffusion of information respecting the reasons for seeking a change--and by a practical and sensible beginning of entrance upon that change, the choice of women, first, to those stations for which their fitness is incontestable, and in which immediate and obvious benefit may be expected from their co&#x00F6;peration. Thus, in Worcester, two or three women, and in Pembroke one, have been placed upon the School Committee; an example which many towns may be expected to follow.<hi rend="italic">--<bibl>Boston Correspondence of the Nat.

                        <p>THERE is extant a Review of one of Mrs. Browning's poems, that does great credit to the heart and head of the author, for his just appreciation and expansive views of woman's intellectual and spiritual capabilities. It is a blessing that there are such men! Yet even this author so much to be commended for liberality of thought, has fallen into a common error--an error of the present as well as of the past--and from which mankind are just beginning to awake. He says, "The same atmosphere suits not both man and woman." He had been speaking of the greatest and most gifted woman who ever held a pen in France, and of her fatal familiarity with emotions and experiences, through which "no woman can pass, and keep sacred the special spirit of her sex." He says, "The only real evil quality of her works seems to be this, that her <hi rend="italic">immorality</hi> is <hi rend="italic">mannish.</hi> The discipline to which she subjects her hero is a discipline of which a man might conceive for himself, but from the thought of which a woman should recoil with a natural shudder."</p>
                        <p>I would be far from deprecating the spirit which laments that woman should transgress the bounds which "keep sacred the special spirit of her sex," but I would deprecate, yes--reprobate the idea that makes purity a specialty of woman. I would reprobate the idea that while woman must be pure in heart in order to see God, or to stand in the sight of man; man may stand as fair in the view of his Maker, and still higher in the consideration of his fellows, for that "discipline" of un-holy and impure associations "from which a woman should recoil with a natural shudder."</p>
                        <p>I have nowhere learned that man can breathe carbon with impunity any more than woman; neither can he inhale a pestilent moral atmosphere without the same deadly consequences; without tarnishing indelibly the spotless raiment of the soul. It is this idea that man may follow what desires and inclinations he pleases, and it is all right enough, that has been the bane of society, moral and intellectual, in all ages, and is still the curse of the world, both secular and religious. There is, there can be no discipline so good
<pb n="129 Immunity of Sex."/>
and so strict as that which keeps the heart with all diligence from all unholy thoughts and desires--as that which loves truth and purity for their own intrinsic loveliness, and follows after holiness because of its conformity to the likeness of God. How strange would Scripture sound rendered like the following: <hi rend="italic">God cannot look upon sin, in a woman, with the least allowance. Cleanse your hearts, ye women, and purify your hands ye double-minded daughters of Adam. Let the wicked woman forsake her way, and the unrighteous woman her thoughts. Regard not iniquity in your hearts, ye careless daughters, for purity is the special spirit of your sex. Teach all these commandments to your daughters, rising up early and teaching, but let your sons conceive for themselves that discipline from the thought of which a woman should recoil with a natural shudder.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>How strange that man should argue against woman's exercise of equal intellectual and political rights on the ground of contaminating her with his own follies and vices, while be is blind to the fact that unless the husbands and fathers of the coming generation <hi rend="italic">purify their own hearts,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">daughters</hi> of that generation, as well as the sons, will equal and exceed "George Sand" in all that is most deplorable!</p>
                        <p>Why was not the son of Adam born in the likeness of God? Plainly, because Adam did not bear that likeness himself. As the daughters of the Nineteenth Century are manifesting that they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> inherited the <hi rend="italic">ntellect</hi> of their fathers, let not any one, taking upon himself the responsibility of a father, hold himself guiltless if his daughter prove to have inherited <hi rend="italic">also</hi> his <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> characteristics. Let not Society take to their hearts and their homes the impure man, while they reject with scorn the fallen woman; but when either turns from the evil way, say not " Stand thou there, I am holier than thou;" but reply with the Saviour, "Neither do I condemn thee--go and sin no more."</p>
                        <p>Then shall we see <hi rend="italic">men</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">women</hi> who can see "illusions vanish without losing faith in the realities which survive all illusion, too clear-sighted to be sentimental, too sincere to scoff; who can be thwarted without being perverted, vexed but not vitiated, swift-sighted to pierce every disguise of falsehood, but strong-hearted with the immortal <hi rend="italic">love</hi> of Truth!</p>

                        <docDate>NO. III. MARCH, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>William P. Tomlinson</docAuthor>
                        <p>As accident not unfrequently determines the course of a stream, so in life some incident, perhaps at the time lightly regarded, gives direction to the channel of thought, and ultimately results in the shaping of an entirely different character. It was thus with Miriam Talbot. Up to her eighteenth year she had possessed a character differing slightly from that of any of her companions. Naturally intelligent, blessed with a sunny temperament, with more than ordinary charms of person and manners, surrounded, by all creature comforts, life for Miriam Talbot wore none of those phases which reveal its deeper meanings to the understanding. The awakening came with a shock, rudely dissipating all traces of a lightsome, careless girlhood, leaving in its stead only the sober, determined woman. The transformation of character was in this wise.</p>
                        <p>At the date of our sketch, well nigh twenty years ago, the little town of N----, near which Miriam came to reside while on a visit at the home of an uncle, was in a blaze of excitement. The announcement of an Anti-Slavery lecture which sturdy farmer Graves, Miriam's uncle--the, only man, at that early day, in the entire community at all tinctured with Abolitionism--had caused to be circulated, was the bomb whose rapid exploding, by village gossip, was giving rise to the angriest comment. An exciting political campaign, in which the Slavery question had largely entered, was just closing; and to N----; a sleepy town with a large foreign element, with the rankest conservatism as its leading feature, the notice of a set lecture on the hated topic was as oil poured upon the flames of mens' heated passions.</p>
                        <p>The meeting, as was customary at such times in country places, was called in the village school-house; the announcement made being that a popular lecturer from New England would be the speaker--one, albeit a woman, who was known far and wide for her boldness, her fiery vehemence of denunciation of the national evil, and who had carried her crusade against wrong, East and West encountering persecutions that would have deterred any nature cast in a mould less impervious to
<pb n="132 The Woman's Advocate."/>
contumely, or any species of indignity. Long before the hour of the lecture the little building was filled with an excited audience, many of whom were foreigners, rude laborers from some adjacent public works, with a sprinkling of the more respectable farmers and villagers with their wives and children. That a riotous disposition animated many of the assemblage was unmistakably evident, and blunt farmer Graves--who had escorted the speaker to the platform, and who, despite his heresies, was rather popular than otherwise--was kept constantly busy, the few intervening minutes previous to her appearance, in preserving even partial order among the motley assemblage. As soon as practicable he called the unruly body to order, beat upon the rude desk to enforce attention, and, in the lull that succeeded, briefly defined the purpose of the meeting, ending with introducing the speaker and craving for her their respectful attention. She came forward, their lecturer, commanding as ever in presence, with the dauntless earnestness of purpose so eminently a characteristic of her nature, throwing her whole soul into the work, and, for a while, charming the ear, or cowing, by the majesty of her mien, even the most rebellious spirit in all the assemblage. Seldom indeed bad those rude walls given back the echo of a truer or more matchless eloquence. But as she proceeded, warming with her work, and passing from a picture of the slave's hapless condition to the enormity of the crime of human bondage, arraigning the government therefor and especially the party in power, the baser nature of the major portion of the audience began to assert itself, and the interruptions, at times almost preventing speech, were many and protracted. Still, with that marvellous tenacity of purpose her friends so well remember--ah, on that sick bed in her New England home do those days of her <hi rend="italic">triumph</hi> as well as of her martyrdom ever come back to her?--she fought her way from point to point and branch to branch of her discourse, spiking as a skillful artillerist, each gun captured from the enemy; and all the while Miriam Talbot, with cheeks a-crimson at the indignities heaped upon the speaker, sat drinking in that fiery eloquence, with a sense of remorse at past unmindfulness gnawing at her heart, for, to her, every word was a <hi rend="italic">revelation.</hi> Never in her life, previous to that evening, had she listened to an Anti-Slavery discourse. In her city home, none of her fashionable associates were in any way identified with the hateful reform; and the
<pb n="133 Under Ban--A Sketch."/>
few lecturers that had ever ventured before a T---- audience, sure of encountering covert, if not open, hostility, had come and gone without her thought or interest having been in the slightest degree excited. Her father, a prominent conservative and office-holder, had carefully weeded his library of all obnoxious works; and the papers that Miriam occasionally glanced over when diverted from the flowery paths of fiction or poesy invariably breathed nothing but invectives against the "noisy fanatics" and "disrupters of the Government." Still, with Miriam Talbot--
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <lg type="stanza">
                                 <l>"The evil wrought was more the want of thought</l>
                                 <l>Than want of heart."</l>

                           </q>
It was a negative rather than a positive conviction. Her conscience had simply slumbered, and was rudely waking 'neath the knotted lash of the speaker's logic and scorn. And all the while that this revulsion was going on in her breast, confusion dire was more and more asserting itself. Good farmer Graves, called by courtesy "Squire," had gone through all the gradations of temper from respectful entreaty to downright indignation in his effort to preserve the semblance of order, but was acknowledging to himself the probability of a riotous breaking up of the assemblage. The speaker herself, more and more exposed to indignity and even to open threats of violence, although undismayed by the storm she had excited, was losing strength in the increased exertion of making her voice heard, and was beginning to meditate an abrupt closing of her remarks when an expression wrung from her by the malignant spirit of her audience--a retort one not more than human must have pardoned her--capped the climax of indignation.</p>
                        <p>"Northern nagurs, does she call us?"--misinterpreting her words--"put her out, the petticoat tacher!" and, with an Irish yell, a knot of laborers who had gathered together in a corner of the room, made a rush for the platform, while with shrieks of terror women and children vainly essayed to escape by the door, blocking, in their fright, the only means of exit. How it would have fared with the object of their wrath would have been little question, for stout farmer Graves found himself as a child in the grasp of two or three of the most determined of the assailants, and the few peaceably disposed men in the audience sat cowering with terror. But before they could reach where the lecturer stood calmly awaiting the assault, a new actor appeared upon the scene, rapidly bor-

dering upon the tragic. Miriam Talbot had made her way to the platform. Struggling through the crowd, she reached the side of the speaker, almost forcing her person between her and the audience, and confronting the infuriated men, rapidly pressing upon them, her eyes flashing all the scorn of her soul, her voice ringing with trumpet clearness, she cried:</p>
                        <p>"Are ye men and would ye assault a woman? Are ye Americans, and do ye deny freedom of speech to aught of human kind who has eye to see, and heart to feel, the woes of humanity? Back to your seats ye cravens! Is this the lesson ye learn of Republics? But yesterday yourselves oppressed; do ye clothe yourselves wlth privileges, only to deny the boon of freedom to those of humanity yet more unfortunate? Away, I say! What that woman ye would assault has borne testimony to I subscribe to literally. Henceforth my place is by her side! Forever more I cast my lot with her! Her cup I will share: her indignity partake of! I walk with her, and the cross she carries, I must bear also! Back, I say, and carry the shame with ye of this night's work!"</p>
                        <p>Perchance since she of the Bible who pronounced condemnation on the assailers of the chosen of Israel, never fell words upon illiterate men with greater power. They slunk from the withering of her scorn; a moment stood irresolute, then slowly retreating, with muttered curses at being thus balked of their vengeance, more rapidly joined the audience who were now effecting an egress from the building.</p>
                        <p>They slept in each others' arms that night, apostle and disciple, stern teacher of morality and child of inexperience, but the closely cemented bond of sisterhood, made in the trial-hour of danger, was theirs, and the baptism laid upon the younger's brow was a consecration to a Cause, binding for all after time.</p>
                        <p>And Miriam Talbot went back to the city, but no more the unthinking mistress of a beautiful home--the heartless devotee of fashion. Life came to her with a new meaning; a mission was hers, and alone and in secret she sought of the Most High for wisdom to direct her steps. Many trials, bitter to the spirit, were to be encountered. She forsook society. She rigorously marked out for herself a course of study. She familiarized herself with the beautiful writings of Lydia Maria Child, and she hung spellbound on the oratory of Wendell Phillips. She sat at 
<pb n="135 Under Ban--A Sketch."/>
the feet of the sweet-lipped Quakeress, Lucretia Mott, and she sought out the good and pure of the small body of Reformers, making all that was wisest of lore, purest of thought, and loftiest of spirit, hers. They would have marvelled, they who missed the once courted belle from her place in society, could they have beheld her transformed into the earnest student, alone in her chamber, or in some quiet retreat, poring over the lore which was to fit her for a higher mission than that of which her girlhood had ever dreamed. Ever her cross she bore with her. Society placed her under ban. Her father, proud of her no more, finding she could not be diverted from her purpose, almost turned her from his doors, denying her the most common necessities of life. A lover trusted, almost idolized, vainly sought to lure her back to the gayeties of her past life, and then returned her her troth at her earnest entreaties, with bitter upbraidings at the disgrace brought upon his name and hers. She was as a leper. Only the despised Abolitionists, with whom she had cast her lot--a mere handful in numbers--gave her a welcome. All others frowned upon her. Even the servants in her father's house who had listened as it were to the rustle of her silks along the halls, so attentive were they to her commands, now failed to salute her as she passed them clad in the simple garments only her industry had enabled her to procure. Yet she never murmured. Sustained by an inward power, she calmly submitted to the privations that befell her, welcoming as it were all dispensations that brought her into closer kinship with the race whose deliverance from bondage was the one purpose of her new-born being. Distrustful to a fault concerning her own abilities, she for a time held back from the public exercise of speech, seeking only in private ways to promote the cause nearest to her heart. But the moment, when she could no longer bury her talents, came at last.</p>
                        <p>The "dark hours" of the nation were at hand. The infamous Fugitive Slave Bill--that ineffaceable stain on our national legislation--had passed both Houses of Congress, been declared the law of the land, and the North, a shorn Sampson grovelling at the feet of the Delilah of Slavery, was converted into a great hunting ground. Public opinion was gagged. A muzzle was on the press. A statesman towering above his fellows, termed "godlike" in intellect by his
<pb n="136 The Woman's Advocate."/>
admirers, had gone down into the mire of abasement, glorying in his apostacy. Charity was a crime. The north star no longer pointed the way to the fugitive. Men looked into each others' eyes, and saw reflected there the shame of the nation. In the midst of these "evil days," the little band of Abolitionists, undismayed by the mob spirit which ever pursued them, held their annual meeting in N----. Miriam Talbot attended. It was her first visit to the empire city, and her first attenLdance at an Anti-Slavery Convention. As she rode up its great thoroughfare, attended by her uncle, good farmer G----, whose hospitable home latterly had been almost hers, as indeed a daughter's place she had taken in his bluff loving heart--as she looked out on the glittering pageant of moving concourse, towering edifice and varying phase of metropolitan splendor, she could scarcely realize that beneath all its fairness to the eye there lurked the fell elements which had been so often evoked to suppress freedom of utterance. The Convention was a memorable one. There are men and woman, old in the Anti-Slavery warfare, who can recall it, as veterans recall a hardly contested field, and the part played in it by Miriam Talbot has been the fond theme of pen or tongue recounting its incidents. Days before its ccnvocation, the edict had gone forth among the dens and low political haunts of the metropolis that the Convention was to be dispersed, and the hour of its assembling found the street in front of the hall rapidly filling with men, and even women and children, whose passions were inflamed almost to brute ferocity by the incendiary harangues made them by the few noted leaders conspicuous always on such occasions. Miriam and her uncle, pressing through the throng, gained admittance to the building. Recognized by her old friend, the N---- lecturer, she was pressed to accept a seat by her on the platform. There had been a call to order, and some preliminary business had been transacted, but the untoward aspect of things had induced rather a consultation on the part of the members than a prosecution of the usual proceedings. Indeed it was a moment causing no ordinary test of courage. Well they knew, that devoted band of men and women, that no arm of the law would be outstretched to save, and that the howling mob outside might be goaded on to do its worst without the interposition of authority to check the grossest excess of lawlessness.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="137 Under Ban--A Sketch."/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Grasping as by intuition the exigencies of the moment, Miriam Talbot requested her friend to inform the presiding officer that she herself desired to address the Convention. The man banned as an "outlaw," upon whose head had been heaped the obloquy of years, gazed a moment on the slender girl, as though desirous of shielding her from the wrath she would evoke, but reassured by something in her countenance, he rose to his feet, and the announcement that a woman would speak ran with an electric thrill through the assemblage. Nor did it pause there. The outer crowd caught up the murmur; it pressed for admittance, filling every available place, surging even up to the platform, and, for the second time, Miriam Talbot confronted a mob audience. It was a picture, that frail girl looking resolutely into the faces scowlingly upturned to hers, and waiting for a lull in the tumult to begin. Of the speech that followed, indescribable in character, no pen could present even the faintest outline. Heard at first all incredulously, as though those rude men expected a speedy. discomfiture from such temerity, surprise changed swiftly to wrapt attention, ending even with bursts of applause at the impassioned oratory of the speaker. It was an unalloyed triumph. All opposition was disarmed. When the protracted applause, following the delivery of the last word, died away, the would-be rioters, the notorious Capt. W---- at their head (who being taunted a few days thereafter at showing the white feather at an Anti-Slavery meeting, declared that the plucky girl made him half an <hi rend="italic">Abolitionist</hi>); stole quietly away, and the Convention went on, that day and the one succeeding, without any farther interruption.</p>
                        <p>It is not the purpose of this sketch to follow Miriam Talbot further in her life, consecrated by years of labor for humanity. Not alone the North learned to know her voice, New England towns and remote Western villages; but amid the slaveholders and the slaves of the South she wandered oft and long through those gloomy years, wrapped round with the beautiful mantle of purity, preserved from every danger, never wearying, never shrinking from sacrifice. She lives still, rejoicing in the work so nearly accomplished, lending yet her aid and counsel to the oppressed, and waiting hopefully for the full measure of deliverance, in the goodness of God, awaiting the down-trodden of the land.</p>

                           <hi rend="italic">Address of Mrs. Elizabeth B. Chace before the Judiciary Committee of the Rhode Island Legislature on the hearing of the Petitioners for Woman Suffrage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:</p>
                        <p>It has been so universally the custom to treat the idea of Woman Suffrage as a subject for ridicule and merriment, that, in coming before you to urge the prayer of the petitioners, sent up to the Legislature from various parts of the State, we wish to assure you that we make our claim seriously, thoughtfully, earnestly, as the result of long and patient deliberation.</p>
                        <p>We ask for suffrage for women, not as a favor, not as a privilege, but as a right; on the ground that we are human beings, and as such, are entitled to all human rights. We do not make this claim for the gratification of any personal ambitions or retaliations. For, it is a fact well worthy of note, that, although women have long felt the degradation of their inferior position, yet, until, in the progress of enlightenment and reform, they saw that the welfare of the race required that they should share the duties and responsibilities of government, they have silently, patiently and humbly submitted to this deprivation of their just and equal rights.</p>
                        <p>Within the last few years, also, we have been deterred from pressing our claim by the fact that other interests have so filled the heart of humanity, that, although longing to aid by our vote their more rapid success, we knew that our claim for this just recognition could not then be heard. But now, when our nation has fully proved the stability of Republican government, the safety of religious liberty, the necessity of general education, and, above all, when the Nation has decreed that man shall no longer hold property in man; now that the newly emancipated slave and the colored man throughout the land, are on the eve of restoration to all the rights of citizenship, we believe the hour has come to set forth our claim to be made citizens also, as the crowning glory of a righteous, just and safe reconstruction.</p>
                        <p>Surely the United States, which has so far vindicated the rightfulness of self-government, should be the first Nation to give citizenship to the wives, mothers and daughters of the Republic; and the State of Rhode Island, where civil and religious liberty have so long been largely enjoyed, and where the laws in regard to women have been so modified from year to year, that we are now almost on
<pb n="139 Address."/>
an equality with men in holding and disposing of property, this State, so small, that a good idea launched forth in the morning, may be the subject of the evening's conversation in every household; this spot, where the colored man is already enfranchised, and the colored child has free education in our public schools; this <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi> should be the first to give to her daughters what her sons so highly prize--a voice in the making of the laws to which we are all held amenable.</p>
                        <p>Do you say we are represented by our fathers, sons and husbands? We reply by asking you, would men be willing to be so represented? Do you believe that men could so represent each other, that it would only be for half the men to vote? And, that you, gentlemen of the Committee should be included in the half represented by others? Do you believe that the man who votes for a license law, which, makes drunkards of sons and husbands, truly represents his wife and his mother?</p>
                        <p>I hope you will listen patiently to those who will here address you in our behalf, while they show you the reasons why we prefer, hereafter, to represent ourselves, and why we object any longer, to be governed without our consent by laws we have no voice in making.</p>

                                 <head>LETTER TO THE EDITOR.</head>
                                 <p>WHEN any matter of public concern begins to make a mark here, you may be sure it has made broad marks elsewhere. When a word freely spoken for some vital reform gains earnest attention, or even patient hearing, here, you may be sure that reform has strength, prophetic of victory; and this not because men and women with us are poor of soul, below the average, but because, in a center of National Legislation it cannot be expected that questions on which the people have bestowed no thought, and which have not been discussed with some thoroughness, can gain, or claim, attention from public men.</p>
                                 <p>The coming event of woman's suffrage has "cast its shadow before" into the Capitol--or rather its light, like that of the pillar of fire, guiding us, like Israel of old, out of our Egypt into a land of manly and womanly promise.</p>
                                 <p>Two years ago a few Senators voted for universal suffrage in this District--some from high motives, that was the <hi rend="italic">light;</hi> others from lower, that was the <hi rend="italic">shade;</hi> but light and shade alike were prophetic. Last Summer the Memorial of our Universal Franchise Association, and the comments of the delegates who presented it, were heard with respectful and careful attention by the Members of the House Committee, in their room at the Capitol. Hon. G. W. Julian, faithful to his convictions; has moved that suffrage in this District be universal, and a few days since offered an Amendment to the National Constitution making citizenship and suffrage inseparable and irrespective of race or sex. Motion and Amendment were respectfully referred to fit committees. Mr. Pomeroy, of Kansas, led the way in the Senate the grave members of that honorable body treated his motion with quiet decorum. Petitions for universal suffrage meet with the same respect in both Houses.</p>
                                 <p>Not much, you may say, but it is a good deal, <hi rend="italic">for a beginning.</hi> A few years ago such proposals would have met slight or derision, but now the feeling is that they are the beginnings of a great end.</p>
                                 <p>Next, and soon, we must have votes on them, and if you "fight it out on this line" of your moral warfare a surrender will come. This movement, indeed, seems not like a warfare, so much as an education, lifting up the thought and act of men and women to a higher and purer realm.</p>
                                 <p>Last week Lucy Stone and her husband spoke, on a very stormy night, to
<pb n="142 The Woman's Advocate."/>
a large audience, in which were an unusual number of Members Of Congress, and gained appreciative attention.</p>
                                 <p>The Universal Franchise Association of this city, kept up by the efforts of Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing and others, issued a call some weeks since for a "National Woman's Suffrage Convention," which met here this week, closing its two days' session last night at 10 1/2 o'clock. Delegates were present from quite a number of States, even from California; the audiences were good, in the evening very large, and the interest increased to the end. Lucretia Mott presided, and many persons spoke, among them Senator Pomeroy, Mrs. Archibald of Kansas, Col. Hinton, Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony, Robert Purvis, G. T. Downing, Clara Barton, G. B. Stebbins, Mrs. Dr. Hathaway, and Mr. Pillsbury.</p>
                                 <p>Space forbids to give extended report of these meetings, which will awaken a  good deal of thought, and thus be of benefit. An earnest discussion was had on wo resolves of similar purport, one of which was laid on the table, and the second, declaring "that a <hi rend="italic">man's</hi> government is worse than a <hi rend="italic">white</hi> man's government because, as you increase the tyrants you make the condition of the disfranchised class more hopeless and degraded," was put aside and the following substitute passed:</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">"Resolved,</hi> That the privilege to cast a ballot is an individual right, not restricted by color or sex, and one which cannot justly be withheld on the plea that another is unjustly denied the same; and that it is the duty of every honest and consistent lover of justice to urge the securing of that right, ignoring sex or color, even if they be themselves disfranchised."</p>
                                 <p>More might be said of other matters here, of interest, but doubtless your casket is full of gems, and why toss on a pebble to run over? At some other time there may be room for more.</p>

                        <p>WE do not assert that woman will enter the lists and conquer; that she will certainly achieve all that man has achieved; but this we say, "Clear the lists, and let her try."

Of all such objections, on this and kindred subjects, I love to dispose in some such way as this: The broadest and most farsighted intellect is utterly unable to foresee the ultimate consequences of any great social change.

                        <p>IN a lecture on the education of girls, Ruskin says: "Speaking broadly, a man ought to know any language or science he learns, thoroughly, while a woman ought to know the same language or science, only so far as may enable her to sympathize in her husband's pleasures, and in those of his best friends." Farther on, he says: "I tell you that this is to me quite the most amazing among the phenomena of humanity. I am surprised at no depths to which, when once warped from its honor, that humanity can be degraded. But this is wonderful to me--oh, how wonderful! to see the tender and delicate woman among you, with her child at her breast, and a power, if she would wield it, over it, and over its father, purer than the air of heaven, and stronger than the seas of earth--nay, a magnitude of blessing which her husband would not part with for all that earth itself, though it were made of one entire and perfect chrysolite: --to see her abdicate this majesty to play at precedence with her next door neighbor!</p>
                        <p>Wonderful! is it? But not so strange as that Ruskin does not see that "as men sow, so shall they reap." This tender and delicate woman, who abdicates the majesty of true womanhood and stoops to play at precedence with her neighbor, has probably been taught the sciences and languages only so far as to enable her to sympathize in her husband's pleasures! But this is not education. The hungry child on the sidewalk stops to enjoy the savory odors that come from the rich man's kitchen, or perhaps steals in and gathers up the crumbs that have fallen from his table; but we should not therefore call him well fed, nor should we expect from him the physical vigor of one whose bodily needs had been satisfied. Neither can we call one educated who knows only the alphabet, however thoroughly, of the sciences and languages, or one who knows superficially much more than the alphabet. Nor need we wonder that such are not conscious of their birth-right, nor that they stoop to littlenesses of behavior that belong to childhood.</p>
                        <p>Education of girls in the past has been so superficial and incomplete as to have produced comparatively feeble results. It is true that the ability to read and write is the key to the acquisition of all knowledge, and this has long been in the hands of women. But it is not enough to place a magic key in the hands of a child and say, "my dear, this key will unlock the doors to all the treasures in the world," and then leave him to find the doors as best he can. And if this letting-alone is preluded by the assurance that, splendid as these treasures are, they only win for the finder the opprobrious titles of "strong-minded" and "blue-stocking" of course the young girl,
<pb n="144 The Woman's Advocate."/>
who is sensitive to ridicule, comes to think that the treasures are not worth the pains of striving for, and she is satisfied with little more than the key itself. Instead, she seeks satisfaction in things that pertain to the outward woman, and when she comes to the years in which to use her "power, purer than the air of heaven, and stronger than the seas of earth," she knows nothing about this power, and is well prepared to stoop to the game of precedence with her neighbor. Every woman who, under favoring circumstances, has found the doors to the treasuries of knowledge, and has gone in and possessed herself of these imperishable riches, must feel mingled sorrow and indignation, that all these years her sex has been robbed of its birth-right, and the world defrauded of the beneficent influences.</p>
                        <p>Every reason that is urged for the thorough education of the young man, bears with equal force upon the young woman. "Knowledge is power" for man; so is it for woman. Education, in its broadest sense, makes man a better workman, a worthier citizen, a nobler father; so education ennobles woman and all her relations. Between the alphabet and the limit of human powers there is no point at which man may say to woman, "thus far and no farther." Since she has learned to read, much to the astonishment of Turks and some Christians, the barriers of public opinion have slowly yielded and there are signs of promise that before many years they will have disappeared entirely, and that there will be no recognition of sex in the provisions for education. Not many years ago, the public schools of Boston were open to girls only in the Summer time, when their brothers were away at work. Next year the Cambridge University in England will admit women to all its privileges. This is a great change. In our own country there is a rapidly growing interest in this subject, and colleges for women are multiplying, and long-established schools are beginning to open their doors. From this time forth, the supply of opportunities will be proportionate to the demand, and from this time, the responsibility for their right use, will rest mainly with women themselves. It is not wise to dwell sorrowfully and indignantly on the past; it is better to thank God for all good changes, and make haste to improve the golden hours of coming days.</p>
                        <p>One relic of the "barbaric age," which ought immediately to be put away, is the idea prevailing among girls, that to be in school after the mature age of seventeen, is a violation of their "inalienable right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It is pitiful to hear the spoiled children of wealth and fashion, these fruits of the past, these babes in development, who might command every advantage, bewailing the unhappy destiny that keeps them in school at sixteen. They are weak--it would be shocking to be strong! They are near-sighted; they refuse to have their vision extended beyond the worthless pleasures of "society," to the enduring joys of the soul. They

do not catch the signs of the times, so they
do not realize that every year the charms of weakness and ignorance and dependence are growing less potent, and that the time is coming, when such as they will be called the "foolish virgins." Then, the freshness of youth gone, their lamps dim or empty, it will be too late to enter into the full possession of the rich inheritance prepared for every child of God. Neither do these foresee the increased responsibilities of women in the future. Women are feeling more and more their right and duty to share the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship; men are coming to feel the justice of their claim, and perhaps it is not too much to say, that they are beginning to acknowledge that, women who rule beneficently in the home and social circles may also prove to be wise and just administrators of state affairs. There is enough of ignorance and pedantry already employed in public service. Let women see to it that when they are called to this kind of work, they go complete women, with all their powers well trained and at command.</p>
                        <p>Those who are now engaged in the advanced education of young women, have much embarrassment from the preparatory teaching of girls. When they have gone beyond the first requirements of all schools, having in view but two or three years of study at most, they choose here and there a subject that they deem it necessary to have some knowledge of, and in this way they become superficially acquainted with many things. But there is little mental training to be gained in study, without thoroughness, and without a plan and a purpose. The whole system, of education for girls needs to be reconstructed and placed upon a broader and deeper basis. Let parents, whose dearest interest it should be to have their daughters truly educated, join hands with their instructors and raise the standard of their education. Let them so combine intellectual with physical training, that from year to year they shall grow in bodily and mental grace and vigor, and at last be prepared to bless both home and society by their presence.</p>
                        <p>Yes, the world needs strong-minded women. This appellation must be redeemed from the reproach that has gathered about it, and stand for its legitimate meaning. The strength of the strongest man is most powerful when combined with delicacy; so will the delicacy of true womanhood be most effective when it graces strength. There are yet those who blindly cling to the prejudice that completer education will transform the very nature of woman, and unfit her for the duties of domestic life. They are blind indeed who do not see what are the tendencies of those who are only superficially taught. It is such who have gained for vanity the name of woman; it is such who devote themselves to fashion; it is Such who have no aim but to be lifted into Dr. Holland's consummate life; " it is such who having been thus lifted up, shirk the responsibilities of the position and

leave house and children to the care of servants; it is only such to whom the ideal home is impossible. The laws of woman's nature are fixed; she is made in the image of God. We need not fear to develop all her resources. That which is in her nature is planned--
<q direct="unspecified">"To warn, to comfort and command,"</q>
will be more effective to warn, more sweet to comfort, more powerful to command. Truly educated, she will bring to her father's house, or to her own home, a mind so richly stored, and a heart so attuned to the Divine laws that she can be happy without the appliances of wealth; and her guests shall hardly miss the "purple and fine linen" in the delight of her presence. Truly educated, she will have learned that high sculpture is, no artist is called to so exalted a work as she, if she is appointed to motherhood.</p>
                        <p>Truly educated, conscious of her high calling, all that is vain and unworthy in social intercourse will disappear before her approach; her home will grow to be a temple of the living God; her hand will be stretched out to purify and exalt the State.</p>
                        <p>O it will be good for the world, when all its women are as delicate and pure and strong as Womanhood itself.</p>

                        <p>NEITHER do I feel called upon to show what woman's proper sphere is. In every great reform, the majority have always said to the claimant, no matter what he claimed, "You are not fit for such a privilege." Luther asked of the Pope liberty for the masses to read the Bible. The reply was, that it would not be safe to trust the common people with the word of God. "Let them try!" said the great reformer; and the history of three centuries of development and purity proclaims the result. They <hi rend="italic"> have</hi> tried; and look around you for the consequences. The lower classes in France claimed their civil rights--the right to vote, and to direct representation in the government; but the rich and lettered classes, the men of cultivated intellects, cried out "You cannot be made fit." The answer was "Let us try." That France is not, as Spain, utterly crushed beneath the weight of a thousand years of misgovernment, is the answer to those who doubt the ultimate success of this experiment.--<bibl>

                        <p>WHAT do women want?</p>
                        <p>"All that is allowed to men: opportunity for whatever action man is free for." The answer is bold and broad. Is it not also vague? And when did vagueness ever win a triumph? Reading the first number of THE WOMAN'S ADVOCATE I find many generalities against which I have no care to cavil; but only one specific--<hi rend="italic">the claim to the Suffrage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From my earliest manhood I have been a woman's advocate. Sometimes a very partial one. Almost from my boyhood a Chartist, demanding manhood suffrage, I always supplemented it with womanhood. I fought then the battle of <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> as earnestly as", I see others fighting it now. I found the battle of <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> to mean this: Every one for self, and not exactly God for the hindmost. I found that the Brights and the Cobdens tempted too many from our ranks, with cheap bread and other household stuff, through which they recruited the "garrison" of our present institutions. The phrase was Mr. Cobden's own. We Chartists were then--and if there were any Chartists left, would be now--at issue with John Bright on this "garrison" question. We wanted universal suffrage, and he his life through has striven for something less.</p>
                        <p>After the Chartist failure--a failure for which we were mainly indebted to the Manchester men, ("political economists," "free-traders," "peace-men," etc.), some of us turned our thoughts to Republicanism. We found that to involve something more than the question of mere rights, (excellent theory as that was so far as it went), we found ourselves led to the question of <hi rend="italic">duties.</hi> I for one began to think that the question of <hi rend="italic">rights only</hi> had had sufficient prominence during the years of its discussion--some eighteen hundred or thereabouts. Christianity and the French Revolution--it seemed to me--had settled that point. If any farther argument were needed, when you Americans armed the negro, he clinched it for you, with the butt end of his musket. I think there will be no occasion to talk again of <hi rend="italic">Equal Rights.</hi> The theory is established for all time.</p>
                        <p>"But to put the theory in practice, we demand the suffrage for Woman." I answer, that I do not want this secret suffrage for myself; and I will not ask it for any woman whom I respect. I do not want any such right as that of going secretly once in a year, or two, to vote for <hi rend="italic">my Master.</hi> I want liberty to do my best for the world; freedom to make my example, and my voice, and my thought felt in the education of my children and in the work of my own age. For the rest, I can take care of myself without asking
<pb n="148 The Woman's Advocate."/>
leave -of any <hi rend="italic">"representative."</hi> A representative! I know no one who can represent me even for a single day. What do women want? To vote for President, Governors, and Representatives? I thought the gist of the complaint was that men cannot represent women? How also shall women represent men? Are we only to organize two new parties--women <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> men instead of the present Democrats and Republicans? Small gain appears to me in that. Nor any worth to any woman or any man in being "master"--nominal master--during the process of election. Is it worth leaving the bench or the nursery to exercise a "right" and a "sovereignty" which consists merely in being the ten-millionth part, or even the ten-thousandth part owner of "a master of tongue fence"--supposing the elected to be indeed your representative. If not a representative, that is a delegate only, the elected is your master till the next election. The next election has been put off for more than seventeen years in France. And you only change masters here.</p>
                        <p>Is this what women want? If so, God forbid they should get it. We have too many "electors " and politicians in the ring now. The Lord keep our women out of it. "But they want something else." What else? At what are they really aiming? Now the main talk--almost the only talk--is of the ballot.</p>
                        <p>The ballot means voting for Grant, or Seymour, Morrissey or Blank; voting for some improbable, not to say impossible, chance of the better management of the present party machinery, the prolongation of the present <hi rend="italic">effete</hi> system of class-government; the ballot means a share in misgovernment, for only misgovernment is possible under the present essentially unrepublican system.</p>
                        <p>I believe--to speak whole truth--that the Woman Question does mean more than this. I know it should. Perhaps I could say what else some women would have it mean. But will they not say it for me? They can say it better than I can.</p>
                        <p>I think I am helping the Cause if I provoke, even by an unpleasant discussion the formation or outcome of a healthier agitation. I think, by pointing out where, as it seems to me, American Reformers are off the line, I shall be doing more toward helping them to the true solution than by any mere easy vaguenesses which help no-whither, or by repeating the, to me, unfortunate cry of "The Ballot for Woman."</p>

                        <docAuthor>Agnes Howell</docAuthor>
                        <p>BORN and bred in one of the most rural villages of Missouri, innocent of railroads, Yankees, and the progressive spirit generally, and where we rub against the great world only through the medium of newspapers, a great event in my life was a recent visit, in company with a friend, like myself a village girl, to our great and growing city, St. Louis.</p>
                        <p>At home our attention had been several times directed to the minutes of a Woman's Suffrage Association, said to be meeting in the Hall of the St. Louis Mercantile Library, and we had immediately marked that down on our list of sights to be seen, and things to be done. So, early on the Saturday afternoon following our arrival, we wended our way thither, filled with some interest and a great deal of curiosity; but ascending the broad steps leading to the Hall our courage was considerably damped by encountering a crowd of fashionably arrayed mothers, with their little ones (for somehow these ultra fashionables oppress one in spite of one's better judgment) returning from the Matin&#x00E9;e of a Negro Minstrel Troupe. Surmising our destination, we caught their whispered undercurrent of "woman's rights," "hunting a vocation," "how ridiculous," and various other of the stereotyped phrases of the day; which would no doubt have been accompanied by a general uplifting of skirts and passing over to the other side, if the present fashion of short skirts bad not deprived them of that womanly mode of expressing disdain or contempt. As I said, my courage was oozing terribly, for in our village the term "Woman's rights," applied to a matron, is a term of opprobrium only equalled by "Yankee school-marm," and applied to a young lady, in Western parlance, is to ruin "her market forever;" but looking into my companion's face and seeing depicted there, that model resolution I was inwardly praying for, I took heart of grace, and on we went.</p>
                        <p>Timidly knocking at the door of the Hall, it was immediately opened by a sweet-faced young lady, who kindly found us seats, and reassured us by a few pleasant words. Being merely "lookers on in Vienna," we composed ourselves and immediately began that eminently feminine process of making observations, in smothered whispers, upon the proceedings. Though feeling an interest, abstractly considered, in the question, I had never been able to divest my ideas of those female champions, from the light usually thrown upon them by newspaper reporters. Yet the picture before us bore no such coloring. Instead of discontented wives and faded spinsters, seeking a vocation, and grasping at suffrage as a weapon to hurl at their natural enemy,

man, we found ourselves at once in an atmosphere of earnestness and calmness. Shut out from the jar and din of the great mocking city, we found a society of women of wealth, culture, and even of fashion--women seeking this not as an avenue to bring them before the public, but women by birth, culture, and wealth already independent--women whose hearts were satisfied, and whose home-lives were filled with beauty: but some persons are born to be leaders and pioneers of new ideas--are born philanthropists, and it was of these who there; many sustained in their timidity and inexperience by the presence of husbands who could conceive of equality, without rivalry, or encroachment. I saw no levity, heard no jar, felt no discord; wealth had laid aside its trappings, and its possessor was as simply attired as the workwoman who sat by her side; on every countenance was exhibited a purpose, on every care-worn workwoman's face shone the dawn of a hope.</p>
                        <p>I there learned that women claim suffrage not as an end, but as a means for the attainment of an end; that as the slave grasped the musket to emancipate himself from physical bondage, and now claims suffrage to free himself from social degradation, so woman, socially and intellectually emancipated by the spirit of the age, seeks suffrage to free herself from inefficiency and helplessness when, alas, there is too oft no one to help her. Our recent War, and it may be a great underlying purpose beneath, are throwing women upon their own resources as they were never thrown before. In society, in literature, in the fine arts, as a great working element, she is a power, has a voice, and now demands that she be heard in order to open to herself new avenues of labor, to equalize the wages of that labor, and to protect herself in the rights of property. The French historian, Lamartine, has said there was a woman at the base of every Revolution: I predict this is a <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> in which woman is both the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> and the superstructure; that it will not only ameliorate woman, but lift a crushing weight from the shoulders of fathers and brothers. And this organization in St. Louis means work--is working. It was only the other day that I heard one of its most violent and derisive opponents remark: "That thing may accomplish something," and undoubtedly it will. Douglass once remarked that New England was a fine country to be born in, but that it took the strong Western minds to expand him into a Giant; so with this idea of Woman's Suffrage; the seeds were sown among the granite rocks of the East, but the winds wafted them Westward, and the farther West you go, you find the idea in its fuller development. In this organization at St. Louis, I observed one family especially: a mother, her two daughters and their husbands; a family whose social position is not surpassed in St. Louis. One of the daughters, a woman of sweet face and modest deportment, was reading an Essay
<pb n="151 Why Men Should Not Vote."/>
when I entered, and from that Essay, I first gathered the true ideas of the objects of this Association. The benevolent face of an elderly lady by my side attracted my attention; she too I learned was one who might have lived a life of ease, and immunity from all labor; instead of which, I was informed that she had lost even health in deeds of practical benevolence.</p>
                        <p>But when an humble working woman arose, and encouraged by the friendly faces around her, made a call to her fellow laborers of St. Louis, to meet on the following Saturday, to consider things of practical import to them, I felt that I had heard the ring of the true metal, and was content to go, feeling that to some extent the scales had fallen from my eyes, and that woman may yet be found true to woman.</p>

                        <p>THERE are two unanswerable reasons why men should not vote; the first is, that the subject of politics is utterly above their comprehension; the second, that it is totally beneath their notice;--reasons that, like sturdy athletes, are all the stronger for their antagonism.</p>
                        <p>Politics is a mystery, an art, based on such subtleties of economic science as only the most patient student can comprehend, and the most erudite apply to practice. It is a calling for which men are peculiarly unqualified, not only from the low average of the masculine intellect, but even more strikingly from the manifold duties to which they are born, and the true sphere which has been assigned to them by the merciful providence of God.</p>
                        <p>Men were pre-eminently born to labor, to maintain their wives and their daughters. Their only dominion is over the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air,--"born to rule pigs and chickens!" To this end the Maker gave them that brawny strength of frame, and vigorous digestion of pork and beans, that are fatal to great mental achievements; and when they attempt to become rulers and lawmakers, they clearly "resist the ordinance of God, and shall receive to themselves the greater"--disagreeable consequences--to draw it mildly.</p>
                        <p>How admirable they are in their own subordinate sphere; how grotesque and awkward when they leave it! How contemptible when they leave it to be quibbling demagogue or demagogue's tool! Clod-boots trudging behind his plough has a sturdy dignity that I have often admired even Pat with
<pb n="152 The Woman's Advocate."/>
his hod, ascending and descending his Jacob's Ladder, though not quite an angel, has a certain picturesque bearing, a self-centered attitude, quite charming to contemplate, a little way off. But see them with an assumed swagger of independence, which betrays the toady at heart, or the fine venal dollars in the pocket--go to the polls with their votes for a man whose name they could not spell, and whose principles they could not guess, only knowing "he is a first-rate feller, and b'longs t'our side"--and they are objects no longer to be admired, but only to be thought of with mournful reflections! The honest mercer can stand behind his counter as the bulwark of his integrity, with his yard-stick for his sword of Themis but when be comes to the polls, led by his spiritual nose, to cast a name that means nothing to him for a cause that he could not comprehend, and has no desire to comprehend, I think his integrity is left behind the counter, and his good sense stays to keep it company.</p>
                        <p>Let men hew down forests, build mills, make railroads and telegraphs, and even build the lofty rhyme, if now and then one rises with a genius like Mrs. Browning, or Mrs. Hemans, but let them not fly out of their divinely appointed sphere, to become rulers and law-makers. The time required to qualify them for such high claims, renders these wholly incompatible with their true duties, the social, industrial and religious. No man was ever a born voter in this world; the ballot is an invention of our fallen, besotted human nature, in revolt against the ordinance of Heaven. The truly religious mind confesses so much when it prays that God "may <hi rend="italic">give</hi> us rulers"--not that we may elect rulers for ourselves "just rulers, fearing God and eschewing evil." What a piece of blasphemous mockery to make such a prayer and then turn round and vote for some drunken villain, to make him ruler by a count of noses, whom you pretend to have by grace of God!</p>
                        <p>To learn the simplest trade, a man must devote years of patient industry. To fathom the most obvious scientific truths, takes half a life-time of diligent study. But anything, more than an idiot or a woman, who has the profound qualification of being twenty-one years old, is supposed to be competent to select the wisest man, and decide upon the subtlest principles of political economy. What would you say if Hodge, the mason, should presume to practice surgery, and deal with the most delicate vital tissues as with his mortar-shovel and trowel?</p>
                        <p>But would you look at it, the body politic has suffered a severer compound fracture than ever mortal man survived, and you, advocates of manhood suffrage, would set Tom, Dick &#x0026; Co.--hod-carriers and mixers of untempered mortar, who carry their bricks in their own smashed hats--to do the setting, and are credulous enough to expect civic body to stand straight on its legs again!</p>
                        <pb n="153 Why Men Should Not Vote."/>
                        <p>What would you say if the rude wood-chopper and coal-heaver were to assume the responsible duties of the medical profession? But how much less wisdom will suffice for the mending of a nation's broken down constitution, than ordinarily goes to the exhibition of rhubarb and senna? No! the average masculine mind is not qualified for the political duties it arrogates.</p>
                        <p>But the gravest objection is one which leads to our second proposition--the inherent baseness of politics, and may be called the moral objection. When a man, neglecting all his human duties and those laborious callings for which he is so admirably fitted, gives all his life to the subject of politics, what do we see? In proportion as he is qualified for the duties he has assumed he is disqualified for every human duty; and so certain is the moral deterioration that an honest politician is a rarity worthy of giving the man a new nick name, even while honor among thieves is a thing of proverbial notoriety. You say the exception shows that a man can be honest and a politician. Yes, and he can be honest and steal men from Africa and sell them for slaves; but the thing does not conduce to honesty. True, the finer moral sense of women might elevate and purify, to a certain degree, the political morality of the nation, but the experiment would be hazardous to woman. She can bear up against great temptation; but dirt is dirt, and here is a cess-pool that it would not be wise to enter! Politics is a thing too vile for a decent man to meddle with. No self-respect can survive the plunge into its dirty waters, and no claim to the respect of other men, not even from those who are draggling in the same puddle.</p>
                        <p>Man was ordained by God to be the father of the family, the husband, protector and supporter of the most perfect creature of God; and the example of the little ones, who are as the kingdom of heaven. If he dabbles in dirty pools, how certainly will he defile the whiteness of those delicate natures. An immortal soul is to take color and character from him--what will it be if he joins in the vile scramble for power and place? Such contact can only taint him with the deadly virus of sin, that be will bring back to his tender flock and poison them in their nonage, till they can only grow up fit for treasons, politics and office.</p>
                        <p>All moral distinctions are levelled by this base democracy of the ballot. A man is no better than a "dead rabbit." The professing Christian voluntarily stoops to the level of the rough and the rowdy, and the dog-fighter, when he is willing to let his fair nose be counted out by a purple fungus on a bloated face. The vote of Saint Paul would be neutralized by that of the lowest sot from a corner grocery; nay verily, the sot would be in, the majority, for he would vote twice and carry it over the Apostle! Evidently a man is out of his sphere where the loafer matches, or outweighs the saint.</p>
                        <pb n="154 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>God has ordained rulers undoubtedly, as he ordained other plagues. Paul teaches that--from a pulpit where he cannot be balanced by a dead rabbit. The ballot is infidel, an overturning and uprooting of the ordinance of God. The only theory of human government which has Scripture sanction,--after the Patriarchal Institution--is the divine right of kings. The reign of the Patriarchs has gone by, and that of kings is getting shaky. God gave the Jews a king in his wrath; though I can but think he would have shown a subtler malice had he given them universal manhood suffrage! If to give one king is a token of divine vengeance, what would it not be to impose on a people a whole nation of sovereigns? It would appear that Queen Esther ruled by heavenly approval; so while the right of queens is settled on a basis of divine complacency, the kings are apparently a sort of scourge to be endured because men would dabble in politics. Since then, it follows that the strongest is ruler, not by election, but by gift of Heaven. The Can-ing, <hi rend="italic">Konnig</hi>, or cunning man, who is sharp enough to spell <hi rend="italic">able,</hi> is natural <hi rend="italic">Rex,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prex,</hi> an infidel innovation.</p>
                        <p>An undersized man has no rights that a big fellow is bound to respect. Rights are for people who can take care of them; they are not given to slender people, nor ignorant people, nor to bores and workmen. You do not give your child a looking glass and hammer to play with, nor send your gold repeater to the peat-digger to be cobbled, nor set Pat to concocting your sputtering and bouncing chemicals. Every one to his sphere and measure. Shall a little man pretend to the same weight in public affairs as Daniel Lambert? or the living skeleton assume to be not bone only, but the sinews of the commonwealth? Will the dyspeptic make laws for well-folk? Blue laws indeed, were they! No. Let man keep in his sphere, take thankfully the rulers God gives, and not think to choose for himself, and so rush out of his orbit. The purest and wisest, the men of finest genius and best culture have always stood aloof from the ballot; and so will stand. And when only the worst of knaves, and the most sottish of fools, are left to vote, the thing will right itself; God will give us a king in his wrath, or a queen in his, mercy!</p>

                        <p>THE present relation of political parties to the Woman question is similar to that of the old Whig and Democratic parties towards the anti-slavery movement, prior to 1844. A certain amount of sympathy with Freedom existed in both parties. This sympathy was earnestly expressed by individual Democrats, and sometimes even by resolutions of State and County Democratic Conventions. </p>
                        <p>There was a still larger and more pronounced expression of such sympathy among individuals and Conventions of the Whig-party.</p>
                        <p>But those parties, composed in part of slaveholders, could never be induced to act, except in support of Slavery. Both were equally profuse of promises, in certain localities, on the eve of an election; both, equally barren of performance when the election was over.</p>
                        <p>At length the Abolitionists, who believed in political action, grew weary of these empty promises, and organized the LIBERTY PARTY. Few in number, the Liberty Party was originally composed of both Whigs and Democrats. It ignored all existing party issues. On questions of Bank, Tariff and Taxation, it expressed no opinion. It had but one idea, Liberty; one method, Consistency;. one object, Abolition. Its growth was mainly, though not exclusively, at the expense of the Whigs. While yet in its infancy, it attained, in the State of New York, enough votes to hold the balance of power. While still unable to carry a single County, it drew enough votes from the Whig Party to defeat Henry Clay in 1844, and allow the election of a Democratic President, pledged to the annexation of Texas. Horace Greeley denounced the Liberty Party of 1844, as the destroyer of the Country. Posterity will applaud it as the preserver of Liberty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="italic">Our</hi> Liberty Party is not yet formed. But we are on the eve of important changes in the attitude of parties. Before this article meets the eye of the reader, the 40th Congress will have adjourned and, with it, will have terminated, probably forever, the political dictatorship of the Republican party.</p>
                        <p>Since 1860, one fourth of all the States have been excluded from representation in the National Councils, and have been governed by the
<pb n="156 The Woman's Advocate."/>
dominant majorities of the loyal, or Republican States of the North. A part of the Border States,. viz., West Virginia, Tennessee and Missouri have indeed represented but by stringent acts disfranchising the white men lately engaged in rebellion, they have served only to swell the Republican majority. The other Border States, Maryland, Delaware and Kentucky, have generally elected Democratic Senators and Representatives, and have aided the scattering Democratic members from New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, etc.</p>
                        <p>This slender Democratic minority have had powerful auxiliaries in a President and Cabinet of similar proclivities, and in a few members of Congress, selected as Republicans, but estranged from their original party. Nevertheless, the entire opposition has hitherto amounted to less than one third in either house of Congress, and the Congressional majority of two-thirds, being thus enabled to override the Presidential veto, has wielded, by means of Party discipline, an almost unlimited power of legislation.</p>
                        <p>The Impeachment of the resident is the only instance in which the Republicans have hitherto been foiled, and then only by a single vote, and in consequence of a division of opinion in their own body.</p>
                        <p>The most important result of the exclusion of the South has been the ability of the Republicans in Congress to submit various Amendments of the U. S. Constitution to the States. The unexampled Republican preponderance in three-fourths of the State Legislatures, (also a direct result of the War,) has combined to make a ratification of these Constitutional Amendments possible.</p>
                        <p>This unprecedented supremacy of a Party in State and Nation is now at an end. We do not regret it. For however natural, inevitable, and even salutary under existing circumstances it may have been, it is abnormal in its character and unlikely ever again to occur. Indeed its effect must necessarily be to corrupt the party which possesses it, by elevating that party above the legitimate restraints of Public sentiment. Whenever and wherever a party becomes numerically so strong that the mere fact of a nomination in Caucus is equivalent to the election of the nominee, the result is demoralization.</p>
                        <p>This effect is equally visible and deplorable among the Democrats of New York City and the Border States, and among the Republicans of Kansas and New England. The fluctuations of Parties and the varia-
<pb n="157 Principles and Parties."/>
tions of the winds are alike essential to the purity of the political and material atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>The re-admission of the Southern States and the settlement of the Negro question, if simultaneously effected, will go far towards equalizing the future strength of the two great political parties. Practically, the result will be a compromise between them. The enfranchisement of the Negroes (who are all Republicans) is the demand of the Republicans. The enfranchisement of the late Rebels (who are all Democrats) is the demand of the Democrats. The sentiment of the masses (always more liberal and magnanimous than their leaders) is in favor of both.</p>
                        <p>Trading politicians are quick to feel the popular impulse, so the Tribune coins it into the watchword of "Universal Amnesty and Impartial Suffrage."</p>
                        <p>But if "Manhood Suffrage" be established, it will soon be accepted by both parties. Human Nature never struggles long with the Inevitable. Southern Democrats will seek to win and control the Negro vote. However reluctantly, they will stoop to conquer. The white man's brain will seek to control the black man's ballot. To do so, the black man must and will be conciliated. For, thank God! the vote always protect the voter.</p>
                        <p>In the North, when the issues growing out of the war are adjusted, the Democrats will win back many who formerly belonged to their party, or who, by tradition, and constitution, gravitate towards them. Questions of finance, tariff and taxation will divide the present parties and enlist supporters among both.</p>
                        <p>But such questions, however important, concern only the material interests of men. They never did, they never can satisfy the moral aspirations of the human soul. When that day comes, as it probably soon will, a third party will arise. It will be the WOMAN'S PARTY.</p>
                        <p>Many of the friends of Woman Suffrage do not believe this. Some look for aid to the Republicans; some, to the Democrats; we look exclusively to neither. To all such sanguine persons we say "Put not your confidence in Princes!"</p>
                        <p>Politics in America is not a profession, nor a philanthropy. It is a trade. Politicians are dealers in votes as grocers are dealers in sugar. In the very nature of the case, they cannot lead public sentiment. At once timid and selfish, they follow in the wake of every Reform, ready like mercenary soldiers, to enlist on the winning side.</p>
                        <pb n="158 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>The last four years have been, to many advocates of Woman Suffrage, years of experiment. Every effort has been made to induce both the political parties to adopt our Cause--and made in vain.</p>
                        <p>Two, years ago, Congress had under consideration a bill enfranchising Negroes in the District of Columbia. To make Negro Suffrage appear ridiculous, Mr. Cowan of Pennsylvania, moved an amendment enfranchising women also. He did not pretend to be in favor of either. Indeed he said expressly that he was opposed to both. But, as a matter of taste, he preferred that, if negro men vote, white women should vote also. Greatly to his surprise, a few earnest men, <hi rend="italic">all radical Republicans,</hi> men of culture and principle--Gratz Brown of Mo., Anthony of R. I., Foster of Ct., Wade of Ohio, Wilson of Mass., and others--avowed themselves in favor of Woman's Suffrage. They spoke manfully in its favor--and several voted for the amendment upon principle, notwithstanding that it was considered a device of their enemies. Conservatives, both Republicans and Democrats, opposed it. No earnest speech was made by any Democrat in its favor.</p>
                        <p>In the Kansas Legislature, about the same time, the Radical Republicans, "the original free-state men," the old "Liberty Guard," refused to allow the question of Negro Suffrage to be submitted to the people unless the question of Woman Suffrage was also submitted as a simultaneous, but separate proposition. The Democratic minority in the Legislature united with the Radicals and forced the Conservatives to submit both questions.</p>
                        <p>But there as in Washington, what was with the Radical Republicans a matter of principle was with the Democrats avowedly only a party man&#x0153;uvre. In the discussion which followed, both in the Legislature and before the people, not a single prominent Democrat spoke or wrote earnestly in favor of Woman. The Democratic State Convention met during the Campaign and passed a resolution against it. Individual Democrats there were, who exerted a private influence in its favor. But very few who advocated it publicly upon its merits and upon principle. Mr. Train, who came to Kansas avowedly as a Democrat to advocate the Cause among the Democrats, was the chief exception, and he utterly failed to enlist general or permanent Democratic cooperation. And we were frankly told by leading Kansas Democrats who were delegates to the recent New York National Democratic Convention that there was and is very little real sympathy with the Woman Suffrage movement among the Democrats of Kansas.</p>
                        <p>At the National Democratic Convention an able and eloquent appeal in behalf of Woman was met with uproarious ridicule and ironical applause. No earnest word was spoken by a single delegate in its favor. Yet the Boston Post, the leading Democratic newspaper of New England, has advocated Woman Suffrage in several admirable editorials, and gave the best report of the proceedings of the memorable Convention which so successfully organized the Woman Movement in New England.</p>
                        <p>The New York World, moreover, the leading Democratic newspaper of America, while it preserves a cautious neutrality, gives the Woman
<pb n="159 Principles and Parties."/>
question a full and generous hearing, publishing more valuable matter upon the subject than any half-dozen Republican papers.</p>
                        <p>In the Republican party, on the contrary, while there is a bitter and pronounced opposition on the part of the Conservative leaders and members, there is also an earnest and growing minority of both, in favor of Suffrage for Women.</p>
                        <p>In the 40th Congress, three bills in our favor have been presented, all of them by radical Republicans. The men of moral convictions, who form the reliable strength of the party, are rapidly becoming convinced that Women are entitled to equal political rights and that the question should no longer be postponed.</p>
                        <p>Yet the Republican party, as an organization, is not friendly to Suffrage for Women. In no single National Convention has the question ever been mooted. In no single State Convention has Woman Suffrage ever been affirmed. The machinery of the Republican party was actively used against Woman Suffrage in Kansas. The Senators and Representatives indeed gave it a moderate Support. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor and many influential leaders were active it its favor. But the Republican State Convention evaded the question and ignored the issue. The Republican State Committee secretly worked against it. Many Republican leaders denounced it as a Democratic conspiracy against the unity of the Party, and called public meetings to oppose it. In short, the active support and the active opposition were both Republican, while the Democrats preserved a cold and contemptuous neutrality.</p>
                        <p>In New Jersey, a State Woman Suffrage Association, numbering nearly a thousand members, sent a delegation with a petition signed by 760 citizens, to the Republican State Convention of 1867. A member of the Committee on Resolutions vainly endeavored to introduce a resolution affirming the rights of Woman, and in order to prevent its submission to the Convention, the resolutions of the majority, affirming the rights of Negroes, after being read, were not submitted to a vote. The petition was not allowed to be presented, nor the resolution to be read, and by an adroit arrangement of the managers and the chairman, the question was altogether excluded from the Convention.</p>
                        <p>During the recent Congressional debates upon Suffrage in Washington, a flood of petitions, signed literally by hundreds of thousands of names, in favor of Woman Suffrage, have been presented and referred but no action taken. Yet while the Republican majority have shunned the question, and while the Republican organs have sought to ignore it, no earnest Democratic voice has been heard in Senate or House of Representatives in its support. Mr. James Brooks, indeed, adding insult to injury, proposed an amendment to Manhood Suffrage, enfranchising also women and children over 12 years old--thus classing his own mother, wife and sister with infants under guardianship.</p>
                        <p>For ourselves, we long for the ratification of a Constitutional Amendment conferring suffrage upon all men irrespective of Race. That a parallel amendment should not also be submitted and ratified conferring suffrage upon Women is a disgrace to our civilization and our age. But the day which sees the Negro question eliminated from our politics will
<pb n="160 The Woman's Advocate."/>
break the chain which now binds five hundred thousand earnest men to the Republican party. With profound moral convictions, with heroic persistency, these Radicals are storming the citadel of Pro-slavery Aristocracy. That citadel carried--the slave-power annihilated--the Union restored--Manhood suffrage established--these men of ideas, of principles, of positive convictions, will rally to the support of Woman.</p>
                        <p>Let the friends of Woman Suffrage no longer look for aid to any existing political organization. Let us cease to be Republicans or Democrats. Let us appeal to the good men of all parties. Let us organize to vote for our own candidates and our own principles. To effect this, let as avoid all extraneous, or secondary questions. Let us cease to advocate paper money, or specie, tariff, or free-trade, labor or capital, national honesty, or repudiation, Americanism, or Fenianism. Let our sympathies be recalled from Greece, or Ireland, to find their expression nearer home. Upon all extraneous topics let as agree to differ. But upon this one great all-embracing question of Equal Human Rights, without distinction of Sex, let us stand immovable.</p>
                        <p>Above all, let us reject at once and forever any dalliance with the current formulas of political exclusiveness. Proscriptive tests of every nature--of Nobility, of Property, of Nativity, of Religion, of Morals, of Education--all are alike false in principle and will prove pernicious in practice.</p>
                        <p>Let us recognize the free-school and the ballot as the pillars of the great Republic. Let us oppose all qualifications for suffrage but the ability to exercise rational choice--the consent of the governed--the sovereignty of the Individual and the human nature of the Citizen.</p>

                        <docDate>NO. III. MARCH, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>Antoinette Brown Blackwell</docAuthor>
                        <p>IT is currently supposed that voting is somehow allied to fighting; that, the right of suffrage involves military duty. Government is a system of cooperative interests, and correlations are established between <hi rend="italic">taxation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">representation;</hi> between rights, duties, and privileges generally, both in war and peace. A close connection exists between any rational demand and its physical enforcement; yet ballots and bayonets are not therefore necessarily convertible.</p>
                        <p>In the ancient civilizations when <hi rend="italic">might made right,</hi> and the government was the embodiment of that might, every strong male arm was but one more spoke in the government wheel, and bound to turn as the wheel turned, or be broken for its obduracy. Of, course every weaker female arm was comparatively less worth. In a Republican Civilization, where the consent of the citizen creates governmental right, every rational mind becomes part and parcel of the one living wheel of State; and every rational mind is bound, individually, to exert its own fraction of directive influence! This is the wheel of Ezekiel's vision which was full of eyes, and every eye must see from its own stand-point. When, therefore, all these eyes, male and female, or even a majority of them decide, in any given instance, that war is just, necessary, and inevitable, then practically it is inevitable; and males and females are equally bound to uphold such a war in every feasible way, and to the sacrifice of all personal interests for the general good. It is the duty of every citizen to lend his full and most efficient support to all the measures adopted by his Government, so far as he can do this without a violation of his individual conscience; and failing to meet its demands, to willingly suffer such penalty as the Government may see fit to impose. No man can honestly do more than this in upholding his country and no woman can honestly do any less.</p>
                        <p>In the event then of war, and in the matter of police force generally, let us consider the relations of women to physical force.</p>
                        <p>The country, in need of the services of any, or all of her children, has a right to those services! There may come occasions when the whole
<pb n="162 The Woman's Advocate."/>
populace, men, women, and children should rise <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> to repel an invader. The quick sympathies of women, according to all the annals of past history, have never allowed them to remain inactive in such emergencies. Time and again women have stood side by side with men in defending beleaguered cities, and side by side with men have starved willingly rather than admit the invader. Another Duke of Alva, sending peaceful citizens by thousands to execution for their religious faith, would again marshal the girls of fifteen and the women of fifty, as soldiers in defence of civil and religious liberty. What women have voluntarily done in the past, we may pledge them in good faith to willingly repeat in the future.</p>
                        <p>But is all this only self-defence, and ruled out of the pale of ordinary warfare? We accept the fair issue. Will women, as voters, consent to be as eligible to the war draft as to official positions? In a war made by the people as such, all citizens of adult age being virtually represented as the war-making power, the people, men and women jointly, will sustain the war. Little need now of drafting! Enough will press forward as volunteers; and when the most eligible parties, the able-bodied young men have fought and failed, then the old men and the old women will take their places. The young mothers should still keep watch and ward in the homes of the country until the children are needed also.</p>
                        <p>Let me quote from a sentiment written during the darkest days of our late war, when Pennsylvania was invaded and Washington and Bunker Hill threatened : "If need be, if our cherished institutions were really in danger, if the might of slaveholding barbarism were deemed potent enough to destroy our national liberties, partial and one-sided though they are, I for one, leaving my little children to the tender mercies of the aged and the infirm, would learn to handle musket and revolver in the defence of a civilization dearer to me, for their sakes, than life itself." The actual war record of the American women is one of which they have no need to be ashamed!</p>
                        <p>But is it equally the duty of men and women to wield the appliances of physical force? Certainly not! Their relations to government and to society generally are intrinsically unlike; The first need of every government is citizens; and so long as women alone are the ordained
<pb n="163 Political Correlations."/>
mothers, they must be forever exempt from military duty, except in the last extremity. The relation of the woman to the family and to the government is alike fundamental. We assert that the wife and mother often necessarily a non-producer off m'on6y values, is yet justly legally entitled to be an equal moneyed partner in the matrimonial firm by virtue of her relations to the home; and the children of the family. On the same principle the woman, though constitutionally a non-fighter, is justly politically entitled to an equal representation in the government, by virtue of her equal interests, and of her special relations to the present and prospective citizens of the State.</p>
                        <p>The soldier <hi rend="italic">devotes his time and perils his life</hi> in the interest of his country; but the mother <hi rend="italic">devotes her time and perils her life</hi> to give the country not only its soldiers but its citizens universally. These are obligations analogous in kind, and if they are not commensurate in value the difference is immeasurably on the side of woman, and the State must remain forever her debtor. But we ask only that it be conceded that men and women may alike render appropriate and adequate services to their common country. The same constitutional facts must regulate woman's relation to all police service generally. A "large half" of the hard work of the world is the legacy which Providence has left to men; but a "large half" of the privation and suffering incident to humanity, the same Providence has impartially  bestowed upon women. We only ask that these fundamentally related facts be recognized; and an equal balance of accounts made between the sexes, both in private and in public life.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, while actual warfare was a normal element in the dynasties of <hi rend="italic">Might;</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> it belongs only to an exceptional state of things, even if ultimately it can find any place there at all. There must be perpetual need for general military and police service, so long as people are still largely selfish and ignorant; but it may well be doubted whether a great National War could ever gain a foothold in any well-grounded and powerful republic. Our civil war, with aggression on one side and resistance and emancipation on the other, arose because all our citizens were not enfranchised. The House was divided against itself--the <hi rend="italic">might dynasty</hi> striving to regain the mastery. Let us enthrone the principle of <hi rend="italic">universal rational suffrage,</hi> and the main
<pb n="164 The Woman's Advocate."/>
element of constitutional injustice will be eliminated, When all classes are adequately represented one would like to be acquainted with a nation that could feel itself strong enough, or enough in the right to enter into a deliberate war against us; and the subjects of a true republic would not enter on an aggressive foreign war on any light pretext. There are better highways for a nation out of national difficulties than the bloody path willingly trodden only by savages.</p>
                        <p>What duelling was to brutal men, that war was to brutal nations; and what duelling is to civilized men that war will be to civilized governments.</p>
                        <p>If it be held that Suffrage is correlated with a Poll-tax or with any other taxes, yet give us the ballot; and with equal wages for equal work, women will willingly pay all equal taxes.</p>
                        <p>Is Suffrage correlated with the Jury-box? Give us the ballot that we may be represented on the jury at least when our own sex are to be tried as criminals, or when women have either political, social, or moneyed interests at stake. Lest crying babes might disturb the grave deliberations of the Court, make the young mothers legally joint possessors with their husbands of all their partnership gains, and then, even though citizens were to be empannelled on all juries <hi rend="italic">pro rata,</hi> the mothers would be able to pay for substitutes.</p>
                        <p>In the same spirit we concede the general fact that while most women could find time to vote, to read, think, and help manufacture political opinions, yet that the practical duties of legislation, generally belong more appropriately to the grandmothers than to the mothers of the yet rising generation.</p>
                        <p>It has never been claimed that the political relations of men and women are, or can be in the nature of things <hi rend="italic">identical;</hi> but we do claim that in the nature of things they are <hi rend="italic">equal.</hi> It is precisely because our interests are not wholly identical, because many of the relations of the sexes are and forever must be special and peculiar to each, that justice imperatively demands that each be represented in every department of State and National Government, by those of its own class. Because our intuitions into the nature and relations of all public and private interests and needs, if no clearer and no broader than man's, are yet taken from another and generically unlike stand-point; therefore,
<pb n="165 Political Correlations."/>
neither we, nor the nation, can afford to dispense with the consentt of the womanly mind to any of its legislation.</p>
                        <p>We grant that universal suffrage and eligibility to office will necessitate more or less political and legislative reconstruction but we respectfully submit that such reconstruction is pretty obviously needed. Constitutional Amendments may begin;, but they can never be completed till man accepts the only help meet for him in the framing organic law for the whole people. There is need of mutual counsel. Whatever may be said of woman's strength, compared with man's, in the Sixteenth Century; in the Nineteenth Century, women have brains which the wisest men may do well not to despise. When they become joint Legislators, doubtless they may come to some mutual agreement as to the fair share of aid which each class is bound to render to the common country.</p>
                        <p>We admit that political rights are everywhere correlated with equal duties; and we freely pledge ourselves, in advance, that when we are allowed to exercise the former, we will also take up all the duties legally assigned us by any Legislative Body, representative of the people, and composed fairly both of men and women.</p>

                           <p>IT is with profound regret that we see a few of the real friends of Woman Suffrage laboring unintentionally to postpone the consideration of their own question, by urging that Manhood Suffrage be postponed until Woman also can be made a Voter.</p>
                           <p>It is said "Let no more men vote until Women are admitted." The sentiment is natural, almost excusable; but the principle is wrong. We have no right to refuse justice to a part of our citizens, because we cannot at the same moment, render justice to all.</p>
                           <p>The policy is short-sighted. For, to combine the two questions in one and the same Amendment would be to defeat both.</p>
                           <p>The principle which underlies all forms of political exclusiveness is indeed one and the same. Every argument in favor of Suffrage for the negro, based upon principle, is an argument in favor of Suffrage for Woman.</p>
                           <p>But from a practical stand-point, the two questions are not identical. Moreover, Manhood Suffrage is demanded by an overwhelming National exigency. It is an issue between the two great political parties. It has to be fought out. Its defeat will annihilate the Republicans. Its success will annihilate the Democracy. It is a struggle for life or death. Neutrality is impossible. Compromise is impossible. It is North or South, Grant or Lee, Washington or Richmond, the Union or the Confederacy!</p>
                           <p>It would be unjust to the question of Manhood Suffrage to combine it with that of suffrage for Woman. For, thousands of Republicans, we are sorry to say, would vote to give the ballot to a black man who would vote against him if they were required to extend Suffrage at the same time to their own wives and daughters.</p>
                           <p>It would be equally unjust to the question of Woman to combine it with that of the Negro. Hundreds of Democrats are sincerely in favor
<pb n="167 Editorial Department."/>
of Suffrage for Women, but if it be combined with Suffrage for Negroes, their prejudices of Race will compel them to Vote against both.</p>
                           <p>As advocates of Universal Suffrage upon Principle, we protest against combining the two questions in one and the same Amendment.</p>
                           <p>Let Congress submit each question separately to the State Legislatures, as parallel, but independent propositions. Let each be advocated or opposed by its respective friends and enemies, and stand, or fall, upon its own merits.</p>

                           <head>AXES OR BALLOTS?</head>
                           <p>THE <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune,</hi> speaking of the recent woman Suffrage Convention at Washington, says:
<q direct="unspecified">"The National Women, in Convention assembled, give notice to the Country that in claiming the ballot they do not overlook 'the logical fact of its being accompanied by the right to be voted for.' There is another logical fact which we fear they do overlook. It is that Suffrage has duties as well as privileges. We should like to hear of their accepting the logical fact that they ought not demand the one and shirk the other."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>The very next day, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> published the following communication without comment:
<q direct="unspecified">"SIR: The war of women against whiskey has commenced in Perrysville, Ashland County, Ohio. A man opened a rum-shop in that place recently, and the women did not like it. They proposed to buy him out, but, as he intended to build up a large trade, he refused to sell. The women, however, were determined that he should not remain; and so, since he refused the very liberal terms they offered, they formed in line, and, with axes on their shoulders, marched to his place and deliberately broke in the heads of all his barrels. Of course the man was angry, and brought a suit in the County Court but was beaten after incurring heavy expense. The people of this part of Ohio honestly think that the next war in this country will be between the women and whiskey; and though there may not be much blood shed, you may rest assured rum will flow freely in the gutters. As the women of Ashland County have taken the matter in hand once before, we claim to have fought the Bunker Hill of the new Revolution."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>So it appears after all that the Women of Ohio do "accept the logical
<pb n="168 The Woman's Advocate."/>
fact that Suffrage has duties as well as privileges, and that they ought not to demand the one and shirk the other." We hope that <hi rend="italic">The Tribune</hi> will now recall its hasty censure, and at the same time inform its readers what sort of weapons it would prefer to see Women use in executing their political duties--axes, or ballots? In Kansas, where women already vote on all questions concerning schools, or licenses, they use the ballot; in Ohio, where they have no vote, they resort to the axe! Tastes differ, but we think a ballot decidedly the more womanly weapon--certainly the more effective one. What says <hi rend="italic">The Tribune,</hi> Axe, or Ballot?</p>

                           <p>THE new Wisconsin Senator, M. H. Carpenter, declares emphatically for Woman Suffrage in a letter published in the Western journals.</p>
                           <p>The <hi rend="italic">Liberal Christian</hi> of this city, a journal truly <hi rend="italic">liberal,</hi> has just finished the publication of a very comprehensive discourse by the Rev. J.
<pb n="169 Notes."/>
W. Chadwick on "Woman's Right to vote," delivered a few Sabbaths since, at his Church in Brooklyn.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Ella Davis Rockwood, favorably known as a speaker and writer, is doing efficient service in the lecturing field this Winter.</p>
                           <p>The <hi rend="italic">Portland Press</hi> says that several, prominent members of the Maine Legislature are eager to do all that is possible to bring about Woman Suffrage in that State.</p>
                           <p>Hon. Mr. Nelson of Tennessee has introduced a bill in the Legislature of that State for Woman Suffrage. It was supported in a able manner by the Hon. Guy Wines.</p>
                           <p>Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford, late Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Repository</hi> (Boston), and a welcome contributor to THE ADVOCATE has received a call to a Universalist Church in Portland, Maine.</p>
                           <p>Several German ladies of this city, sympathizing with the movement for woman suffrage, contemplate founding a German organ to advocate the question. We trust that the movement may succeed.</p>
                           <p>Hon. Wm. Henry Scott of Hamilton County, Ohio, is entitled to great credit for his earnest advocacy of Woman Suffrage in the Ohio House of Representatives during the discussion of his bill to strike the word "male" from the Constitution of that State.</p>
                           <p>We are indebted to the Boston <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth,</hi> one of the most valued of our exchanges, for several kind notices of THE ADVOCATE. The <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi> itself, we are pleased to learn, is rapidly achieving all the success so liberal a journal richly merits.</p>
                           <p>By invitation of the Executive Committee of the Woman Suffrage Association of Rhode Island, Lucy Stone will repeat her address on Woman Suffrage, recently delivered before the Judiciary Committee of the Legislature of that State.</p>
                           <p>The women of Boston pay taxes on forty millions of property; the women of Philadelphia on sixty-eight millions;. in St. Louis on upwards of fifteen millions. The most ignorant and worthless man can vote, irrespective of qualification, but intelligent women of property are denied the ballot.</p>
                           <p>A free school for teaching women the art of telegraphy opened last month at the Cooper Institute in this city. This school is established by
<pb n="170 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the Cooper Union in connection with the Western Union Telegraph Company, and is the first attempt in this country to give Women a regular training as telegraph operators. Applications are to be made to Mr. Vincent Colyer at the Institute.</p>
                           <p>Sallie Holley, widely known as an effective lecturer, whose life bas been devoted to the freeing of the slave, is now traveling and lecturing in Virginia.  While in that State, we understand, Miss Holly intends visiting Miss Caroline F. Putnam who has left the comforts of a New England home to assume charge of a Freedman's School at Lottsburg which has been in very successful operation for several months.</p>
                           <p>The new law of Kansas by which a wife may prosecute a publican who sells spirits to her husband promises not to be a dead letter. The <hi rend="italic">Lawrence Tribune</hi> contains the following:</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>"To whom it may concern. I hereby give notice that the sale of spiritous liquors to my husband is contrary to my wishes, and that I shall prosecute, according to law, any person who disregards this notice."</p>

                           </q>
                           <p>Elsewhere will be found a paper by Mr. W. J. Linton, the well-known English artist, now a resident of this country. Scarcely less distinguished as a writer and as a bold, and vigorous thinker, than in his art, Mr. Linton's communication will be perused with interest, although not in agreement with THE ADVOCATE, or with the views it was established to promote. In no narrow spirit of intolerance, however, we welcome it to our pages, confident his truly liberal mind will yet realize that "political equality" is no chimera to be spurned by American women. Will not some one of the sex take up the gauntlet thus thrown down?</p>
                           <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> says:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"We advocate Impartial Suffrage as we do Universal Amnesty--not because it will favor this or that party, but it will tranquilize and strengthen the Republic, and because we shall never have true, enduring peace without both. So long as there is a disfranchised class among us, whether of Blacks or ex-Rebels, agitation in its behalf is certain to be kept up. All intelligent persons must realize that the Brabminical system of caste is unsuited to the genius of our people--that political equality is in the long run, inevitable. Then why not establish it at once, and save years of fruitless, mischievous heart-burning and strife? We appeal from prejudice and hate to reason and good sense."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>The above states a universal truth. Why should it not be applied to women? For their sake we "appeal from prejudice to reason and good sense."</p>
                           <p>The <hi rend="italic">Radical</hi> (Boston), one of the most valuable, as well as liberal of
<pb n="171 Notes."/>
our monthlies, acknowledging the receipt of the <hi rend="italic">Revolution,</hi> THE ADVOCATE and other journals especially devoted to woman, says:</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>'Mr. Alcott in the course of his late conversation on Woman, said, 'This is Woman's Evening.' One would think that we might also say, 'This is woman's day, her year.' We are in receipt of so many new publications, of late, advocating the claims of woman, that we begin to feel that the work of her emancipation is to be Speedily accomplished, and without a war. Many <hi rend="italic">weeklies,</hi> religious and secular, and many <hi rend="italic">dailies,</hi> have wheeled into rank; and we even find some of these canvassing their own claims to having been 'pioneers' of the movement.</p>
                              <p>"Altogether the Woman Question is well launched. The political aspect of it, we doubt not, will speedily pass by in this country. It will be wise, to save time and bustle, to concede the inevitable without delay.".</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>Last year the Rhode Island Legislature referred the Woman Suffrage petitions to the Committee on Burial Grounds. This year they were referred to the Judiciary Committee, and a hearing granted the petitioners. The Representatives' Hall was crowded to positive discomfort, while tiers of heads peered in from side doors, and many went away unable to find a place even to see, much less to stand. Elizabeth B. Chace read an admirable essay, which we present elsewhere, showing the justice and the need of Woman Suffrage.</p>
                           <p>Miss Fairbank read for Paulina W. Davis a very forcible and earnest plea for human rights, irrespective of sex. This was followed by an address from Lucy Stone, which was listened to with profound interest. Had Judge Green, the chairman of the committee, then put the vote, it would surely have been carried for the ladies. If one might judge from his fine, pleasant face, he is himself ready to rescue the women of his State, from their present political status, with idiots, and Narragansett Indians; the last not taxed.</p>
                           <p>Among the many earnest, effective workers in the lecture field, perhaps no one is more thoroughly grounded in the love and respect of the people than Lucy Stone. Wherever she goes--and her labors in the cause the past Winter have been continuous and arduous--she is greeted with the same manifestations of kindness, and the tributes paid her, not only as a speaker, but as a woman, have been uniform in expression. From many lying before us, we select a notice of her recent address before the Ohio House of Representatives, taken from the <hi rend="italic">Ohio State Journal:</hi>
                           </p>

                                    <p>"The Ohio House of Representatives did a very graceful thing yesterday to invite the distinguished lady who is known to fame as Lucy Stone, to address them upon the merits of the Woman's Suffrage resolution pending before them.</p>
                                    <p>"It was not only generous, but it was just to give this gifted woman an

opportunity to plead in behalf of her sex, and to present the arguments in favor of an extension of the franchise to women from a woman's point of view. Mrs. Blackwell, on being introduced by Speaker Thornhill, in graceful and feeling terms thanked the House for the privilege they had accorded her, and then delivered an address distinguished for candor, fairness and force.</p>
                                    <p>"This lady has a voice, melodious and musical as a chime of bells, her manner is refined, easy and lady-like, and her way of presenting her opinions winning and persuasive. The entire address was characterized by good judgment, good taste, and simplicity, beauty, power and pathos of language."</p>

                                    <p>THE National Woman's Suffrage Convention adjourned on Wednesday night. The city reporters it seems to me, could not have done their work more poorly, and you can get no correct idea of the proceedings as a whole, till the secretaries make their report. But I send you the resolutions on which there was a division, and give the names of those who sustained and opposed them:</p>
                                    <q direct="unspecified">
                                       <p>
                                          <hi rend="italic">Resolved,</hi> That as the partisan cry of a White Man's Government created the antagonism between the Irishman and the Negro, culminating in those fearful riots in 1863, so the Republican cry of manhood suffrage creates the same antagonism between the Negro and the woman, and must result, especially in the Southern States, where violence is the law of life, in greater injustice and oppression toward woman.</p>
                                       <p>
                                          <hi rend="italic">Resolved,</hi> That a <hi rend="italic">man's</hi> government is worse than a <hi rend="italic">white</hi> man's government, because, in proportion as you increase the tyrants, you make the condition of the disfranchised class more hopeless and degraded.</p>
                                    </q>
                                    <p>Mrs. Stanton supported the idea of the first resolution on the first evening, in as able a speech as any one could make, on such erroneous ground, of course meantime giving expression to noble sentiments and making appeals that reached the judgment of all hearers. But she expressed the hope that if one class was to be enfranchised before another, women should be that class, and that not another negro man should be admitted to suffrage, before American women. She would stand aside and wait for the colored <hi rend="italic">women</hi> of the South, but was opposed to Germans, Irish, Chinese, Negroes and those of other nationalities coming into possession of their legal rights before American women.</p>
                                    <p>I never heard her speak when she had so little of what we have always deemed the true philosophy of Reforms, and when she gave less expression to the genuine democratic idea. On that evening Clara Barton and Col. Hinton, and the next morning, Edward M. Davis, Geo. T. Downing, Giles B. Stebbins, Dr. Purvis and others, opposed the resolution, contending that there should be no antagonism between, them: Mr. Davis saying that if public sentiment and Congress were ripe for Negro Suffrage, women should not throw the slightest obstacle in the way: Mr. Stebbins and Mr. Downing denying that representative colored men had opposed in convention or committee (as had been asserted) suffrage for women: Mr. S---- taking the ground that one advance step hastens another
<pb n="173 Notes."/>
that one reform accomplished, paves the way for the next. Mr. Downing moved to substitute the following two, for the second one I have given you:</p>
                                    <q direct="unspecified">
                                       <p>
                                          <hi rend="italic">Resolved,</hi> That the privilege to cast a ballot, saying who shall govern us, is in individual right, not restricted by the color or sex of  the individual--is one which cannot justly be withheld on the plea that another individual is unjustly denied the same, and that it is the duty of every honest, consistent lover of justice, to urge the securing of that right, ignoring sex and color, even though they be disfranchised themselves.</p>
                                       <p>Resolved, That no one should assume, that a person would, if given their right, abuse it, and withhold the same on the assumption, but that they should be secured in the same, and be held responsible for the abuse thereof.</p>
                                    </q>
                                    <p>The substitute was opposed by Mrs. Stanton, and supported by George T. Downing and others, and carried.</p>
                                    <p>There was also one voted down, requiring an educational test or qualification for franchise; but I observed in the evening, one was offered by Miss Anthony demanding "that in the Reconstruction of Government, suffrage should be based on loyalty and <hi rend="italic">intelligence,</hi>" and nowhere limited by distinctions of color, sex or race, and a vote taken; but of course it was a crowded house, and it could not be known whether only enrolled members voted.</p>
                                    <p>I confess that some years ago educated suffrage seemed plausible to me, and as if it might be a cure for some of the ills under which the nation labored, but I have been for a long time convinced that in a Democratic government <hi rend="italic">humanity</hi> should vote.</p>
                                    <p>Because I yield genius and talent more influence than education, in formation of character; because I trust the heart sooner than the head; because I place moral consciousness higher than intellectual attainments, am I in favor of Manhood Suffrage (in its universal sense). I cannot guess how many centuries it would need of the oppression of Woman, or the negro, to obliterate the divine sense, to bury the germ of Life so deep that we could not find the line of distinction between man and the inferior animals, but this I have witnessed with the enslaved race; a wonderful patience and faith which had something of the Godlike--and since the war, a perseverance and readiness in letters, of which any race might be proud. We need not fear when they are once allowed, that they will not soon learn to read the constitution and their ballots.</p>
                                    <p>Some of us felt earnestly on this matter of making Negro Suffrage and Woman Suffrage antagonistic, and deprecated the introduction of the Resolution, but as it was voted down, and we came to stand on common ground on the last afternoon and evening, particularly evening, when Mrs. Stanton spoke grandly in her old-fashioned way, holding up the true Republican idea, making appeals <hi rend="italic">for</hi> toiling women, and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> mothers for the sake of the virtue of their sons--showing the necessity of the influence of mothers in affairs of Government, in such a manner that every ear listened, and every heart must have responded in <hi rend="italic">feeling,</hi> to the beautiful utterances, whether they adopted her conclusions or not; as we came to stand on this ground, we were baptized into a spirit of unity which embraced all; and we felt not only that evening, but every time we saw the large audience, that the people were awakened, and the discussions had done good.</p>

                           <docDate>NO. III. MARCH, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>
                           <p>EVEN in books comes up the "Woman Question." Looking over our already filled table, we are freshly reminded of the preponderance of the works of woman. In light literature especially, perhaps it would be safe to assume that three-fourths of the popular books before the public are the productions of women. To those who have not considered the question this may seem an unwarranted statement, but we believe it to be literally correct. Glancing at our own accumulation, we have first</p>
                           <p>"A ROMANCE OF THE REPUBLIC,"</p>
                           <p>by L. Maria Child, a 12mo. volume of 442 pp., from the great publishing house of Fields, Osgood &#x0026; Co. of Boston, a book whether considered as the finished literary creation of a gifted woman, or judged by the extent of sales, is entitled to a front rank in American fiction. It is a story of the South, before and during the Rebellion. Turning on the question of caste of color, it possesses all the intensity of interest accompanying the most exciting romance, while abounding in passages of rare beauty, such as have endeared Mrs. Child's pen to so many readers. Chaste in diction, elevating in tone, inculcating a moral, the wisdom of which must yet sink deep in the heart of the Republic, wreathed round with the fall blossoming of Mrs. Child's genius, it is no wonder that the "Romance of the Republic" has attained such success. We trust that all who have not yet enjoyed the treat of perusal will hasten to procure the volume. Next, from a pen scarcely less known, and fresh from a heart no weakness of flesh can cause to throb less warmly for humanity, we have</p>
                           <p>"POEMS"</p>
                           <p>by Frances Dana Gage, a 12mo. volume of 252 pp., issued in an elegant manner by the well-known house of T. B. Lippincott &#x0026; Co., Philadelphia. Scattering poems in this collection, drifting the rounds of the newspaper press, now with and now without credit, have long been familiar to the genuine lovers of verse,
and we need only mention, "My Fiftieth Birthday," "A Mother's Thought," "Coming Home," Rain on the Roof"--all gems--to awaken in many a breast pleasant, memories of one who, to many better known as "Aunt Fanny," has lived in her life of unwearying labor for humanity a grander poem even than any of the touching verses embodied in her collection. Great, judged by the more artificial standard of poetry, they may not be, but they have the rarer merit, so strikingly illustrated by the muse of Whittier, of being adapted to the wants of life, and there are sober-minded matrons, or girls in country homes, who hold as dear, utterances so appealing to the unexpressed desires of the heart. The edition before us--a third--is embellished with a steel engraving of the author, which lends an additional value to the volume. The same house has also issued--</p>
                           <pb n="175 Chit-Chat on Books."/>
                           <p>"ELSIE MAGOON, A TALE,"</p>
                           <p>by the same author, a story of Western life in "pioneer time," turning upon the evils of intemperance, and presenting many interesting pictures of society and social customs in the course of the simple narrative. The volume contains 324 pp., is issued in a very attractive manner, and, we are glad to know, is commanding a very extensive sale. Next the eye lights upon</p>
                           <p>"WHAT ANSWER?"</p>
                           <p>Miss Anna E. Dickinson's new story, a handsome 12mo. of 301 pp., issued by the house of Fields, Osgood &#x0026; Co., Of Boston. Like Mrs. Child's more tropically scented romance, Miss Dickinson's book strikes as its key note the question of caste of color, and the great woman heart of the lecturer glows in every page as she holds up the mirror to the American public, showing the enormity of the sin it has for centuries hugged to its breast. Judged solely by its literary merits, the pretentious, flippant criticisms of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and sundry other journals to the contrary, "What Answer?" is a rich addition to our literature, and we congratulate Miss Dickinson that her first venture in fiction should be crowned with such success. Next--from across the water--we have</p>
                           <p>"THE WOMAN'S KINGDOM."</p>
                           <p>A sweet, simple story of English life, already familiar to many of our readers by its publication in <hi rend="italic">Harper's Magazine,</hi> and by which firm (Harper &#x0026; Brothers) it is in its present book form, presented to the public. Miss Muloch sees--
<q direct="unspecified">"The truth, but not the whole truth," </q>
and while the many who follow her pen, always admire the chasteness of her style, the purity and general correctness of her thought, a feeling of dissatisfaction invariably lurks that she does not realize a woman may be all--and more than she depicts. Next our attention is claimed by a graver, more philosophical student work--a new edition of</p>
                           <p>"THE COLLEGE, THE MARKET, AND THE COURT,"</p>
                           <p>by Mrs. Caroline H. Dall, a beautifully issued volume from the house of Lee &#x0026; Shepard of Boston. To the change which the last decade of year has wrought in public opinion concerning women, Mrs. Dall has been an effective contributor. Less celebrated as a speaker than some of her compeers, she has undoubtedly wielded the most vigorous and efficient pen, and the volume before us is a monument of laborious research of which any one might be proud. Space forbids entering into details, but we advise all who wish to make a careful, conscientious study of the subject to procure the volume. Next, in a lighter vein, wholly disconnected from reform--save, may be, spiritual--we have--and with which we close our present chit-chat</p>
                           <p>PLANCHETTE'S DIARY,</p>
                           <p>Edited by Miss Kate Field, one of the most versatile of our younger writers. The volume is written in a spirit of honest inquiry, neither affirming nor denying a theory on the baffling phenomenon, and possesses all the interest of a personal narrative. It is issued in a neat manner by J. S. Redfield of this city, and has already found its way to many homes where curiosity, by the pranks of the elfin board itself, has been excited.</p>

                        <p>DURING this two years I have seen women yield to so many absurdities in the name of Fashion, that I wonder they venture to criticise any dominion whatsoever. For awhile they wore hoops, so smothered in yards of merchandise, that they might have been "drapery dolls" in a haberdasher's window. Then their scant skirts clung to their limbs as if they had been wet, to produce that effect, as we hear of them in Richardson's day. One day, they swept the pavement as well as the saloon with their ample trains; the next, like the little old woman in the story, their "petticoats were up to their knees," and it ought to have been quite certain, that the little "dog Tray" would bark when they got home! I have seen <hi rend="italic">Grecian bends, Pacific slopes,</hi> high pegs under the instep, and "crutches" under the shoulders. What should women resent, one would say, if they will not resent the tyranny of Fashion? Yet women dressed in all these absurd ways, and in other ways also, have something to say about the "Woman's Cause." It is generally the expression of their discontent--always the expression of a strong interest--and to the discomfiture of the <hi rend="italic">New Englander</hi> and
<pb n="180 The Woman's Advocate."/>
similar prophets, I can truly say, that whatever distrust or disappointment women have expressed to me in regard to the present manifestations of our reform, I have never yet talked with one who showed or felt it on her own account. I have always considered organization an evil in connection with this reform. I suppose it to be a necessary evil, but it brings a large number of women into public observation who have neither the time nor the strength to meet its demands. For one, I shall be very grateful when its uses are passed, for pass they must. But so long as it exists, working in manifold ways in all the great cities of the country, it is well to consider whether in conventions, clubs, associations or leagues, there should not be some restrictions imposed upon what is attempted, so that what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> done, may be <hi rend="italic">well</hi> done. It is really alarming to see how many things women are attempting all at once, in all our large cities. It is the same group of women, for the most part, who are active in some half a dozen movements which would absorb, each one, the entire energies of a male Board of Direction. I have no desire to dictate in this matter. I wait for the revelations which are to come, feeling quite sure that women are to make laws and customs of a new kind. But I can hardly feel happy, knowing how frail in body and how unprepared in mind many of them are, to see a dozen enterprises undertaken in one headlong moment each one of which demands generous purses as well as faithful and serious thinking. But I may speak out of my own defect. I have always found one new enterprise as much as I could safely hold in hand. In one Western city, I found three papers devoted to this cause, no one of which was competent to its work--no one of which could show a <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre.</hi> Yet the women who undertook this work were sweet and capable in a way, and two at least had been moved to it, by a misapprehension of my own books. Why could I not encourage them to persist? Because, we need, above all, one first class magazine, sustained by the best talent of our country; and because, until we have it, all these small undertakings drain the purses which should sustain that.</p>
                        <p>We have too many kinds of work in hand; we have too many pieces of work of one -kind, and we have too many meetings, and too many speeches at each meeting. The whole question lies in a nutshell. Let it be presented by a few able speakers, or by a few earnest ones, and all
<pb n="181 Breakers!"/>
is done that can be done for that time; what is over this, injures the cause with sensible people. Whatever a man, may do, a woman should never speak for effect. I think we all like <hi rend="italic">her</hi> best, who seems to have been compelled to speak against her will, and for this reason a few, words, from unaccustomed lips, frequently have a great effect upon the public mind. It used to be said of Theodore Parker, that when his great audience was at last secured, he was at first disappointed to miss from it a certain class of cultured persons who were dear to him. He felt that he bore a message to the scholars, but they were not there to hear. When I listen to some of the ambitious addresses of our Roman matrons, I feel as if they were exposed to a similar mistake. It is the human race that we speak for, after all, and our words should court the hospitable welcome of the humblest of God's people. It is because the highest culture is the only thing which will guarantee that, as a possibility, that culture is needed on our platforms--pedantry never can be needed there.</p>
                        <p>I know how difficult it is to limit the undisciplined impulses of a new movement, but it seems imperative to me that our platforms should be kept pure and our hands clean. Great prudence is needed to save the mass of men from the fear that license will be quick to follow liberty. The late Convention at Washington seems to have been one of those we could have spared. The base truckling to dishonorable politicians, of which I have more than once spoken, was so apparent on the part of two or three, as to elicit the rebuke of the press. One limitation ought always to be insisted on: No woman ought ever to be allowed to speak in regard to a grievance from which she has personally suffered. That very fact should seal her lips. Let her tell her sister's story instead of her own. If she cannot feel for "those in bonds as bound with them," she has not yet the temper needed by a Reformer. It makes one's heart ache to think of the noble Lucretia Mott sitting through certain scenes which she might well have been spared. I know how difficult it is to be steady under the inevitable pressure, but the difficulty must be braved. I have not yet forgotten how difficulties thickened when I resisted the introduction of the dress reform, upon the platform of the early conventions which I assisted to call in Boston, nor how the breaking up of one of them was followed by the reception
<pb n="182 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of a letter addressed to me in a newspaper, beginning: "Sister Dall, the worm upon which you have trodden may yet turn and sting you!"</p>
                        <p>I do not feel afraid--nor should others--in the inevitable "Good Morrow" of some brighter land, my sister will come to know, that I never meant to hurt <hi rend="italic">her</hi> any more than that <hi rend="italic">invisible worm!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Constitution of all State Associations should be thoroughly democratic. At first, in all such movements, committees must appoint themselves, but it is a practice which should not be allowed to continue. There ought to be preparatory meetings corresponding to the ward meetings of towns to elect the officers. One or two mistakes might occur, but they would be more useful than the work of a factitious committee to whose nomination few women dare to object. I hope no woman will ever again complain of a nomination which she has not openly opposed. The only proper time and place to object to an officer is in the convention, at the moment she is nominated. But leaders must change, as the work opens, and it will inevitably fall from inefficient, dishonest or uninterested hands--for it is impossible for this Movement to grow healthfully, except it grow out of sincerity and purity. Parasitic growth, will never be luxuriant in our Northern air. Where the thought and purpose is, the real ruling will be, and like Banquo's ghost, it will haunt every council. "Where Macdonald sits is the head of the table," and for the discontented, there is no better counsel than that contained in the two words, "Truth and Patience." If I knew an ambitious woman, who wanted to become popular, I think I would give her a little satirical counsel which is the fruit of experience in manifold Committee Rooms.</p>
                        <p>1st. I should say, Don't be punctual.</p>
                        <p>2nd. Don't be persistent.</p>
                        <p>3d. Don't be sincere, especially on Nominating Committees.</p>
                        <p>4th. Don't accept any nominations, or if you do, not till your supporters have tired themselves out with solicitations.</p>
                        <p>5th. Do your work a little <hi rend="italic">less well</hi> than you could--at all events less thoroughly than the men associated with you.</p>
                        <p>These five points, ludicrous as they seem, suggest the actual points of danger. For any purpose of personal promotion, you had better keep a
<pb n="183 Breakers!"/>
whole Committee waiting than rebuke every member of it by being at your post one minute before the earliest.</p>
                        <p>I look for the highest moral results to follow the persistency of women; but at present, moral persistency is not popular, and if <hi rend="italic">approbation</hi> is your object, yield to the first objection. I have been a member of a great many nominating committees, religious and secular, upon which women were appointed upon principle. In such cases, I have always observed that if the women attempted to do any work--to object on moral grounds to the nomination of any person, that it was an entirely unexpected event. It is quite evident that committees are not yet prepared to accept the only work it is worth while for women to do. If you are nominated to an office, it must always <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> a surprise, no matter how many months you may have known it, awaited you. If you accept it quietly, just as you would an order to march if you were in the field, you will be thought to be ambitious. The idea that you may consider it a duty, will never enter anybody's head. It is my opinion that those officers are best appreciated who require the most teasing, just as it is with the young lady who "has a cold," who is always urged to sing to the exclusion of the purest contralto present.</p>
                        <p>As to the quality of work, one would think committees and associations would be glad to be spared trouble, and to move direct to their ends. One would think that everywhere a clear brain and firm hand would be in request. But it does not appear to be so, and the reason is clear. The rapid action of a certain class of minds, is a sort of rebuke to the indirection of the majority; and then there is a valid, practical objection--the slower brains are not able to understand and follow this. rapid action. The "slowness" of Abraham Lincoln, greatly as we resented it, was for that reason the special Providence of the War. It compelled us to hold back until we could build the roads upon which we were to travel.</p>
                        <p>But to leave this jesting tone and speak soberly, men and women need to be educated to magnanimity, but let women lead the way. It is essential in public life, still more than in private, to make allowance for a <hi rend="italic">defective memory</hi> in those with whom you have to deal. In regard to this, I can speak from a bitter experience. I entered public life without understanding that an intelligent person could misunderstand what
<pb n="184 The Woman's Advocate."/>
occurred before his eyes, or that he could forget his own words. I am ashamed to say, that it was years before I could understand it. At first, I acted promptly for those who brought their grievances to me, and, found to my sorrow that those upon whose support I depended, had "forgotten what they said," as soon as its accuracy was questioned, and I had to bear the whole undeserved onus of misrepresentation. At first, I honestly thought this was pure mendacity, but now I know that most minds have a loose, careless way of acting, even when they seem under moral conviction. Leave a large margin for this action always, and when it seems a duty to act on private representations, demand written statements, <hi rend="italic">and refuse to act until you receive them.</hi> All that I regret, in my own career, would have been avoided had any one given me this advice at the outset.</p>
                        <p>"About a hundred years ago," as Miss Woolsey says, with happy exaggeration, in her "Hospital Days," a few of us took up this work in behalf of women, following out the thought of Mary Astell In 1731; Mary Wollstonecraft in 1797, and Margaret Fuller in 1844. Graceful and scholarly as Margaret's work was, it is quite evident that it had little popular effect, nor can one of us boast that we have spoken better sense than Mary Wollstonecraft. It is just possible some of us know how to make our thought more attractive.</p>
                        <p>After our years of labor, we ought to be thankful to see younger and abler hands ready to catch the ball that we have kept in the air so long. Only let the players look out that they do not try ten balls, and go turn the whole thing into a juggler's trick! I, at least, am thankful to relax my ceaseless watch of facts and figures and turn my thoughts to the literary labor that I love.</p>
                        <p>The contemptible drivel of the recent pamphlet issued by A. D. Fulton, is incapable of influencing one living soul. He does not confine himself to opposing woman suffrage, but he opposes woman's right to labor, and undertakes to prove that this right, when enjoyed, has always degraded her. In support of his assertion he quotes two or three pages from "The College, the Market, and the Court."  Why did he not tell his audience that he owed his information to a woman's work? And still more, why did he not repeat the argument of those same pages, which was simply that in the countries where woman had been forced to
<pb n="185 Breakers!"/>
                           <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> labor, which she had not sought, there was no rational excuse for refusing the profitable labor which she does seek? Only let women prepare themselves for the work they would do. I pointed out this omission to one of Mr. Fulton's admirers, who happened to be a Spiritualist. "Yes," he retorted, "but when do you women ever give credit to one another? Did not half a dozen of you apply for a Horticultural College the other day, and never say one Word about Emma Hardinge, who would have built one, before now, if it had not been for the war?"</p>
                        <p>Let women set men an example in such respects, and when they advocate an idea, investigate and report its history. God is the only Creator of Thought.</p>
                        <p>What I say of Mr. Fulton's neglect of our <hi rend="italic">argument,</hi> will apply as well to the <hi rend="italic">New Englander,</hi> which has lately thought it worth while to take up our subject. If society has already made us "valuable animals," we demand the pay of such animals. We prefer lighter work, but not on the ground that <hi rend="italic">even that</hi> is too heavy.</p>
                        <p>I believe, with the <hi rend="italic">New Englander,</hi> that if women were to enter public life at once, there would be a great increase of partisan acrimony. Women cannot be wheedled, if men, can. This acrimony would be founded on <hi rend="italic">principle,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">persons;</hi> but in the providence of God, women are not going to vote next November. I believe they have got to earn their right to it, and when I consider the morals of cities like San Francisco, New Orleans, Chicago and New York, I pray on my knees that God may grant us first, by some miracle, an educational qualification for suffrage. I do not see how it ever can come in this country, but I know we need it, and education touches morals--I do not mean the mere learning of the Alphabet.</p>
                        <p>But whatever the qualification demanded, men and women must come under it alike. If universal suffrage is to be, then the "increased acrimony" falls under God's general laws, and will soon defeat itself. All that we need pray is, "The will of God be done."</p>
                        <p>What relation then does my "parable" bear to my argument ?</p>
                        <p>In the first place, pilots and captains can never change work, each needs the other, and the man to whom no one takes off his hat is the sole reliance of us all when the storm's come. It is the obscure worker
<pb n="186 The Woman s Advocate."/>
that saves society oftentimes. But why should women lament that? Public life is not the highest life for man or woman, only a necessary self-sacrifice for the few.</p>
                        <p>And just as my father prophesied that when I came to my fortune I should find my hands tied by duty in a way that I did not look for, just so when we come into the suffrage will women find the Divine Paths open before them in a wholly unexpected direction. Many will be the crosses and misapprehensions to be borne from those we best love.</p>

                        <p>FROM whence do <hi rend="italic">men</hi> derive the right to vote in this so-called Republic? On what have they, themselves, rested the claim; not as this one or that may have asserted as his caprice or selfishness may have dictated, but as a historical fact. They did not possess the right, as a thing admitted, under the British Government; King George did not give it to them when he acknowledged the independence of the States, and they could not <hi rend="italic">create</hi> the right by fighting and conquering that king; for mere successful fighting creates nothing; it simply conquers, and the conquered party maybe in the right and the conquerors wrong. In fact our fathers had no right, even, to fight unless there had been a <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> right of <hi rend="italic">self-government.</hi> And it was this prior right that they assumed and asserted in justification of the War for Independence. And if a <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> right, it was a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> right, as there was no right prior but <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. The leaders of that Revolution were too wise, if not too good, to think of making the foundation of their struggle anything else. So they declared, "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." They further said: "Gov-
<pb n="187 The Right of Woman to the Ballot."/>
ernments derive their just powers from the <hi rend="italic">consent</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">governed</hi>." This latter proposition was, no doubt, rightly intended, but strictly and philosophically, it is badly put; for, in fact, there can be no other but <hi rend="italic">just</hi> powers in government properly so considered. Usurped and unauthorized governments may and do involve unjust powers. But not a majority, nor, even, a whole people can make an unjust government valid, -nor their disapproval make a <hi rend="italic">just</hi> one invalid. All <hi rend="italic">rightful</hi> government must be essentially just, and the <hi rend="italic">powers</hi> of such government, so far from being derived from the consent of the governed, are derived from God, and exist independently of the people, to which they are bound to conform their civil polity and its administration. But in the sense in which the Fathers intended the statement, that, the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to create the State and administer its powers in conformity with justice belongs to the whole people, is absolutely true.</p>
                        <p>Now if this prior right, of which we have spoken, is a natural right, and we have seen there can be no other, then to be a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> right it must find its seat and source in the <hi rend="italic">human nature.</hi> But if it is a right of the human nature, then <hi rend="italic">all who possess that nature must possess with it the right.</hi> Now, unless it can be shown that woman does not inherit a <hi rend="italic">human nature,</hi> her right to the ballot, the essential instrumentality of self-government, <hi rend="italic">stands on the same foundation as man's and is every way  equal to his.</hi> Therefore, for the masculine and stronger sex to forcibly, as they do, keep woman from the exercise of her right is the same despotism, in its nature, as that in Monarchical countries that not only deprive woman of all participation in government but the most of their masculine subjects as well. For men in this country to talk about whether it is best to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> the right of the ballot to women is sheer impudence. The right is theirs, and they are kept from its exercise by violence no better, though of another kind, than that by which the Southern terrorists keep the blacks there from the polls and deprive them of both their natural and legally declared right of the free exercise of the vote.</p>
                        <p>We do not consent to argue this question with men claiming to be Republicans and to believe in a Republican government, as one of privilege, propriety or decorum, or, even, of utility. A right that is right in itself, in the abstract, cannot be one of privilege, nor other than proper, decorous and useful in its exercise and

application when guided by wisdom, patriotism and justice, which women are as likely to possess as men. Let the government take away its unauthorized bar to the woman's free exercise of her rights. Let it cease the use of force to repel her from the polls, and then she will vote or not as she sees best, as men now do. Let the men of this country, to be consistent, renounce their own right of the ballot or yield it to women and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> who possess our common human nature.</p>
                        <p>The full and complete <hi rend="italic">exercise</hi> of the right of the vote depends upon conditions. Not even every natural right has immunity from conditions which Nature herself ordains and the necessities of government may require. The child and the idiot are barred from the ballot by the condition of <hi rend="italic">inability.</hi> The criminal by that of <hi rend="italic">moral obliquity,</hi> and by the fact that be is an enemy to society and should not be allowed to make laws, since he would make them in the interest of villainy, which the interests of society forbid. This thought has a wider sweep than might be imagined, touching, not merely <hi rend="italic">technical</hi> criminals, but all whose moral obliquity would make it impossible for them to act in the interest of just and beneficent government. But the discussion of it does not come within the scope of the present paper. Beyond these three sources of limitation, the right of the ballot is absolutely the right of <hi rend="italic">all the governed</hi> without respect to sex, or color, or race. And so far as the <hi rend="italic">abstract right</hi> is concerned, even children, idiots and criminals possess it, and they need only escape the <hi rend="italic">conditions</hi> of its restriction and the right springs forth in all its original authority and force as the prisoner, shut out from the light, when his imprisonment ceases, walks forth from his cell to find the sun shining still for him as for all.</p>

                        <p>THE highest culture has been claimed for women: it has been shown that for two centuries,. the ideal of such a culture has existed, but has been depressed by an erroneous public opinion. There has, however, been a steady growth in the right direction, which entitles us to ask for a "revised and corrected" public opinion. The influence of mental culture is a small thing by the side of that insinuating atmospheric power and the customs of society which it controls.

                        <p>"I will tell you," I replied, "I think it is a great pity for the negro, but I think it is far worse for yourselves."</p>
                        <p>That was my honest opinion then, and it has never changed. Just as we pity the one who sins, more than the one sinned against;--just as we pity the murderer more than his victim, so did I pity the willing or unwilling slaveholder.</p>
                        <pb n="191 Our Future."/>
                        <p>Now, looking back through the vista of years, and perceiving how woman has stumbled along over the rough and thorny road with the Dutchman's stone upon her head; how, laden with the double burden of maternal cares and excessive physical toil, she has staggered in the footsteps of her lord and master, afar off; and how, her earthly hopes blighted, she has looked to her Father in Heaven for strength and comfort, and receiving them, has thus become chastened and purified from much of the dross of earth, then do we say: Alas! for man, that he has all this time been trying to walk alone. Alas! for him, that he has overlooked or neglected the immense reserved strength, the latent ability and hidden wealth with which woman would have blessed the world, had she been permitted to walk unfettered by his side.</p>
                        <p>Conforming herself as best she could to his fancies, she, became a dim reflection of his image. Moulded to a certain extent according to his will and pleasure, she is not a woman, but an absurd parody upon man.</p>
                        <p>Those who are so fearful that she will escape from her sphere, should be made to understand that she has never yet had the opportunity to occupy it. They have little idea of the hight to which she will ascend, when free from the cramping, depressing idea of inferiority; when no longer placed in the same legal category with the gibbering idiot and the raving maniac.</p>
                        <p>"Perfect love casteth out fear," are the words of wisdom.</p>
                        <p>When the servile fear that has possessed her soul through all these long ages, shall have been banished therefrom, then will she bless man with a depth and purity and wealth of affection, of which he has as yet had little or no experience; then will the affluence of her free and noble being, stimulate and inspire him to deeds far superior to his present capacity; and then, while he looks back regretfully to see how he has defrauded himself, in thus confining her, they will together advance to the possession of peace, purity, wisdom and happiness ineffable.</p>

                        <head>"POLITICAL EQUALITY."</head>
                        <p>THE question of the position of woman in society is an important one, I suppose as important as that correlative one of the position of man. And though I do not believe that the present generation will witness any satisfactory settlement of it, and though I am sure that under the present political organization of society it cannot be settled, I still think that it is not a day too soon to begin the discussion which should help toward a settlement.</p>
                        <p>But I do not think that vague declamation is discussion; so, even at the risk of wounding some susceptibilities, I would provoke, if possible, the expression of certain clear grounds of thought whereupon the advocates of woman's <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> (content for the moment with so narrow a phrase) may find some opportunity for argument and chance of defining their principles.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason I have asked, not careful to drape my words with any enticing pleasantness--"WHAT DO WOMEN WANT?"</p>
                        <p>"Political equality" is the first answer, implied in the editorial sentence friendily rebuking me for thinking that "a chimera."</p>
                        <p>I do not think political equality a chimera; but I think the idea of obtaining it through the ballot-box to be a chimera.</p>
                        <p>I think also that the term "political equality" may be used vaguely. There was political equality in the South, before the war, for black men and black women. Both being without any political rights whatever, the political equality was perfect.</p>
                        <p>The political rights of men, not theoretically but practically, in the free United States of America (if I may accept Theodore Parker as sufficient authority) consist in merely submitting to the rule of "one-eightieth part" of the male population, who in virtue of their position control the rest. As things stand the political equality of man and woman would be obtained by one-eightieth portion of the female population sharing the usurping privilege of the male eightieth. I think, Mr. Editor, that such a measure of political equality would be a "chimera to be spurned by American women."</p>
                        <pb n="193 Political Equality."/>
                        <p>So I ask again, even at the risk of not being "in agreement with THE ADVOCATE or with the views it was established to promote"--WHAT DO WOMEN WANT?</p>
                        <p>Something more and better, I hope and believe, than is expressed in your "Political Equality," or than can be obtained by any use of the ballot-box or any other of the present political machinery.</p>

                        <docDate>NO. IV. APRIL, 1869 VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>Virginia Penny</docAuthor>
                        <p>THE present condition of thousands of women, in all countries, prompts the wish that organizations such as Sorosis, and other Women's Clubs be deeply in earnest in their efforts for benefiting women. Theory is not wanted so much as practice. There is danger of women's clubs becoming like men's, mutual admiration societies, and outlets for vanity or selfish indulgence. There is not a city, nor a town, nor a village, in this broad land, but what contains one or more sad and breaking hearts that need the solace of consolation, the tenderness of friendship. No time should be lost, no opportunity passed by, in efforts to remove ailments, physical, moral and mental, that afflict womanhood.</p>
                        <p>Members of clubs should stand by each other in sustaining good men and women. Particularly should it be so in business transactions. Would it not be well in the meetings of Sorosis, when other business is discharged, to mention any man or woman whom you have found correct and honorable in your dealings. Perhaps for several years you have patronized certain stores, fancy, dry-goods, shoe, bonnet, book, drug, etc. You have found the owners and sales-people just, honest, prompt and obliging. You feel that it is a pleasure to recommend them. Again you have had dealings with others, and you have found them dishonest or untruthful. To mention your experience may save some friend from the inconvenience or loss you have sustained. This might be done without making the society either a Methodist class-meeting, a gossiping club, or an advertising medium. And by all means patronize
<pb n="194 The Woman's Advocate."/>
stores conducted or attended by women. Let sales-women feel that you are their friends.</p>
                        <p>Open a store for the sale of woman literature, and it would be well if some women would combine and open a publishing house, for the publication of books by women. Commence a library of books written by women in all countries and times. Copies of their books would doubtless be voluntarily contributed by living female authors.</p>
                        <p>But let us return to something more immediately practical. Let rich members pay the initiation fees of those unable to become members from that cause. For instance, let some rich member who has a friend that is educated and refined, learn her views and wishes in regard to the matter, and if she desires membership, propose her, and if she is elected, let the rich proposer pay the initiation fee to the treasurer privately and unknown to others.</p>
                        <p>Make arrangements with the editor of some first class paper to secure his exchanges, which you can probably do for a small sum, and place them on the table of your club room that they may be accessible to all the members.</p>
                        <p>Have at your rooms a list of respectable boarding places, that will accommodate transient members, or the personal friends of members. Let a book be kept, containing the names, locations, and charges of said boarding places.</p>
                        <p>Have a box, just outside of your room for meeting, in which written questions can be dropped asking information, or as subjects for discussion. Let them be read by the corresponding secretary when the regular business transactions of the meeting are over.</p>
                        <p>Have a committee of honorable, high-minded, kind-hearted women to confer with members who have social or business troubles, and who need advice and guidance. The title of women counsellors may be objected to--but what is in a name?</p>
                        <p>Publish a paper containing contributions from the members. Make it a literary paper, but let a portion be devoted to securing employment for educated women--a medium between the employers and employed.</p>
                        <p>You can thus greatly benefit society. Adieu--<hi rend="italic">au revoir.</hi>

                        <p>A FALLACIOUS argument is occasionally brought forward by newspaper writers and others against all participation by women in the affairs of State. It is this: "Women do not and cannot bear arms, therefore they should have no part nor lot in government. As they cannot defend the State, they cannot be the State." Louis XIV. said: <hi rend="italic">"The State! It is myself."</hi> These reasoners say: <hi rend="italic">"The State! it is ourselves: it is the men."</hi> Unfortunately for their argument, which by the by Antoinette Brown Blackwell unanswerably confutes in her admirable article in the March number of, THE ADVOCATE, political power is not confined to arms-bearing men. The feeble and those advanced in years are not disfranchised, and a large number of those who hold civil offices are not subject to military duty.</p>
                        <p>But has not woman something to do for the defence of her country! How was it in our civil war? The Nation received a large portion of its army almost from the arms of mothers--with the patriotism, the <hi rend="italic">morale,</hi> the love of liberty, inherited and taught in happy homes. These sentiments were fed and kept alive by mothers, wives and sisters at home during the conflict and so vital were their sympathies that many soldiers said in their letters, "I believe you suffer more at home than we do." Then in time of war, women have a great increase of duty and labor at home. But let these considerations go for nothing, though they are much, and let us glance briefly at the part women took in our late war. It is safe to say that it was of a character unprecedented in history, showing unmistakeably that women can perform their full part in the duty of defending their country and its institutions. There was probably not a loyal woman at the North, who did not contribute in labor or gifts to the Aid Societies, themselves composed of women. These in turn sustained the great Commissions, Sanitary and Christian, that did so much to help our cause. More than this, there were numbers of women who--unconsciously to themselves--exhibited some of the highest qualities of human nature. They went down to the battle-fields, and amid the most appalling scenes, they succored the wounded

and ministered to the dying. They labored in city hospitals, in field hospitals and in hospital boats. They penetrated rebel prisons and entered the enemy's lines on errands requiring courage, address and romantic daring. They showed patience persistence, and an organizing power not generally supposed to be a quality of the sex, by which a large and often conflicting variety of elements were made to unite in one beneficent result. If another similar occasion called for it--it this country should again have to make deadly struggle for existence, woman's part in it would be immediately recognized, and by sysematic organization vastly increased.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="italic">"You can't fight, therefore you shall not vote!</hi> Let us never hear that from a man who did not fight for his country--from one who did, we shall be little likely to hear it.</p>

                        <p>As my eye rests upon this word, an infant wakens into life. At each throb of my pulse, by day, by night, a being akin to me is born. For what? In the grand and solemn phrase we know so well "to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever"--to share, to increase and to conserve the treasures of mankind.</p>
                        <p>Treasures we have, real, lasting and enlarging. Beneath their fruits which enrich and beautify the world in admirable, useful works multiplying with every generation--the productive farms, factories, workshops, ships, laboratories, convenient and healthful homes, which, despite dreadful blemishes in our industrial and social life, are yet as thousands to one when compared with the acquisitions of the past, and which are diffusing among the forgotten millions, beneficent facilities heretofore unshared and even unknown. Beneath these fruits and feeding them, as the stem the flower, are garnered our treasures--those invaluable truths which God's revealing hand is writing in human life. Gaining clearness age after age, they have become luminous in the experience of men. Though earthquake and flood should wreck and obliterate our industries, homesteads and monuments of art, such outward destruction would be but as the withering blast of winter if those treasures were conserved. Like the living root which, after the frost, shoots forth anew, those vital facts would again unfold their power in a world as fertile and in a human life as rich as ours.</p>
                        <pb n="198 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Primal among truths, as the granite among rocks, is Providence. Intangible, perceived by no being lower than man, it underlies all his landscape, encircling his whole horizon. We have not a trust apart from existing order--Order is Providence. We have not an interest outside of existing relations--Relation is Providence. We have not a hope underived from existing aspirations--Aspiration is Providence.</p>
                        <p>If the fact of Providence, though unrecognized, upholds and inspires us, as for ages Men stood upright by virtue of the unsuspected force of gravitation; no less does the knowledge of that mighty fact illumine, quicken And utilize our mental life. Withhold the knowledge of Providence from childhood. Perhaps no man ever tried to do it. But destitution, ignorance, vice have done it for the wretched. Hiding Providence they have intercepted the air and excluded the sun. Then normal growth falls. Affection, hope, purpose should be there, but are not, save as instinctive needs grope prophetically, seeking involuntarily the light there ought to be. Take from man or woman this eminent human treasure. What has shrunk the muscle of his being and dimmed the fire of his vision, anticipating age? What has paralyzed his convictions and withered his heart? What has undermined his path, driven the angel from his perspective and couched the lion of annihilation there? To a man, Providence, though unknown is vital breath; Providence known is ship, wind and polar star.</p>
                        <p>True democracy, which is political unselfishness, builds the structure of a real hierarchy, where men, diverse but akin, stand under the administration of God.</p>
                        <p>But mankind is given to idolatry. No sooner do we enshrine our treasure, than we begin to attach to the altar the reverence due to Him whom presently we ignorantly worship. Then follow, surely, enquiry and protest, indicating a revival of the first love. A strange spectacle is seen--in the guise of the iconoclast, the conservative. Arrayed against the altar stand new martyrs who suffer, and modern champions who contend for the old, great truth. Amid sanctuaries hallowed by our fathers, and ecclesiastics honored for their office sake; amid devout though ignorant millions who gaze aghast at the supposed sacrilege, the theses of reformation burst from the minds of men, while some Luther with heart half-broken, half-inspired, cries, "Here stand I: I cannot

otherwise!" There are the institutions, the recognized exponents, all that exists of the <hi rend="italic">organization</hi> of Christendom. Here are the weak and isolated souls forced into dissent by their new vision of the old glory, and <hi rend="italic">these</hi> are the Conservatives.</p>
                        <p>A fossil altar, a material half view, a permitted selfishness--either of these may conceal our fundamental treasure--the mainspring of moral vigor--Fatherhood--Providence.</p>
                        <p>If the Kohinoor is brilliant, our kindred diamonds are like unto it. We advance into related social life. Patent at the threshold, in the nursery of home as in the arena of the world, parental providence has stretched a golden chain of union in diversity. Man and woman, not either but both, manifest our nature and represent our race. Of this broad and beautiful relationship the Family is the bright exponent. To whomsoever the tie of son and mother, of daughter and father, of brother and sister, of husband and wife is known, to him is known the peculiar value of this gem from the Creator's signet and its high position among the treasures of men. Humanizing, dignifying, refreshing individual lives in each charmed circle, the Family organizes society, civilizes the State and spreads decorum, forbearance, respect, gentleness, chivalry, wherever men and women meet.</p>
                        <p>There attaches to individuality a sacredness which is evidently dear to the Creator. It is the origin of responsibility, the foundation of character, the essential condition of relationship. No one can divest himself of it. He can cast away his external life, but not his separate being. No stranger can intrude upon it. It is intrenched in absolute seclusion. This it is which invests our existence with its singular dignity and incomparable value. Allied with this individuality, by constitutional fiat, is that capacity and design of dual union, so clearly expressed in creation. Commanding among social attractions is the desire of each individual for its kindred counterpart, an intimately related individual life and symmetrical dependent ties. Around each person, whether man or woman, there gathers by divine intent, a sacredness which should enfold at once his individual and his dual life, whether that dual life has yet been realized or not. Many a person has never met another with whom this nearness of individual life seemed possible. True to such an ideal, though unknown, he may wait in vain even to the end of this life,
<pb n="200 The Woman's Advocate."/>
fulfilling manfully meanwhile all other relations. Some have found but lost and are content to wait, convinced that hereafter the lost may be found again. For all these, they who see the house we live in but not its occupant, may have a sneer. Except in happy unions, I know nothing nobler or lovelier than such vestal lives.</p>
                        <p>From the reckless indiscretion of many marriages, result family ties wherein there is not found that unselfishness which supercedes the need of civil law. Legislation touching marriage interests should treat with complete equity the partners, who are equals in nature and should be so in law. The relation in its integrity is independent of enactments as the finished structure needs no more its scaffolding, nor the willing heart a constraining hand. The only mastery in love inheres alike and equally in both the allied hearts. The insulting idea of headship should be exorcised as an alien thought, if it seek entrance here. Between husband and wife is an absolute merging of all objective properties, an extinguishment of meum and tuum, in the equal and complete endowment of each by each. Though individuality remains eternally intact, yet identical interests, concurrent sympathies and shared experience should result in a community of subjective existence unparalleled outside. This constitutional Relationship despite its violations and its counterfeits still stands the test of human experience which is the crucible of God.</p>
                        <p>As in the family, sister and brother illustrate the diverse unity of human life, so in society there should be mental interchange as equal and respectful and good will as considerate and kind. There is consideration, deference, between brother and sister, but among such as best represent our nature, the consideration and deference are for the more excellent and the more wise, while he or she who represents the better excellence or the truer wisdom, certainly is not the claimant of the deference. Easy as breathing is the quiet performance by either of the most attractive study and the best adapted work. In home's republic there is sympathy not disdain, aid not opposition, equal conference not assumption. Why should it not be so beyond the typical circle of the family? I know no reason based in nature. If there be any reason, it originates in human ignorance or vice. Expedients not grounded in nature are anomalies, accepted under protest if at all, but not destined

to endure and ever to be gladly exchanged for the wholesome natural law. Of course thought bears credentials of strictly equal cogency whether emanating from a man's or from a woman's mind, Conscience, of the man or of the woman, alike pleads duty and the plea is final. Skill and merit of whatever kind, exhibit a claim quite irrespective of sex and cannot equitably be ignored. </p>
                        <p>This diverse but co-operative and in all things equal constitution of men and women is a scripture written in our nature, to guide us in the solution of many a social problem; a simple scripture, once admitted easily applied. It proclaims freedom mental and industrial for women, and this is essential to character; it teaches magnanimity and this is the core of manliness. Though long ignored, equality in diversity is old as the creation. They who hold the sparkling crystal up and show how straight the sunbeam passes through, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> surely are Conservatives.</p>
                        <p>There are still those who sketch this horoscope for woman: Her place nursery, kitchen and parlor only. Her education care of the house, culminating in graceful manipulation of the tea cups and of the piano. Her aspiration, "good Lord a husband!" Her theology, "God be thy law, thou mine," and its morality, "What thou bid'st, unargued I obey." But what is the mental stature contemplated here? Is it such as may befit one who, whatever her relationships, yet alone in her individuality must live and die? How brief a life is given in which to learn God's ways and his intents--will this enable her to make the most of it? Her own nature must be the pattern nearest to her eye, by which to estimate the nature of her race. Will she find it aptly mirrored there--herself a dwarf and parasite? Whatsoever our race is meant to know of truth or to achieve of good, woman equally with man must share. To do so she needs equal powers, means and hopes, These the Creator gives: who so withholds them knowingly, steals and defrauds; and if in ignorance, is yet the unconscious minister of death.</p>
                        <p>The Brother and the Sister must be accepted by us as type of the best social attitude of men and women. It is the earliest mirror God holds up to life, let us learn well and forever remember the divine lesson. Wherever that co-equal station is denied, in Church or State in

work, society or home; there is a central truth eclipsed and he who rends the veil away, revealing anew the axiom, "Equal though different, and though different one," he is the Truth's conservative.</p>
                        <p>Indestructible as individuality is the characteristic thereof which attracts the mind to others, so that the central "study of mankind is man." The family is the sanctuary of the individual. Society is the refuge of the race. Society is man's cradle, school, gymnasium, workshop, study. Here he comes of age and mingles with his peers. Marriage of one with one is the great Relation of the individual. Society, the adjustment of each with all, is the generic Institution of men. Agriculture, manufactures, commerce, government, combined worship, allied philanthropy, all the forms the restless energy of human nature takes, spring forth in society and with it flourish or decay.</p>
                        <p>Brotherhood makes Society. Brotherhood is equity alive--unselfishness in action. A society whose institutions are channels of this water of life is indestructible as the ever germinating humanity they mould and quicken. Every departure from brotherhood tends to subvert society, and rings an alarm which summons the reformer, who is the conservative, to protect the threatened treasure. The impressive demonstration of this fact in the decade about to end, can never be forgotten by its witnesses. A society attempted with the essential fact of brotherhood left out, exploded with a violence which shook the world. The dying thunders linger yet and will reverberate through history forever.</p>
                        <p>Of the countless agitators of the social pool, the angel in disguise is he whose schemes contemplate, or whose life applies, this constitutional requirement of the common weal. Such are Conservatives--the police of heaven--the agents of a power supreme.</p>
                        <p>With every breath we draw, some silver cord is loosed and the record of some life is closed. Each was an heir and beneficiary of Truth, How far was each that Truth's conservative?</p>

                        <p>IN an underground room on one of the streets of Williamsburg lived a widow and her daughter, a young girl about seventeen years old. One morning I called there on business, and was surprised to see them working in a room so dark. There were two small windows only; and they looked out into a dingy, dark street on which the sun seldom if ever shone. Under these windows was a sewing machine at which the daughter sat sewing. Although it was only ten o'clock in the morning, yet she looked tired, and her face was very thin and pale. By her side sat her mother, a middle-aged woman, preparing work for her daughter to sew on the machine. They were so busily engaged that they paused but a moment as I talked with them, working with all the zeal and zest of one toiling to save a life.</p>
                        <p>"How much do you receive for making these garments?" I said, taking up one of the fine nice shirts they had just finished.</p>
                        <p>"We have eighteen cents a piece," replied the mother.</p>
                        <p>"And how many can you make in a day?"</p>
                        <p>"Sometimes when everything goes right we can make six, but we average about five, perhaps a little more."</p>
                        <p>"That would be ninety cents per day," I said--"about five dollars and a half a week. Do you always have all you can do?"</p>
                        <p>"Not always, Ma'am," answered the mother, "but there is seldom a time when we do not have something to do. We have had work plenty now for two weeks, and just now we are working very hard, for we have made ourselves a little extra expense. My daughter," continued she, "subscribed for a book a week ago, and we expect it will be brought around in a day or two, and as our rent comes due about the same time we are in an unusual hurry."</p>
                        <p>"Money cannot be better invested," I said, "than in good books. What is the work, Miss, that you subscribed for?"</p>
                        <p>It is a work on <hi rend="italic">Woman,</hi>" replied the young girl, lifting her sad eyes a moment to my face, "and I think it will be very beneficial."</p>
                        <p>"What do you know about the book?" I asked. "In these times
<pb n="204 The Woman's Advocate."/>
when the subject of equal rights is so thoroughly agitated there are very different ideas written on the subject; but of course as you are a working girl- and have no father, brother or husband to support you, and are entirely dependent on your own exertions, surely you would not work so hard to purchase a book which is averse to your possessing all the rights of your country, and all the advantages for supporting yourself which man possesses."</p>
                        <p>The pale face of the young girl flushed scarlet "I do not believe as you do, Ma'am," she stammered. "Our minister subscribed for the book, and recommended it very highly, and said every woman, especially in these times, should study it well. It says woman's sphere is at home by the fireside; that she was made to make home happy; to make every thing nice and inviting and train her children in the fear of God."</p>
                        <p>There was a wavering about the thin lips as she uttered these words. "My child," I said, "what does it propose to do with those women who have no firesides; who shiver with the cold because they cannot obtain fuel to make a blazing hearth; who work until their fingers bleed to pay the rent for a cheerless, miserable tenement; whom men do not support, but try every way in their power to rob them of their virtue, what does your book propose to do with such women as these?</p>
                        <p>The slender young creature ceased her working a moment, and looking up I saw that her eyes were filled with tears. "O Ma'am," she said with quivering lips, "I do not know. I am afraid it says nothing for such poor creatures. There seems to be nothing for us but work, work from morning till night, and then live like beggars. I wish it would tell us how to obtain pleasant homes, for we are surely the ones who need advice and sympathy, for women with loving friends all around them, with plenty to eat and wear and good beds to sleep in, do not need books to tell them that the fireside is their sphere, and that they must occupy it, for they will not do otherwise, but it is different with us who need books to tell us some way of escape from this cruel bondage of labor not half compensated--this working and wearing away our lives in dark cellars and squallid garrets. I wish, Ma'am, I could subscribe for such a book as that!"</p>
                        <p>"I wish my dear girl," I replied, "that such a book could be obtained, and I would go miles to get it for you if necessary, but I have a book
<pb n="205 The Two Books."/>
Which I would like you to read, and will send it to you, and after you have perused them both, this one and the one you have subscribed for, I will call again and see which you like best."</p>
                        <p>That night I sent the book to her, and in two' weeks I called on her again. She looked much brighter than when I last visited her, the sadness had partially disappeared from her eyes, and she met me with a smiling face, and gave me a cordial welcome.</p>
                        <p>I have read both books," she said almost immediately, and your book I have read through twice, and I believe it has made a new being of me. The book I subscribed for I stowed away and do not want to read it again, for it made me feel more discouraged than ever, but your book put new life in me. I feel as if I were of more consequence and importance, and when I went to carry my work home last evening, Mr. Allen asked me why I looked so smiling and fresh, and I told him it was because I felt more independent. I had been reading a work on woman's rights, and I did not think he paid me enough for my work. He laughed and paid me a dollar more than common, and said he would pay me in future twenty cents a-piece for the shirts we are making. O, Ma'am, I am a strong believer in I 'woman's rights' now, and mother is too, and I feel as if I could make my mark in the world, and I am so much obliged to you for that dear, good book."</p>
                        <p>I went out of that house rejoicing, and the next thing I did was to get a score of woman's rights journals and put them into the hands of a score of women on that street.</p>

                        <p>A cheerful optimist may well believe that we are in a transition state, that women, impatient of the old life which was without thought and culture and motive, in the blind struggle to something better have fallen for the time on something worse; that with the movement of the age toward mutual helpfulness, man to man, women will move not less steadily, if more slowly, and come gradually into truer relations with each other and with men. It will not hurt woman to be criticised. She has too long been assured of her angelhood, and denied her womanhood.--<hi rend="italic">

                        <p>[FIRST PAPER].</p>
                        <p>TEN years ago an article by T. W. Higginson appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> entitled, "Ought Women to Learn the Alphabet?" During, the years that have intervened she has effectually mastered that important branch of education, and now the results are rapidly forcing themselves upon the attention of society.</p>
                        <p>The question of woman's proper position in relation to civil government and the various occupations of life, has become a branch of the irrepressible conflict between the desire of a portion to rule exclusively, and the right of the whole to participate in self-government. Woman asks to-day that she may have a voice in government; that she may have a share in making laws to protect herself, her children, and her property; that she may be able in future to defend herself against any legislation that may tend to oppress her sex; that she may exert her influence morally and intellectually in establishing a form of government never before known in the history of the world, in which every human being, without regard to race, sex or color shall be represented. The question before us is, shall she have these rights, or shall man continue as in the past history of the world to be her ruler.</p>
                        <p>In ages past, morality and intelligence have not been the ruling element in nations; physical force thus far has tested their strength. Great principles have been established through this force; but as the world advances, slowly but surely in wisdom and justice, principles themselves will be the governing power. Philanthropists tell us the sooner woman bas a voice in government the sooner that day will arrive; others say this is not so, that political life will drag woman into its mire; but what does the past show in regard to the social and public intercourse of men and women? Is woman degraded, or is man elevated? We take the ground that man and woman working together elevate each other, and that the present degradation of political life shows the want of woman's influence.</p>
                        <pb n="207 The Consequence of Woman's Learning the Alphabet."/>
                        <p>The power of moral, principle which we hope at some future day will be the power of nations, has been well tested in family government. Once a husband had a legal right to chastise his wife for disobedience, provided the rod used did not exceed a certain thickness, and when this law was repealed it as believed by many men that the corner stone of family government was removed. But to-day in all well regulated families, where woman is the companion and adviser, intelligence and love are the ruling elements. Forced obedience would now be considered brutal, although our puritan fathers used it, probably successfully, in governing our puritan mothers.</p>
                        <p>We have said that woman's influence is needed in the affairs of the Nation; but some of the opponents of this reform tell us that she already exerts so strong an influence, that voting would weaken rather than increase her power. If this is true then strengthen the morality of the country by taking away the vote of our moral, upright men; or stop the mouth of the pulpit on political evils; for it has been argued just as reasonably that the pulpit can exert more influence by letting political sin alone. Politicians doubtless would heartily concur in these arrangements. But this argument on the face of it, is both false and weak. If woman's influence is so strong, then she should have a power placed in be hands by which that influence can become a part of the life of the nation, so that no laws made in future, in times when men's passions govern their reason, can deprive her of that right.</p>
                        <p>It is no new thing for woman to ask, for more liberty and power. Wherever in the history of the world woman has had a chance to cultivate the better part of her nature, she at once demands a share in the affairs of the State, as being equally interested in good government, and in the social and political blessings that flow from it. The Roman women more than eleven centuries ago asked to have laws repealed that oppressed them, and they were partially successful. But there were men in those times, as at the present day, who saw only evil in giving political and civil liberty to woman. Cato once made the following speech in the crowded forum of Roman men and women who had met to consider woman's condition, and his spirit in an ameliorated form shows itself at the present day:</p>
                        <pb n="208 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"The fact of woman claiming rights and assuming a voice in public affairs, is proof that man has lost his majesty and abdicated his supreme authority--that absolute authority over the weaker sex which his ancestors had established by so many wise laws--for if each master of a family,, emulating the examples of his progenitor, had kept his wife in due submission at home, we should not now have so much to apprehend from the public disobedience of the congregated sex." However on that occasion Cato's speech was. unsuccessful, for the women carried their point.</p>
                        <p>Among the opponents of woman's cause at the present day, we notice many reverend teachers of the religion of Jesus Christ; of him who made woman his companion and equal, never exhorting them to obey their husbands, to keep at home, or to devote life solely to domestic duties; of him who treated with kind consideration the fallen women, never intimating by his words or his intercourse with them, that they were worse than fallen men; of him who recognized in all, man and woman, the great common element of humanity. We also notice that these teachers quote the Bible to defend their cause. If men array Moses and Paul in opposition to the just claims of woman; if they use Noah's example and Paul's advice to Timothy to defend the use of intoxicating drinks; if they quote Paul's counsel to servants to defend the right of man to oppress his fellow-man; if they use the example of Abraham, David or Solomon to prove polygamy to be right, or the advice and example of Paul to prove marriage to be wrong, they do one of two things; either they cramp the intellect and moral sense by making men and women believe the Bible supports that which opposes their inward consciousness of truth and justice, or they sow the rankest seeds of unbelief in its divine authority. If religious teachers could feel the force of this truth, they would very carefully examine any movement claiming to advance the interests of mankind, before they began to select texts of Scripture either to oppose or defend it.</p>
                        <p>Teachers of religion are slow to take bold of any new cause; they weigh the pros and cons very accurately before they decide to lend their influence in its favor. Reforms are so likely to overthrow old theories that we do not wonder at their caution. Mr. Garrison says that for ten years he had the clergy hanging on his skirts
<pb n="209 The Consequence of Woman's Learning the Alphabet."/>
in the Anti-Slavery cause. They were slow to give up old prejudices, but when they did they went to work in earnest. So we expect it will be in woman's cause. A few religious publications have come out openly for the ballot for woman; others say they have always advocated "the true rights of woman," but do not specify particularly these rights, which is encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The foreign missionary societies, after raising money year after year to send men to heathen and Mahometan countries, have learned at last that woman has the work to do. In many countries where it is believed that ignorance and seclusion are necessary to keep woman virtuous and in proper subjection to her husband, the missionary cannot gain access to the homes and hearts of the people. Within a few years the simple truth has been discovered; that in order to accomplish the desired object, woman must be sent on this work. She can visit her sex at home, teach them to read, and enlighten them upon the principles of christianity; and through the mother's influence the children will be elevated and thus woman begins the work at its foundation. Will she stop when the foundation is laid and let man raise the structure? Already these women are addressing large audiences in our towns upon their work. They will doubtless be told when the foundation is securely laid, and these heathen women begin to show a thirst for knowledge, that woman's work is to teach the alphabet, and not to preach, but whether they will quietly submit to these old arrangements remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p>It is comparatively easy, with present public opinion to prevent woman from ascending the height of thought and action, but quite another matter to induce her to descend after she has once reached its summit. Could any man weave a theory fine enough, either scripturally, philosophically, or poetically upon woman's duties as to convince Harriet Hosmer that she ought to give up her masculine employment--for the art of sculpture has in times past belonged exclusively to man--and devote life to domestic duties? Miss Hosmer was educated like a boy, and she has done a noble work for woman, for she has proved that woman with equal advantages can equal man in art. These missionary women when they see the fruits of their work will feel a consciousness that the glory belongs to them. To be sure men and women should work
<pb n="210 The Woman's Advocate."/>
for higher' motives than worldly glory, and doubtless do; still when the praises of the world are to be bestowed, there are very few men benevolent enough to let another wear the honors that </p>
                        <p>justly belong to them, and we are inclined to believe that a share of this weakness belongs also to woman.</p>
                        <p>As an example of the argument brought forward by clergymen to prove that woman should not have a voice in government, we copy the following item from a leading religious paper:</p>
                        <p>"At a recent meeting of ministers the question of woman's suffrage was discussed. Many expressed the opinion that it was sure to come, while they took grounds against it. At the close the moderator, who is a man of gentle manners and sound learning and crowned with a 'hoary head,' was called upon to express his views. He said that several had expressed the opinion that woman's suffrage was sure to come; he hoped not, but if it should and he should live to see it, he should resign himself to the situation and feel like saying as Paul's companions said of their ship when they were driven up and down in Adria, <hi rend="italic">'Let her drive!'</hi> Of course all laughed, then raising his voice a little above the confusion he added, <hi rend="italic">' nevertheless I think I should rather drive myself'</hi>" Doubtless the gentleman told the truth, and it was probably the nearest approach to logic that be could bring to bear upon the subject. <hi rend="italic">He would rather drive himself</hi>, for this we cannot <sic corr="blame">bame</sic> him, it is human nature, men and women like to rule, though all are not as willing to confess it. But merriment does not answer the moral question. It may, at the expense of the reform or the reformers, keep it at bay for a time, but the day will surely come when it must be met, and met seriously too, and stand or fall upon its own merits.</p>
                        <p>If nature had intended that woman should occupy her time wholly within the range of home duties, why is it that she does not, as she developes, mentally cling closer to what is called woman's sphere? Why is it that she begins to reason on questions outside that sphere? Why is it that the daily routine of domestic duties does not satisfy the cravings of her nature? Either cultivation perverts her mind, or God intended she should do more than rear her children and minister to her household. We have failed yet to meet the first instance of a woman of culture and earnest thought,
<pb n="211 A Letter."/>
who was satisfied with domestic duties, except she was interested in some object outside of home, or in literature, art, or music.</p>
                        <p>To a father and mother with their children about them, home should be the sweetest spot on earth; a place to rest from the cares and toils of life, and to hold counsel and communion together; but the parents who take no interest in outside objects, become narrow in views and thoughts and cannot do justice to themselves or their children.</p>

                                 <p>Accompanying petitions with a letter may possibly be deemed a work of supererogation, but as the stand-point of observation for women is different from that of men, it may not be wholly a matter of indifference to you, to receive a direct expression of feeling from them, when a question involving so much in the future is to be settled.</p>
                                 <p>We ask you to look along down the hastily gathered names and observe how many are wives and mothers. Some of them, the mothers of sons whom they have educated as worthy citizens--and now these mothers ask you for the one right you so highly prize.</p>
                                 <p>We have been told often that in this progressive State we have but to ask to receive. We are fully cognizant of the liberal laws which you have already made, but we cannot help while giving due credit for generous intentions still to say that these laws <hi rend="italic">are one-sided</hi> and plainly indicate the impossibility of class legislation being just and equitable.</p>
                                 <p>Every woman owning a small amount of property, or doing business in her own name, pays her full proportion of taxes, revenue included.</p>
                                 <p>Is she represented? If you say yes; by her husband, father,
<pb n="212 The Woman's Advocate."/>
brothers, we answer by quoting from James Otis who says no such phrase as virtual representation is known in law or constitution: "It is altogether a subtlety and illusion wholly unfounded and absurd. We must not be cheated by any such phantom or fiction of law or politics, or any monkish trick of deceit or hypocrisy."</p>
                                 <p>Again, Lord Coke says, "The supreme powers cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person or by representation. Taxes are not to be laid upon the people without their consent, in person or by representation. The very act of taxing those who are not represented, appears to me to deprive them of one of their essential rights as freemen, and if continued seems to be in effect an entire disfranchisement of every civil right, for what civil right is worth a rush after a man's property is subject to be taken from him without his consent."</p>
                                 <p>Says our own Senator Anthony in Congress: "It is not a fair statement of the case to say that the man represents the woman.</p>
                                 <p>"Representation implies a certain delegated power, and a certain responsibility on the part of the representative toward the party represented.</p>
                                 <p>"A representation to which the represented party does not assent is no representation at all, but is adding insult to injury. When the American Colonies complained that they ought not to be taxed unless they were represented in the British Parliament, it would have been rather a singular answer to tell them that they were represented by Lord North, or even by the Earl of Chatham.</p>
                                 <p>"The gentleman on the other side the Chamber who says the States lately in rebellion are entitled to immediate representation in this Chamber would hardly be satisfied if we should tell them that my friend from Massachusetts represented South Carolina, and my friend from Michigan represented Alabama. They would hardly be satisfied with that kind of representation. Nor have we any more right to assume that the women are satisfied with the representation of the men. Where has been the Assembly at which this right of representation was conferred? Where was the compact made? It is wholly an assumption."</p>
                                 <p>The thanks of every woman in our State are due to our Senator for this noble speech.</p>
                                 <pb n="213 A Letter."/>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">The Tribune</hi> of yesterday in speaking of the National Convention held in Washington says: "We hope that women do not overlook the logical fact that voting implies the right to be voted for, an also another logical fact, that of duties as well as privileges, and we hope they do not wish to shirk them. Here is precisely our Honored Sirs, we do not ask you for bon-bons. We know that when we claim the right to Suffrage we are asking you to place us on an equality with yourselves, that we may share with you the duties however onerous of government. We do claim in serious earnest that we are far better qualified to comprehend the genius of our government and the interests of our Nation than yonder ignorant foreigner who owns one hundred and thirty-four dollars worth of real estate in fee simple.</p>
                                 <p>Now can we feel otherwise than degraded when we find that however highly cultivated we may be, or however much property we may hold in our own right, we still stand outside of these duties according to article second, section 4th, of your constitution: "No pauper, lunatic, person <hi rend="italic">non compos mentis,</hi> person under guardianship, or member of the Narragansett tribe of Indians shall be permitted to be registered or to vote. Nor shall any person convicted of bribery or any crime deemed infamous at common law, be permitted to exercise that privilege until he be expressly restored thereto by act of General Assembly."</p>
                                 <p>The lunatic may recover his senses, the idiot through science and woman's patience, may be educated up to a weak manhood, the minor will pass out of guardianship, and the criminal may be restored by an Act of General Assembly, but alas!--Woman more hopeless than either is still disfranchised and degraded, and the political influence which is said to be hers is a fiction.</p>
                                 <p>Again, the question how will women do military duty? Are there no military duties but those of bearing arms? Our noble army of nurses during the war have answered that question fully. So also has the civilizing influence of women all over the great West proven that. woman s influence is needed in the government, not because I claim for her a higher or better moral nature but a different one, an that very difference a necessity to completeness. We do not claim these new duties because we despise or deem those we now have inferior, but because we love our country, as you do, and desire above all other things
<pb n="214 The Woman's Advocate."/>
her prosperity. We see that now in the reorganizing of society, socially as well as politically, there should be no fatal compromises made or complex questions left for future settlement. We have said that women have the capacity to rule, and rule well, and have only to point you to Catherine of Russia, to Maria Therese, to Elizabeth of England and many others whom I might name to prove this. Still the simple fact of voting, does not make her a ruler, any more than it makes every man a ruler, who casts a vote. It is but comparatively a small portion of the men of this State who make politics a business, but every man knows that he has the right to vote, and that if tried it will be by a jury of his peers, but no woman has ever yet been tried by mothers with tender, loving hearts who would temper justice with mercy. Again, women will not rule or make laws if not elected, and they will not be elected if incompetent, for it is by consent and choice of the people that your rulers are elected.</p>
                                 <p>What would you, sir, say of a family government where all authority was vested either in the one parent or the other? Would it be likely to be either a wise, just or good government? Do we ever see well regulated families where there is not a united head. I know there are women who will perhaps whisper in your ear, "we have all the rights we want." Allow me to say, sir, such women deceive you. They are the women who rule or ruin, playing alternately the slave and the sycophant; they can stoop to conquer, can wheedle, coax, and pour out a flood of tears when needful to carry a point. And this very assertion is only one of the evidences either of her ignorance or her will to manage you. I claim, sir, to understand women better than men can, and I always know this assertion to be false, or the result of ignorance and wilful stupidity. The slaves often said they did not wish to be free. We come, sir, neither in a spirit of defiance or petty complaining of wrongs. We simply as women ask you to deal justly with us; to deal with us as you would wish to be dealt by if we were in position--where might makes right--and you were the disfranchised and degraded class. Where there is power we have every reason to expect magnanimity to say nothing of justice. We are aware our petitions are an innovation. So is every act of progress, but our State has not been wont to shrink from revolutionary changes. It was the first to proclaim religious toleration.  It early
<pb n="215 The Elective Franchise for Women."/>
instituted its free schools. The abolition of capital punishment, was a serious innovation, but it has worked well. Dare then in this, as in the past to give a precedent, and you will have the gratitude of thousands on thousands of women, who have deserved well of their country, for they have loved and served her with true loyal hearts.</p>

                        <head>SEVERAL REASONS WHY WOMEN SHOULD HAVE AND EXERCISE THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE ON THE SAME CONDITIONS AS MEN.</head>
                        <docDate>NO. IV. APRIL, 1869 VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>Samuel J. May</docAuthor>
                        <p>THE first reason is based upon that, which the Fathers of our Republic declared to be one of the self-evident truth, namely, that "Human governments derive their <hi rend="italic">just</hi> powers from the <hi rend="italic">consent of the governed"</hi> not from any one class or order of persons in the State or, nation; not from those of any particular size, height or weight; nor from those of any particular complexion--florid or brunette, black or white--but from those who are to be governed. Certainly, then, a government cannot derive <hi rend="italic">just</hi> powers from one half, nay less than one half of the whole people, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> not the <hi rend="italic">better portion,</hi> though they are of the male sex. We submit, that, unless <hi rend="italic">brute force</hi> be the basis of civil government, the males of our State and nation had no more right, than the females had, to assume the powers of electors, legislators and executive officers; and they cannot retain and exercise those powers exclusively, without continued <hi rend="italic">usurpation.</hi> It would have been as just, and as safe, for the women only of our State and Republic to have organized and officered our governments at first and to have kept the exclusive control of them until now, as it was and is for the men so to do. Probably the women would not have made more, <hi rend="italic">they could not have made worse</hi> mistakes, than the men have made in the management of our public affairs. If the whole of human nature is better than
<pb n="216 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the poorer half of it, never will bodies politic or bodies ecclesiastic be properly cared for, disciplined and thoroughly well educated and governed, until the feminine powers of mankind are put in requisition for these purposes, equally with the masculine. Mothers of the State are as necessary as mothers of the family.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> reason is the one, that, probably more than any other, drove our ancestors into the Revolutionary War. If "taxation without representation" was tyranny in their day, can it be anything less than tyranny now? And is not tyranny as oppressive, as cruel, as exasperating in its operation upon women as upon men? If submitted to, is it not as demoralizing, dehumanizing in the one case as in the other? There are thousands of women in the State of New York, whose properties are taxed and appropriated to public uses by a legislature, or by a municipal government, in which they have no voice, no representation. Can any one convince himself that this is right? If not right, may it safely be persisted in?</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> reason we urge, for placing women upon the same civil and political platform as men, is the sacredness of the right of <hi rend="italic">Trial by Jury.</hi> Hitherto, never has a woman, accused of crime, had a trial by <hi rend="italic">her peers, her equals.</hi> Let not this sacred right be denied to woman any longer. There have been, there are, there ever must be cases involving the guilt or innocence of women, in which a Jury of men alone would not, could not give a righteous verdict.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> reason, why women should be enfranchised, we would press more particularly, more emphatically than either of the foregoing, for practically, it includes them all. It is this. In our country, under our State and national governments, the elective franchise--the ballot--is the chief protector of the civil and social rights of all classes. With this weapon in their hands, certainly no class of the people, scarcely any individuals, would be wholly without redress, if injured in their persons, their property, their means of living by their labor, or in their opportunities for education. See what the bestowment of the elective franchise has already done, and, is obviously doing, for the colored population of our Southern States! See how the freedmen--those who three or four years ago were held as property--<hi rend="italic">chattels</hi> personal--domesticated brutes--see how they are coming to be regarded, instructed, courted by
<pb n="217 The Elective Franchise for Women."/>
the politicians, the statesmen, the aspirants to office of both parties. The cause of the change is this; a person without the ballot in our country is politically insignificant; but when <hi rend="italic">enfranchised</hi> he becomes a power. However lowly, his vote may effect the result of an election as much as that of the most exalted one in the community.</p>
                        <p>The rights and interests of no class are so safe in any other hands, as in their own. All men and women therefore, should be enabled, as far as possible, to <hi rend="italic">protect themselves.</hi> So far as it can be done by governments, an equal ability should be conferred on all--the lowliest not less than the loftiest ones.</p>
                        <p>Give to all women, of adult age and sane mind, the elective franchise, on the same terms that it is given to men, and the axe will be laid at <hi rend="italic">the root</hi> of some of the most terrible evils that afflict society, and threaten the ruin of our body politic. Admit women to the ballot-box--give them the same political significance that men have, and they will, in due time, redress their <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> wrongs, and secure to themselves <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> rights. You will not much longer see women doing the same kinds and amounts of labor that men do--doing them equally well, but receiving only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the compensation that men receive. You will not much longer see them denied equally easy access to all the opportunities and helps to education of the highest grades, that are provided for men. You will not much longer see women excluded from any of the employments, professions, honorable pursuits of wealth, or of social or political position, to which they may aspire, and for which they may have duly qualified themselves. Enfranchise women, and you will, in due time, see them using and succeeding in the use of the same means of self-support that men use, and becoming equally <hi rend="italic">independent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then, <hi rend="italic">marriage</hi> will no longer be a necessity with them; and will be much more likely to be contracted only between those, who are drawn. to each other by a kindred spirit--by pure love--and by a sacred, intelligent regard for the momentous purposes, for which the Creator instituted the conjugal relation. Enfranchise women, and in due time, you shall no more see, nor hear of, the awfully degraded conditions to which so many females have sunk, and to which they have reduced the males, who have been their partners in the utter desecration of the most sacred functions of their bodies. Give to women political significance--
<pb n="218 The Woman's Advocate."/>
equal social and civil rights with men, and in a few years it will not be, as it is now, the appalling <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> that, in the great metropolis of our State there are thousands of women who have access to so few employments, and are so poorly paid for the work they do, that it is impossible for them to live, without submitting to <hi rend="italic">prostitution.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The men, who take advantage of their necessities, are greater sinners and therefore become meaner, baser, more demoralized than the prostitutes, though they may not be so cruelly abandoned by the respectable and virtuous of their own sex. Thus the ruined females are, unintentionally perhaps, but not less surely, visiting upon us the horrible consequences of the degradation to which our partial legislation, our unjust laws and customs have consigned them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> and last reason that we will now urge for the admission of women to all the rights, opportunities and privileges or men, is, that it will improve the character of domestic and social life. Thenceforward women, being the equals of men, will be admitted, invited to participate in their councils upon all subjects of State and national interest; to consider and discuss the morality of every political principle upon which our rulers have acted or may propose to act, and the expediency of every important measure they may be about to adopt. These high themes of thought and conversation will take the place of the trivial topics, that are usually introduced in the company of "the ladies." Their attention will be consequently turned to things vastly more worthy and improving than the amusements of the season, and the fashions, the light literature of the day. And the men, if they would then be agreeable companions, must cease to be frivolous, and must come into the company of females, as they would into that of their own sex, prepared to contribute somewhat worth knowing on every subject of pressing importance, or especial interest, at the time. Need we offer any argument to prove, that this change would lead to the continual and increasing improvement and elevation of both women and men?</p>
                        <p>Let no one turn away from us with the light remark, that most women do not desire this change--do not wish to be enfranchised. Women, not less than men, are subject to the government of our country. Therefore is it their <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> to understand the laws and executive
<pb n="219 The Elective Franchise for Women."/>
powers, to which they are amenable. They <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to know, and make known to others, whether they approve or disapprove--whether they consent to or dissent from the government. And if women are the "better-half of mankind" it surely will be for our interest, as well as theirs, to insist that they shall bear the responsibilities that properly belong to them, not less than to us. Their quicker sensibility, their nicer moral intuitions might admonish us of political dangers in time to avert them; guard us against injustice and immorality, before they shall have become tolerable by custom, or established by law.</p>
                        <p>What great evil, what dire calamity, what awful punishment may come upon our State and Republic, if we persist in the tremendous unrighteousness of disfranchising more than half of the people, God only can foresee. We have been solemnly admonished by the dreadful sufferings, the immeasurable losses caused by our late civil war. If injustice to <hi rend="italic">four</hi> millions of the inhabitants of the land brought upon us such a visitation as we have experienced, what may we not incur, if we dare to go on doing signal injustice to more than <hi rend="italic">fifteen millions?</hi>

                        <p>[From the Setting Sun].</p>
                        <p>This important Convention met in the city of Rip Van Winkle on the 22d ult., for the purpose of considering how Men's Rights may best be protected. It assembled in Mummy Hall, which is situated on Conservative avenue, corner of Anti-Progress street, opposite the church of The Seven Sleepers, and was kindly offered, free of charge, for the use of the Convention, by Messrs. Dust, Cobweb &#x0026; Co., who have exclusive proprietorship. "The Hall was beautifully and appropriately decorated," says our correspondent, "with festoons of Beard-grass, Bachelor's Button and Wild Oats. On the table were two bouquets, composed of King-cups, Prince's Feather, Cardinal flowers, Dandelions and Sweet Williams, very tastefully arranged.</p>
                        <p>A banner, bearing the device of a falling flag, the flag white, with a background of dark thunder-clouds; and underneath the motto, 'Rally<pb n="220 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Round the Flag, Boys!" stood in a conspicuous place on the platform. The opening exercise was by the band, who played "Hail to the Chief," with much feeling and expression; the piece had evidently been well studied and faithfully practiced. After this the principal speaker was introduced as the Right Honorable Solomon Wiseman, a direct descendant of the Three Wise Men of Gotham, who went to sea in a bowl. He was greeted with a burst of applause. We wish we had space to print his entire speech, which is worthy of the highest praise, but can only quote the conclusion of his eloquent address:</p>
                        <p>"What is to be done, what can be done to stay this tide so swiftly advancing? Oh my countrymen, behold what the future has in store for us if a determined resistance is not made! Slowly, but surely, we have been obliged to give up one vantage-ground after another and the last relic of our superiority seems about to be wrested from our grasp.</p>
                        <p>"I repeat it, gentlemen, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> relic! and our only hope is in maintaining the stand so bravely taken by this Convention, and resisting this final encroachment upon our rights, with voice and pen, in city and country, in private and public, in season and out of season! (Some person in the Hall remarked, audibly, "and particularly <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of season," which occasioned much confusion, but the offender could not be found. He was thought, however, to be one of the society of Wide-awakes from the neighboring city, who had stolen in unobserved. Order being restored, the speaker continued), "Already women are coming to be regarded as our equals--in many places they even supercede us. Lucrative offices we once held are now in their possession. We find women teaching in our Common Schools, High Schools, Academies, and even Colleges. Our young men are driven from behind the counter and from the book-keeper's desk, and their sisters take their places. They are in the Post Office and Treasury Departments. <hi rend="italic">Our</hi> works are crowded from the shelves of the bookseller to make room for feminine effusions. Lady doctors with a large practice may be met in almost any city. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> city, however, I am proud to say is a noble exception to this general rule. <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> physicians are confined entirely to the sterner sex. Women have, in certain instances, ventured into the pulpit itself, and received the large salaries rightfully belonging to deserving ones of our own number. But while <hi rend="italic">such</hi> cases are rare, in many, very many churches, her <sic corr="sacrilegious">sacreligious</sic> fingers sweep the keys of the organ, and man, outraged, unhappy man, is only permitted the small privilege of <hi rend="italic">blowing</hi> it. (Groans and hisses). They edit successful papers--they paint great pictures. Ristori is queen of the stage, as Jenny Lind of the concert hall. But, my friends, while we deplore these evils, let us rejoice that, as yet, our town-meetings are -unprofaned by the presence of women, and the ballot-box, so dear to every white male American citizen over twenty-one years of age, is ours. It belongs exclusively to
<pb n="221 Men's Rights Convention."/>
us, and may it always remain in our possession, and ours alone! (Cheers.) Picture to yourselves, gentlemen, the consequences of admitting women to an equality here. The meerschaum and cigar would be banished from the spot. The juice of the Indian weed could no longer lie unmolested in pools upon the floor. Spittoons would be prescribed. The pleasant whiskey-bottle would no longer circulate freely among us"--Here the speaker was much affected, and sank into a chair, unable to proceed on account of his emotion, while many of the audience were dissolved in tears. The band, being in the gallery in the remote part of the house, misunderstood the cause of the silence and most unfortunately commenced playing "The Rogue's March" which had been previously agreed upon as the signal for closing, and the meeting broke up in the utmost confusion. We understand that a similar Convention will be held on the first of May in the same place, in order to organize a Men's Rights Protective League, and appoint a Vigilance Committee. Persons interested are invited to attend. Special trains will be run, and return tickets provided for those coming from abroad.</p>

                        <docAuthor>Aaron M. Powell</docAuthor>
                        <p>THE question of Woman's political rights has been promptly and favorably introduced in the Forty-First Congress. It is safe to affirm that, from this date, the subject will not be withdrawn, or lost sight of for any considerable period, until its demands are complied with; until woman is recognized as an equal citizen, and her right to vote and to be voted for is fully guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>The Hon. George W. Julian, of Indiana, has introduced in the House of Representatives, bills for the enfranchisement of the women of the District of Columbia, and of all the Territories; with a special bill for the territory of Utah.  He has also introduced a resolution proposing an additional Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, to be known as Article XVI., as follows:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>The right of suffrage in the United States shall be based upon citizenship, and shall be regulated by Congress; and all citizens of the United States, whether native or naturalized, shall enjoy this right equally, without any distinction or discrimination whatever founded on sex.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>We congratulate the friends of woman suffrage that the question, as presented by Mr. Julian's Amendment, is made a distinct, national issue; and that one, who, by his long and honorable service as an advocate of equal freedom for the colored race, has won our confidence and esteem, becomes, very opportunely, also the champion in the House of Representatives, of woman's enfranchisement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Julian's joint resolution was read twice and referred to the Judiciary Committee. We hope that Committee will bring it before the House at an early day, and that, with the bills for the immediate enfranchisement of the women of the District of Columbia and of the Territories, it may be speedily brought to a vote. The friends of woman's enfranchisement should everywhere, by petition and otherwise, call upon Congress for prompt action. We have no doubt that when the question can once command serious consideration and an honest vote upon its own merits, the opposition to it will be found to be compara-
<pb n="224 The Woman's Advocate."/>
tively feeble, and unavailing. How promptly Congress will act will depend largely upon the attitude women themselves assume in relation to their political rights. If a large majority of women continue, in effect if not in words, to say "We have all the rights we want," Senators and Representatives will doubtless feel justified in postponing indefinitely a serious consideration of, and favorable action upon the question.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing in the Amendment above quoted to prevent, or to render less desirable, the presentation of the question of suffrage for women in the State Legislatures. It is a proper subject for State action, and its consideration in the Legislatures is very useful as a means of public discussion and education. But it is most auspicious that the issue, as fairly and distinctly embodied in the Amendment offered by Mr. Julian, becomes thus early a national one. It is quite probable that before a third of the States shall have been induced to adopt woman suffrage as States separately, the required three-fourths can be brought to ratify by concert of action an amendment of the National Constitution, making suffrage uniform and impartial, as it should be, throughout the Union, irrespective of sex. We may hail with great satisfaction the action of any advance State, whether it be Kansas or Massachusetts, which shall lead the way, and give the nation, and the world, a needed precedent of a truly Republican government, knowing no distinction among its citizens on account of sex. But national duty requires, as "manifest destiny" points to, uniformity of suffrage in all parts of the Union, its free exercise to be guaranteed alike to women as to men, by Federal authority.</p>
                        <p>The action of President Grant and Postmaster General Cresswell in appointing Miss Van Lew of Richmond, Va., and other competent women as official representatives in charge of post-offices, is highly commendable and a very encouraging indication of progress. If women are deemed competent to hold office, the question will naturally follow whether they are not also quite as competent to vote?</p>
                        <p>Since the Fifteenth Amendment, guaranteeing suffrage to colored men, upon equal terms with whites, has passed beyond the jurisdiction of Congress, and can no longer be hindered and embarrassed in that body by the negro-hating, insincere triflers with woman suffrage, we hear little about the political wrongs of women from copperhead Sena-
<pb n="225 The Political Rights Women."/>
tors and Representatives or from the negro-hating copperhead journals, such as <hi rend="italic">The New York World</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Boston Post</hi>. But having, though for an ulterior purpose, assumed a championship of the cause of woman suffrage, they cannot now very well at once turn "right about face" and offer violent opposition. With a powerful and controlling influence in behalf of woman's speedy enfranchisement on the part of the political allies of Temperance, with a friendly bias among Republicans, and with their party opponents unwittingly committed at least not to oppose the movement, the present is an auspicious, encouraging period in which to urge the claims of women to the ballot. Let it be improved to the uttermost.</p>

                           <p>Now that the Constitutional Amendment, guaranteeing the ballot to colored men upon equal terms with the whites, has passed Congress, the next step for the friends of woman suffrage is to press the passage of an Amendment abolishing all political distinctions on account of sex. Hitherto, Senators and Representatives, friendly on principle to the measure, have resisted its introduction in Congress, desiring first a final disposition of Manhood Suffrage, and the chief attention it has received, in times past, has been bestowed by the enemies of freedom, who sought thereby to embarrass or defeat, if possible, any measure looking to Negro Suffrage.</p>
                           <p>But now all this is altered. With the question of Negro Suffrage transferred from the National Capital to the State Legislatures, there is a clear field in the Forty-first Congress for this now leading question of the age, which should be at once occupied by the friends of Woman Suffrage, and an urgent demand be made for the prompt passage of an Amendment, such as covered by the admirable bill recently introduced by the Hon. G. W. Julian, and ably commented on elsewhere, admitting women also to the body politic. For such a beneficent measure, recent legislation has paved the way. For our Nation, there is no abiding place short of Universal Suffrage. Every important achievement in behalf of human rights renders easier the next step to be taken. There can be no halt until woman also is enfranchised.</p>
                           <p>We look now with confidence to Congress to heed the petitions that have been rolling upon it for the last six months; and while we anticipate, hereafter, less of officiousness from certain Copperhead Senators and Representatives, who by pretentious championship of the political rights of women can no longer embarrass the cause of equal suffrage

for colored men, we have added confidence that every friend of humanity, in both branches of our National Legislature, will be found aiding by voice and vote this loudly demanded act of Justice.</p>

                           <p>THE Publisher of THE ADVOCATE hereby offers a prize Of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for the best Story bearing upon any of the phases of the "Woman Question;" FIFTY DOLLARS for the second best, and TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS for the third best; the MSS. (not to exceed 100 pp., nor to be less than 50 pp., of THE ADVOCATE) to be submitted in season for award and use by June, 1869. All writers entering into competition for the prizes must direct to the Publisher of THE ADVOCATE, who will retain the names, handing the inclosed articles to a Committee, (to be later announced) who will decide upon the different MSS., purely upon their merits. While each article will be regarded as the property of the author and strict confidence be preserved respecting them, it is hoped that many will be induced to donate their MSS. to THE ADVOCATE after the awards are made public. The Publisher trusts that these liberal offers will stimulate our writers to a spirited competition for the prizes, and thus enable him to present some of the best serials ever offered to the public.</p>
                           <p>WITH the next number we design commencing a story by Miss Nora Perry of Providence, R. I., entitled "Anne's Vocation," written expressly for THE ADVOCATE. Miss Perry has long been known as a favorite contributor to the pages of Harper and other of our leading magazines, and we congratulate our readers that her graceful pen is thus employed for their benefit.</p>
                           <p>THE Publisher of THE ADVOCATE makes the gratifying announcement that hereafter N. B. Spooner, of Plymouth,, Mass., will act as General Agent for New England, and all subscriptions or advertisements designed for THE ADVOCATE may be entrusted to his care. Mr. Spooner is well known to many of our readers, not only as possessing fine business capacities, but as an active reformer, identified with all liberal movements, and we bespeak for him everywhere the co-operation of all friends of progress.</p>

                           <p>Several of the academies and learned societies in Italy have at last decided to admit women as members, and a beginning has been made with the well-known authoress, the Countess Dora d'Istria.</p>

                           <p>In the session of the Newark M. E. Conference a communication from Lucy Stone, in reference to female suffrage, created considerable merriment, and it was moved to refer it to a committee of bachelors. The motion was rejected, and the subject was referred to a committee to be appointed by Bishop Scott.</p>
                           <p>We observe with pleasure that <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Advocate</hi> (Dayton, Ohio) is to be enlarged to twice its present size with the next number. This indicates not only a commendable enterprise on the part of the publisher of this well conducted journal, but a growing interest in the subject <sic corr="throughout">thoughout</sic> the State, which renders such enlargement necessary.</p>
                           <p>The second number of <hi rend="italic">The</hi> (Ohio) <hi rend="italic">Westerville Banner,</hi> a new and exceedingly neat appearing journal devoted to Woman Suffrage, has been received. There are now five journals in the United States specially advocating suffrage for women, with more in prospect, while the press generally gives the question a large measure of good will.</p>
                           <p>Senator Sprague of Rhode Island on the 23d ult. presented a petition for Woman Suffrage, with the rather ungracious endorsement "that as
<pb n="229 Notes."/>
in his deliberate judgment the voters of the country have less to do with the management of their Government affairs than other people, there could not be much harm in granting the prayer of the petitioners."</p>
                           <p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> speaking of the sobriety and good order which reigned at the recent press dinner at Delmonico's, in this city, says that the secret of success, is "that women were there--and there, not by sufferance, but on absolute equality, having--we had almost said right manfully--paid their way"--all of which, good common sense as it is, is somewhat novel testimony borne by the <hi rend="italic">Tribune.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Miss Maria L. Sanford, a young lady who has been teaching a public school in Chester County, Pa., is strongly urged for County Superintendent of Common Schools. Miss Sanford is spoken of as possessing all the requisite attainments for the office, education and rare executive ability, and, as there is nothing in the laws to prevent a woman from holding office, we trust she will be elected.</p>
                           <p>We are in receipt of the first number of <hi rend="italic">The Agitator,</hi> a handsome, eight page weekly, recently established at Chicago by Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, with Mary L. Walker as associate editor. The initial number contains articles by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anna  E. Dickinson, Mary A. Livermore and others. The name of Mrs. Livermore itself is a guarantee of excellence, and we predict for <hi rend="italic">The Agitator</hi> a full measure of success and a wide field of usefulness.</p>
                           <p>At the sixth annual Commencement of the New York Medical College for Women, the valedictory address, which was warmly received, was made by Miss Mary J. Safford, of Cairo, Ill. Miss Safford, whose name is familiar to the readers of THE ADVOCATE, is a young lady of superior attainments, possessing a mind enriched by travel and varied home experience, who, carrying a rare enthusiasm into her profession, cannot but succeed.</p>
                           <p>In the Rhode Island House of Representatives recently the Woman Suffrage proposition was rejected by a vote of 16 to 38. This is certainly a gallant fight for little "Rhody," and one that must encourage its earnest sons and daughters to renewed efforts for success. While the measure was pending in the House, it was earnestly and ably advocated, by the Hon. James W. Stillman, a young man of great promise, who stood firmly by his convictions amid all the jeers and ridicule of some of those opposed to the proposition.</p>
                           <p>A Convention of the friends of Equal Rights was held at Syracuse on the 19th ult., at which an organization was formed entitled "The
<pb n="230 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Onondaga County Equal Rights Association," with the Rev. Samuel J. May for President, and Mrs. Charles D. B. Mills, Mrs. M. E. J. Gage, Mrs. Strowbridge and other of the best men and women. of Onondag County as assistant officers. The Convention was numerously attended, and the proceedings throughout were of a highly interesting character. We are glad to learn that Onondaga is thus pioneering the way for Northern and Central New York, and with such noble spirits enlisted in the work it can not but go forward.</p>
                           <p>At the late town election in Vineland, the ladies printed a ticket of their own, using the names of those whom they regarded as the right men for the right place. They headed the ticket with a dove bearing an olive branch. Seven of their candidates were elected by the legal voters. One year ago, only one woman in that town voted. Last November, at the Presidential election, 172 voted. And now on the 1st of March, 182 voted. There the number of women voting has rapidly increased, while the men of that town only polled about half as many as they did last fall. Does not this prove that men do not want to vote, and should not be allowed to?</p>
                           <p>At the recent very large and enthusiastic Woman Suffrage Convention held at Chicago, Anna E. Dickinson gave most efficient help. It was her first appearance at a Woman's Rights Convention, and in the discussion into which she was drawn with the Rev. Mr. Collyer, she displayed not only an intimate knowledge of her subject, but a quickness of repartee acknowledged by the frequent bursts of applause of the audience. Rev. Edward Beecher, Rev. Robert Collyer (our Robert Collyer, not the other) and several other clergymen spoke earnestly for the cause. Mrs. Livermore and other Chicago ladies added greatly to the interest of the occasion.</p>
                           <p>The great increase in the number of illustrated books and papers, at the present time, is opening a new field for the skill and industry of women, which, we rejoice to see, is being filled, both in this country and in Europe, in a highly creditable manner. Many of the finest illustrations in the <hi rend="italic">Galaxy, Riverside</hi> and other of our illustrated magazines, are from the pencils of young women, among whom may be mentioned Miss Lucy Gibbons, Miss Mary L. Stone, Miss Mary Hallock, Miss C. W. Conant, Miss S. E. Fuller, all of whom draw with daring and freedom. A number of the pupils of the Cooper Art School have been very successful, both artistically a pecuniarily, in this speciality. Abroad, such English magazines as the <hi rend="italic">London Society</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Belgravia</hi> have long been supplied with designs by women, while some of the most amusing sketches in <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> are likewise of their production.</p>

                           <p>A pouring rain greeted the Woman Suffrage Convention in Springfield, Mass., on the 9th and 10th ult.; notwithstanding which there was a fair attendance, a large part of whom were women, who literally waded to the Hall. Lieut. Gov. Trask presided. Among the principal speakers were Lucy Stone, Stephen Foster, Charles C. Burleigh, and Henry B. Blackwell. Several clergymen from the vicinity, and ladies of Springfield, participated in the proceedings. A large number of woman's rights tracts were disposed of, especially the excellent speech of George Wm. Curtis, and the Hon. Samuel E. Sewell's "Legal Condition of Women in Massachusetts." At the close, a meeting was appointed of all those who desired to form a Society for the promotion of Woman Suffrage. Petitions to the State Legislature, and to Congress, headed by the President, were circulated through the audience and numerously signed. It was voted to send a special protest to the State Legislature against granting the petition of Amherst College for an appropriation of $100,000, inasmuch as the property of women who are excluded from the College would be taxed to raise the amount. The <hi rend="italic">Springfield Republican,</hi> one of the editors of which lent valuable aid to the Convention, gave full reports of the proceedings and very favorable editorial comments on the results accomplished.</p>
                           <p>Very pleasant in its way, was the union press dinner at Delmonico's, in this city, on the 20th ult. Among the guests, some one hundred and

fifty in number, who are more or less identified with reform and who by their presence could not but have assisted in the elevation of tone, may be mentioned Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Johnson, the Sisters Cary, Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Jackson Davis, Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Burleigh, Eleanor Kirk, Mr. and Mrs. James Parton, Miss Mary Kyle Dallas, Mrs. Dr. Lozier and others. The entertainment consisted of addresses, sentiments and responses, letters, etc. We subjoin the gems of the evening--two happy effusions by the Sisters Cary:

From the slight perusal of them I have had opportunity as yet to make, I am much gratified. There are several paths of approach to your ground, each and all of which I think it important to keep open. This can be done, of course, with wideness of view and tolerance, looking simply at the one great object in view. I approach this Cause from the stand-point of the Divine Revelation: and Christianity, and believe it based on truth and that it will prevail. I wish you good success in your advocacy of it.

                        <p>IN the first place I wish to state that my heroine insisted and insists to this day, that her name shall be pronounced in one syllable.</p>
                        <p>"I am Ann in pronunciation and Anne, in spelling,", she would say. "My old English grand-aunt, Anne Hastings, named me for herself, and Anne, with the final <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is the ancient Saxon method of spelling it. I find scores of people who exclaim when they see my name written, 'oh, your name is Annie, why are you always called Ann?'</p>
                        <p>"Then I elaborate myself in explanation, and they listen blandly and go away and glibly call me <hi rend="italic">Annie</hi> from henceforth: and I will never come at that calling. To think of my having to bear the burden of one of those <hi rend="italic">ies</hi> which are so obnoxious to me. To think of my being forced into the ranks of the Minnies, and Nellies, and Hatties, and Matties, which have inundated the world for the last few years. My little sensible name to be masqueraded like this!"</p>
                        <p>This was the way my heroine talked at eighteen, and this is the way she talks at this day. But I desire to present her now in the first blush of her youth--in this eighteenth year when her character was giving that bright promise of what it was to become in the future. This eighteenth year when she was so full of life, and health, and <hi rend="italic">opinions.</hi> Opinions which she vehemently expressed upon all <sic corr="occasions">ocasions</sic>, with the same earnest yet <hi rend="italic">insouciant</hi> manner which characterized her protestations in connection with the obnoxious <hi rend="italic">ies.</hi> And she had opinions upon
<pb n="236 The Woman's Advocate."/>
every imaginable subject, all of course, at this age more or less crude and presumptuous--or what Thackeray would call--<sic corr="bumptious">bumptuous</sic>. But if they had the unripeness and rashness of youth they had too that "light which is never on sea or land"--that halo of generous enthusiasm, and bright belief, and ready courage which accompanies all fine natures in the early morning of life.</p>
                        <p>She was the youngest of the family, and her two brothers and one sister were as unlike her in character as it is possible to conceive. Society people every one of them execept Anne--gay, and good-natured, and well-bred and well educated, but with no higher aspirations than society's successes and its well-bred comforts and pleasures. Amiable and gracious people who believed without question, because without thought, in the settled institutions of the day; always disposed to think the old ways must be ways of respectability, and the new, of anarchy and ruin. It is such people of whom Theodore Winthrop spoke, when he said with that sad satire, "It is shabby that mankind will not keep the peace and be decent."</p>
                        <p>And amongst such people it was certainly curious to find a character like Anne's. Their friends would often laughingly declare that she was in the wrong place. But nature is wiser than we, she makes no mistakes, and probably she had her own deep designs when she let this alien young sapling spring up in this trim-bordered garden. I think, though her family loved her tenderly, that she was a source of no little dismay to them, for she was perpetually getting into scrapes, as she herself would tell you by these extraordinary opinions of hers. For instance, when the war was yet in its early days, and the "sacred institution" of the South was very timidly if not tenderly treated, and abolition sentiments were less freely expressed in "society" than at present, and when expressed, by no means received in the same manner;--in these early days, Anne one night electrified and horrified a certain portion of avenue-dom, by one of her "speeches," as her sister called her outbursts. It was at a party--a party just large enough to make everybody else the audience of one speaker occasionally; and Anne had been listening very attentively to the conversation of two or three gentlemen near her, when one of them in reply to the other, said suddenly, with that splenetic emphasis which was then very common:</p>
                        <p>"I don't believe in slavery, but I believe in its biding its time. I don't believe in sudden and violent measures to abolish it. It will die out naturally if let alone."</p>
                        <p>Then quick as a flash this girl who had a moment before been talking gay little girl nonsense with the youth beside her--this young girl with roses in her hair, and on her cheeks, turned, and cried out in a ringing voice:</p>
                        <pb n="237-Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
                        <p>"Ah, that's what Jeff Davis wants, you know; just that, to be let alone! Mr. Vance, do you think he'd die out with no further trouble if you let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> alone?"</p>
                        <p>And Mr. Vance, a courteous, middle-aged gentleman, without slightest suspicion that this girl was in earnest, was uttering anything more than one of those bright audacious nothings, which a pretty girl is privileged to utter, made some jesting reply wherein he dropped a compliment as one drops a sugarplum into a child's hand. But the next moment this pretty girl, with roses on her cheeks, was astonishing him by the most vehement outburst of abolitionism. And the best of it was, or the worst of it, she was just inexperienced enough to be perfectly at her ease, and quite regardless for the time that everybody had paused to listen to her, that everybody was petrified at her audacity, and nobody sympathetic.</p>
                        <p>I cannot tell yon what she said in detail, but it was what any enthusiastic radical would have desired to say in reply to such sentiments as Mr. Vance had expressed. There was a little pause of utter silence as she concluded; but I think the pause was significant, not only of. surprise, but of a momentary emotion, at least, of admiration, for the audacious charge. I think too, that the truth made itself felt for that moment, the truth that was beyond them and which this gallant young herald riding into their ranks, had proclaimed as one sent from Heaven. But I can tell you one thing--she "caught it," as the urchins say--afterwards.</p>
                        <p>"I can't understand how a young girl like you can bear to make herself so conspicuous, to say nothing of the arrogance of the thing," reproved Mr. Hastings as they talked the matter over at home.</p>
                        <p>Mortified at this accusation of forwardness and arrogance, Anne quite humbly replied, that she had had no idea of being arrogant or conspicuous; that she forgot herself in fact in her amazement and indignation.</p>
                        <p>"But young girls shouldn't forget themselves in such ways; and besides what do you know of laws and governments, that you should presume to oppose <sic corr="your">you</sic> elders?" papa Hastings returned severely.</p>
                        <p>Anne was silent and submissive under this reproof, until Frank, who was only two years her senior, said patronizingly:</p>
                        <p>"Yes, you'd better not meddle with the darkies if you don't want your fingers smutted, Miss Anne; for young ladies with smutty fingers, don't succeed in society very well, you'd much better attend to your fineries, and exert your superfluous reformatory energies upon one of those marvellous structures which you call a bonnet, and I call a coal-scuttle." (Reader, it was the era of high pokes with a flower garden enshrined above the forehead).</p>
                        <pb n="238  The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Well, at this Annie flew up again, not angrily--the occasion wasn't worth that--but as sharp as a rose-briar: like Tennyson's little Lillian--
<q direct="unspecified">"A rose-bud set with little wilful thorns."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Success!" she cried out briskly. That means in your dandy-dictionary, a husband to buy me diamonds and point lace, and to take me to Newport and Saratoga. That. is as high an ideal as you can conceive for a woman. I like diamonds and point lace, and I like Newport and Saratoga but I'd rather smut my fingers, as you call it, with all the isms in the world than to have such success for the end and aim of my life!" </p>
                        <p>"Oh, you're a regular strong-minded one!" laughed dandy Frank at this breezy burst. "And they're always leaders of a forlorn hope. You'll be the Sister Anne to look out of the tower and foretell what is coming to the rest of your sex."</p>
                        <p>"You'd prefer me to be Blue Beard's victim, instead, I suppose sir."</p>
                        <p>"In that case I should come and deliver you. That is the end of the story, you know. It is the sister who idly talks in the tower, and the brother who protects and delivers. There's a pretty allegory all ready made for men and women."</p>
                        <p>"Pretty fiddlesticks! your protection would turn out as poor little Clara Wing's did. They married her off--that family of hers--to Mr. Blue Beard Oglesby, and when he behaved so badly to her that all the neighbors talked of it, those nice brothers of hers, tried to hush matters up and make Clara live with him, because they considered a family fuss discreditable! They'd have seen her popped off into the fatal closet with the rest of the victims for the sake of an external <sic corr="secrecy">secresy</sic> and silence, which stands with them for respectability, you know. Thank you sir, I'd rather be the sister Anne who foretells than Blue Beard's victim, to depend upon Mrs. Grundy's slave to deliver me!" and Anne dropped a saucy, smiling courtesy upon dandy Frank, whom she had defeated by her sharpness, and went off to bed, with flying colors.</p>
                        <p>This was the way she got her name of Sister Anne; a name which given in jest clung to her ever afterwards. And this was the way in which the family reprovings ended for her; in a laugh at last, and a puzzled feeling of admiration for this strange duckling who made such a commotion in their quiet waters. Anne was "odd" they concluded--that vague term that covers so much misinterpretation and ignorance of another. Anne was odd, but she'd come out all right by and by. By and by they thought, when the world's smoothing-irons had pressed down her rough edges. In the meantime Anne went on her way, winning friends and good wishes, spite of her opinions, wherever she went, by the force of her
<pb n="239 Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
great healthy, sunny nature, which magnetized even these obnoxious opinions. Of course with her tendencies, all the interests and incidents of the war, were of vital importance to her. The fact of her eldest and favorite brother, that handsome Tom Hastings, being a lieutenant in the army, specialized her feeling into a more vivid personality than it would otherwise have been. And this very fact too became at last the lifting lever which carried her forward to achieve her destiny. But in the meantime she was the busiest of the busy in the work at her hands. Nothing came amiss to her. She was the prime mover of Sanitary Fairs, and unwearied in her labors in all those many ways wherein the loyal women of the North proved themselves such a power in the land.</p>
                        <p>"How Anne does go it," Frank said laughingly. Her sister Julia, pretty and petite, shrugged her shoulders and declared that Anne must be made of iron.</p>
                        <p>But papa and mamma Hastings were sincerely glad that Anne had found such a safe and legitimate field for her superfluous energies and sympathies. It was "the thing" to attend the Sanitary rooms, to scrape lint and get up Fairs--proper feminine employment; and though Anne did "go it;" to quote master Frank, it was a safe field and could lead to nothing undesirable. Oh, ye deluded people! While Anne was so busy; while she was "going" at this swift pace, yes, even while she was gaily chatting and chaffering behind those Fair-tables, rosy, and smiling, and attractive over her various wares, a sober plan and purpose was forming in her mind. A plan and purpose growing out of this very Sanitary work, springing up from all the constantly stimulated sympathies of the time and place. That it was something she knew would not meet with the approval or consent of her parents is self-evident from the fact that she held it closely locked in her own breast.</p>
                        <p>"The time will come for me to suggest it, I am certain," she said to herself half audibly one night as she stood brushing out her long hair after a fatiguing evening at a Fancy-stall.</p>
                        <p>"What is that you are saying ?" asked Julia looking over her crimping-pins in curiosity.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">did</hi> I say anything ? I was only thinking," and Anne blushed guiltily under her half-uttered secret.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, of course you said something, you said something about a time coming for you; and you'd better go on and say the rest, you know I'll never tell, Anne, and perhaps I can help you or advise you."</p>
                        <p>But Anne was not to be moved by this insinuating offer.</p>
                        <p>"Catch me telling her!" she thought, and this time she didn't think aloud, but she laughed gleefully as she parried Julia's curiosity and considered what
<pb n="240 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Julia's help and advice would be. And Julia, pondering upon what she had heard, and observant of Anne's blushes, came to only one conclusion, that Anne was in love. "And it's that, horrid Grainger, the man with the long hair and dreadful coat and radical notions!" Julia's ideas you see were confused on the subject of radicals. Of necessity, in her mind, they were horrid men with "long hair and dreadful coats," and other external oddities. Anne would have laughed still more gleefully if she had guessed this conclusion of Julia's, for "that horrid Grainger" certainly had nothing to do with her secret.</p>
                        <p>"Let him laugh who wins," saith the proverb, and Anne won; but she found the winning no laughing matter, as it happened.</p>
                        <p>PART SECOND.</p>
                        <p>It happened in this way: Mr. Hastings came in one day with a telegram in his hand. Tom had been dangerously wounded and was then lying in one of the Washington hospitals. I am going on at once, and I think Anne had better go with me, she is so strong and helpful in emergencies," was Mr. Hastings' first remark after the communication of his sad news. And poor delicate Mrs. Hastings, and the hardly less delicate Julia, entirely acquiesced in this arrangement. Anne always stood in the gap in all domestic emergencies, and it was quite natural that they should turn to her in this graver emergency.</p>
                        <p>And Anne, who received this summons while she stood the centre of a gay group of girls at the Sanitary rooms, herself as gay as any, felt, as the saying is, as if a judgment had come upon her, for a moment. To go out to the hospitals! This was what she had longed to do; this was her plan and purpose--her secret. But to be called to the work through Tom. To go out to nurse Tom--perhaps to see him die--oh, she had never thought of this! But the thought had now to be faced as calmly as possible, for every member of the family seemed to depend upon her and look up to her, as it were, for strength and courage at this crisis. And she proved herself equal to all their demands. She had a cheerful word for her mother and sister, and a hopeful smile for her father even while her own hopes were at the lowest ebb, and her anxious fears kept whispering, "Oh, if Tom should die." But Tom did not die.</p>
                        <p>"Thanks to your nursing he'll live to be shot at again," said the old surgeon to her one morning; weeks after she had first taken her post by that hospital cot. For a time Anne had no thought beyond the happiness which this recovery gave her. But after the gay Thanksgivings which ran into endless merry-makings and feastings at home, and the hero of them all had gone back "to get
<pb n="241 Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
another shot," as he merrily quoted, Anne began to consider the feasibility of returning to the work she felt was hers more than any other just now; a work, too, that should be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> thank-offering for the life that had been spared to them. As might have been expected, she did not meet with any encouragement to carry out this plan.</p>
                        <p>"What, go back again voluntarily into the hospitals? She must be crazy!" was the general home-verdict.</p>
                        <p>"Why do you want to go, Anne?" her father asked her at length, when she had shown by her persistence that it was a serious matter with her.</p>
                        <p>"Why? Oh, because I know I can be of so much service there. I'm a famous nurse, as you are well aware, sir," laughing up in her father's grave, perplexed face. "And Doctor Dick declares I'm equal to a sister of charity," she concluded gaily, but with a depth of earnestness no gaiety could quite conceal.</p>
                        <p>"I don't think it is proper for a young girl like you, Anne," her mother remarked rather severely.</p>
                        <p>Oh, but mother, I don't look so very young., You know Julia is often taken for the younger. And then, as far as propriety goes, old Doctor Dick would let me board in his family and would look out for me in every way. Besides, there's sister Frances, who would be my friend always."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, dear!" sighed poor Mrs. Hastings, "I do wish that Anne would fall in love with some good man and get married!"</p>
                        <p>This was the only way Mrs. Hastings could see out of the perplexities that beset her. The only way to cure Anne of her "notions" But Anne had one friend "at court." Tom, who was the hero of the family now, wrote home in answer to the letters asking his opinion--</p>
                        <p>"Let her go. Anne can't be out of place anywhere, because I verily believe she always knows her place. And then she is such a blessed nurse she ought to serve if she wants to; and I want her there when I'm sent in again with my next shot," the heedless fellow wound up. Tom's letter, perhaps the final reckless suggestion, which was a probability no one could gainsay, helped Anne to accomplish her desires; and it was not long after this that she was back again at her post--a sister of charity in good earnest--though wearing no bonds but those of her own brave and generous spirit. All the family now, following Frank's jesting lead, addressed her occasionally as "Sister Anne," until it grew to be almost a habit without the jest. The poor fellows lying maimed and helpless to whom she would now and then relate anything amusing that came to her, received this jest, that she read out of her letters one day, as if it had been an inspiration; and from thenceforth one and another took it up, and many a stranger
<pb n="242 The Woman's Advocate."/>
visiting the wards and noticing the slender girl darkly and plainly clad, who answered to the name of Sister Ann, would associate her unquestioningly with the sisterhood of the Roman Church. But this same stranger meeting her at another hour in Doctor Dick's drawing-room--brilliant in her flowing robes and her vivid animation-would never have dreamed that the nun-like, flitting figure of Sister Anne and Miss Hastings were one and the same. Yet into those hospital wards she carried all that sunny cheerfulness, that gracious vivacity which made her so brilliant in society. Into those wards she took all the gifts of her nature, tempered to suit the needs of the sufferers there, and shone upon them as the sun shines in dark places.</p>
                        <p>"I can understand now how the fellows in the Crimea used to kiss Miss Nightingale's shadow," said one poor boy, speaking of Anne at this time. "Only," he would finish with quaint and unconscious poetry, "Miss Hastings doesn't cast a shadow--it's only sunshine."</p>
                        <p>Ah, who that saw her here could doubt that Anne knew her place--that she was doing the work that was fitting for her? Once that year she wrote home to her sister, words that were full of a certain sweet though unthinking pathos:</p>
                        <p>"Don't be anxious about me," she wrote, I never felt so much in the right place before, for here I seem to know just what to do, and to say: and you remember at home and in society there, I was always doing and saying the wrong thing, or the thing out of place that fretted you all so."</p>
                        <p>Yet at home and in society there, how they missed this bright creature, who while she startled with her heterodox opinions, still carried a sort of enchantment with her which--
<q direct="unspecified">"faster than her tongue did give offence,"</q>
did heal and smooth for her all her offences and wrong-doings.</p>
                        <p>To Julia Hastings this life that Anne lived in the hospital seemed a treadmill existence.</p>
                        <p>"So strange that any girl should <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> to be there!" and Julia, poor, dear little girl, thought of what Anne missed in New York. All the gay merry-makings--the balls, the parties, and the Fairs: in short--Society, which was Julia's sole idea and ideal of human contentment; and--this was a veiled consciousness, not even put into thought--words--the principal ingredient, or what society signified in truth; the admirers, possible adorers, and still further, the ultimatum--possible husbands! And these brilliant possibilities Anne was losing, in the May-time of her youth and good looks. But while Julia pondered this momentous and nteresting question, and congratulated herself on her superior opportunities, what do you think happened, not to her, but to Anne?</p>
                        <pb n="243 Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
                        <p>It was the old story of the Lark and the Butterfly. "Why do you leave these delightful fields, where there is such pleasant company, to soar away by yourself in loneliness and solitude?" asked the Butterfly of the Lark.</p>
                        <p>"I am in the service of the gods," answered the Lark, "and carry the aspirations and prayers of the children of earth up to the gates of Paradise."</p>
                        <p>"But it must be so dull," returned the Butterfly, "to go off on such a tiresome journey, and leave such pleasant companions."</p>
                        <p>"Dull, oh, I never think of that, for I sing on my way the songs the Gods have taught me, to cheer and gladden these sorrowful children of earth," returned the Lark soaring away even then, and beginning her song as she soared.</p>
                        <p>But the Butterfly ruffled her beautiful wings as she rocked, to and fro on the bosom of the rose, and murmured over and over, pityingly,</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">"Dull, dull, dull!"</q>
                        <p>and then as a brilliant Dragonfly came whirling up to her, she murmured still more pityingly: "And such chances as she misses! The Lark, poor thing, will never find a mate."</p>
                        <p>But even while she made this reflection, the Dragonfly went whirling off to where another Butterfly smiled and fluttered. They were so much alike, these Butterflies. And just then high up in the blue ether another Lark bound on the errand of the gods joined the heavenward flight of the first, and with his stronger wing bore her on and mingled his song with hers in such a strain of melody that the Butterfly folded her wings and drooped her head in mortification and despair.</p>
                        <p>And this was something the way it happened with my human Lark and Butterfly. While Julia fluttered her gay wings at the splendid Dragonflies who went whirling through "society," and while she pitied her sister's lonely lot, there came along one day a fine fellow who straightway attached himself to the little brown nun as none of Julia's brilliant admirers seemed inclined to attach themselves to her. It came about very simply as such things often do. Going in to her ward one morning she found a stranger sitting beside one of the cots in earnest conversation with the occupant; and the occupant was no other than her pet patient, the boy who had made the pretty speech about the sunshine of her shadow. "Oh, sister Anne, sister Anne," he called out to her. And Anne went at the call and was presented to "my friend, Mr. Gainsboro." She looked up at this "friend," and saw a tall, dark faced gentleman, and felt at once that he was what his name suggested, of Southern lineage. Her boy Johnny as she called her patient, divined the question in her eyes and answered it with boyish hilarity and unreserve.</p>
                        <pb n="244 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"Oh he's loyal, Sister Anne. He's true-blue, though he does hail from the Carolina swamps. But he isn't <hi rend="italic">blue-black,</hi> you know, as we are! Sister Anne is an awful Radical, Mr. Gainsboro!"</p>
                        <p>There was a hearty laugh at this; and at the end of it, and of the few minutes conversation that followed, Gainsboro and Anne seemed to know all about each other. An awful Radical, and John Gainsboro though truly loyal, was of Southern blood and breeding! But there is a difference which is of nature, and a difference which is of training and association. The former is vital and antagonistic, the latter external and stimulating. Thus with Anne and Gainsboro--they were of sympathetic natures but of different training and associations. They evinced their likeness in unlikeness, by the fact that both of them exceeded the limits of the social order in which they were born, on the side of breadth and liberty of thought. Amidst the life-long associations of a Southern aristocracy John Gainsboro was always loyal to larger issues than were accepted by his class, and Anne we have already seen went as much beyond the principles of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> class in breaking over the borders of popular republicanism, into the turbulent sea of Radicalism. With only a knowledge of the externals, however, the news of the engagement, which speedily followed the acquaintance of these two, was received with amazement and incredulity. The Hastings family, father, mother, brothers and sister, were delighted. They had always entertained a secret fear that Anne would introduce an alien element into the family in the form of a "horrid Grainger with a dreadful coat, and Radical notions." And here she was, securely engaged to a man who, whatever his range of thought would never be likely to break out into "dreadful coats," or very "Radical notions." The two being concomitant upon each other in the rather limited range of their judgments upon this matter.</p>
                        <p>"Gainsboro is a gentleman and a man of the world," pronounced Mr. Hastings. This was the key-note of the family. A gentleman and a man of the world. Everything now was going to run smoothly and respectably! There would be no more talk about vocations! As John Gainsboro's wife, Anne would find her vocation in his heart and home. Julia expressed the whole mental state when she remarked, one day, that it was lucky Mr. Gainsboro was of their own class--a gentleman like other people. Like other people! That was the idea. Uniformity, regularity; these meant respectability. They could reconcile themselves to lack of fortune for these safe qualities.</p>
                        <p>The Gainsboro blood and breeding, as things stood, were of more importance than aught else. It was a great family, as we foolishly say here in Republican America, of long inheritance.  A great family, and John Gainsboro, the last of
<pb n="245 Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
the name though not of the race, found himself at the age of six-and-twenty with only a few hundreds in the place of thousands, and his profession of the law, which yielded little or nothing at that time. Previous to this he had lived upon a small patrimony, spending his days in travel and study, until the exigencies of the times, depriving him of State and estate, drove him to action.</p>
                        <p>"No, I couldn't enter your army and shoot at my South, though I think they are in error," he said resolutely. "I was born, and bred amongst them. They are bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, for I am connected with almost every State by some tie of kinship."</p>
                        <p>This was the quality of John Gainsboro's character. Whatever breadth his thought might take, he would never become an enthusiast or a zealot. He would sacrifice much for conscience' sake, but he would always stop short of extreme action, not from want of courage, but from temperament. Firm, calm and self-reliant, he was the opposite of the generally received idea of the Southern character. And this was the man with whom our fierce little Radical was to cast her lot.</p>

                        <p>IN behalf of true delicacy and womanliness, we would make an earnest protest against that quiet essence of national vulgarisms, the almost universal use of the term <hi rend="italic">female</hi> as applied to woman. One cannot take up a newspaper, not even <hi rend="italic">The Independent,</hi> we are sorry to say, without reading about female colleges, female meetings, excellent <hi rend="italic">females,</hi> and otherwise. When a child, it always gave us an undefinable disagreeable sensation, we scarcely knew why, when our good pastor read from his pulpit the weekly notice of the <hi rend="italic">female</hi> prayer-meeting. Still our attention was never fully called to its inherent coarseness, until our French professor, who had but recently become a resident of our <hi rend="italic">highly cultivated</hi> land, spoke to us of his surprise at the use of this word to designate woman. With as strong terms as his broken English would allow, he expressed his disgust at the practice and finished by saying, "In my country they do not so."</p>
                        <p>Why, in the name of all true refinement, is this expression allowed to tarnish the literature of the day? Being a term equally applicable to one-half of the brute creation, it tends to lower the dignity of womanhood. If one should say "I saw a female in the street," were it not for universal usage, we should not know whether old brindle, a favorite pussy, or some motherly hen, was indulging in a stroll. "Do you know that a Female College is going to be established here," asked a friend one day?</p>
                        <p>"No indeed," we replied, "for if so the good old cows and other animals, will be entitled to admission."</p>
                        <p>Education we want, good friends, full, and complete, but we <hi rend="italic">do</hi> decline to receive it in <hi rend="italic">female</hi> colleges. Why not drop this at once, and say Ladies' College, like the sensible men and women we trust you are. This expression is not merely coarse; it is ungrammatical also, for it makes the college itself a female. Females' College would be correct but not refined. We hear nothing of male colleges or of meeting males in the street. This is as it should be; then why degrade woman by such expressions as we are considering.</p>
                        <pb n="248 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Now-a-days there is another noted <hi rend="italic">female</hi> who claims our attention, namely, Female Suffrage. Kind reformers, we thank you for your untiring zeal and interest in this respect, but, why thus lower those whom you aim to elevate? Womanhood suffage, good people! yes we repeat, let womanhood suffrage speed joyfully and triumphantly on its way but do not, we, beg of you, learned divine, or popular editor, sully your "flights of imagination" by this uncivilized American vulgarism.</p>

                        <p>[SECOND PAPER].</p>
                        <p>IF it is admitted that woman has a right to be interested in one object outside of home duties, then she has a right to be interested in others, and it is difficult to say where these objects end. Public opinion regulates them without much regard for justice. It does not allow a woman, at least not without a disapproving frown, to mingle with men in business, "to buy, sell and get gain;" but it will allow her if she is in want to crowd through our streets, picking up a chip here or a cinder there to keep her children from freezing, and that too without a scruple for the delicacy of her sex. It will allow a mother to leave her children for hours, days or even weeks, to visit watering places to attend parties, or religious meetings but it is very sensitive about her doing the same thing to prepare and deliver a lyceum lecture. It will allow her to sing in the presence of thousands, but it does not like to have her preach the doctrines of Christ even to hundreds. It will allow her to personate all kind of characters upon the stage, or dance in public halls, but its sensibilities are shocked at the thought of her going into our halls of legislation to help make laws. Public opinion is not a very consistent guide for woman when we come to examine it closely.</p>
                        <p>If a woman who is interested in moral and spiritual truths feels an earnest desire to tell mankind of the truth as she sees it, has man a right to close the doors of his theological schools against her, and tell her woman's sphere is the kitchen or the nursery? If another sees corruption in political life, sapping as she fears the moral life of the nation, and feels it to be her duty to publicly protest against it, shall man tell her woman's sphere is the needle or the school-room? Man or woman's sphere is any position that either can take and successfully hold. Nature never makes mistakes. If giving more liberty to woman takes her out of the path that man has marked out for her, it is proof positive that man was wrong in limiting her. If she succeeds in any department of art,
<pb n="250 The Woman's Advocate."/>
literature or politics then nature intended that she should do the work in which she is successful.</p>
                        <p>It is one of the chief arguments of our opponents that our mothers, wives and sisters do not want the ballot. Who, we ask, are the leaders in this reform? Man of them are faithful wives, and devoted mothers, who have thought upon the subject, and who candidly believe the voice of woman is needed to save our country from moral corruption. They also believe they should have a voice in making the laws under which they and their children are to live; that God created mind, which makes man and woman above the brutes, independent of sex; that woman has aspirations, desires and intellect in common with man; that the intellect of woman should be cultivated, and the circle of her influence widened, that she may become a wiser counsellor for her sons and daughters; that the present life of a great number of women which is devoted to fashion and ostentation, has a tendency to dissipate that which is great, noble and unselfish in woman; that widening the circle of woman's work will have a tendency to check the present ostentatious way of living, and to awaken in her improved thoughts and views of life. And shall we be told that woman does not want the ballot ? If the mass do not ask for it, it is no reason why the wants of these thinking women should be disregarded. They believe it is necessary for the good of woman, society and our country that she should have it, and man should prove that their belief is wrong before be refuses to grant it.</p>
                        <p>We sometimes hear these women spoken of with derision as "strong-minded," but no man, however weak he may be himself, desires to live with a weak-minded woman, for weakness and selfishness are usually inseparable. Mental strength is as essential in woman as in man. They need to learn by observation, study and self-discipline how to control themselves and how to direct the minds of others. A boy who has a strong-minded, thinking mother, with a knowledge of the world, has generally a safe staff to lean upon.</p>
                        <p>We have sometimes seen the sons of mothers, who were strong morally but not as strong intellectually, on the road to ruin; frequenting the gaming table, loving the wine cup, and seeking the company of the immoral and profane. A mother's prayers and a
<pb n="251 The Consequence of Woman's Learning the Alphabet."/>
mother's tears have no effect. Perhaps in after years, when that mother is on her death bed, or he finds himself within the walls of a prison, those prayers and tears will awaken within him remorse for the past, bitter enough to bring repentance in its train and the moral strength of his mother does its work. But had that mother comprehended the workings of the human mind; had she been versed in the philosophy of life, and understood the relation of cause and effect, she Might have saved her boy this bitter experience. Woman's strength does not lie in her weakness as it is often asserted. We need strong, thinking women to teach the, rising generation how to avoid the shoals and quicksands of selfishness, misery and vice. A weak-minded teacher of moral truth is better than no teacher, but the strong-minded is the only one upon which we can safely rely for success.</p>
                        <p>The question is often asked, and asked as seriously as if it was an intricate problem in mathematics, if women vote and mingle in political life who is going to take care of the children? We ask, if men vote and mingle in political life, who is going to plant our corn and potatoes, or build our houses, rail-roads and steam engines? The same ones who do this work now. In the great majority of cases their mothers will take care of them; in other instances they will be left to the care of others, as they are now, that their mothers may provide for them the necessaries of life, or that they may spend a Winter in Paris, or a Summer in Newport, or possibly that they may attend a session of the legislature. If every politician in the country was a woman, we doubt if the children would be any more neglected than they are neglected to-day. Mothers find time to visit, dance, shop and embroider, and if in some cases political duties should take the place of these occupations, we see no need of alarm for the safety of the little ones. Victoria has brought up a large family of children and attended to political duties at the same time. Who ever heard of her children suffering from neglect? Her eldest daughter, we, are glad to be able to add, "is interested in the woman question, and entertains advanced ideas upon it, as well as on social, educational and theological subjects." If women of influence become interested in these subjects, opposition to the enlargement of woman's occupations will be as powerless, as opposition at the present day to any fashion that originates among the crowned heads of the Old World.</p>
                        <pb n="252 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>The love of a mother for her child, is one of the strongest instincts God has implanted in our natures, and he who thinks a visit to town-house two or three times a year is going to destroy it can have but little faith in the laws of God.</p>
                        <p>It is believed, or professed to believed by some, that the quiet and retirement of domestic life is conducive to virtue in woman, and that mingling with the world will have a tendency to mar the purity of her character. This idea originated as far back as the days of the Grecian philosophers. The wives and daughters of the philosophers, heroes, and legislators of Greece were kept at home with no companions but children, slaves and pet dogs. They were taught in the two branches of education believed to be necessary to woman, obedience and embroidery. But there was in Greece another class of women, who disregarding the laws which prohibited the education of virtuous women, were learned in science, arts and philosophy. Sages forsook their homes to spend their time with these gifted women, and advised with them in matters of law and science. But in the course of time, intellectual development, being confined almost wholly to this class of women, became a sign of moral degradation, and man hastily adopted the idea, that ignorance and seclusion were necessary to virtue in woman.</p>
                        <p>If the mothers and wives of Greece had had the opportunities of these outcasts of society, they would have, been the companions of their sons and husbands, and kept them from the degradation into which they fell, and Greece would have presented to us a different history. Many of the present ideas regarding woman have descended as directly from pagans, as the custom of making holes in the flesh in which to attach ornaments, has descended from savages. Both are equally common and absurd.</p>
                        <p>Men who would be shocked at the thought of woman's mingling with legislators to help make laws, have no uncomfortable feeling at seeing them whirl around the ball-room, encircled by the arms of these same legislators. If they have no fears in one case they certainly need have none in the other. Do we consider the wives and daughters of New England less virtuous than the wives and daughters of the Turks, who are kept at home or veiled from the gaze of men? There is no half way course. If retirement is conducive to woman's virtue, then the Turk is right and the New
<pb n="253 The Consequence of Woman's Learning the Alphabet."/>
Englander wrong; if, on the contrary, mingling with the world developes wisdom and strength in woman as well as man, then the New Englander is right and the Turk wrong. Man has no more right to limit woman in her intercourse with the world, than she has to limit man, and reasonable men will admit the truth of this.</p>
                        <p>There is the question of labor and its remuneration in connection with woman. Labor does not degrade woman as we are sometimes told. It never degrades any human being if it is not carried to excess. It is idleness and half pay for labor that brings the degradation. When a woman leans on fashion and amusements to kill time, it is like a canker worm, destroying that which is just, true and generous in her nature. Idleness is a great destructive power to the <sic corr="nobility">nobilty</sic> of womanhood. Girls as well as boys should be brought up to feel that they have something to do in the world, and should be educated with reference to their work. No girl should be taught, either by precept or example, to believe marriage to be the object of her existence. Too many, from this idea, form unions from mere mercenary motives, and never know the joys that flow from a union of heart and soul, but often the bitter cup of repentance stands before them filled to the brim, and neither honor, wealth or fame can keep it from their lips.</p>
                        <p>To a true man or woman marriage is too sacred an institution to be trifled with. Some of the best women go through life alone; for except they meet one whose tastes, sympathies and affections are in harmony with their own, they will not venture within its sacred precincts; and as the circle of woman's influence enlarges this feeling will grow stronger. Man will not always be able to look about him and select a true and virtuous woman, without being true and virtuous himself. When woman has more extended views of life and character, she will doubtless be as exacting towards man as be is towards her, and he will then come up to her standard of manliness.</p>
                        <p>Whenever woman does the same work as man she should have the same pay. A <sic corr="traveler">traveller</sic>in Switzerland writes about the degradation that labor brings woman, stating that "no difference is made in general labor between man and woman, excepting that the men receive higher wages than the women." This tells the secret of the degradation. Whenever woman labors side by side with man and
<pb n="254 The Woman's Advocate."/>
receives the same compensation, she is his equal, as in literature or art. Our publishers and editors do not ask whether authors are men or women; they pay what the work is worth to them, and in these departments, woman stands an equal chance with man. In the ordinary occupations of life she has no such opportunities. A few years since, a report of a school committee in the vicinity of Boston, suggested that the town economize by employing female teachers, as the work would be done just as well and at much less expense to the town; thus trying to save taxation at the expense of woman's work and, strength because of her sex. Surely the suggester of this plan is worthy of a name among the pagan philosophers. Does not woman, we ask, need the ballot to protect herself from her male friends who now profess so faithfully to represent her at the polls?</p>
                        <p>We are told again that Christian faith is all that woman needs to elevate her. If it is all that woman needs, it is also sufficient for man. The wants of the human soul are the same whether male or female. Faith is an important element in the character of every human being--a faith that lifts us above the cares troubles and trials of life--a faith that enables us to feel the hand of a kind and loving God in every event of life, however dark it may appear at the time. Man and woman alike need faith and trust in God.</p>
                        <p>There has been too much sophistry about man's head and woman's heart. The man who cultivates his head alone, becomes cold, selfish and calculating, and looks upon the generous impulses that flow from the heart as unmanly. The woman who cultivates heart alone becomes weak, and is driven about by every living impulse without regard to reason. God intended that both man and woman should cultivate both head and heart and when these are in an active state of development, we find in both sexes the same loving, noble and generous impulses guided by justice and reason.</p>
                        <p>Man can reach as much higher above woman, morally and intellectually, as his advantages are higher. Nature's laws are fixed. Thorn bushes do not bear grapes, neither do weak-minded women bear strong-minded men. As Lycurgus looked after the health of the Spartan women that their sons might be strong physically, so the son's mental strength is alike dependent upon his mother.</p>
                        <pb n="255 The Consequence Of Woman's Learning the Alphabet."/>
                        <p>Men have instinctive admiration for women who show marks of intellectual strength and sound wisdom, notwithstanding their professions made to the contrary. When woman drops the toys of fashion and raises herself to a higher plane of thought and action, when she can minister to the intellectual as well as the physical wants of home life; when she is man's companion, in all the relations of life; when she can counsel and advise with him, as well as amuse him in his idle hours; when men and women can, mutually lean on each other in times of trial and affliction, and when by their united strength they can keep the tempter at bay; then the love and admiration which woman will awaken in the heart of man, will lift him with herself above the baubles of life, to higher, purer and nobler aims; and the race will progress in true and harmonious development, with a rapidity which can never be hoped for while the sexes are divided by petty jealousies and rival interests.</p>

                        <docDate>NO. V. MAY, 1869. VOL. I </docDate>
                        <docAuthor>M. E. J. Gage</docAuthor>
                        <p>IN the March number of THE ADVOCATE is an article entitled "WHAT DO WOMEN WANT?"</p>
                        <p>The author, W. J. Linton, says that Woman's only specific claim, among many generalities, is, "Suffrage;" and that "the main talk--almost the only talk--is of the ballot;" a cry which he deems unfortunate because he "believes the Woman Question means more than this."</p>
                        <p>Thirty years ago the great Baron Von Humboldt said "Governments, religion, property, books, are nothing but the scaffolding to build up a man." This remark strikes at the root of all reform, and in a limited manner shows what is Woman's demand; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> opportunity for development. What woman demands, is not this, or that, or the other right, specifically and solely as a woman, in order that she as a woman alone, may there be recognized; (although that has a collateral bearing) but she demands that all distinctions shall be removed in order that she may find room for development.</p>
                        <pb n="256 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>She claims for herself the widest opportunities in work, in education, in the family, in society in, government, in religion. The word "Woman's Rights," as applied to the demands of the women of the present age, was an unfortunate misnomer, tending, as it does, to mislead those among mankind who never see to the depths of a proposed change, and also to prejudice those other short-sighted individuals who do not see that widening the opportunities of one class, or of one individual, enlarges the capabilities of the race.</p>
                        <p>Woman is an integral part of humanity. There are no man's rights; there are no woman's rights; all rights are human and belong to man and woman alike, by virtue of their existence as human beings. It has been well and thoroughly shown by the advocates of this reform, that rights are eternal; that they cannot be created by any individual, sect, party, or government, and that they do not cease to exist, when unused, let the reason of that unuse be force, inclination, or what it may.</p>
                        <p>Woman needs opportunities no more than does man, no less than does man.</p>
                        <p>It is but a short time since man as man, earnestly demanded opportunities for himself,  either social, political, or religious. The divine rights of kings occupied men's thoughts more than did their own. Now, in all civilized countries the struggle for human freedom goes on. Woman desires freedom in order to become what she has the innate power of becoming.</p>
                        <p>She is a living, growing organism as much as is a tree, and like that tree, she needs room and freedom. A tree planted close beside a stone wall, cannot grow upon the side next to the wall. Sunshine and air may meet it upon the opposite side, its branches may put forth in one direction, but the stone wall prevents its becoming a tree of symmetrical proportions.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the same of humanity; in whatever direction repressed, religious, governmental, social or family, in that direction the soul is dwarfed. People demand the overthrow of those restrictions which press the hardest upon them. Religious liberty was demanded by the Scotch. Political liberty was fought for by our revolutionary sires. Social equality is the need and the demand of the Turkish women of today.</p>
                        <pb n="257 Opportunity of Develoment."/>
                        <p>As each human being possesses a triplicate unity in himself, so does he possess a triplicate interest in those about him. First, comes the family into which every one enters the world as a member; second, is society of which he is also- perforce a member; and third, government, under which he also emphatically belongs.</p>
                        <p>In each of these three institutions every human being has an interest, and a natural right to assist in framing.</p>
                        <p>Those three institutions, family, society, and government are his only three sources of life, of happiness, and of liberty in this world.</p>
                        <p>Whatever is of benefit or of injury to a person, that, a person has an interest in, and a right to concern himself about. The family interests me; I am an integral part of it, I have a right to share in its management, accordingly as it is well or ill managed I am happy or miserable. The family is responsible for my growth, as it concerns me, I have a right to a concern in it.</p>
                        <p>So of society. The customs of society affect me, I am made happy or miserable by them. I am in fact, part of society, therefore I am concerned in society; I came into the world not only as part of a family, but as part of society, and therefore I have a natural right to a voice in society.</p>
                        <p>I was born under a form of government and under it I live, therefore government interests me; government concerns me; for upon government, more than upon society or the family, depends the security of my life, the preservation of my liberty, and my chances of happiness.</p>
                        <p>The government bases not itself on force, neither is it founded upon intellectual ability alone. The science of government is the science of morals, or rather the science of morals is the science of true government. Woman more than man belongs to the great moral era of the world, whose dawn we see rapidly breaking.</p>
                        <p>The women of China are not members of the family, they are the slaves who wait upon their lords and eat after those lordly husbands, and their male children; yet even in China is woman demanding for herself recognition as a human being.</p>
                        <p>To ask of a Turkish husband after the health of his wife, is an undying insult, yet the women of Turkey, with a party to back them up, are to-day demanding social recognition.</p>
                        <pb n="258 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>The women of England and of America are members of the family, they are members of society, they help make the laws of society, they help make the laws of the family, they are integral portions of each; both the family and society influence their growth, but no more than does government, yet in government they have no power. The ballot is the stone wall upon one side which prevents their growth in that direction; it is the Alexander between them and the sun on that side, and like Diogenes, all that women ask of the world is to stand out of their light.</p>
                        <p>The true end of all living is development; human beings are but a promise of what they may be, the family is the unit of society, the unit of government, but the individual is the unit of the family. Upon exact justice to the individual, rests the firm base of the family, society, government.</p>
                        <p>The right government of the individual is to be found in no human ordinance, but in Divine law. Religion addresses itself to the individual; religion is a law of restraint--the rule of justice to the individual. All human governments base themselves more or less on individual restraint, and the nation or the person that governs the individual self most fully, is the nation and the person best fitted to rule, and that the least need governmental restraint.</p>
                        <p>Woman more than man, is fitted to wield the helm of government, is fitted to make laws for the government of others, is fitted for the ballot, because she more than man has for ages past ruled herself by moral, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> religious law. Not only for her own growth, but for the growth of the world, it is necessary that she take part in the political organizations of the day.</p>
                        <p>We may look forward with an eye of prescience and in the remote future see a time when human governments shall have come to an end, but our duty lies not in the contemplation of that happy period. We belong to a period of the world's struggle; our opportunities and our duties lie with the world as we find it, and women as human beings have inherent rights to share in all the duties of the world, in all methods of the world's progress, because in these duties, in these methods, lie developing powers.</p>

                        <docDate>NO. V. MAY, 1869. VOL. I </docDate>

                        <p>IN common with most of my countrywomen, who have cherished any love for the arts, or an appreciation for the struggles of genius, I had for years, regarded the name of Harriet Hosmer with profound veneration. She was a great soul emerging from the trammels of custom into the liberty of righteousness, and all that I had ever read of her genius and daring as a girl, or seen of her skill as a sculptor in after years conspired to make me admire and reverence her.</p>
                        <p>One fair, bright August morning, in 1868, my wish was gratified, and I stood in the presence of Harriet Hosmer. But I was all unconscious of my privilege. It was the Sabbath day. In the confusion on board the little steamer, <hi rend="italic">Rose Standish,</hi> which plies between Boston and Hingham, laden with passengers, who enjoy gliding amid the green islands of Boston harbor, my baggage had been deposited at Hull, some seven miles or more from my Sabbath home in the ancient town of Hingham. The express-man, failing to deliver it to me, rode first to Boston and then to Hull, and finally came back to Hingham with my bag, thus affording me the privilege of exchanging my gray traveling suit for a pulpit dress of black, and, what was of far more consequence, furnishing me also with the sermons over which I had spent some warm and weary hours, "burning the midnight oil" in the most improper season of the year, because of the pressure of editorial labors by daylight. With no little satisfaction did I prepare for church, and with a serene sense of duty well performed, did my parishioner, (who had <sic corr="traveled">travelled</sic> more than forty miles that morning, in behalf of his woman-pastor), sit, breakfastless, in his pew, and listen to my remarks upon the text, "I shall be satisfied when I awake in thy likeness."</p>
                        <p>When the service was over, a gentleman said to me, with an air which one might have in announcing the presence of a royal guest, "Miss Hosmer was here to-day."</p>
                        <p>"What, Miss Hosmer?" I asked, for I had not dreamed she was this side of Rome, whose marbles--Beatrice and Zenobia--were a petrified inspiration. It needed but a second more to flash the fact, into my
<pb n="260 The Woman's Advocate."/>
mind that my little flock, in being not forgetful to entertain strangers, had entertained one of the angels of my young life unawares. She had come, and gone, and I had not even known her presence. Was there a providence in the fact that as I wove the warp and woof of my sermon, I illustrated the divine unrest which induces effort, by the labors of artists to attain their ideals? Not dreaming of her presence I had not been hampered in my remarks on that point, and the marvel is that I did not mention her name as a familiar example, of which, being one of my own sex, was especially proud.</p>
                        <p>The Sabbath hours passed on. At last--
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <l>"It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded red sun</l>
                              <l>Sinks down behind the azure hill</l>
                           </q>
and, with kind friends, I rode upon Nantucket beach and sought for the famous woman sculptor. She was domiciled at the Rockland House; had been rambling on the beach, enjoying--
<q direct="unspecified">"the deep twilight's purple charm,"</q>
perhaps recalling--
<q direct="unspecified">"the sunny skies of Italy,"</q>
and on her return greeted me with a friendly cordiality that won my heart at once, if indeed it needed to be won. She said she was about to write to me, for women who preached sermons, and women who sculptured marble ought to know each other. And then we had, in her far-aloft little room, such a chat as I had hardly dared desire, but which was delightful, and will live in my memory forever. Her strong, sweet spirit blessed me with its utterances, and the aroma of that hour, spent in communion with Harriet Hosmer, remains with me still as a benediction.</p>
                        <p>A few days after I received from her a note in which she wrote words that other women ought to read, and I gladly give them here, trusting that I violate no confidence in doing. She says, referring to the ordination of Rev. Wm. Garrison Haskell at Marblehead Mass., in which Rev. Olympia Brown and myself were to take part:</p>
                        <p>"On Monday I saw a notice of the ceremony which was to take place yesterday, and I only wished that circumstances had favored my being present, and while reading I could not but think, what a country mine is for women! Here, every woman has a chance, if she is bold enough to
<pb n="261 Harriet Hosmer."/>
avail herself of it, and I am proud of every woman who is bold enough. I honor every woman who has strength enough to step out of the beaten path when she feels her walk lies in another: strength enough to stand up to be laughed at if necessary. That is a bitter pill we must all swallow in the beginning, but I regard these pills as tonics quite essential to one's mental salvation. That invigorator was administered to me very plentifully by some of my brother artists on my arrival in Rome, but when the learned Doctors changed their treatment and declared that I did not do my own work, I felt that I must have made some progress in my art, otherwise they would not have been so ready to attribute that work to one of their own sex. You have the advantage there, for no one can say you do not preach your own sermons. But in a few more years it will not be thought strange that women should be preachers and sculptors, and every one who comes after us will have to bear fewer and fewer blows. Therefore I say I honor all those who step boldly forward, and, in spite of ridicule and criticism, pave a broader way for the women of the next generation."</p>
                        <p>Such words as these were very encouraging to me, from one I so respected, and I doubt not they will encourage many women who may read them. At the close of her letter Miss Hosmer made a fitting reference to the efficient President of the Illinois Woman Suffrage Association--the eloquent speaker and brilliant writer, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore of Chicago-which I cannot forbear quoting. Miss Hosmer was just then starting for the West, and so she said in closing:</p>
                        <p>"I hope I shall see you again at no distant day; meantime, I hope to see Mrs. Livermore, who is a general in the field, or rather, field marshal."</p>
                        <p>Both of these women have already done a great and good work for their sex, and have not yet paused in their enthusiasm or their efforts. Long may they both be spared to gladden the hearts of their friends on earth by their inspiring presence, and to bless the sex which has such reason to be proud of them! I regret to say they did not meet, after all, for Mrs. Livermore was visiting at the East, when Miss Hosmer reached Chicago, and--enjoying what she afterwards described as a crowning joy of her life a view on a clear day from Mt.. Washington--Mrs. Livermore wrote (but, let me mention this as a fitting tribute from
<pb n="262 The Woman's Advocate."/>
grand soul to another)--that she would willingly have relinquished the visit to the White Mountains for an interview with Harriet Hosmer.</p>
                        <p>During the past winter another brave and cultured woman Lorenza Haynes, (a sister of Warden Haynes whose work on Prisons is attracting much attention) while lecturing in my pulpit upon the physical training of girls, referred to Miss Hosmer as an example of one who was properly trained. With my friend's , permission I quote her words, knowing they will be of interest to all who love and honor the woman artist of whom she speaks:--</p>
                        <p>
                           <text id="wa1.532" n="Letter from Lorenza Haynes">
                              <body>
                                 <p>"You are all, I presume, proud of our celebrated young countrywoman, Harriet Hosmer. Who has not watched the developing of her genius with national pride? Indeed, she is a little American institution, that reflects honor upon us at home and abroad, not only as an artist but as a woman.</p>
                                 <p>"You probably know that her mother and only sister died of consumption, and that Hattie was a puny child. Her father was a sensible man, as well as a learned and skillful physician. He knew his only chance to save her life was to allow her the freedom which the breezes, the brooks, the birds and the boys enjoy. As she grew strong by her open air sports, he gave her a horse with which she commenced those daring feats that to-day render her one of the best and most fearless riders across the Roman campagna.</p>
                                 <p>"The beautiful Charles river, which laves the banks of my home, after coursing two miles, kisses the margin of her childhood's home. She swam in its waters, rowed her boat in them, and skated over their frozen surface. Then she had her workshop in which she made footstools and carved boxes. Her shop became a studio and, in it she modeled her first work of art. Thus was her life saved, and her health strengthened to put her thoughts in marble--thoughts as pure and beautiful as the spotless marble in which she embalms them.</p>
                                 <p>"When she, went to Rome and entered the studio of the celebrated sculptor, Mr., Gibson, to become his pupil, he said, 'My dear little fellow' (his pet term
of addressing her) if you mean to apply yourself to art, I fear you will have to 
give up your riding or it will take too much of your time.'</p>
                                 <p>"After inquiring at what hour he would be at the studio, she told him she would rise at four o'clock and have a gallop for an hour or two over the campagna and be at the studio as soon as he. This practice she continued for years, and her teacher had never occasion to discourage or regret that health-giving exercise.</p>
                                 <p>"Before leaving America she had received a diploma from a medical college
<pb n="263 Harriet Hosmer."/>
of St. Louis for her attainments in the study of anatomy, a knowledge of which is very important in modeling the human form. While she was Mr. Gibson's pupil he sometimes gave anatomical lectures to Art students. At the close of one, when Miss Hosmer was the only woman present, 'a sweet little man' stepped up to her and said, 'I could not help blushing at some parts of the lecture, but I noticed, Miss Hosmer, you did not blush.' Her only reply was to close her strong little hand and allow the blushing cheek of the modest youth to hit it, so effectively that he found himself lying at her feet. Then placing her little hand in the open palm of her dear old master she walked away, and left the blushing youth to pick himself up amid the laughter of his brother-students. Womanly words would have been wasted on such a person; she met him with a man's argument, and then <hi rend="italic">gave him the floor.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>"Although she can chastise one who insults her, she is not masculine in mien or manners; her heart is pure and womanly, just and generous. Having spoken of her physical ability, it is but just I should say something of her mental activity. A gentleman, who has known Miss Hosmer from her earliest years, told me that when passing a winter in Rome, an English gentleman whom he met there wished to be presented to her. Accordingly Mr. B---- invited the English gentleman to accompany him to one of her receptions. She appoints certain times when she receives visitors at her studio, to avoid the frequent interruptions to which she would otherwise be subject. I think it was one of her studio receptions which the gentleman attended. Twenty or more persons were present on the occasion referred to, and Miss Hosmer, by her wonderful conversational powers, her fund of anecdotes and ready wit, was charmingly entertaining. She kept her visitors pleased with themselves and delighted with her.</p>
                                 <p>"'After we left,' said Mr. B----, 'my English friend said to me--"That young countrywoman of yours is a very remarkable person."</p>
                                 <p>"'Yes,' replied Mr. B----, 'she is a fine artist.'</p>
                                 <p>"'Oh, yes,' said the other, 'she is very <hi rend="italic">very clever</hi> in her art, but I had reference more particularly to her conversational talents. I have seen most of the celebrated women of my time, but I have never before met a woman who could so agreeably entertain friends and strangers. Great as is her genius as a sculptor she is even greater as a cultivated woman.' That was the Englishman's opinion. It is a correct one, and with all this I believe her heart is the best part of her.</p>
                                 <p>"Suppose Dr. Hosmer had tried to rear his bright little girl on the superfine proper principle, where now would be those exquisite productions of her genius which have excited the admiration of two hemispheres?"</p>

                        <p>When the ballot is given to woman, and her place as a citizen fully acknowledged, there will be less sneering if she seeks faithfully to do that for which God has fitted her, whether usual for women or not. Meanwhile, and always, let every true woman acknowledge that the sex owes much to the pioneer footsteps, and successful industry of such noble souls as Harriet Hosmer.</p>

                        <p>TRUTH is of no sex. Republicanism embraces the whole of Humanity. Humanity is man and woman. We recognize differences between the sexes, but no inequality. All of humankind are equal before God.</p>
                        <p>The rights, <hi rend="italic">the means for duty,</hi> which we claim for men, we claim for women also: liberty and equality--that is to say--<hi rend="italic">equal freedom,</hi> as the ground for the organization of society which we understand by that word Republicanism. How freedom shall be used by women is not a subject for man's dictation, any more than the use which men shall make of freedom is to be prescribed by woman. Many duties only weakly attempted by slavish men are well fulfilled by freemen. Doubtlessly when women are free they too will be found more capable of duty. it is too soon yet to fix the limits of human capability.</p>
                        <p>We are still far from the knowledge which might enable us to draw up a table of human duties--classified as "man's" and "woman's." What part woman should take in legislation, how far she should be the educa-
<pb n="267 Woman."/>
tor, in what capacities an actor--of all this, we know little yet. For we have refused to learn. We have off-hand assumed the superiority of man, and built all our systems upon a partial theory. So the very foundation of society is at fault.</p>
                        <p>Only when men and women, the component parts of society, shall conjointly rule the social order, when the equal enlightenment of both, and the conscientious accord of the intelligence of both, shall be brought to bear upon the great questions of social government,--only then may we hope for a state of society in harmony with nature and the beneficent destiny of earthly life.</p>
                        <p>Woman's is the emotional, the poetic nature; man's is the logical and practical. What we endeavor to express by Celt and Saxon is precisely the womanly and the manly: the two halves of human nature. Humanity is not perfect till each half is perfected: in the same way as a human being is not perfect, unless, if a man, that being has also some admixture of womanly qualities; or if a woman some admixture of the manly. The grandest-natured man is the practical man fulfilled also with the poetic energy. He is not merely masculine. He is womanly too. He is a Milton, or a Mazzini. Humanity has there a perfect type: only the manly nature is predominant. The grandest woman, again, is not the most feminine, but she whose emotional poet nature can become also practical; one in whom the womanly soul is dominant, but who can also dare and do.</p>
                        <p>During the rougher ages of the world the masculine has been supreme: not however without continual protest, not only on the part of women; but also on the part of men themselves. Women were the most sacred priests of Vesta even in manliest old Rome. And our rude masculine Saxon ancestors could find it in their hearts to, believe that the soul of woman was nearer than the soul of man to God. In the gentler future for which the sternest warriors pray, even with fiercest battle prayers, at the stake, at the gallows, or in exile,--in the gentler future of our republic, those protests of old time will bear their fruit; the vague ideas of younger days will become clearly practicable; woman will take her equal place as the free sister of free man, and the heaven on earth, like the heaven of the olden poets, have its goddesses as well as gods.</p>

                        <p>It is indeed the vision of our Republic. For it is at no half-revolution that-we would stay our hopes. Henceforth, as political change must lead. to social so the social change must be as thorough as the political. No mere adjustment of the relative positions of rich and poor, master and servant, shall satisfy the reformer, but the readjustment of all the relations of life, not omitting the greatest of all. Our aim is the organization of society--the whole of society--, not only a half. Society has not yet been organized.</p>
                        <p>It is idle to talk of the inferiority of <hi rend="italic">woman.</hi> Of the inferiority of enslaved women to freed men there can be no doubt. No doubt also of the inferiority of enslaved men to freed women. The free, whether men or women, have hitherto been but few. Women fewest perhaps: but if so, the reason is obvious.

woman's worth. Scarcely is there any capacity in which woman has not signalized herself. Fierce warfare and statesmanship and intellectual genius have found their exemplars in women. From Jael, who slew Sisera, to the heroines of 1848-9, from Zenobia to Elizabeth Tudor, from Aspatia to Madame Sand, women may stand forth and challenge the comparison.</p>
                        <p>Are these exceptions to the law of womanly capacity? Give free room for even exceptions! "Strip off the parasitic forms, that seem to keep her up, but drag her down!" But they are more than exceptions; they are protests and indications. Appeals against your dictum of inferiority. "We will show you what we can do even in your own walks." Indications of <hi rend="italic">power,</hi> which will be healthily applied (even if it be true that there is unhealthiness in the exceptional nature seeking an exceptional development) when your parasitic conventionalities and rules of inferiority permit the equal freedom which is the first necessity of health and growth.</p>
                        <p>Leave native power free to grow in accordance with the great laws of being. Do not presume that you know all a woman can or ought to be. No! not even all a man can be. How many even of the noblest men, and so by their own nobleness enabled to judge of the nobility of others,--how many men have read in the beloved eyes of woman the whole secret of a perfect womanly nature? The few so favored by God will be the first to preach the gospel of woman's redemption. Symbolical of all life is that fine story of the brave true-soul'd mother of Raffaelle, who broke through the conventions of her time to suckle her angel-boy; and who so inspired the greatest of artists to show the world <hi rend="italic">he Mother and the Child.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Who among women asks to make women <hi rend="italic">such as</hi> men? "We ask but room for our distinctive growth." But it remains to be shown that the many assumptions of manly proprieties are true to nature. Is religion a matter confined only to man? If it is to be believed by women shall it not be also preached? Nay, the priestess is no innovation. The prophetic is especially the womanly spirit. And if the education of the future men is to be entrusted to women during the most important years, is it so improper for women to understand, to help to make, and to carry out, the laws of education? Will you make laws of marriage and deny
<pb n="270 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the woman's right except to obey and suffer? Will you make laws of marriage, and ask no woman to teach you what is virginity, what chastity, what love? Nay, man can but see the half of the marriage question, when he knows all these; and our manly legislators--let them pass! true marriage will not be the rule of the world till woman too may speak, through our institutions, and in all her relations, by word and life, as Edm&#x00E9;e spoke to Mauprat, teaching the savage the true reverence for woman and for himself.</p>
                        <p>The equality of man and woman in society is but a logical deduction from our republican principles. Woe to that "Republic" which shall forget or neglect this! There will be no vitality in it: but a falsehood at its heart, gnawing it to death. Half-republics are as abortive as half-revolutions. It may seem very strange at first for women to care as much as men for the wholesome ordering and godly rule of that society in which they are only as much interested as men. It seemed as strange at first when poor men called themselves priests of God and so by divine right the equals of the kings of earth. Young Truth is indeed a stranger. Let her abide with us and be of our family.</p>
                        <p>And again--this equality of woman is but the completion of the equality of Christianity, as yet not fully carried out as regards men. Not carried out, but acknowledged: it is only through some subterfuge that tyranny over man can find its justification now. The equality once proclaimed is certain to be at length realized. Proclaim the equality of woman also: the completion of Christianity, upon which as upon a sure foundation, the world shall build the republican temple of the Future. </p>
                        <p>This is indeed the inner doctrine of Christianity. And for the sake of those who care for the mere Scriptures rather than for the religion itself, it is worth noting that, whatever nonsense may be talked by intolerant Paul in his Epistles, the Gospels admit no inference of the inferior nature of woman. Evidence of the inferior condition of women in those times; but no commendation of the division of human society into two classes, of superior-males and inferior-females. Human beings are God's equal children, their spirits equally divine, their duties equal, their right to the means of duty,--freedom, opportunity and growth,-- also equal, their origin one, their God-ward destiny the same. In the Gospel

myth the Holy Spirit descends first upon the woman, and by women the glorified Christ, the type of Redeemed Humanity, is first beheld and worshiped. Deep in the heart of the old Catholic superstition, stupid and corrupt as that old superstition has become, has lain through all ages the faith in the divinity of woman: the Woman, as the Mother of the Saviour, enthroned on high above Apostles and Martyrs and Priests and Princes and Principalities and Powers--the Woman, whom the painter has revealed to us--with the majesty of man bowed down before her, bearing in her arms the Divine Child, the angel of the regenerated earth.</p>

                        <p>"A DOLL is not a woman; a toy is not a woman; a poor drudge, with all thought driven out of her, is not a woman." The words of Mrs. Howe in her address before the New England Convention have been practically illustrated to my mind during the past week. A number of the friends of the "cause" have been circulating petitions for Woman Suffrage, in this city (Springfield, Mass.) and also soliciting subscriptions for THE ADVOCATE. The writer chanced to call at a few residences in a locality claiming to be aristocratic.</p>
                        <p>Some were too much engaged to see me; others could not imagine why any woman should wish to vote. It was in vain that I offered Beecher, Curtis, or John Stuart Mill. They had no time to read such things, I was informed, and the embroidery needle was applied with redoubled exertion to make up the time already lost in listening to a subject so unimportant.</p>
                        <pb n="272 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>When I turned away from those doors I said, Surely these are the "dolls" and "toys" of which Mrs. Howe speaks--not women--and therefore utterly unworthy to take any part in this great Cause. An hour afterwards, a woman came to my room with my week's washing. It occurred to me that, as I had already seen two of the class who "are not women," here an opportunity was afforded me of testing whether a third should be included in the same category. (She was an American woman, and one who had had many sad experiences. Accordingly I asked her to sit down and rest a moment. I then told her something about the effort we were making to secure suffrage for women. At first she shook her head and said women were not good enoughh to vote, but when I took THE ADVOCATE and read "Looking Back" by Frances D. Gage, the sympathetic tears stood in her eyes, and she said she should try to save money enough to take the book, she would love to read it.</p>
                        <p>Need I tell you which had the better claim, those children of wealth, or the worn toiler, to the title of woman ? Readers of THE ADVOCATE, we have commenced this work in earnest and mean to leave no stone unturned, but by our continual asking to weary the unjust judges until they shall grant our petition. Sisters, we may not sit idle longer, while inward fires consume us. Those who have climbed the steep and thorny ascent before us, making sure paths for our feet, will soon be worn out in the service and ready to exchange this life for the higher, deeper broader one in the presence of God, where there is neither male nor female.</p>

                        <p>A FOURTH peculiarity of Christianity is its estimate of woman. This is the measure and the test of every religion; its idea of woman, and its treatment of her. The level of spiritual life in a man, or in an age, is to be measured by its ideal of woman. The spiritual and moral possibilities of the future lay in the relative placee which shall be accorded to woman in the coming time. Christianity is the only religion which has ever conceded to Woman the place that God ordained for her; and Jesus was the great teacher of Christianity.--<bibl>

                        <p>THE editor of the <hi rend="italic">Boston Commonwealth,</hi> who never loses an opportunity to say a friendly word for woman, has, besides a good editorial on Woman Suffrage, the following item in his paper of April 10th:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>Many married women in this State are now doing business on their own separate account, and have employed in their business a large amount of property, which may be attached, or taken upon execution, by creditors of their husbands, unless a certificate has been filed in form and manner specified in the following section of chapter 198 of the acts of 1862:</p>
                           <p>Section 1.--Any married woman now doing or hereafter proposing to do business on her separate account, shall file a certificate in the Clerk's office of the city or town where she does or proposes to do said business, setting forth the name of her husband, the nature of the business proposed to be done, and the place where it is to be done, giving the street and number of the place of business, if practicable; and whenever the place of business or the nature of the business is changed, a new certificate shall be filed -accordingly. In case no such certificate shall be filed, such married woman shall not be allowed to claim any property employed in said business as against any creditors of her husband, but the same may be attached on mesne (mean) process by any such creditor, or taken upon execution against the husband of said woman.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>This is a provision to enable a married woman to do business in her own name, and a positive gain upon the old status when a husband was entitled to all his wife's personal property, to the life-use of her real estate, and to her daily service to the end of her life.</p>
                        <p>The unspeakable humiliation of her present position will be apparent if we insert the words "married <hi rend="italic">man</hi>" in the above statute, as follows: Any married man now doing, or hereafter proposing to do, business on his separate account, shall file a certificate in the clerk's office of the city, or town, where he does, or proposes to do, business, setting forth the name of his wife, the nature of the business proposed to be done, and the place where it is to be done, giving the street and number of the place of business, if practicable; and whenever the place of business; or the nature of the business, is changed, a new certificate shall be filed accordingly. In case no such certificate shall be filed, such married man
<pb n="274 The Woman's Advocate."/>
shall not be allowed to claim any property employed in said business, as against any creditors of his wife, but the same may be attached on mesne process by any such creditor, or taken upon execution against the wife of said man. </p>
                        <p>The civilized world would justly despise men who would quietly consent to such degradation:--but from a "lower deep" are married, women brought up, that upon such terms, they may be legally entitled to the product of their own brain and bands. Do women have all the rights they need?</p>
                        <p>This is not all. A married woman in Massachusetts may own property of any kind, but she can make no conveyance of any stocks, or dispose of any real estate, (except to rent a house for a year) without the written consent of her husband. If the husband have deserted the State, or is in the State prison, during such imprisonment or desertion, the wife can sell and convey her property as though she were sole. When the deserter returns, or the prison gives up its tenant, her right to convey or dispose of her property vests again even in such a husband. Th slave needed the written consent of his master to enable him to go anywhere. The wife in Massachusetts must have the written consent of her owner, to enable her to make a legal disposition of what is her own. Do women have all the rights they need? But the laws of Massachusetts as regards the property of married women, are much better than in many other States. </p>
                        <p>In the District of Columbia, a wife can hold property only through trustees, and all the products of her mind or hand belong absolutely to her husband. In Massachusetts, a married woman can make a valid will of some portion of her property without her husband's consent. In some other States, where the common law prevails, the husband can revoke his consent to the will of wife, at any time before the will goes to probate, an her will becomes null and void. </p>
                        <p>A married woman cannot be guardian of a child, not even of her own. A widow may be a guardian of her children. But if she marry again, her guardianship ceases. This is true in every State, except Kansas and New York. In all the States except these, no married mother has any legal ownership of her children. The custody of the
<pb n="275 Married Women in Massachusetts."/>
child belongs to its father. The law of New Jersey, on this topic, copied from Nixon's Digest, page 915 sec. 9, is as follows:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>Any**Father,***whether he be of age, or not, may,**by his deed executed in his lifetime, or by his last will,**dispose of the custody of his child, born, or to be born,**and such disposition of such child, or children, shall be good against the child's mother, or every other person or persons; and if the mother, or any other person, shall attempt to recover custody of such child, or children, she or they shall be, subject to an action for ravishment or trespass.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>Thus a minor, who cannot legally give a deed, or make a will of any <hi rend="italic">property</hi> whatever, may, by law, both deed and will away the child from its mother whose God-given right to it the law absolutely annuls. And this atrocious law is in force in the District of Columbia, in the Territories, and in nearly every State in the Union. Only an unmarried mother has a legal right to her children.</p>
                        <p>There is cause for gratitude in the fact that many States are hastening to put away these relics of more barbarous ages, and to return to woman's hand the right to protect herself in every relation. There is reason to hope that Massachusetts will retain her historic pre&#x00EB;minence, and be the first to recognize woman's right to the ballot. Her present Legislature promptly referred the petitions for women's suffrage to a joint special Committee, which twice gave ample opportunity for the petitioners to be heard for their Cause.</p>
                        <p>Both in and out of the Legislature, many eminent men are known to favor the measure, while the most influential papers in the State are on its side. Last, not least, the women, with Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, President of their Woman's Suffrage Association, are earnestly espousing their own cause. It must succeed.</p>

                           <docDate>NO. V. MAY, 1869. VOL. I </docDate>
                           <p>FOUR months ago--a venture upon the sea of journalism--we issued the first number of THE ADVOCATE.</p>
                           <p>Bearing the imprint of no great publishing house; unheralded by the announcements deemed so necessary at this day to the success of any journalistic enterprise; not covered even by the prestige of an illustrious editorial name, almost presumptuous even to ourselves seemed the undertaking. But we were profoundly convinced that a publication such as we proposed should be established; a cry throughout the land went up for it; thoughtful men and women pledged us their pens and countenance; the "harvest" seemed awaiting the laborer, and, although knowing well the risk, we gave misgivings to the winds and began the work.</p>
                           <p>Taking now the retrospect our brief editorial life furnishes, we have nothing but pleasurable emotions at a success surpassing our most sanguine expectations. At every step, beset at first with difficulties, we have been blessed with ability to remove all obstacles from our path, and more than make good our pledges to the public. A generous press has been prompt to acknowledge, by notices and every fraternal courtesy, our mission; writers of breadth of thought have opened their treasure-houses, freely tendering their best for our pages ; a wide circle of sympathetic friends have caught up our banner, bearing it over New England hills or Western prairies, until THE ADVOCATE, as a child of love, has entered into so many hearts, and so many generous responses have thrilled ours in return that all sense of anxiety has been lost in the full measure of success accorded it. To make a parade of the testimony borne our labors has been no portion of our purpose; we only feel the additional desire to increase, as the best possible requital, the excellence of our pages and, with the arrangements we have made and the im-
<pb n="277 Editorial Department."/>
proved facilities at command, we feel warranted in stating that THE ADVOCATE, hereafter, in the variety and character of its contents, will, in no respect, less merit the kindness that has hitherto been accorded to it.</p>
                           <p>Looking beyond individual exertion to the Cause itself, we have none the less reason for congratulation. Even within the brief period of Our own existence, three or four journals, specially devoted to the enfranchisement of Woman, have been established to meet the wants of their respective communities; the press have accorded the question an increasing measure of good will; conventions too numerous to mention have agitated it, and, in the legislative bodies of half a score of States Woman Suffrage has been pressed by such earnest and eloquent advocates as LUCY STONE, WENDELL PHILLIPS and others to a hearing or a vote with results carrying conviction of a speedy triumph. Indeed, in Rhode Island and other of the New England States our friends are sanguine of a legislation conferring Woman Suffrage within the year; and more sober thinkers, whether men or women, regard the measure as only a question of time, and in this age of ours events move with a rapidity hitherto undreamed of. Courage friends! it is no dream of a visionary, a Republic democratic in practice as in theory! Not alone the child is born, but gray-haired patriarchs live, who will see every  legal disability removed from Woman, then a portion of the body politic of our regenerated government, knowing no distinction of COLOR, RACE, or SEX.</p>

                           <p>THE Publisher of THE ADVOCATE hereby offers a prize Of ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS for the best Story bearing upon any of the phases of the "Woman Question;" FIFTY DOLLARS for the second best, and TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS, for the third best;--the MSS. (not to exceed 100 pp., nor to be less than 50 pp., of THE ADVOCATE) to be. submitted in season for award and use by June, 1869. All writers entering into competition for the prizes must direct to the Publisher of THE ADVOCATE who will retain the names, handing the inclosed articles to a Committee, (to be later announced) who will decide upon the different MSS., purely upon their merits. While each article will be regarded as the property of the author, and strict confidence be preserved, respecting them, it is

                           <p>The <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Independent,</hi> in a recent editorial on the monthly meetings of the Radical Club, Boston, says: "There is one thing in which agree--viz., that the presence of cultivated, quick-witted woman gives a spice and zest to conversation such as no dinner-table talk of men alone can attain, however gifted be the talkers. In fact the steady refusal of this large circle to remove from Mrs. Sargent's crowded parlors into a public hall would seem to show that the whole affair is but a French <hi rend="italic">salon,</hi> and owes much of its continue success to the energy and magnetism of one agreeable woman.

where in the country has never been told. 'The boys' habitually, resort to her for advice, and the 'old Governor' was accustomed to hold her judgment in the highest esteem. Her counsel to the old firm of A. &#x0026; W. Sprague have been transferred to the new house, and have proved as beneficial to her sons as to their father and their uncle. She is now an old lady Of 70 years, but her faculties are as vigorous as ever."</p>
                           <p>Twenty-one members of the Pennsylvania Legislature have put themselves on record as in favor of extending suffrage to women on the same terms as it is now exercised by men. <hi rend="italic">The Bucks County (Pa.) Intelligencer,</hi> of the 13th ult., one of the most liberal journals in that State, commenting on woman suffrage, says: "A bill embodying this principle was voted on last Thursday for the first time, we believe, in the history of Pennsylvania. Sixty-five of the members, however, were so illiberal and ungallant as to vote against the proposition, for which act they will no doubt be called to account by their wives and sisters when they get home. But it is really an encouraging thing to know that there are twenty-one men in our Legislature who are ready to meet and accept the coming revolution."</p>
                           <p>Among the women of England who have cast a luster on literature, and who by their breadth and liberality of thought have powerfully assisted in creating the present sentiment there in favor of woman suffrage, may be mentioned the venerable Mrs. Mary Somerville, of whom the <hi rend="italic">Springfield Republican,</hi> in a recent issue, says</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Mrs. Somerville, who is now in her 88th year, is an advocate for woman suffrage, though she can hardly expect to live to vote in England, where she was. born. Nearly forty years ago this remarkable lady published her first great work, 'The Mechanism of the Heavens.' It is a translation, or summary of Laplace's Mecanique Celeste, and was completed four years after the death of tile great astronomer. In 1834 she published 'The Connection of the Physical Sciences,' which was followed by the 'Physical Geography,' and other works. She has all along been in the vanguard of human knowledge and scientific investigation. It is said that mathematics never presented any difficulty to the mind of Mary Somerville, and the physical sciences, which are based on the great primal laws of mathematics, she as readily mastered. Other distinguished women who favor the same side are George Sand, who has written a long letter in favor of woman suffrage, woman physicians, and woman preachers, addressed to Mdlle. Raynouard, a French lady, now lecturing in the provinces on woman's rights; and Mrs. Mundt H. (Louisa Mublbach), who will shortly publish a pamphlet on suffrage and woman's rights. It will be entitled 'The Historical and Political Mission of Woman.'"</q>

petitions of the Winter were referred to a Joint Special Committee who have given the petitioners two hearings:--Wendell Phillips, Julia Ward Howe and Lucy Stone were heard in March, and April 14th a second hearing was granted the Rev. James Freeman Clark, and the Hon. Geo. F. Hoar, Representative, in Congress from Massachusetts. Mrs. Howe said gracefully, that as the bass and treble were necessary to harmony in music, so the masculine and feminine influences were necessary in government. She paid a pleasant tribute of respect to the earnest spirit of the Western women, who are seeking civil and political equality--and concluded by saying her speech must be an amen, to the speeches of Mr. Phillips and Mrs. Stone. This last lady showed that by the theory of our government every adult, save citizen convicted of crime, is rightfully, entitled to vote; that republican institutions are impossible while mote than half the people are disfranchised; that in Massachusetts there are 62,000 more women than men, who are subject to a masculine minority; that the laws of Massachusetts though greatly improved still show how much women as a class need to protect themselves; that national safety is more endangered by the disfranchisement of women, than by that of any class of men, black or white. Of the very able presentation made by Mr. Phillips we will present a synopsis next month.</p>

                           <p>STUDIES IN GENERAL SCIENCE. By Antoinette Brown Blackwell. 12 mo., 356 pp. Price $2.25. New York: G. P. Putnam &#x0026; Son, Publishers.</p>
                           <p>That this volume is the work of an American woman, and one endeared to the liberal public by a prominence before it as a gifted speaker, is the least of its merits. The pioneer work performed by Mrs. Blackwell, both in the Woman's Rights Movement, and in the pulpit, where she was a more than ordinarily effective preacher, prepared the public for work breathing purity of tone and loftiness of purpose, but the rare literary merit of the volume is at once a surprise and welcome treat even to the admirers of her late admirable essays. Condensed in statement, it yet discusses in a style of almost conversational simplicity, topics of great import which this generation has taken from the study and the professor's desk, and which are becoming ever more familiar to our daily thought. They are indeed the facts which underlie our faith, our civilization and reforms. In this connected and related world all facts bear the impress of one origin, and all their

roots are found within the universe itself. What attraction, what startling light is thrown upon the vital questions of the source and aim of life, the nature of mind, the character and ways of God!</p>
                           <p>Dealing with such themes, these "Studies," though to some extent abstruse, are of absorbing interest to thinking men however diverse in their opinions and bent of mind. The physicist and the psychologist, the statesman, physician, reformer, moralist and theologian, each in calm conference with very searching kindred thought, will find in these compact and lucid essays quickening suggestions of great interest and value. The first chapters present the metaphysical basis of Mrs. Blackwell's philosophy, but any reader of ordinary intelligence, can follow with ease its amplification and application to the many phases of physical, mental, moral and social interest with which the essays deal.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Blackwell says, "These essays are a summary of the conclusions arrived at after a lifetime of more or less steady devotion to the subjects under consideration. *** While the earlier studies were hindered by duties few women attempt to shoulder" (as pastor of a church and lecturer) "the later ones were impeded, perhaps in both cases I should say aided, by duties which no man ever performed--those which devolve on the mother of a young family, all of whom are still in childhood."</p>
                           <p>But notwithstanding these drawbacks, if such they were, the work gives no evidence of any want of continuity of thought.</p>
                           <p>Our limited space forbids a comprehensive statement of the philosophy of this book, but as a key-note to its drift and conclusions, we quote a few sentences from the "General Statement:"</p>
                           <p>"Force has been determined by science to be as self-existent and indestructible as substance, and force, it is evident, could be nothing except realized in and through substance. * * * * Energy may be self-existent, but a definite system of correlated interchangeable modes of energy, sentient as well as unsentient, coordinating thoughts, feelings, purposes and all possible living personal experiences with all the other modes of force and capacity now co-operative in the universe, is necessarily created, and, as it seems to me, it may be shown to be so from an intrinsic rational or intellectual necessity. * * * * The properties, modes and processes of matter are all found to be rigidly quantitative and the action and reaction among them is always exactly equal; so that they all exist and act strictly according to the mathematical principle of precisely so much for so much. The properties of matter are all therefore <sic corr="strictly">strictily</sic> mechanical and there is evidence that they are also unsentient or simply and unconsciously mechanical. The properties of mind on the contrary are all held to the sentient or living prop-
<pb n="284 The Woman's Advocate."/>
erties. * * * * Sentient properties are modes of sensations, perceptions, thoughts, purposes, self-determinations; and though these sentient modes never ignore or contravene the laws of the unsentient, to which they are allied, yet they have, in addition, co-ordinated laws and principles of their own of a wholly unlike higher character. * * * * * * * *</p>
                           <p>"Thought has been applied to things, and each atom whether matter or mind, is allied to its own immutable properties with their wide diversity of co-ordinated modes and processes, which are forever turning and overturning but always developing more fully the pre-established order of things; moving molecules, moving worlds, quickening minds, developing races, lighting, warming, evolving, organizing, animating, ennobling, developing: till the result is before us--the physical and mental universe, one and harmonious."</p>
                           <p>We enumerate the suggestive titles of some of the most intensely interesting essays of this thoughtful book: "An Eclectic Development Theory," "Immortality," "Law and its Sanctions," "Social Progress," "Nature of the Creator inferred from the Creations."</p>
                           <p>The attractive exterior of the volume is due to Messrs. Putnam and the Riverside Press. For the conscientious research, calm discrimination and clear precise language, as well as for the keen intuitions and wide deductions which brighten and ennoble "the Studies," we are under obligation to Mrs. Blackwell alone. We predict that the number of her appreciative readers will constantly increase, and that this book will long hold a favorite place in the estimation of the public.</p>

                           <p>There lies before us a slender volume, which, although eliciting appreciative notices from a few discriminating critics, has never attracted the attention which the rare merit of its verse entitles it to receive from the public.</p>
                           <p>A Briton by birth, Mr. Linton, to a thorough knowledge of his subject, brings the most intense aspiration for that liberty "which knows not realm nor birthplace," but is the common heritage of humanity; and fortunate indeed would it be for "Erin" if every champion of her cause possessed the clearness of vision, the realization of her needs, evinced by the author of the above blending of verse and prose. As a specimen of the thoughtful character of Mr. Linton's muse, which must not only be read but studied to be fully appreciated, we subjoin the following poem:

                        <p>IF you have spent a winter in the gay Prussian Capital and circumstances did not favor a Court presentation, you need not treasure it as a life-time regret, for even had you been so favored you doubtless would have remembered it only as a <hi rend="italic">stage scene</hi> wherein you were an actor;--your <hi rend="italic">role</hi> that of turning like a weather vane, so as never to be found with back turned upon His Majesty, or Her Majesty, nor any of their shining satellites. Ay, you would always shiver, though the dog-star were at the height of his watch, when you recalled the hours of anxious waiting, in those marble halls of the palace,--<hi rend="italic">"unter den linden,"</hi>--for the coming of Royalty. Representatives from all Nations, with picturesqueness in costume, characteristic of many nationalities, graded according to rank, in double column, reminding one of an old-fashioned country spelling school--with less to encourage, for there merit took one to the head, but here, the index finger of fortune always points each to his place. At last their Majesties are announced with their royal suite, and there is a universal rustle of silks and satins, as trails, with the modest measure of three yards length, which have been held upon the arm, are spread. Stately and erect, the old king moves along, nodding his head to right and left, while his affable queen smiles, and courteously bows in passing by her guests.</p>
                        <pb n="290 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Such are some of the salient features of a Court presentation--of which we did not think to tell you--but of a entertainment, in our judgment, far more regal--an evening at a German Professor's, which you may well regret all your life, if you have not enjoyed. To be Professor in a German University does not always indicate that the man is possessed of unlimited wealth, though he is often rich in contentment and in the enjoyment of a little. We are acquainted with but one of the Faculty of the Berlin University who owns the house in which he lives, and he had the good fortune to become possessed of it through his wife. You need not have come from the <hi rend="italic">Hub,</hi> neither have written a book, nor have been in Congress, to gain admittance into the charmed professorial society of Germany. If you carry a letter of introduction to one family, or if a friend present you, you are pretty sure to find your self a frequently invited and welcome guest. When once invited to come in familiarly to tea, it means that you are at liberty to go in any evening, when a cup of tea or coffee, a plate of sandwiches, or a basket of mixed cakes, are passed to you, and father, mother, sons and daughters add to the pleasure of a social evening. There is interesting conversation, there is music, to which all listen; there are games--everything is cheerful and agreeable, with no stiff hedges of formality to leap over. Usually during the winter each professor gives one or more large party. It is to one of these that we will now present you.</p>
                        <p>It may be seven, not later than eight o'clock, when all are assembled. The folding doors are thrown open; the large, double parlors become one. Studio, and library, all the nookeries, sacred to study, are open, and give every facility for social duets where the <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi> of young peoples' voices becomes musical in the Teutonic as well as in the Anglo Saxon tongue. The shining waxed floors are as much of a terror to us as was a pond of ice in our childhood days, upon which we had studied the constellations, and we count upon the possible, if not probable, consequences, before we venture to slide across them, and when the mazy dance begins, we never cease to wonder how they whirl like tops, and still maintain their perpendicular.</p>
                        <p>Out host is perhaps the brightest luminary in the professorial galaxy. He is not only master of his own abstruse kingdom, but his broad, clear mind comprehends other realms of thought, and his ear catches the voice
<pb n="291 An Evening at a German Professor's."/>
of humanity. He listens, be waits, and hopes for the enfranchisement of all mankind from the thraldom of tyranny, of ignorance, and of superstition. The students all feel that they have in him more than a preceptor, a friend, an adviser. He tempers the impatient Radical who thinks he cannot wait till to-morrow, for that which he knows justice demands done to-day. Into the mind of the sluggish Conservative he infuses new life by inspiring him with the importance of right directed influence. Royalty has proffered him a title, but he sees in it only an empty name, and prefers to stand allied to the world only in his manhood.</p>
                        <p>And what of our hostess? She greets you with a cordiality that makes you feel at home in her presence. She is very plain in appearance; her flaxen hair, divided into two braids, winds twice around her head. She wears a drab silk, that we doubt not was her wedding gown twenty-five years before. Its style is in keeping with that time. She wears no ornaments; you feel that she is all she seems, a cultivated, unassuming, natural woman. How she converses with this guest in French, with that in English. She knows the noted authors of each country by their works. Although the world is not cognizant of it her thought has blended with that of her husband in his writings. She has reared sons and daughters to honorable positions in society. Weekly she gathers into her home a class of poor girls, whom she instructs in ways of usefulness; and in the joyous Christmas season, hundreds of hearts are made glad by the needed things she puts on their scantily hung Christmas trees.</p>
                        <p>There are present those whose names are known in all lands. B----, the quiet, medium-sized, dark-faced, stern-browed African traveller:--we try our best to turn conversation into a channel that will give his thoughts free flow; we only get responses to our interrogatories upon African scenes and experiences; but something turns the conversation to an American battle-field; his face lightens up; his lips are unsealed, and many are the pleasant words of earnest sympathy he speaks for our country. Professor L----, who might have been the original for that magnificent statue of Aristides, carries you away captive, whenever he tells you of his explorations in foreign lands. He spent years of his first manhood among the nomadic Arabs, that be might make their language his own, thus getting access to ruins untrod, with inscription
<pb n="291 The Woman's Advocate."/>
before unknown to the civilized world. Mrs. R----, whose pen has enriched American as well as German literature, he friend of G&#x00F6;ethe, and almost the last living link in that literary chain which binds the past to the present;--receives the homage of young as well as of old. Germany calls her its most talented daughter, and America is proud to claim her by adoption.</p>
                        <p>Sir Charles and Lady L---- were the honored guests of the evening. To meet with two such noble specimens of humanity, atones for the hundreds of their countrymen with whom one comes in contact, who sail under the banner of <hi rend="italic">High Pretences</hi>--failing "for a' that" to be true men and women. The clouds were dark over the American horizon at that time, and yet they were full of hope and good cheer for our future. They were among the few who, having been in America, could rise above prejudice and preconceived ideas, and discover in the multitude of crude material, elements for a powerful nation, with an intelligent, cultured civilization.</p>
                        <p>The Crown Prince, with a frank, manly expression of face, and a military bearing, came to pay his regards to Sir Charles and Lady L----. In his conversation with the latter, to which we listened, he said, in English as broad and pure as if a born cockney: "I suppose you speak our language--the German--with fluency, since you have been so long in the <hi rend="italic">wilds</hi> of America."</p>
                        <p>To which she replied, "I speak your language readily, having learned it in Germany when a child, but during my residence in America I neither saw the uncultivated regions of that country, nor heard the German language often spoken."</p>
                        <p>There was present a Countess and a Duchess; talent, titles and wealth had their noted representatives, and yet, there was a simplicity of externals astonishing to an American eye. You did not feel that weeks had been squandered in preparation for the occasion. It was not a rival dress parade, but a social gathering, where mind met mind, and was elevated by the contact. The supper was served <hi rend="italic">&#x00E0; la table d'h&#x00F4;te,</hi> with a varied round of courses interspersed with lively, merry conversation. There were wines for those who drank them, but no withdrawal of the ladies to give the gentlemen an opportunity for indulgence in a

                        <p>A CERTAIN domestic animal more admired under his Norman name by which he graces the table, than under his Saxon cognomen which gives a symbol, vigorous but not elegant, for stubborn beastliness, has a trick of cutting his own throat when he gets beyond his depth, by the sheer awkwardness of his swimming. Without applying the more offensive features of the comparison, or attempting to make the figure "go on all four," like the beast himself, I must say I have been forcibly reminded of the porcine style of natation in the efforts of some of our astute opposers of Woman Suffrage, who, wallowing much beyond their ability to touch bottom, have, struck out for the shore of an adverse conclusion with the genuine suicidal stroke of the great. Ham-burgher.</p>
                        <p>"Woman should not have the rights and franchises which men have in the State, because they are not men, they have a nature essentially <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than the man's, a different sort of soul, in which every faculty, though called phrenologically by the same name, is really a different development of mind, feminine in the very reason, memory, art, poesy and passions. The woman is religious in a way of her own, she hates and loves with a distinct specific modification of the same passions in man, and were we wise in the marks of differentiation we could distinguish an original mathematical demonstration produced by a woman's mind from a kindred solution by a man. I state the position strongly, more strongly than many of its advocates, but not beyond the demonstrable truth. I have seen something of a faculty called Psychometry, by which a sensitive person can read character by simple contact with any scrap of writing which may be had; and in the hundreds of experiments, with sealed and blank envelopes covering the writing, I have never seen a single failure to determine whether the writer were a man
<pb n="294 The Woman's Advocate."/>
or a woman. The feminine nature marks the most trivial act of a woman, and her sex never forsakes her. If she should transcribe the Multiplication Table, a Psychometrist though in a dark room, would know that the scrap containing it wag written by a woman's hand."</p>
                        <p>Now, because the objector has caught at a grand truth, in his protest, and one still deeper and broader than he was aware, I have given it a fuller statement than his own; for a blow that must recoil so fatally on his own head may as well be made as strong as the truth will warrant. Observe the logic. Because woman is so different from man--man shall do the legislating for her! Her nature is peculiar, therefore a man knows exactly what it needs! She is a distinct self, and hence should not be allowed to have self-government. God gave her every pulse and feminine attribute, and for this cause her heart must beat only under masculine law! Did a swimming pig ever cut his throat with more celerity?</p>
                        <p>Who gave you an insight to know what fits a nature different from your own, and to know it better than the possessor of it? Can a congress of horses be presumed to know the wants of a herd of neats cattle? Will a fish devise just laws for a bird; and shall our venerable cat, Thomas, legislate for the little colony of chickens in the yard? He would find it legal to gobble up one now and then, as man-legislation has devoured widows' houses.</p>
                        <p>A clergyman has, by long use and study, a widely different way of looking at things, from a layman's. He has peculiar tastes, peculiar opinions, a peculiar stand-point from which to view life and duty. Therefore, oh Sapience, let him be disfranchised. Disfranchise the sailor; he lives in a different world from ours, he walks with a roll like a big sea; he talks a lingo that our parlors cannot understand. We'll make laws for him.</p>
                        <p>In short, while you are about it, disfranchise everybody but Number One, for everybody else is peculiar, different in tastes, habits, feelings, from that grave Ego wherefore that unique specimen is the only proper person to make laws for these diversities, variety being a ground of incompetence.</p>
                        <p>Strictly speaking Number One is as different as Number Two and the rest. Between unlikes it would take a philosopher to say which is the dis-

similar one, and therefore which ought legislate for the other. Men are not women, they have peculiar natures, therefore women ought to make the laws that govern them. What hinders treating gander to the sauce that is good for goose? The simple truth is a government cannot, be Representative that disfranchise a class. If for their crimes it says that State's prison graduates shall not vote, that is a mode of punishment and the State may as justly inflict that as any other; but to inflict the same disgrace on half the community, the most pure and humane half at that, is an outrage as gross as the defense of it is absurd. Because woman is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> man, because she has a purely feminine mind and heart we assert that man is not competent to do her law-making. Just that peculiarity of soul which makes her a woman, makes her the only competent person to draw with precision the boundary of her rights.</p>
                        <p>Society is a chemical compound that losing the feminine element would be crude, rude and barbaric in spite of culture. The State is another compound, from which the feminine element has been largely rejected, with just the result that would occur in society--having become so corrupt, in the estimation of our opponents, that it would be a disgrace to a virtuous women to mix in its affairs. Such a result would have been impossible if woman's peculiar nature had always had expression there. The State needs woman more than woman needs the franchise, and she needs the franchise as much for her own culture an growth as for her protection and freedom.</p>

                        <p>TYPICAL differences seem also to exist in the mental natures of the two sexes. Such a distinction has been largely insisted on as an argument for keeping women within their proper spheres. Instead of allowing woman to develop any peculiar gifts which she may possess, free from conventional restraints, a predetermined sphere has been marked out for her, and she has been rigidly enjoined to keep within its precincts. Granted the fact of her peculiar feminine gifts, this obviously is a direct argument in favor of her developing all her powers untrammeled and finding for herself her own level in society.--<bibl>

                        <docAuthor>C. Clark</docAuthor>
                        <p>SEEING one evening the announcement that a celebrated minister was to preach on one of the questions of the day, I went to hear him. There being no new ideas in the discourse, all of his Points having been expressed before, better and more tersely by others, my attention wandered, when suddenly my ear caught the following words delivered with startling emphasis: "And now, we will speak of <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> that interesting branch of our fellow creatures!"</p>
                        <p>I listened eagerly for what was to follow, hoping to receive some enlightenment in regard to that vexed question "woman," or, at any rate, to be informed how many <hi rend="italic">branches</hi> there were of which women were one, and what the trunk from which all sprung; but alas! no information on these points was vouchsafed to the many twigs of "that interesting branch" who filled the house--only wearisome platitudes on woman's sphere and duties were dinned into ears already satiated with the tedious iteration.</p>
                        <p>Now, being but an average twig, one of many, a unit among the countless thousands of women who, quietly minding their own affairs find their position or "sphere" in life, their capacities, their wants arrogantly prescribed for them, with never so much as a question of what they would choose, or what they think of their own capabilities or needs, I beg leave to speak.</p>
                        <p>Laying no claim to being a "strong-minded woman," not because I would not be if I could, but because both physical and mental calibre for that position is wanting I yet indignantly protest against the silly twaddle, written by so-called "weak-minded women," attempting to portray what women,, as a class, desire, suffer and accomplish. A really "weak-minded woman," would not be able to write the articles so signed, and it is reasonable to conclude after reading them, that they are the result of some man's careful pondering over that enigma "woman," and his opinions of what women ought to feel, and would write, if they were capable of expressing themselves. Does it never occur to men that we should prefer to be let "alone;" that there are subjects more in-
<pb n="297 An Average Woman."/>
teresting than their ideas of how we should keep house; how much we should spend on dress; what our amusements ought to be; what should satisfy our "inner nature;" what books we should read; and how we shall best tutor ourselves to meet their approval?</p>
                        <p>Perhaps a little of their superfluous advice and spare time might be employed to advantage in teaching other men--if they, the advisers, need none-how to curtail their expenses; bow to, take heed to their amusements; how to purify their "inner natures" and make themselves more worthy of the adoring devotion women are expected to bestow.</p>
                        <p>Women do not pretend to be sages, but neither do they wish to be ranked as fools, incapable of reasoning, judging and acting for themselves, made only for foolish petting or contemptuous ignoring.</p>
                        <p>Articles have appeared from time to time, treating on women and their supposed capacities and wants, among them one, signed "A weak-minded woman," purporting to be from one who desired ardently to write, but in consequence of the harassing petty cares of daily life, could not find time to fitly express her burning thoughts and so took refuge in feeble plaints over hopes unfulfilled. Every one can imagine the article, for scores of them have appeared, being always convenient stop-gaps in empty columns.</p>
                        <p>Some other articles, giving advice to the unfortunate woman, I should like to say a few words about. One of them tells us that "the weak-minded woman is one of many, and their name is legion;" that women as a rule cannot keep house and hope to write and if they will look into "some inner chamber of the heart," there will be found a hand-writing that time would be better employed in deciphering, instead of attempting  original.</p>
                        <p>Now, that there are many silly people in the world, men as well as women, no one will deny, but pray don't put all the fools in one sex and make the other preternaturally wise. There are just as many Jacks as there ate Jills: for one of Nature's fundamental rules is equality.</p>
                        <p>As to the assertion, that women were only intended for the "home sphere," do people, who talk so glibly in this manner, ever realize what is necessary to form a <hi rend="italic">home?</hi>  A loving, courageous
<pb n="298 The Woman's Advocate."/>
heart, a wise, administrative head, capable, willing, helpful hands are not easily to be found, united. And yet women, who are adjudged. to be unfit for so-called authorship, which needs none of these qualifications, only a certain surface smartness; and for occupations, demanding only one of the two last are supposed "by instinct" to be capable of forming, controlling and guiding that small, but difficult to rule, miniature kingdom, a home.</p>
                        <p>It is the right training of heart to imagine, head to plan, and hands to deftly execute and carry out ideas which make a home either a heaven or hell on earth. Neither be heart, head nor hands can be neglected, and just so surely as we depend upon hands alone, as so many do, and cultivate their powers alone, so surely does the home lack that intangible something which makes it home. The obsolete idea that literary women must perforce be slatterns, needs no rebutting testimony; and the greater the cultivation, of a woman's powers, the greater the charm of her home.</p>
                        <p>Any one who has read Mrs. Dall's work "The College, Market and Court," for which all women should be grateful, for the time, energy, patience and skill displayed, in grouping together so many interesting and significant facts,--can no longer deny that there has been, and can be, nothing, from the hardest manual labor upwards, which we women have not done, are not doing, and cannot do.</p>
                        <p>To return to our author, we are asked "If the magazines will not publish your stories, it is a natural inference that you are not exactly, a <hi rend="italic">genius,</hi> is it not? Further, "It is sorrowful to see in what crowds women, married and unmarried, flock to the gates of authorship. Here and there you see them with white hands of command turning back the ponderous golden hinges, and entering in where the palms are and the crowns. Down below, they are turning away in great, sad groups, shut out."</p>
                        <p>Where, may be asked, are the gates of authorship? The writer only mentions two magazines, so if the portals through which their editors are reached, are the only gates, and if in those sanctums lie the crowns and palms, can we wonder that crowds flock to those doors?' Will not some one tell, "the great sad groups shut out," that perchance those are not the only gates, that some other "golden hinges" may turn at their knock.</p>
                        <p>Again, "Women have a mania for going where they are not wanted, and then complaining that nobody makes room for them."</p>
                        <pb n="299 An Average Woman."/>
                        <p>Who has a right to tell us where we shall, or shall not go? and what place can, there be where we are not wanted, if we have the capacity and desire to fill that place? If some with "white hands of command" may do thus also, how can anybody assert that our hands may not be able to do the same?</p>
                        <p>All these objections to women's writing amount to what? They certainly would seem to prove that the "writing" women should decipher, is either unreadable or unsatisfactory, and that they prefer to make essays of their own skill.</p>
                        <p>The magazines rejecting articles does not always indicate a lack of power in the articles or the writers, for we know there is a "ring" around the periodicals, and if the name of the writer is unknown, ten chances to one the article is returned, often without even a glance at its pages. And as to rejected articles showing the writers not to be <hi rend="italic">geniuses,</hi> may it not be asked do we want any more geniuses? 'Tis not they who decide the position of the world, but the common sense people, the average men and women of the day, and if the average men and women would come to the rescue, and write for us, readable and understandable articles, tales and books, leaving the geniuses to befog each other's brains with their Delphic utterances, Sphinx-like conundrums, introverted sentences, and word painting, the community would be greatly the gainer.</p>
                        <p>In a second article meant to be satirical, also giving advice to woman, the writer tells us that talking with her husband she told him: "John, I'm done writing forever." Would she had kept to this resolution; though we are sure the writer is a man endeavoring to simulate what he considers a woman's style. At any rate, the following information is given: that there are no women angels mentioned in the Bible; that the Bible doctrine is, that women should be second to their husbands; that there has never been a feminine Milton nor Shakespeare and never will be, and lastly that "we may hold office, but we never can be men."</p>
                        <p>Has the world ever produced more than one Shakespeare or Milton? Are they not unique and unapproachable? To tell women they must not write because they cannot become either Shakespeares or Miltons, is like telling a rose or pink they must not bloom because they will never, become a century plant nor a
<pb n="300 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Victoria Regia; or the rank and file of our brave army that they were of no account because they didn't show themselves to be Grants or Shermans.</p>
                        <p>As for the other remarks they can be  taken for what they are worth, that is as "stop-gaps" in an empty page.</p>
                        <p>We sigh over the Lost Arts, but though we cannot make Damascus blades, our Sharpe's and Colt's rifles do more execution. We may have lost the Syrian dyes, but our petroleum blues and purples are surely brilliant enough. We cannot mayhap work in brass, but iron is more to our needs, and yet we are losing an art, which once gone is gone forever; the art of writing terse, elegant English. One of the first things we learn at school, is that Grammar teaches the use of language, but would not one reading our light literature now-a-days think that Grammar was an obsolete study.</p>
                        <p>We have the "Cry of the Human," "The Cry of the Children," will not some one write for us, " The Wail of the Adjectives?"</p>
                        <p>Poor, tortured, misused words, forced from your proper spheres, and jumbled together in wild confusion, will no one be found to right your wrongs? </p>
                        <p>A few extracts, drawn from the writings of those, both men and women, who having found their way into print, have shown according to our author, that they have "hands of command," may serve perhaps to prove that <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> is not so much needed in our light literature, as average common sense, written not by those who are styled "masters of word. painting," but by average writers for average readers. What can be made of sentences such as these:</p>
                        <p>"The heights of futurity were foreshadowed in his forehead's marble dream."</p>
                        <p>"His low, dense, passionate forehead."</p>
                        <p>We all know what a dense forest may be, and what a dense intellect is, but a forehead "dense and passionate," must be a marvel. In a criticism of Miss Ingelow's poems, we are informed by competent authority that she has, "no such drowning surge of splendor, such weltering wealth of words as Mr. Swinburne has." This is welcome news, but will any one explain what a "weltering wealth of words" is? As long as adjectives are piled on, and the mouth is full, when trying to read of high sounding words, sense
<pb n="301 An Average Woman."/>
seems to be considered of no account, but how could one analyse or parse such sentences!</p>
                        <p>One more and I have done, though a volume of such like elegant extracts is beside me. Speaking of Ballanche, the friend of Mme. Recamier, a critic makes the following statement:</p>
                        <p>"His soul was an &#x00C6;olian harp, through which the music of the pre-historic ages played."</p>
                        <p>We have a dear friend, who has always said, that whenever she thinks of her soul; she imagines it looking like a dropt egg, but a soul that is asserted positively to be an &#x00C6;olian harp, through which such extraordinary music played, excites my liveliest astonishment. A different writer, speaking of music, says "he played fragments of Egyptian music, ancient as the Pyramids, and just as incomprehensible."</p>
                        <p>Now, if the music of that age is pronounced incomprehensible, and we have historic information of that time, what must the music of "pre-historic ages" (when exactly were they?) conveyed in the disjointed wailings of an &#x00C6;olian harp, which is we know capable of no connected harmony--be? Imagination fails, there are bounds that cannot be passed, and chords that refuse to vibrate.</p>
                        <p>Poor Ballanche! he deserves indeed pity, if added to his other defects he had such a soul, one like a dropt egg, would be of infinitely less annoyance to its possessor.</p>
                        <p>If these are the writings of those who have "hands of command," to turn back golden hinges, and are endowed with the "divine afflatus," might not average writers stand a chance of being acceptable to average readers of average minds.</p>

                        <p>"GAINSBORO will cure her of all her eccentric notions," quoth the wise one-and-twenty Frank. "Safely married to him she'll have no excuse to be 'strong-minded' any more." Safely married! This was the burden Of their jubilate.</p>
                        <p>Safely married! But in, the meanwhile how much lay between that time of security. As yet there could be no definite plans. In a year perhaps Mr. Gainsboro's income might be sufficient to hazard the beginning of a small home, for there was a talk of his getting some appointment as clerk connected with the law-courts, which without interfering with his profession would help to eke out the rather precarious subsistence which that afforded. But how many purposes fail in a year. How many new combinations spring up in life within a few short months, which make new measures and even new purposes necessary. At the end of this year instead of the little home John Gainsboro had planned so eagerly, there was indefinite postponement of all plans, and separation in place of companionship. For at the end of this year John Gainsboro was <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for Europe, an invalid in search of health. The accident of a boat upsetting upon a fishing excursion and a forced detention all night in a marshy district, had brought on a malaria fever, which left him in such a condition that a score of physicians united in one opinion--that his length of days depended on a sea voyage and a change of climate. Some easy consulship to one of the minor ports was found for him, where the salary would be sufficient to meet his personal expenses, and the duties light enough to be no burden. Anne bade her lover good-bye with a bright, brave face and cheerful words of hope, but at her heart there was a weight of foreboding. If we could look forward into the future we should find ordinarily that the perils we most dreaded passed by us, and those we did not anticipate took their place. Thus it was with Anne's foreboding. All her fears and anxieties just now clustered about the invalid who was sailing away from her in search of health. She felt the shadow of Death above and around her. She felt that loss and bereavement were to be her portion. But while she waited for the shadow to fall upon that one beloved head, the Angel entered at another gate. While John Gainsboro was slowly creeping back to life, with a distant prospect of health before him, suddenly, in a night, a new and entirely unlooked for sorrow befell, in the death of Mr. Hast-

ings. Misfortunes seldom come singly, and thus proved in this instance: for it was not only loss by death which the family were called upon to meet, but pecuniary disaster and discomfort. In the necessities and fluctuations of business it was found that a large property had been exhausted, and only a mere pittance left. What was to be done? Tom had his lieutenant's pay; Frank, just graduated from college, had only "prospects"--a chance in a counting room or an importing house, which opportunity this fine young gentleman, who had been planning a trip to Paris, loathed and abhorred.</p>
                        <p>But even then how <hi rend="italic">are</hi> we to live?" moaned poor little Mrs. Hastings. "We cannot stay here; and there will be house-rent and a servant's wages and all the rest out of just nothing at all!" Anne hearing these laments turned over in her active mind some way of help. She could see but one path before her. There was but one idea upon which her mind could fix, and tying on her bonnet one day she took herself and her idea straight to their old family physician, whom she thought most likely to help her to carry out this idea.</p>
                        <p>"What did you say, my dear?" he questioned, putting on his spectacles and peering curiously at her. That you propose to go out as a nurse for the sick, to earn your living?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, just that, doctor. I've been in the hospital now as a nurse for two years, and Doctor Dick will tell you I am peculiarly fitted for that work."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, I know, I've heard about it. I dare say you are efficient, but that wasn't what I was thinking of. Do you consider my dear what a step you are about to take? It's one thing for a young woman to go off on the high-heroics as a soldier's nurse, for that is a romantic fashion now-a-days, and another thing for her to hire her services out by the week at family nursing. There is a very different odor to this, and by no means the odor of romantic or fashionable sanctity. This is a species of labor half classed with what is called menial servitude. Do you see, my child, do you see that if you go out in this way that you, must enter a family not as you enter it now, but as a kind of servant?</p>
                        <p>I think Anne was never more completely roused in her whole life than now. Roused, not against the old Doctor whom she quite understood, but against the social state of things which she also understood, but which thus placed before her by another in actual words, struck her, as such things will, with all their vividness.</p>
                        <p>Yes, I see," she replied, "I see that women even in such legitimate occupations as nurse to the sick, are by this senseless society, this 'world' you talk to me about, crushed down and depreciated in such a way that it is made a difficult trial to take up what should be an honorable profession requiring refinement and

ability. I see that unless a woman has genius for some of the fine arts, unless she can paint, or write, or sing, she cannot earn her bread without losing her place and her prestige in this 'society.' She can stay at home and be a wicked and useless burden upon those who are already breaking under their load, yet hold her place and be a welcome guest in fashionable circles; but let her be an honorable woman and go out into the world as a worker, to help herself and others who need her help, and this 'society,' if it does not drop her at once, forgets her, or ignores her as out of its orbit, and she is from thenceforth looked down upon, and regarded as something apart from it. <hi rend="italic">Society!</hi> It has become a cruel, remorseless tyrant--a slave-driver to whoever will be driven; and the name of these is legion. I think one of the greatest charities, one of the noblest movements the world has ever seen would be that of a woman of wealth and high social position putting herself at the head of some active business--acting herself in it personally, as any man of business acts at desk or wareroom."</p>
                        <p>"Charity, eh?" remarked the Doctor blinking over his spectacles at his guest.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, a great charity. For don 't you see, sir, that such a woman would or could make the matter of active business for women, a fashion, and finally the custom, as it is with men?"</p>
                        <p>"My dear, the woman who would come forward and do that would be flouted at by nine-tenths of your amiable sex, as eccentric and strong-minded, or half cracked."</p>
                        <p>"For a time, perhaps, and by a class, but if the right kind of a woman did it--a woman of brain and influence, it would eventually accomplish great results."</p>
                        <p>"Well, I think you are right, my dear; and about this matter of your own, you are right to go on of course, but still I want to warn you that you'll find it difficult and disagreeable, and I should advise you to try something else--teaching, for instance," the old doctor returned, placidly but persistently.</p>
                        <p>"Teaching!" exclaimed Anne, scornfully. "Don't I know bow those ranks are overfilled? That is one of the few <hi rend="italic">genteel</hi> employments. But I have no gift that way, and so I shouldn't succeed honestly, and I wouldn't succeed dishonestly. As a nurse now for the sick I am confident of myself, and in no occupation could I gain such a competency, for you know, doctor, that a first-class nurse in the city can get twelve and fifteen dollars per week, besides her board."</p>
                        <p>The doctor laughed. "What a little shrewd Yankee you are, Anne!"</p>
                        <p>"Am. I? Well, I'm glad I am, for that is part of common sense. But Doctor there's a question I want to ask you. Isn't there needed at the present time a
<pb n="305 Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
better educated and higher class of women as nurses?"</p>
                        <p>"Undoubtedly. 'There is no physician but what would be glad to see real ladies with cultivated intelligences, and good judgment, enter upon this work.</p>
                        <p>So you see, my dear, that I merely raised the objections to this plan for yourself, out of consideration for your personal comfort. But I will now say, that if you have weighed all the chances for, and against, if you think yourself strong enough to stand up under a good deal, of pressure, I will aid you in every way I can; and I promise you, you shall not have lack of occupation. But there is your family, you know, what will they say to it?"</p>
                        <p>"It will be a blow, of course, but I must do something, and this is the only work I can do to really help myself. I understand your kindness in wishing to save me from its discomforts; but I think I can stand up under the pressure, as you call it. Perhaps, because I feel that I have the courage to do it, I am one of the somebodies set apart to lead the way. I hope I shall live to see the time when it shall be as much the exception in this country for women to be idle as it is now for men."</p>
                        <p>The Doctor laughed out again.</p>
                        <p>"I always knew you'd turn out one of the strong-minded, Anne. I expect to see you going in for woman's rights, voting and all, next thing."</p>
                        <p>Anne laughed a little herself here, and presently looking up, said demurely, "Perhaps you'll see me <hi rend="italic">taking</hi> my rights, as I propose to do now, Doctor."</p>
                        <p>"I dare say I shall," the Doctor answered, highly amused. But as he saw his young guest disappear down the street a moment after, he shook his head, and said aloud with a pitying accent:</p>
                        <p>"Whatever she takes that goes against the grain of that Hastings pride, she'll have to pay a heavy price for. That family of her's will worry her into her grave if she undertakes this thing."</p>
                        <p>Anne knew that she should meet with great opposition at home, so she was prepared for the storm of indignation, and tears and entreaties that met her.</p>
                        <p>"You might as well give up your engagement at once, if this is your plan, for John Gainsboro will never take his wife from the position you see fit to descend into," Julia cried out at her excitedly.</p>
                        <p>Anne's cheek flushed a little at this mention of her engagement, but she said quietly, though with repressed fire:</p>
                        <p>"If Mr. Gainsboro wishes to dissolve the engagement when he receives the news of my determination, I shall be quite ready."</p>
                        <p>"Then you never loved him, or you couldn't give him up for a whim like this."</p>
                        <pb n="306 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Anne caught her breath. Never loved him! But here was no use of going into heroics with Julia, so she explained very simply;</p>
                        <p>"It is no whim to me, Julia, but a necessity. We cannot all three of us live on the small income that remains to us now; and if Mr. Gainsboro thinks I can be unworthy or demeaned by any honest work which grows out of such a necessity then we had better part, because I should cease to respect a man who could have such a feeling."</p>
                        <p>But even while Anna declared herself thus resolutely, a great pang smote her heart. It is not so easy a matter for us to put ourselves into positions that will test our idols. No human being ever does it without shrinking from the ordeal. Remembering her lover's evident pride in her hospital career, remembering, too, his sympathy with most of her liberal ideas, she had scarcely questioned his sympathy with her present plan circumstances became known to him. But the Doctor's late words, and Julia's sharp suggestion, brought up a startling possibility. And in view of this possibility, with that tender fear which lurks in every loving heart, she began to soften her own judgments. She was wrong to say that if he did not sympathize with her, her respect for him would cease; wrong and very narrow. He had lived in a different world from hers: in a state of society much more English than American, where social prejudices concerning employments were inbred. How should she set herself up to despise him then, for some inherent tendency? But even while her heart pleaded for him thus, it was not as a possession. She never blinded herself for a moment to the fact that separation was inevitable if he took this ground against her purpose. Inevitable, because her mind had fully accepted the work she had proposed, as a necessity and a duty, not as a possession, then, did her heart plead for him; but as the idol and ideal of her dreams. It is not personal separation, by absence or death, that the high soul dreads most; it is the destruction of the ideal, or more really speaking, the discovery that we have been investing another with attributes from our own imaginations, and that there is no individual reality. This experience is for a time appalling in its effects, afflicting one with a kind of atheism. From the suggestion of this experience, Anne shrank back in sick dismay, and called up every imaginable excuse to avoid even the possibility of its truth. But the effort--the very fact of the need of this inward defense of him; proved her fear; proved that no defense could save her from the desolation she dreaded if Mr. Gainsboro took the position her sister suggested for him. Out of these conflicting emotions she wrote him a sad yet frank letter, apprising him of the change in their fortunes, and her proposed plan, and releasing him from his engagement if ho wished release.</p>
                        <pb n="307 Sister Anne's Vocation."/>
                        <p>The reply to this was characteristic of the man who had given up his South, 
that he loved because of her wrong-doing, and yet would never take up arms against her.</p>
                        <p>"Give you up, Anne?" he wrote, "what folly are you talking and what injustice are you doing yourself as well as me by this talk? If you were reduced to a street-sweeper I should not forget that you were a gentlewoman in the good old English phrase--a gentlewoman, and the woman whom I loved. No labor can assoil yon or affect my relation with you. But, at the same time, I do not approve of the course you propose. It afflicts me differently, however, from the way you suggest. I am not meanly subservient to custom or afraid of social criticism; but my pride and my love revolts at the injustice which will meet you from vulgar souls who will perhaps have you under their roofs and therefore under their power in certain ways from which yon cannot escape and in which you may be made to suffer. That labor should be dignified for women as well as for men I fully admit, but I do not believe in self-sought martyrdom, and I do not feel willing that you should enter upon it both for your sake and my own. The objections that your family raise, too, are to be considered for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> sakes. What society thinks is of less consequence to me than to most men, but to them, as to many, it is of great importance, and makes their happiness or misery. Even though you know this is weak yet out of your larger nature let your affection make you as willing to sacrifice something of yourself to them as to the beliefs which you have accepted. There must be other avenues open to you--teaching, for instance." Anne felt the first thrill of impatience here, but the tender words that immediately followed, the passionate outbreak of sympathy and sorrow--sorrow that his own right arm was powerless yet to save her, and hers, from every care put to flight any feeling of impatience. Altogether it was a manly letter, consistent and noble, not cowardly and subservient <hi rend="italic">as she had dared to fear!</hi> And her heart rose with a great throb of happiness as she read to the end; for her idol was worthy! But as she realized this, she realized too how much harder it was to do her duty against this idol who held his throne, than it would have been if he had proved himself unworthy the place. Her duty! What was it after all? Putting necessity out of the question--given that she could find other occupations, might it not be as he had shown--her duty to comply with the wishes and feelings of those nearest and dearest to her? As she thought this, leaning back in her chair, her eyes happened to rest upon an engraving from, Millais' picture--<hi rend="italic">"The Huguenot Lovers."</hi> When it first came into her possession, several years ago, fresh from the reading of the inspiring history of that time, she had written underneath the beautiful figures, the significant sentence--
<pb n="308 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <q direct="unspecified">"For conscience's sake."</q>
The blood mounted to her head, and her pulses quickened; and she seemed to hear a girl's voice saying, "If ever I am tempted to give up a principle for any cause whatever, let me look up at this and recall to mind how for a principle--for conscience's sake--one may give up even life rather than the principle, the conscience itself." Even life! and how many were giving that up now, were giving up life and love and home, for conscience's sake. How she had wished that she had been her father's son instead of daughter, that she might enter into the heroic stir and tumult of a soldier's career. To do something heroic!--that had always been the impulse of her ardent and aspiring nature. To do something heroic. And here it was given her to do. Here it was given her to serve her sex, the whole race of women, perhaps, by her example. Did that Huguenot lover consider that he had any right to give up his conscience for the wishes and feelings of those nearest and dearest? Did the men who fighting for a principle now, consider that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had any right to remain inactive at home because of the individual wisheS and feelings? But was the principle before <hi rend="italic">her</hi> mind so vital after all? It was not certainly like those others--a matter of life and death. It was not so immediate--ah, no! she would wait, she would wait, and perhaps, perhaps."--Thus she questioned and argued and temporized with herself, this poor Anne, who was so perplexed and troubled at home and abroad. In this perplexity she sought her old friend the Doctor again. She would try something else if he would help her, she told him. He would help her in any way he could, he replied with the inward comment as he looked at tired face:</p>
                        <p>"Knew they'd worry her into their way or into he grave."</p>
                        <p>The "something else" that suggested was the inevitable school-teaching, and, failing that, copying law-papers, or any other matter available. She was to go at the end of the week to see what he had found or her in these directions. At the end of the week this was the news he had for her: There were the names of <hi rend="italic">five hundred</hi> applicants already down upon the school-teachers' lists, with no chance for a single vacancy under a year. There was no better prospect at the various offices where copying was given out. They had already an over-supply of copyists for the work. As she heard this, a bitter wave rose over her spirit. How easy to counsel women what to do, and what not to do. How easy for one's friends to put up their fine feelings as a shield and a barrier, and to urge compliance to their tastes as a duty. How easy everything but freedom for a woman to choose where to earn her daily bread. Five hundred anxious, weary women waiting for a five hundredth chance of living, because of a corrupt society's false and wicked estimates! Five hundred, nay, five thousand, each

too cowardly in herself or in her affections to go forward and help to break these slavish bonds!</p>
                        <p>These were the thoughts that rushed over Anne in that moment. This was the bitter wave, that passing, left her, no longer bitter, but <hi rend="italic">lighted from within.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>PART FOUR.</p>
                        <p>There was a great party at Mrs. Merrivales the other night. The party of the season it was said to be.</p>
                        <p>"A little dull, you know, at first as these things are apt to be: bat after Mrs. Gainsboro came in we lighted up," said Col. Van Decker, who is authority on social matters.</p>
                        <p>"Mrs. Gainsboro?" in a questioning tone.</p>
                        <p>"Why, yes; it isn't- possible you don't know of Mrs. Gainsboro. Not to know Mrs. Gainsboro argues yourself unknown. Gainsboro <hi rend="italic">nee</hi> Hastings. Don't you remember that pretty piquante Anne Hastings, who went off as hospital nurse in the war, and then afterwards made such a sensation by turning her talents to account in private families--setting up a new order of things, or endeavoring to, by asserting in her own person and example that the care of the sick is a lady's profession. No? you don't know about it! but I forget you've been out of the civilized world, grilling alive in Bombay all these years; but come in here and I'll tell you the story;" and the Colonel button-holed his friend, and drew him in from the street to the little park they were passing.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, it's the greatest thing you ever heard. She went out as I have said, a nurse for the sick, into private families--made a regular business of it to support herself and help her mother and sister. They were very much reduced about that time by the death of Mr. Hastings, you see. Well, there was a tremendous sensation. Society--the society to which she belongs, that is--got up on its high heels in astonishment and dismay. It was done out of bravado! It was an insolent attempt to revolutionize the social order and mix classes! These were some of the things that were said. But the girl held her way. A few right-minded, sensible persons applauded and encouraged; but the right-minded, sensible persons, who see beyond their stupid noses into the real meanings of life, are always the minority in this world, so I suspect Miss Hastings 'way' was a pretty difficult one. But she proved herself a plucky little thing and kept on. The end of it was that she asserted herself and her plan, and made both respected and in a measure understood. She has done more than this, however. She has shown that young and active women of refinement and ability are absolutely needed to displace the superannuated ignorant class who have hitherto
<pb n="310 The Woman's Advocate."/>
tyrannized over sick-rooms and frustrated and set aside even the physician's orders. And she has shown too, that a lady may make an occupation what she pleases, and has thus opened the door of an honorable profession to thousands of her sex. Within the past few years she has trained quite a number of young women for nurses, and has recently organized and opened a training school, which she oversees herself. She knows her ground, you see--knew she was fitted for the work and went forward straight to success. Success is always successful to make an epigram--it always changes the hue and cry of abuse into acclamation at last. So it was in this case. And when the finishing touch was put by John Gainsboro's coming home to marry, her:--John Gainsboro, who was suddenly turned into a millionaire by the death of that old rebel, Gainsboro Shelby--why there was no height too lofty to enshrine Mrs. Gainsboro upon. I thought the other night, as I saw her surrounded by an admiring circle, one and another paying their homage to her, of the time when they would have hunted her down if they could. What is it that old Frenchman says?--'Society always stands ready to devour, either in rage or in admiration.' With equal readiness it will turn victim into a saint, or a saint into a victim, as the wind of popularity rises or falls. It had no power to make a victim of Miss Hastings, because her power was the superior, and so like all tyrants it turned sycophant to what it could not master."</p>
                        <p>"And John Gainsboro, he had his Southern notions spite of his liberality, I remember; how did he accept all Miss Hastings' innovations?"</p>
                        <p>The Colonel laughed. "Well, you may truly say, 'all;' and you will open your eyes when I tell you, that however it was when he was away, he came home to be converted by this little Radical in the most extraordinary manner. John Gainsboro at this day is a firm advocate and supporter of Woman's right to the Suffrage! What do you think of that?" The gentleman who had been grilled alive in Bombay, to use the Colonel's words, thought Mrs. Gainsboro must be a remarkable woman--"a dangerous woman," he laughingly exclaimed, "whom a man might well avoid if he had any prejudices to which she were opposed."</p>
                        <p>But let us say a word privately about John Gainsboro, reader, while Col. Van Decker and the gentleman from Bombay wander off upon other topics. When Anne wrote out to this lover of hers the statement of facts which threw her back upon her original intention, John Gainsboro accepted both facts and intention  with the greatest kindness, but he accepted them as <hi rend="italic">errors and failures.</hi> Anne felt this sorely, but bore it sweetly and a little proudly. But when John Gainsboro came back, and looking about him saw that there was nothing beyond the limitations of these facts, when he saw how narrow and proscribed were the
<pb n="311 Emancipation."/>
avenues of labor for women, when looking deeper, he saw what a noble work his Anne was doing for her sex--his Anne, whose wisdom he had doubted, he was noble enough himself to ask her pardon for his doubt, to confess himself convinced, and to give not only sympathy but countenance and aid in furtherance of her plans. When the great property of Gainsboro Shelby,--his mother's cousin, who had hated him for his liberal beliefs all his life;--when this great property came into his hands, John Gainsboro proved by his use of it of how fine a fibre were these liberal ideas of his. And acting together always, in every liberal scheme, the names of Mr. and Mrs. Gainsboro have become synonymous with everything that is fine and generous.</p>
                        <p>"A remarkable woman," said the gentleman from Bombay, as he pondered over all that Col. Van Decker had told him about Mrs. Gainsboro. "A remarkable woman, <hi rend="italic">for she knew just what to do, and was not afraid to do it!"</hi>

                        <docDate>NO. VI.  JUNE, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>M. F. Burlingame</docAuthor>
                        <p>WOMEN should regard suffrage as a means, not as an end. A means of release from legal restraints which consider her as less than a human being--of enforcing the principle "no taxation without representation" --of protecting property--of receiving a fair equivalent for labor--of social elevation--of mental and moral enlightenment--of awakening to effort--in short a means of emancipation.</p>
                        <p>Ignorant, indifferent men and women view the result of the suffrage movement as merely an increased number of votes polled at the regular elections. "Parties and politics will not be changed," they say, there will be nothing gained, only so many more votes to count." They see nothing of the grand consequences enfranchisement involves, the revolutionizing of woman's social position and individual character.</p>
                        <p>The world needs strong, self-reliant, self-sacrificing, conscientious women for its regeneration. High physical, mental and moral development is what women need. But to this, as a class, they will never attain, while they are treated as inferiors, are deprived of their inherent rights, and are dependent on masculine bounty.</p>
                        <p>Suppose a mother teaches her son in this manner: "My dear, you must not engage in out-door exercises, for they develop the muscular
<pb n="312 The Woman's Advocate."/>
system, and it is desirable that you should preserve a delicate appearance; and you must not expose your complexion to the rays of the sun. You must submit to tight lacing in order to obtain an improved figure. Yon must conform to all the dictates of fashion, however absurd, unsuitable and uncomfortable; and your attire must claim the most of your time and thoughts. An education is but time and money wasted; a slight knowledge of a few prominent branches together with the fashionable accomplishments is all sufficient. You will never have any use for more, besides learned gentlemen are quite ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>"The only aim of your life is to marry. Do not trouble yourself about becoming fitted for its responsibilities, nor think of its various duties; you will learn them when you are obliged to. You can labor a little about home if you choose, but to have a regular occupation, trade or profession is very vulgar. Your sisters and myself will support you till you are grown, and then you must marry a rich wife. Remember that while your sisters are free to follow the inclinations of their minds and choose occupations, you must remain with your mother till you have a wife to provide for you. The property you inherit from me will go into her possession, and you will, at all times, be dependent upon her, but that is as it should be. A woman and her husband should be one.</p>
                        <p>You must not interest yourself in politics; you have no voice in the government. If the laws are oppressive, if your wife becomes dissipated, squanders all your inherited property in gambling and drinking, takes away the money starvation has compelled you to earn, and then beats you for more, you must submit in silence, for you can obtain no redress and if you clamor for reform, you will be termed that horror of horrors 'a strong-minded man.'"</p>
                        <p>Thus taught and trained what sort of a man would he make ? If possessed of any spirit would he not fret and beat against his chains? Then if parental authority and society sneeringly smiled at any higher aspirations, ridiculed his attempts to escape, and forcibly held him in his "sphere," (so-called), would he not become an idling, inane, silly, dandified puppy.</p>
                        <p>Yet the majority of girls are thus taught and trained. From this false system of teaching and practice, energetic reformers are endeavoring to emancipate women. If freedom, education, labor, business, re-
<pb n="313 Emancipation."/>
sponsibility, franchise, and aims are needed to fully develop men, are they not also needed to fully develop women? Let women feel that they are "free and equal," that an occupation is honorable, and that their acts, opinions and influence are of some importance, and they will desert the ranks of ignorance, idleness and folly.</p>
                        <p>Suffrage is the gate to fields beyond. Fields of labor, of education, of development. Merely the privilege of voting the Republican or Democratic ticket is not our aim, but to make "perfect women, nobly planned."</p>
                        <p>Croakers prate of evils which will follow the legal and political equality of woman. Every great change is accompanied by temporary evils. But this fact still remains--right is right. And further, liberty does not mean license; nor does the right of ballot annul woman's peculiar duties and responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>With woman's enfranchisement will come elevation and thorough education. With thorough education will come a just appreciation and a better performance of her duties. In the marriage relation she will take her true position as a help-meet--a woman, not merely as a female.</p>
                        <p>"But women do not use the privileges they have, why give them more?" ask the oppositionists. True, women as a class do neglect their privileges, they are yet sleeping in a chrysalis state, but there is a promise of what they can be, of what they may be. In the old slavery days, men said: "The slaves will not work without a driver, they cannot support themselves, they are incapable of self-government, and they must remain dependent." But the emancipation has shown how unfounded, how empty their assertions. In the same manner the emancipation of women will reveal stamina, powers and resources among them yet unimagined.</p>

                        <p>TEN years ago--how long the time seems looking back from this period--it was my fortune to be in the then sparsely settled Territory of Kansas, acting at once as a <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> correspondent, and as a volunteer aid to the noted Free State hero--James Montgomery.</p>
                        <p>It was the year 1858, the culmination of the difficulties in the southern part of the Territory, known as the "Fort Scott Difficulties;" and the theater of action was chiefly in the Counties of Lynn and Bourbon, in the latter of which the Fort, then an important military station, is located. I was fresh from the East. Reared among Quakers, the descendant of those who through love of its "simple faith" had followed Penn to the Western world, myself partaking largely of its influences, it was long before I could contemplate unmoved the desperate character of my surroundings. Indeed it would be difficult to depict in colors too vivid the atrocities perpetrated by the "Border Ruffians" in the last of their long line of aggressions on the freemen of that disputed soil. Fort Scott, although nominally a garrison for the preservation of law, was the rendezvous of some of the most notorious characters in the Territory, who, aided by their willing tools, the soldiery, made frequent forays on the scattering settlements, laying waste the property of Free State men, and making the lintels of many a cabin home drip with the blood of inoffensive victims. Along the Osage and Marmaton rivers, where the settlements were most numerous, scarcely a night passed without witnessing some depredation on life or property; and the sorely needed labors of the husbandman were almost wholly suspended in the efforts to preserve life itself from the bullet of the assassin.</p>
                        <pb n="316 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Yet far more deplorable would have been the condition of the settlers hardy enough to remain exposed to the assaults of the ruffians, wearing as in mockery the uniform of the soldier, without the powerful arm--the volunteer organization of James Montgomery. Inspired with a love of liberty, marvelous in one so reared and educated, bringing to council a clearness of judgment and promptitude of action, his well-known courage, his deadly skill in the use of arms, and natural fitness for command, enabled him, to assume leadership, and exert unquestioned authority over the undisciplined natures persecution had driven to his standard. Perhaps not even some ancestor If his name, in the years agone, on Highland heath, received fealty more loyal from his clan than Montgomery from the gallant spirits whom circumstances had drawn around him, and whose presence, wherever emergency called them, was guarantee to the harassed settler of protection from the marauders, who, by bitter experience, had learned well to flee from where, as the stern Marion of old--</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">"Rode Montgomery and his men."</q>
                        <p>Ay, the outer world then received, and may even yet credit, tales of lawlessness of the operations of this same volunteer organization, but I who for months shared, as it were, their crust, rode in the saddle with them, was cognizant of their daily deeds and intimately associated with their chieftain, know how false were the reports of their abuses of freeman trust, and the Kansas settler, who to-day by the fireside recalls those "dark hours" of Territorial history, teaches his children to bless the name of Montgomery.</p>
                        <p>One evening--and this much of needed prologue--brings me to my story--we were encamped in a dense body of timber bordering on the Little Osage river, a stream some twenty miles north of Fort Scott. It was just after the visit of Gov. Denver, already half a proselyte to Free State theories, to Southern Kansas; light was breaking on the political horizon; fresh hopes animated the defenders of freedom, and on the evening, in question light-hearted merriment presided over the Free State camp. Tale, joke and song alternately went the rounds, and peal after peal of laughter burst from the lips of the men, and was borne by the night-wind until lost in the hoarser murmurs of the Osage. Among stories narrated was one, which I refresh my memory by reference
<pb n="317 A Kansas Heroine."/>
to my note-book to repeat, illustrating as it does traits of character the world never wearies to hear--bravery and filial affection. As it fell from the lips of the speaker, a comely, sun-burnt fellow of five-and-twenty, whom I shrewdly suspected was more deeply interested in the heroine than he would have cared to acknowledge, the narration was unnecessarily prolix, introducing much not strictly relevant in character, but assuming the historian's privilege of abbreviation in immaterial passages, his story was substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>"Well, boys, you may talk of your exploits, and I don't deny courage to many of you, seeing I have faced the same dangers with you, but I am going to tell you something a little Kansas girl did the other day that for pluckiness I'll match against any of your yarns, not excepting even noisy Dick Halsted's. You all know Parson Kimberlin, he that lives down on the Marmaton, and maybe many of you know, or would like to know his daughter, pretty Susie Kimberlin. Well, the old Parson is a mighty strong Radical, and what with his mixing politics and Free Stateism up with his sermons, and writing such out-and-out letters to the Lawrence papers, he has stirred up a perfect hornet's nest among the gentry down at the Fort, and more than once he has been threatened that if he didn't quit ink-spilling and talking about his betters they'd find a way to make him. About a month ago a party of them visited his cabin and read what they call the 'Regulations' to him, saying that if the had ever occasion to call on him again they'd bend a limb with his carcass, but the plucky old fellow has just kept on preaching and writing as though there was no such thing as <hi rend="italic">Judge Lynch</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">slip-noose</hi> in the Territory. Last Sunday week at a meeting up on the Fork he paid his respects to the Fort gentry in language more forcible, I suppose, than polite (and good reason the old gentleman had to be wrathful, for his best horse bad been run off just the previous evening); but some sneak in the crowd made it his business to carry the talk, which lost nothing in his hands, down to the Fort, and the rascals there, Brocket, Clarke and the rest, decided at once to make short work of Parson Snivelton, as they call him. So a strong posse of them, a dozen or more, rode up to the Marmaton, one pitchy black night last week, and cautiously approaching the old man's claim, they surrounded the cabin, catching him at home, alone and utterly unsuspecting danger,
<pb n="318 The Woman's Advocate."/>
sitting in" his, easy chair, the pretty Susie, reading some of his favorite Bible chapters to him. Of course they pounced in like so many tigers, but not before Susie, whose quick ear had caught their approaching tread, managed to thrust her father, unwilling though he was, into the small adjoining room, snatch up the six-shooter the old gentleman always carried on his journeys, and bar the way to his retreat, her slender form erect, her right arm extended, and that eye of hers blacker, boys, than a Kansas night at ordinary times, but now blazing with excitement, and leveled straight on the barrel's 'sights,' and covering the foremost of the ruffians before her. I tell you it was a picture, and one not greatly relished by the blood-thirsty pack, who could have fought a man well enough but who, villains as they were, rather shrunk from such an encounter as was offered.</p>
                        <p>"'Stand aside, girl!' thundered old Brocket, 'it will be worse for you if you give us not instant access to yonder canting hypocrite. We have an account to settle with him, and your puny person shall be no obstacle between us and our vengeance. Back, or, by G----d, we'll riddle you!'</p>
                        <p>"'Never!' said the brave girl, 'I stir not from here, but the first wan, who advances so much as even one plank of this floor, courts his death and meets it instantly. Not one of you has my father wronged, and I warn you that not the first one who tries will live to reach him. Away, ere the vengeance of a higher power overtakes you for the thoughts of blood you have harbored in your hearts this night!'</p>
                        <p>"Boys! it is said that there are special interpositions of Providence--times when, in direst extremity, the Divine arm is reached out for the preservation of mortals. How this may be I know not, I am no hand to advance a fine theory, but it would really seem as though a miracle were performed that evening for Susie Kimberlin. For, as she stood there, calm, yet so inflexible in purpose, her eye losing never its fixity of gaze, the ruffians from very shame began to cower; there was a wavering on the part of the foremost; old Brocket, smothering his curses, turned on his heel, muttering something about 'a breath of fresh air;' his example was followed by his panic-stricken men, and the whole pack, baffled for once in their keen scent of blood, stole away

under the night's cover; black as their own hearts, from the Marmaton."

Ten times, since I listened to that tale of a maiden's heroism, the grass has waved green on those river banks, and the prairie rose flung out its sweetness over broad acres, populous now with busy life. The lawlessness of those days lives only in story, and our loved poet's prophecy--
<q direct="unspecified">
                              <l>"Free homes, and free altars,</l>
                              <l>And fields of ripe food"</l>
                           </q>
hastens rapidly to fulfillment. Perchance, in the swift march of events, that girl by the Marmaton, who, in an hour of danger, took her life in her hand to shield her sire, will yet grasp the ballot, and who will say that she has not earned the right, or has not the capacity to make a judicious exercise of it?</p>

                        <head>WOMAN'S WAGES.</head>
                        <docDate>NO. VI.  JUNE, 1869. VOL. I.</docDate>

                        <p>IN no other way do we find more striking evidences of the injustice which woman has always received, than by considering the wages which have been doled out to her. And although the majority of our country-women are as yet, perhaps, opposed to the suffrage question, still, we venture to assert, that with an almost unanimous voice, they will admit that the present system of wages is outrageous. According to our ideas, this wrong will never be fully <hi rend="italic">righted</hi> until woman receives the ballot; still we think something can be done to improve her prospects, even before reaching that goal.</p>
                        <p>Women have been, and are, altogether too timid about asserting their rights in this respect, and it is about time that they were arousing themselves, and showing a proper resistance to a tyrannical custom. We suppose that at least three-fourths of our Common and High schools are taught by ladies, and they generally receive about one-third or one-half the pay that gentlemen would got if filling their places. Now <hi rend="italic">we</hi> think that this manner of doing business has been carried on quite long enough, and would fain suggest a remedy. Let this great army of teachers unite their voices and <hi rend="italic">demand</hi> as their lawful right, those wages, and only those, which gentlemen would receive in their positions. The expense of obtaining an education is as great for a young woman as for a young man, and there, can be no sound reason given, why she should not receive the same compensation as he does, in the faithful use of it. Let all those who are employed as compositors, government and dry goods clerks, seamstresses, milliners, or in other industrial pursuits, at once make a brave and decisive movement for their own welfare, and refuse to be longer ground beneath the iron heel of Injustice.</p>
                        <p>We cannot find terms too strong with which to urge the prompt and earnest consideration of this subject. Take this matter into your own
<pb n="321 Woman's Wages."/>
hands, and you can without doubt, do very much to ameliorate your condition. But some of you say: "If we ask higher wages, other women will underbid us, and then we shall get no employment." Not by any means, if you are acting together. Talk the subject over with your fellow-laborers, hold meetings to discuss the question, sustain the weak and faltering, and you are sure to succeed in a <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> securing of your rights at least; then when you are ready to ask for the ballot, you will get the full complement, if we do not greatly mistake. During the coming Summer, State Teachers' Associations will be held all over the land. Friends of woman! do not, we beg of you, fail to present this cause on all such occasions, and with such zeal as to gain the attention of all. Those whose means or engagements will not permit an attendance upon the State organizations, can, and should, press the subject warmly and strongly upon the consideration of those assembled at the Town and County Institutes. And above all, ladies, see to it that you ask greater remuneration for your services during the next school year.</p>
                        <p>If the teachers take the lead in this matter--and who more fitted to do it--other women, who are bravely fighting the battle of life, will follow in their footsteps. But some of you say, "<hi rend="italic">We</hi> don't intend to follow this vocation for many years, we are going to get married." Right and proper that you should do so, if a <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi> opportunity occurs; still would you not feel decidedly more independent, should your earnings be sufficient to admit of a little laying up of money, wherewith to furnish your now home, or otherwise assist in your "partnership business?" We think all sensible women would rejoice if permitted to do this. The wages of to-day, barely allow a young lady to board and clothe herself comfortably for the present, but permit of no provision for the future, yet there is no reason why she should not be able to save money, as well as her brother.</p>
                        <p>Again, we say to our countrywomen, arouse yourselves, and with the utmost of your abilities, strive to place the wages of your own sex upon an equal plane with those of men; and in so doing you will forge one of the most powerful weapons for the destruction of Vice and Misery, ever beheld by those who battle for the cause of Truth and Justice.</p>

                           <p>THE Third Annual Meeting of the AMERICAN EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION, held in this city on the 12th and 13th ult., presented features to the friends of the Movement, and to the world at large, which we cannot consistently with our convictions allow to pass without comment.</p>
                           <p>Not as time-honored as some of the Reform Societies, THE EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION, in its establishment three years ago, drew into its organization many of the truest men and women, of those actively engaged in the promotion of the noblest Reform movements of the last fourth of a century. Particularly from the American Anti-Slavery Society it derived a large accession of members, whose self-sacrificing labors for the slave had educated them into a clearness of moral atmosphere in which they recognized humanity standing on the basis of equality, man and woman alike. Its President by common assent was the honored LUCRETIA MOTT, and among its officers, or upon its roll of members, giving tone and vitality to the organization, were such names as ROBERT PURVIS, FREDERICK DOUGLASS, LUCY STONE, STEPHEN FOSTER, ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL, C. C. BURLEIGH and other well-known champions of human rights. Its creed, as enunciated, was broad, simple, unmistakable. It was not distinctively Woman's Rights; it was not the Negro's Rights especially; it was each and all--the WATCHMAN of the Rights of humanity.</p>
                           <p>Thus grand in purpose; its banner upborne by the purest spirits, the clearest intellects, enlisted in the Reform movements, THE EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION had a purpose and a mission such as is rarely confided to an organization. To no one of the pleadings of the victims of oppression, be color, nationality or sex what it might, could it be unmindful without recreancy to its principles. That it should travel the

world in Don Quixote search of wrongs to champion, in order to maintain its consistency, was not a necessity ; but its position required that, concerning any National sin--any wrong battled by the good and the true for years--it should speak with no doubtful voice; and both by its official acts, and by the attitude of those high in trust, it should present to the world an unspotted record.</p>
                           <p>Why, it may be asked, do we assert principles, the correctness of which no one will call in question? Because, in the judgment of some of the best of its members, THE AMERICAN EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION stands dishonored. Tried at the tribunal of public opinion, in the light of its creed and its history, its fame is tarnished. Need we say what it costs us thus to write. Need we say, with the love we have for the Cause in which we are enlisted, and in which so much is at stake, that we would fain commend, or, at least, pass all by in silence, were such a course consistent with our sense of duty. When such men as STEPHEN FOSTER, FREDERICK DOUGLASS and CHARLES BURLEIGH, names synonymous with Reform, feel it their duty either to withdraw from an organization, or make an ineffectual struggle against odds for the establishment of a principle, it is time to consider well what is vital; and, in the interests of independent journalism, we declare the tendency, which compelled STEPHEN FOSTER to withdraw from the AMERICAN EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION, a fatal error. An attitude so hostile to the very principles from which the Society drew its life-blood--for, at every stage, the DOUGLASS Resolutions excited the bitter opposition of the Convention, making the spectacle at times more resembling a Tammany Hall than a Reform meeting--cannot, unless checked, but result in the destruction of all future usefulness on the part of the organization. Not faithless to one fundamental principle can a Reform Society be, and win enduring success for another. Not alone is the treason as criminal, but God suffers, not the perpetuation of triumphs won by expediency. When, with indefensible haste, misled we think by sophistic reasoning, the Convention voted down freedom of speech and, in effect, arrayed itself in hostility to the Fifteenth Amendment, it placed the seal upon its own condemnation and destroyed, very greatly, its capacity for future usefulness, We

pass by all of detail. We have no heart to probe deeply into the cause of the effect. We know that there were noble natures there who would fain it should have been otherwise--who, looking beyond the near, saw the embodied rights of humanity--but these were powerless to prevent the consummation of the evil.</p>
                           <p>Henceforth, while we shall labor as earnestly for the Cause to which we are pledged; while we recognize the purity of motives actuating many of its members, we shall in no wise regard THE AMERICAN EQUAL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION as loyal either to its charter or the claims of humanity, until a new spirit, proscribing not the humblest or the most outcast of our race, is infused into its organization. But, whatever may be the mistakes of individuals or of associations, the work itself must go on. In that we have an abiding faith. Truth is eternal, and our Cause, founded on the immutable principles of justice, cannot perish through human error. All of imperfection will pass away, but the good will remain, and human strivings for excellence, manifesting themselves in truer channels, will be continued, until the world sits in darkness no more.</p>

                           <p>WITH the current number closes the First Volume of THE ADVOCATE. It is in no light spirit of boasting we say that its success thus far has been beyond our most sanguine expectations. Generous friends devoting time and energy to the promotion of our interests; the cooperation of able pens, and a heart fully enlisted in the work and determined to present to the public a worthy offering to the Cause, have all combined to win for our infant journal a circulation, perhaps, rarely attained within so brief a period.</p>
                           <p>Turning over the pages of the initial volume of THE ADVOCATE, more numerous by one-fifth than was promised, the reader meets with the names of such well-known writers and earnest Reform laborers as
<pb n="325 Editorial Department."/>
ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL, FRANCES DANA GAGE, CAROLINE H. DALL, SAMUEL J. MAY, LUCY STONE, HENRY B. BLACKWELL, PHEBE A. HANAFORD, GEORGE BURLEIGH and SAMUEL C. BLACKWELL, each of whom have contributed thoughtful papers, giving the volume a permanent value to all interested in this foremost of questions pressing upon the civilized world for solution. In addition to the more carefully considered Essays from these and other writers, the Departments of "Notes," "Home Intelligence," "Literary," etc., have furnished measurably a record of current events, and given a varied interest to the pages of THE ADVOCATE.</p>
                           <p>For the Second Volume such arrangements are in progress, or are already consummated, as will be an assurance to our friends of no diminution of interest in its pages. The July number will open with a paper entitled, "Are we Worse than our Grandmothers," by Mrs. ISABELLA HOOKER, one of the ablest and most esteemed writers of the day and a careful observer of the Woman Question. FRANCES DANA GAGE will contribute the first instalment of a paper on "Old Maids," and other features will lend varied attraction to the number.</p>
                           <p>Closing with such pleasurable feelings the initial Volume, we look forward to the second with the confidence inspired by the success of honest effort. If, in the widening circle of friends, one regard has been lessened, we are unaware of it; if any word or criticism of ours has given offence, we regret the necessity of its utterance; for the Past we have only kindly thoughts, and for the Future, hope and word of cheer at the advancement of the Right.</p>

                        <p>IN Paris, a woman, Mme. Donmerque, has passed the examination which entitles her to be an apothecary. She is the first woman in France who has done so.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Adelaide Grennan of! St. Louis has been appointed examining Physician of the Hom&#x0153;opathic Mutual Life Insurance Company of this city. It is the first appointment ever made of a woman to fill such a position.</p>
                        <p>A Committee of the Bloomington, Iowa, Temperance League recently made a canvass of the women of that city as to their position on the temperance question, with the following result: Women in favor of prohibition, 1,433; Women opposed to prohibition 143; Women neutral or indifferent, 31.</p>
                        <p>Miss Kate Field, whose gratifying successes in Boston have been previously chronicled, has since delivered her lecture on "Woman in the Lyceum," both in this city and in Brooklyn, to large and appreciative audiences. Miss Field brings to the lecture-room all the varied requisites of success and the critics are unanimous in according rare <sic corr="excellence">excelence</sic> to her efforts.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Special Committee of the House and Senate of the Massachusetts Legislature, to whom were committed the petitions of eight thousand intelligent men and women of that State asking for Woman Suffrage, have made a report declaring themselves strongly in favor of such an enactment, and the Report goes now before the Legislature for its action. We learn that strong hopes are entertained of its passage. May the old "Bay State" be the first to receive the laurel!</p>
                        <p>At the recent Woman Suffrage Convention in Brooklyn an additional interest was lent to the proceedings by the presence of Lucretia Mott, the honored President of the American Equal Rights Association. Mrs. Mott although advanced in years, and bowed yet beneath the irreparable loss of her beloved husband, was able to make a few remarks, leaving a benediction with an assemblage with which, in this life, she may not again meet. Few women have lived such a life as Lucretia Mott, and the sun of a well-spent existence goes to its setting without a cloud dimming its radiance.</p>
                        <p>The Working Women's Association of this city are taking measures for the establishment of an Intelligence Office for Working-women, whereby their true wants and needs can be properly brought to the notice of the public. The plan also looks to the opening of a Salesroom and other desirable agencies for the great class of toiling women. Among the ladies active in this good work are Mrs. Celia Burleigh, wife of the poet, Wm. H. Burleigh, Mrs. C. S. Lozier, Mrs. Sarah A. Norton, Mrs. Mary F. Davis, Mrs. Eleanor Kirke and others. We trust that an enterprise so commendable will succeed.</p>

                        <p>Among the notable women at the recent Anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, was Mrs. A. K. Foster of Worcester, Mass., better known in the days of the old Anti-Slavery warfare As Abby Kelly. Mrs. Foster, who from a long and dangerous illness, is regarded by her friends almost as one raised from the dead, is looking remarkably well, although yet feeble, and manifests all her olden interest, not only in the Anti-Slavery movement, which approaches the full fruition of arduous labor, but in the growing Question of Woman's Enfranchisement. We trust that Mrs. Foster will be spared many years, to witness the full consummation of the principles to which she has rendered such valuable support.</p>

                           <p>The class of minds rejecting all reformatory writings without any investigation, because they may be deemed visionary, or dealing with subjects improper for mortals to investigate, is rapidly lessening, as the light of the age breaks in upon the old domains of ignorance and superstition. Ideas, once deemed heresies, are accepted by the world as truths; and, daily, new principles are unfolding which give to inquiring minds rare glimpses of the rich fields of thought beyond.</p>
                           <p>Among the various works which Mr. Davis has given to the public--and our memory goes back twenty years, or more, to when, a boy in the old farmhouse, we pored over the "Revelations "--we believe there is no one which is destined to exert a wider influence on liberal thought than the volume before us. The most important problems which can possibly affect society are discussed in a familiar and felicitous manner, in which, through the charms of narrative, the reader is made acquainted with the most vital truths. The book reveals two important aims; first, the <hi rend="italic">sacredness of the family relation;</hi> second, that the <hi rend="italic">amelioration of society is to be secured through the elevation of Woman, and a knowledge and application of hereditary laws.</hi> In the startling events of the story, founded the author states "upon the facts, with only a thin veil between the reader and the real characters," Jaques Del Aragoni, Capt. Nelson, and Dr. Morte are traced through their career of crime, and the history of their paternal and maternal antecedents graphically delineated, revealing the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> that hatred for mankind is so often coupled with genius of intellect. Madam Sophia, rarely endowed with personal attractions and depth of spiritual sentiment, has also unfortunate hereditary tendencies, and want of self-reliance. Her redemption is wrought out through suffering. Twenty years of severest trial were necessary to bring to her external recognition, what she had spiritually discerned and unconsciously revealed while in the somnambulistic state, namely: that herself and the noble Dr. Du Bois were soul-mates, destined to be the "happy companions of an eternal life." Dr. Du Bois, an eminent physician of New Orleans, is the principal character delineated. He accumulates a large fortune, which is freely expended in the labors to which his genius is consecrated--the history of criminals connected with their maternal antecedents.</p>

                           <p>Having spoken thus freely of the merits of the volume, we must add one word of regret that the author has felt the necessity of speaking so undisguisedly of evil, in passages of the book, which we think should be more <hi rend="italic">inferred;</hi> and also that any profanity, natural enough to the characters to which it is ascribed should sully even one page.</p>
                           <p>The style of the book is fascinating, riveting the closest attention, yet appealing powerfully to the noblest sentiments of human nature. We bespeak for the volume an extensive circulation and a wide influence.</p>

                           <p>"IT is my monument," said Erskine pointing to a collection of his speeches, "other stone I need not," and the remark applies forcibly to the volume before us, which is indeed a monument of a well-spent, laborious life.</p>
                           <p>Coming from a stock hardy as any be boasted by any of the children of the "Pine-tree State," bearing a name representative in its history, Mr. Fessenden has contributed his full. share to its honorable perpetuation, not alone in State but in National councils, where his voice was heard through some of the darkest hours in our Nation's history, breathing always a loyalty powerfully assisting in the maintaining of the just authority of the Government.</p>
                           <p>The volume is naturally divided into three parts, embracing, first, the principal speeches delivered by Mr. Fessenden while a member of Congress from the Rockland District, Maine; second, a series of sermons preached at different periods principally in earlier life; third, miscellaneous lectures upon Temperance, National Affairs, etc.</p>
                           <p>Although making no pretensions to oratory, Mr. Fessenden's style is concise, his argument is cogent; and, not infrequently, rises to rare eloquence. A true Reformer, upon all the questions of the day, whether as Representative, as Minister, or as simple Lecturer Mr. Fessenden pronounces decided opinions, and the volume, throughout, gives abundant evidence of being the work of an earnest thinker, and one in advance of his age.</p>
                           <p>It is of such men our country should be proud; and it is such books, written by men careless of their fame, that are among the most valuable accessions to our literature.</p>

                        <p>THE Second Anniversary of the American Equal Rights Association, held in this city on the 12th and 13th ult., was largely attended throughout all its sessions, showing unmistakably how general is the interest in the Questions properly claiming the attention of the Association.</p>

                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">First: Resolved,</hi> That the extension of suffrage to woman is essential to the public safety and to the establishment and permanence of free institutions; that the admission of woman to political recognition in our national reconstruction is as imperative as the admission of any particular class of men.</p>
                                 <pb n="332 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Second: Resolved,</hi> That as woman in private life, in the partnership of marriage, is now the conservator of the private morals, so woman in public life, in the partnership of a Republican State, based upon Universal Suffrage will become the conservator of the public morals.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Third: Resolved,</hi> That in seeking to remove the legal disabilities which now oppress woman as wife and mother, the friends of woman suffrage are not seeking to undermine or destroy the sanctity of the marriage relation, but to ennoble marriage, making the obligations and responsibilities of the contract mutual and equal for husband and wife.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Fourth: Resolved,</hi> That the petitions of more than 200,000 women to Congress and to their State Legislatures during the past Winter asking expression of popular sympathy and approval, everywhere manifested throughout the land, ought to silence the cavil of our opponents that "Women do not want to vote."</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Fifth: Resolved,</hi> That while we heartily approve of the Fifteenth Constitutional Amendment, extending suffrage to men, without distinction of race, we nevertheless feel profound regret that Congress has not submitted a parallel amendment for the enfranchisement of women.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Sixth Resolved,</hi> That any party professing to be democratic in spirit or republican in principle, which opposes or ignores the political rights of woman, is false to its professions, short-sighted in its policy, and unworthy of the confidence of the friends of impartial liberty.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Seventh : Resolved,</hi> That we hail the report of the Joint Special Committee, just rendered to the Massachusetts Legislature, in favor of woman suffrage, as a fresh evidence of the growth of public sentiment in our favor, and we earnestly hope that Massachusetts, by promptly submitting the question to a vote of her people, will maintain her historic pre-eminence in the cause of human liberty.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Eighth: Resolved,</hi> That the thanks of this Convention are due to the Hon. George W. Julian in the House of Representatives, and to the Hon. Henry Wilson and the Hon. S. C. Pomeroy in the Senate of the United States, for their recent active efforts to secure suffrage for woman.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">Ninth: Resolved,</hi> That we recommend the men and women of every Ward, Town, County and State, to form local Associations for creating and organizing public sentiment in favor of suffrage for woman and to take every possible practical means to effect her enfranchisement.</p>

For, granting for a moment that fathers and brothers do actually earn all the money that comes into the, house, which is far from being the case, who keeps these men and boys in good working order, and supplies a home more or less comfortable for their non-working hours? Suppose every man and boy was obliged to make, mend, wash and iron his own clothes, to supply himself with food well cooked, and decently served on a clean and wholesome table, to sweep, dust and neatly arrange the rooms of his dwelling how many hours would he have left for a trade or profession? Yet this is what a majority of mothers are obliged to do for themselves, besides performing these same duties for a household averaging five members and taking the entire care of very young children; and many add to all this some outside industry by which they contribute to the actual means of the household. I suppose there is hardly a manufacturing town in New England in which a large part of the work of both the factories and the homes is not performed by women and girls. In one village in Massachusetts, I was told by a clergyman there, that nearly every family in his congregation did their own housework and also sewed shoes for the market in very large quantities; and he added that they were also people of rather uncommon culture and refinement.
"And this leads me to speak a good word for the young girls of the present day, who have been much commented on in the newspapers and magazines of late for their excessive attention to dress and generally for their rather useless lives. In every large city there is a small class of ultra fashionables to whom such criticism justly applies; but this is by no means a representative class, although it seems to be the one uppermost in the minds of undiscriminating writers. Leaving the hopelessly frivolous ones out of the question (and they would not average one woman in a thousand), let us compare the boys and girls of the same family, all over the country, up to the age of sixteen and onward, and find, if we can, which of the two are the largest contributors to the family wealth and comfort. In country villages the case stands about even between them, perhaps, for if the daughters sew and sweep and churn and cook, the sons do also milk and plough and plant and cut down trees; but in the towns and cities it is far otherwise. So long as the boys and girls of a family are attending school, all the way up from the primary to the last term of high school and seminary, it is rare I think that any serious work is required of the boys outside of school hours. They usually are allowed (as indeed <hi rend="italic">all</hi> should be if possible), all their spare time for out of door sports and recreations; while the girls have always on hand a certain amount of home duties, that cannot be neglected without serious loss to the family comfort. In this city of Hartford, for instance, I will venture to say
<pb n="3 Are we Worse than our Grandmothers"/>
that there are not twenty families where the daughters do not make and mend more or less their own clothes, take some care of their own rooms and assist in preparations for entertaining guests, besides making fancy articles for fairs and benevolent associations of various kinds; and by far the greater part of our girls are expected to do much more than this out of school hours. The same thing is true of. the lady teachers in our schools and seminaries, who nevertheless usually receive a smaller salary than the gentleman teachers of the same grade with themselves. The number of stitches that these weary hands are obliged to take for themselves and for dear friends dependent upon them, out of school hours, would be perfectly appalling I fear to the brother of any one of them, after the close of his day's work, be it what it may. All which goes to show that the work of girls as well as women is apt to be underestimated in its money value; and this is true even in families of the very highest culture and refinement, because the service that unmarried daughters perform in the maintaining of a hospitable home would draw seriously upon a father's purse, if by any means such service could be purchased for money."</p>
                        <p>This tells the whole story in few words. There is, we will say, today, a class of fashionable and utterly useless women which had no existence in the United States seventy or eighty years ago--and there is just such, a class of men--but they are both of them and equally the effect of accumulated wealth in the community and of habits of luxury growing out or such wealth. We can afford to count these out entirely as drones in the hive and then there will remain the workers, or those who profess to be such--the men and women who according to their various capacities and opportunities are responsible for the welfare of the family and the State. Of the men no one doubts that they on the whole are worthy representatives of their industrious grandfathers; can it be true that the women are entitled to less praise.</p>
                        <p>Second, As for the style of dress animadverted upon; I, have no fancy for the scanty covering which constitutes a fashionable dress, and was never guilty of an indiscretion, even, in that direction; but I well remember hearing that my mother of sainted memory and her mother before her were often seen and admired in the public dances of their day, and I have no doubt wore the costume of the period in all purity. In fact one cannot look for a moment upon the pictures of ancient dames which have come down to us without being struck with such exhibitions of neck and bust as are really very uncommon now. I have in mind
<pb n="4 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Martha Washington and ladies of similar character, whose party costume, has always seemed to me seriously objectionable, but of whose personal purity and wholesome influence upon society, I have never had a doubt, nor have I ever beard one suggested. They, when sitting in their chimney corners were as amply clothed as any dames in the land no doubt; but in society they conformed to its customs with a grace and purity that left no room for scandal. Why then should we judge more severely the women of the present day, who having been accustomed from their infancy to the wearing of "low necks and short sleeves" are utterly unconscious in their own experience of any ground for such accusations as are common in the prurient criticisms of the day. I remember hearing from a friend who spent several weeks with the late Duchess of Sutherland, that she was always accustomed to appear at her own dinner table in this very fashion, and Queen Victoria, that model wife and mother, still does the same, I believe. In fact it is so well understood in England that etiquette requires this style of dress at dinner and on most ceremonious occasions, that old ladies of seventy and eighty are not at liberty to wear any other, and are therefore accustomed to protect themselves with a shawl when the weather becomes trying to their age. But in virtuous Paris, etiquette is somewhat less exacting and high necks are more commonly worn. Yet one who should upon a comparison of French and English society in this respect, draw a comparison unfavorable to the latter, would go wide of the mark; in fact I suppose the court of Victoria has never been equalled in virtue and intelligence by any other court since the world began. All which goes to show, not that this is the best way of dressing our daughters by any means, but that too much stress is laid upon the matter as evidence of growing impurity among them, and especially that it has nothing to do with the <sic corr="comparative">comparitive</sic> merits of the women of the past and present generations.</p>
                        <p>Closely connected with this is another assertion of the critics--namely, that the advanced culture in physiology to which women are now invited has been a source of moral deterioration. A writer in <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Magazine</hi> for February last, a literary lady of talent and distinction, in an article entitled "Men's Rights," thus discourses: "There is a class of subjects the name of which would bring the red to the old lady's cheek yonder, but with which it is the fashion
<pb n="5 Are we Worse than our Grandmothers?"/>
of the day to make young girls thoroughly conversant. There is no need to send Nelly out of the room now no matter what topics the matrons may discuss. The <hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi> of our grandmothers is well trodden ground to her at sixteen" and again--"She hears the social evil coolly discussed as a social necessity," etc. There is something in all this and in the paragraphs which follow that cuts me to the heart, and I cannot help feeling coming into my cheek on reading it the very red spot that is attributed to the old lady yonder. In fact I cannot understand it--for if the writer simply means that it is not wise for young girls who are living in the hope and expectation of a happy marriage and a blessed motherhood some day, to listen to the discourse of matrons and gather instruction from them and from the books and periodicals devoted to physiology and the laws of health which are now so commonly found in the family reading, then I simply disagree with her; for I am entirely sure that God intended that the mothers of his people should begin at the foundation of their own being and learn his laws concerning their own bodies, those temples of the Holy Ghost, those consecrated shrines of childhood. But if she means that matrons now-a-days are in the habit of discoursing before their young daughters, or away from them, in the most secret corners of their homes, on subjects that are uncleanly and unwholesome, and that should not be so much as thought of by those who would live pure lives then I can only say that she must be greatly mistaken--she is judging the many by the few, the <hi rend="italic">thousands</hi> by the <hi rend="italic">one.</hi> I have lived near fifty years in the midst of an uncommonly large circle of friends and acquaintances, and have been known among them as one of freest thought and speech on all worthy subjects, and never in one single instance have I heard a word from a mother that ought to cause a blush an the cheek of an angel. More than this, we too have a grandmother, and with her I have been accustomed to hold converse on all matters moral and religious that seemed to me of serious importance; and in the light of her serene countenance have I found both courage and assurance while seeking a clean path for myself and my sons and daughters through this wilderness and never has she so much as intimated that her life in its narrower bounds was a higher or purer one than mine and that of my children. It is true we are told at last, that "this evil is, as yet,
<pb n="6 The Woman's Advocate"/>
confined to our large cities, but the feverish taint will spread," etc.;--and it is because I fear that just such articles as this will spread the taint, that I am moved however reluctantly, to criticise it and all others of its kind. I have thought before now that the common method of dealing with this and kindred subjects in our magazines has stimulated curiosity and drawn the attention of thousands to modes of thought and life of which they would otherwise have scarcely had a glimpse; and it has always seemed to me that <hi rend="italic">literature should abound in suggestions of beauty and purity, rather than in criticisms of impurity;</hi> for whom can we hope to reach and mend in the limited circle of already debauched ones, by any public outcry whatever? and surely the mass of outsiders to whom all this is but a startling revelation are no gainers thereby, but losers rather, at least of their faith in human progress. For there is progress after all and that of an unmistakable kind, and "the state of society that can make a Swinburne possible," is greatly in advance upon that which <hi rend="italic">read and delighted in</hi> a Sterne and Swift, a Fielding and a Smollet.</p>
                        <p>Again, the writer quoted above gives us the following remarkable passages: "The most salient and apparent change in women in the last few years (I do not say the deepest) is not advance in intelligence, marked as that may be; it is the growth of impurity." "She reads, or writes as the case may be, novels in which few of the men are honest, and none of the women are virtuous; or, advancing a step further, she finds that but a mean and ignoble life which is sacrificed to the children whom God has given her." "There is reason to doubt whether the ordinary aliment of all women in literature or art now, is a whit more pure and wholesome than that of men, coarse as we declare their appetites to be." From all this I entirely dissent, and it seems to me easy to be proved, first, that purity is on the gain both among men and women and especially among the latter; second, that literature, since it has been largely open to women both as writers and readers, is immensely more elevated than it was fifty or even twenty-five years ago; and third, that if we could gather into one huge heap and destroy forever from the face of the earth those horribly immoral and obscene books which we are told are secretly devoured by young men, but of which few women have so much as heard one single title, and substitute for them the books that the mass of women now read and some of them write, we should have made a greater advance
<pb n="7 Are we Worse than our Grandmothers?"/>
toward moral purity than can be hoped for from the patient labor of many years. There is nothing of which I am more convinced than of the truth of these propositions and it is to the fact that parents are not yet convinced that associations of a polluting character are as harmful to boys as to girls--and suppose that as the former must encounter them at some period of their lives it is useless to attempt to protect them in their youth--that we owe the moral degradation of the race more than any other one cause. I cannot express the depth of my convictions on this subject, nor the pain that it gives me to hear such loose and careless statements as to the prevalence of immorality among the women of America, and as to their character for purity when compared with the women of a past generation.</p>
                        <p>I come now to public amusements, and at the outset I wish to put in a slight disclaimer in behalf of those of us who have attended one or more of the various theatrical performances that are considered very demoralizing in their tendency and who have thus helped to swell the number that are said to delight in immoral entertainments. I have to confess for myself that I have seen "La Grande Duchesse," and more than this, that I was utterly unable to discover either the charm of the play or its wickedness, though looking with all my mother's eye for both. Since then I have given the subject grave consideration, and have listened to the criticisms of all parties, not omitting those of a French lady and gentleman of the finest culture and most undoubted purity and piety. My conclusion is that, so far, great injustice has been done in the public prints to the mass of respectable people who have occasionally attended these plays, and that the injury inflicted upon the community by their attendance has been greatly exaggerated. The truth seems to be that these plays as acted in Paris have a significance that utterly fails to attach to them here. In our ignorance of the associations, and imperfect knowledge of the language, we are attracted almost wholly by the spectacular exhibitions which are really magnificent in some instances, and are unobservant of the occasional innuendo and suggestion which a more corrupt audience and one hearing its own vernacular would easily understand. This is of course no reason why we should continue to patronize such entertainments after we have become satisfied that they are intrinsically mischievous, whether we can per-
<pb n="8 Woman's Advocate."/>
ceive the mischief or not; but it is a reason why there should be no indiscriminate denunciation of mothers and daughters who have sometimes attended them, and why they should be persuaded to avoid them in future on the ground of leading others into sin, rather than because their own personal purity has suffered even unconsciously thereby. One must resent a little such implications, and the tendency of human nature, even when somewhat sanctified, is to persevere in a course conscientiously begun, when the argument for a change is an imputation upon one's own modesty and womanly delicacy.</p>
                        <p>The summing up of this matter then, to my mind, is this: Mothers should discriminate carefully as to the dramatic representations, if any, that they and their daughters shall attend; but they should insist that the same rule be applied to fathers and sons; for, in the present condition of the world, women are in far less danger of contamination than men, and the demoralization of the latter is no less harmful to society than that of the former. We are all bound together in the same social life--we stand and fall together--contamination knows no sex--it is the sins of the fathers that are visited upon the children of the third and fourth generation no less than those of the mothers, and he who rejoices in a virtuous wife in whose honor he can securely trust, must see to it that he transmit a virtuous inheritance to both sons and daughters.</p>

                        <p>"You certainly deserve a worse punishment for your impertinence than to hear so good a story as I have to tell about my friend, Sallie Evans. She was a jewel of an old maid, I can tell you--one whose example and precept made beautiful patterns for any one to follow. Of her early history I know nothing, as she came to the West many years after its first settlement; and of the causes that conspired to keep her in a state of single blessedness, I know as little. Some said, it was a big black mole on the side of her nose, that had kept her heart whole; others that her dark skin and her heavy dark eye-brows had had something to do with it; and others (sneering men of course) that the heavy tones of her voice could never by any possibility be made to say 'yes,' but were sure to turn the soft, lisping sound into 'no,' ere it reached the ear. But I never believed one word of all their nonsense, and now as I look back over the long shadows of the past, I am much more inclined to think that the only trouble was that Miss Sallie had too clear and definite an idea of her own ability to take care of herself, to lose her own identity by merging her name and existence in that of another; being obliged, perhaps, to take care of herself and two or three, or a dozen besides, and then have the, world say that she had been supported. No, no: Miss Sallie loved too well to handle her own purse, loosening its strings just when she pleased, and letting the dimes, and even dollars slip out to suit her own fancy, among the poor and needy; to run the risk of working a week for somebody else, and then being gruffly re-

fused a shilling's wages at the end of it because somebody had stood up with a book in his hand and told her she must 'love, serve and obey.' Her face was, beautiful to me, for it was always radiant with kindness. She was the school-mistress, and for many a long year exercised the law of love among the urchins of our neighborhood. Her worst punishment was a frown, and the withdrawal of her sunny smile made twilight for us all, and to some of us it was starless night. If we had gone wrong, her keenest rebuke was, 'I shall not love you till you are good.' Occasionally an 'I don't care' was sullenly whispered, but the look of sorrow and wounded feeling that settled on her plain face soon smote upon the conscience of the culprit, and brought him back with penitent tears to be taken into her favor and affection. If we quarrelled, she bade us leave her side until we were reconciled, and seldom a half hour passed ere we joined hands as merrily as ever, agreed to kiss and be friends, that we might again enter into the sanctuary of her love. She was neat and nice; but her things were all free to our young hands, if we would only be careful. We tumbled over her basket, unwound her spools, sewed with her needles, cut papers with her scissors, and looked at her pictures through her magnifying spectacles; our only penalty for all this pleasure was the necessity of putting all things as we found them, and thus we all learned lessons of neatness and care. If some one brought her a beautiful flower or a gay bouquet, she called the poor little neglected ones of the school who had no flowers or beauty at home, and bade them admire, with her, God's handiwork, telling them that those who loved His works, praise Him with their hearts, and she would often pin a pink or a violet on the breast of some modest, heart-crushed little one, whose life-garden lay upon too poor a soil to bring forth flowers.</p>
                        <p>"The boys--and she had big boys too, some almost stretching up to manhood-would as soon have been caught stealing water melons as disobeying Miss Sallie, or making her trouble, because 'she never scolded, and how it would look for them to disobey when she always made just the rules they liked best;' for somehow or other she had the faculty of making every bumpkin in the school firmly believe that the good government of the whole establishment hung upon his-shoulders, and without the active influence of his example there would be no les-

sons got or tasks completed. At home Miss Sallie was the love-divinity of the household, and the spirit of cheerfulness and good humor followed her like a shadow of herself. There was old Zacharia, who had been ten years groaning day and night with the rheumatism, who said 'O dear' when his breath went out, and '0 Lord' when it went in, from Sunday morn till Saturday night, would actually suspend his monotonous moan for the space of a minute when, she would ask him if be did not really feel a little more comfortable to-day, than he did yesterday. His invariable answer was, 'Why, yes, Miss Sallie, I do raly complain I'm some better. 'Now a good many littles make a mickle,' and one would have thought that "complaining he was some better' as the days rolled on, for years, would at last have made him quite well; but, bless your heart, it was only the magic tone of her voice, which, though a bass, was richly cultivated by kindness, that made the poor suffering man forget for a moment his racking pains, and feel that he was better.</p>
                        <p>"But it was by the bedside of the sick, the suffering and sorrowing, where Miss Sallie's great goodness of character loomed up the most brilliant and beautiful. She was never engaged to take tea or attend an evening party when a sick neighbor wanted her; she never had a concert or singing-school to draw her away when duty bade her go among the poor and the lowly. I said she loved to open her purse string - aye, she did, and if all the blessings which fell upon her head for the Money expended in making others comfortable had been made of silver and gold, she would have had her skull broken every day of her life. She knelt down by the sick child in the emigrant's shanty, smoothed its pallet of straw upon the floor, and laid her own soft hand under its head while she bathed its little fevered brow. If the mother was sick, she took the wailing babe in her arms and stilled its cries while the mother slept, or quelled the clamor of the older ones by administering to their necessities. Many a portion of balm and oil did she pour into suffering hearts by adding to the comfort of their loved ones. The poor all blessed her; the rich respected her, and yet, Bell, Miss Sallie was an old maid!"</p>
                        <p>"And so is Aunt Hannah," said Bell, archly, and the gleam of her eyes said as plainly as eyes could say it, just as good too. "May I not put a bow here in this corner of your cap border, Aunt?"</p>

                        <p>"The next on my list of old maids was Patty Chapelear, who lived unmarried--so she said, and everybody believed her--'because she was the youngest of fifteen, and it was a pity the baby could not stay at, home and mind mother in her old age;' and five, she declared, being the average number of children to a family, she could well afford to live for her mother's sake, since she had done her work for her twice over. Her mother had seen the leaves fall for fifty autumns ere Patty's jet black eyes ever saw the light, and of course when those bright eyes had watched the opening of the spring blossoms for a score and a half of years--long time enough to christen her an old maid--the parent had got along well in years--had reached four-score, when life to most people becomes 'labor and sorrow.' But not so with Patty's mother; she was brisk as a bee, and could tell almost a nation's history in her own experience. But Patty was her second self--the bright shadow of her early days. She set her arm-chair in the best position, placed the stool under her feet, put her slippers on and off, combed her hair, tied her cap, pared her apples and peaches, wound her balls, threaded her needles, and read her Bible for her.</p>

vehicle, and mother with her weight of eighty years, walked in and rode to church, got out in the same way, and quietly listened to the sermon, always remembering the text, and making Patty write it down for her in a book when she got home. Old Dagon was only a quarter as old as his oldest mistress but it is said he knew as well when Sunday came as any of them and once upon a time when Patty had a bad turn of pleurisy, and could not go out for a Sabbath or two, the old fellow grew impatient of staying away from preaching so long, pulled out the pin of the stable door, walked up to the door step, stood the proper time, and then trotted of to the meeting house, went through his usual service at the church door, and walked leisurely to the post in the fence corner under the shade of a walnut, which had been put there in old Mr. Chapelear's day -for the good of the family, where be stood, still and solemn, till the services were over, then walked up to the door step again to take in his load, and trotted off home, much to the amusement of the younger members of the congregation, who were no doubt more edified by old Dagon's piety than by the parson's discourse upon total depravity. Patty, after all was a true old maid, for when she was forty, (which she certainly did grow to be, and her mother yet a sojourner among the children of men) she had a pieced quilt for every year in her life, all folded away in goodly pyramids, with linings as white as the snows of January, all of which were to be distributed some day among her nieces, who, though Aunt Patty had been very busy and industrious, already outnumbered her quilts, by two, which made her feel somewhat uneasy lest she might be obliged to leave one of the darlings without a token of love from her own hands. But oh, those quilts ! There was a double nine patch and a single nine patch; a double Irish chain and a single Irish chain; and a block work, and a saw tooth and a Job's troubles, and an M and 0; a bird's eye and a sun-flower; a rising sun and a half moon; the single star and double star, the point star and diamond star, Bonaparte's star and Wellington's star; the cat's cradle and the peony; the Carolina pink and the wild grape vine; the pyramid and the mouse trap; the morning glory and the goosefoot, the bird's pest, the oak leaf, the Yankee pedlar and the Old maid's love; the bride's folly and the husband's choice; the American eagle and the full blown rose; the pride of Virginia, the

beauty of Pennsylvania, Susy's favorite, the lover's fancy, grandmother's notion, the rosebud and the tulip, and the buckeye stripe, They were not motley things, I can tell you; but all made of new calico, cut symmetrically and geometrically, and as beautiful as quilts could be, and all pieced and quilted just because Aunt Patty could not for the soul of her be idle, and as she never let slip the 'stitch in time which saves nine' she bad the odd eight to put in when she pleased. And then such piles of blankets and woollen spreads and double coverlets, all of her own spinning-it would do your eyes good to see them all out airing of a sunny day, and almost made one long for a howling winter night to enjoy them and their virtues. Patty found many a spare hour too for reading, and if she did not keep up with all the gossip of the day, it was because she was holding grave converse with the heroes an heroines of olden time.</p>
                        <p>"Her mind was a store house of antiquities, and she had a proverb or a wise saying, from some good authority, for all the occasions that her quiet life presented. Patty was a Woman's Rights advocate long, long ago. Those who turn up their noses at the doctrines as 'new fangled,' only show their ignorance, for there have been women as far back as I can remember, who have felt the unjustness of the laws and the cramped and confined condition of their lives, and Aunt Patty never failed to put the officers of government in mind of their want of consistency -when tax-paying days came. 'All just governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed,' Aunt Patty would say, 'and our fathers fought hard battles to secure the right of representation; but when they had cleared themselves from the yoke of oppression, they turned around, and without a qualm of conscience laid the same yoke upon one-half of their companions, and our necks have borne it patiently ever since. My father was a good man, and meant to be just, and when he found he could live no longer, he made a will; yes, gentlemen, he made a will. Now my mother, when she married my father, was worth one thousand dollars, and my father was worth just nothing at all, not even enough as I have often heard them say, to pay the priest's bill; so after marriage, you know, she and her money too were all his, and he said she must come out West. She did not like it much, for her father and mother, and all

her kins-folk lived in old Vermont. But he would not be easy, and so to keep peace in the family she agreed to come out here among the wild Indians, and live in the woods. I don't think she ought to have done it; but you know everybody preaches that wives must do just as men want 'em to, and I suppose mother thought the whole world would blame her and say she wanted to wear the breeches, 'cause she had a little money wher, she was married; and so she just gave up and let him take her, and her money just where he had a mind to. Well, as I was saying, they came out to Ohio, and he bought him a nice farm, and a good horse or two, and some cows and so on, built a cabin and went to work. The very first day father chopped in the woods after they had got into the cabin, he got his leg broke by the limb of a tree that struck him, and did not do another stroke that year, and was always a half cripple afterwards, and could not do much. They had a little of the thousand dollars left, and mother hired a man to do the clearing in father's place. She spun and wove, took care of father, and kept house all summer, and nights she would go out and pile and help burn the brush. With her spinning and weaving she supplied all the wants of the family, paid for some wool to make the winter clothing, and laid up provision, some way and another, to do; and so it went on from year to year. Father did all he could, but mother worked day and night to get along and get the farm cleared. After the first year they raised nice crops, and so paid men to work, and she did not work much out doors; but she earned many a hundred dollars with the wheel and the loom to help along with, besides taking care of all the children. Well, the farm prospered wonderfully, and father was counted right well off when he died; but everybody knew mother was the manager, though she never said much. But, as I was saying, father made a will, and gave each one of us girls a hundred dollars, (There were ten of us) to each of the boys two thousand, and to mother, who, as you may say, had earned the whole, he gave the old log house, (for he never would consent to having a better one), and all that was in it--the beds and bedding, and household goods that she had earned and made herself, to be all her own as long as she lived single. If she married she was to have a hundred dollars like the rest of us, and if she lived single it was to be hers as long as she lived, and, then go back to the boys. All this was

thought to be quite right with the neighbors; but mother sometimes used to think that she ought to have had at least her thousand back to call her own. He gave the homestead to my two youngest brothers, kindly recommending them to look well to their mother's wants, and care for her comforts while she lived. I was eighteen when my father died, and had that year earned almost the whole of the hundred. dollars he gave me, by weaving, for I could weave everything that was needed in the country. Mother had got too old to keep the loom going then. So I took my hundred dollars and loaned it out, and wove away as hard as I could, to earn more. Elijah and Sam felt very crank when they got the whole control of the homestead, except mother's three acres and the old house; so they went to work and built each of them a fine house, married dashing wives, hired the work done, lived easy, went in politics, undertook to superintend the government, etc.; and by and by Elijah who was a whole-souled, merry fellow, took to drinking. He never would, I don't believe, if he had not been sent to the legislature. But I don't want to talk about that. When I was twenty-three his farm of a hundred and eighty acres had to be sold, and I had money enough to buy it; and now mother and I moved into a better house, and my dear old mother felt that she owned half the homestead again, for I always tried to make her think everything I had belonged to her. Elijah was pretty much cut down by his failure; so he quit drink and went off to Illinois, where he did pretty well, and coaxed Sam to sell out too, and follow him and so when I was thirty I bought Sam's share, and now (and Aunt Patty's eyes would sparkle) I own all my father's homestead, and am ready and willing to pay my taxes; <hi rend="italic">but I can't say I think it's all fair.'</hi>

beautiful, each in its time; her beds camomile, round as the fall moon, and as soft, green and velvety as a bed of moss; her rose trees, every variety that the country produced trained as well as were nephews and nieces, not a rebellious sprout among them to snare your shawl or bonnet as you passed; her great bunches of peonies; her beds of tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, candy tufts, larkspurs amaranths, everything--yes, everything that could be found in the land graced Aunt Patty's garden. Her currant bushes bore riper, richer, better fruit than any one's else; her strawberry beds made merry makings in the spring-time that did all the young peoples' hearts good, while her cherries, raspberries and plums, her melon patch and peach orchard furnished many a treat to both old and young; her radishes, peas and cucumbers were always the earliest; her lettuce and pepper grass and string beans the most tender and crisp, and what was better than all, Aunt Patty was so generous and kind with all her good gifts that not a neighbor but was in some way during the season a sharer of her bounties. To this one who was ailing she sent a mess of peas; to another a basket of onions; a third received the first cucumbers or green corn, and somebody else just in the niche of time got a nice dish of fresh fruit, because somebody was going to have somebody to dinner or tea. Every day there was a blessing upon her head from some quarter. Blessings given are very sure to bring blessings returned, and I wonder people will not learn that truth and abide by it more frequently than they do. Aunt Patty seemed to have but one weakness that the world generally imputes to old maids--she was a great match-maker, or at least they thought she was--named all the apple seeds at the parties, turned all the tea cups, and was as good at guessing as most folks. She always had the well-curb stuck full of live-forever roots, in pairs, growing fresh and green and named for her friends; the wall of the porch too was ornamented with more than one portentous couple, and if they inclined to each other she was sure to whisper the auspicious omen into the ears of those whose names they bore. Once on a time two vigorous plants had grown together, and they fairly entwined each other in a loving embrace. But alas! for Aunt Patty's signs, the young man and maiden whose names they bore had not spoken for a twelve-month. No! they

would not so much as look at each other; for Jane Davis had offended Ansel Braddock beyond forgiveness by going home from a paring bee with a merchant's clerk just from town, after going with Ansel to the bee. But when the year came round just to a day, Aunt Patty had another apple paring, and Jane and Ansel were both there, and while the rest were all busy she called them both out on the porch, and before they knew what she was about, brought them up face to face.</p>
                        <p>"'Do you see those live-forevers?' said she.</p>
                        <p>"'Yes,' they replied.</p>
                        <p>"Well, they're you and Jane, Ansel; and now see, they have twined entirely around each other. You love each other; you know you do, and there's no use pouting any longer about that foolish little trick of Jane's; I tell you you love each other, and you'll never be happy till you make it up,' and off Aunt Patty ran and left them alone in the soft moonlight among the morning glories.</p>
                        <p>"'Is that true, Jane?' said Ansel sidling up sheepishly.</p>
                        <p>"But what Jane answered nobody knows; for there were no fairies in those days to tell tales on the lovers; but, everybody knew the next day that Ansel and Jane had made up, and that he went home with her that night. In less than six months they were married, and have been a happy, loving couple ever since. Aunt Patty says her live-forever made the match. She was a favorite with young and old; not a wedding went off but she was master of ceremonies. The cake was not light unless made by her recipes; the preserves could not be clear if she was not consulted, nor the jellies keep their form except by her direction, and the bride took it as a bad omen for her future life if she had not a sprig of mignonette and rosemary for her hair, on her bridal eve, from Aunt Patty's garden. Besides all this, she was the doctress general of the whole neighborhood; well patronized too, for she never went empty-handed, and never charged a fee. She kept wormwood and tansy for the rheumatism; comfrey and ginseng for the consumption; snake-root, balm and pennyroyal for fevers; peppermint, poppies and cayenne for agues; calamus and sweet annis for the cholic; rue and swother wood for worms; peony roots for fits, etc. Indeed 'for all the ills that flesh is heir to,' she had her antidote. Nobody ever refused

to ask, and she never refused to give, or to go. 'It's but little good, she used to say, I that I can do in one short life; so let me be doing as fast as I can, and mayhap somebody may live to say, when I am gone, he is the better for Aunt Patty.'

I do not believe they are any more particular or fastidious than other people naturally, but having no families nor little engrossing cares like married ladies, they are expected, nay required, to be scrupulously neat and nice. Wives who have no children grow into the same habits. The maiden ladies of my acquaintance (and I know many) are with few exceptions women far above the common lot; their situation in life, free from the cares and duties that must necessarily confine a wife and mother, gives them better opportunities for education and investigation. They seem to have looked more deeply into life and its duties; and they stand before the world calm, dignified and noble--a living rebuke to the thoughtless folly that speaks with sneering of their independent life; and not from me, Aunt Hannah, will the cold, supercilious, misjudging world ever hear a serious sneer upon any one who sees fit to move on through all her years untrammelled by any cares, doing as it seemeth good unto herself all the days of her life.</p>

                        <p>Yes, I do demand that women shall not repeat the errors of men. They must carry a new element into the State, or they can never justify the position they now claim. Many things bring to mind a saying of George Macdonald in "Phantastes":</p>

                        <p>I am far from expecting miracles to follow the extension of the Suffrage. I have pressed it earnestly when such advocacy was costly when for any woman to be known as a "Woman's Rights Woman," was to impair her own social position, and to cut off the hand with which she must earn her bread. Yet if I felt it worth while to plead for it at this cost until the faith became the fashion it is at this moment, there never has been a time when I considered it the chief hope of the world. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> lies, and will forever lie, in the self-government of men and women.
<pb n="23 Breakers!"/>
The suffrage is a necessary means of education and development for both sexes. Whether it works well or ill at the outset, it is a part of the "doing justly," without which it is not enough to "love mercy." The first step toward working well, is to concede it. If the whole thing lay in my hand this moment, I should give the franchise first to the black. I would help men to retrieve their moral character to make amends for ancient wickedness before they should sally out like crusaders in search of a new emprise.</p>
                        <p>Those who depend so securely upon the expected advent of womanly influence seem to forget how few wise and thoughtful women there are in this world. Quite as many, I dare say, as there are wise and thoughtful men, but not enough to over-balance altogether those who live by the vices and the follies of the other sex. What I now labor for, is not to got the franchise--for that is sure to come--but to educate women for it, to help them to think out the problems it will present. When a circular was offered to me for signature, about six months ago, claiming that the enfranchisement of women should be the basis of all political action in all elections of State, County and Town officers; that this enfranchisement should be paramount to all political issues, and that no candidate should be considered eligible who had not publicly pledged himself to it, of course I could not sign it. I do not like to see women go to the polls and vote when they know their votes will not be counted. It is a waste of time, and seems to me mere child's play. Do not let these words be misunderstood. I blame no other person's action or counsel. There may be places and people who can be helped by such experiments, but I wish I could see women carrying some of the energy so spent into really noble, unselfish and associated labor. I do not think that because men and women have "equal rights " that their work for the world must be the same. I do not yet understand the <hi rend="italic">limits</hi> of sex. I do not understand what men <hi rend="italic">should</hi> or what women <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do, but I want first of all that entire freedom for both, which shall ensure the carrying out of God's purposes. People talk about the impossibility of women being faithful to home duties, and at the same time "<hi rend="italic">absorbed in political life.</hi>" But why should we be absorbed in political life?

Those whom "God" has "joined together" it seems to separate, and I suppose the reason that I shrink personally from organizations in behalf of this reform is, because they seem to divide men from women, and in most of their proceedings to authorize the common presumption that the present position of woman is the result of the <hi rend="italic">conscious wrong-doing of men.</hi> Things must be called by their right names, whether consciously or unconsciously done, and I have never shrank from so calling them. Until very recently, the subordinate position of woman--which did not in the least prevent exceptional women from exercising their proper influence--was a condition imposed by the necessities of spinning, weaving and household providing. Now that the progress of civilization sets women free and leaves them many unoccupied hours, the first consequence is that home is neglected for balls, clubs and theatres-for the fashionable parade ground, wherever that may be. Let us take care that the second be not the subordination of <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, to the external duties of citizenship. The security of the public interest lies in the supremacy or the family and in the strength of natural ties. Although franchise Is not to cone in a moment, women are being educated for it by holding public offices as well as in other ways. In Kansas, women serve as clerks of the Senate, and House. In many Western towns they are "notaries public" and post-mistresses. The Boston Post Office has never had any Department so well managed as "Station A" in Miss Buckingham's hands, and last April Mrs. Sarah Wooster was appointed by the Aylesbury magistrates, 0verseer of the Poor, and Surveyor of the Highways for the parish of Illmire in England. Four other women had filled similar offices the previous year, and they have been declared eligible as constables, sextons, and returning officers. In this country, they are being placed upon the school committees with such rapidity that the town of Melrose will be glad to forget the "bad pre-eminence" it acquired when it refused to listen to the petitioners who were among the first to make this demand. I have more
<pb n="25 Breakers!"/>
than once regretted the urgency with which I have pushed women as saleswomen, clerks, etc., because of their indifference to customers and to employers' interests after their appointment. I hope the women who go into the offices I have just enumerated will show a pliancy and fitness that shall create a steady demand for their services. It rests with themselves to do it. The current of public prejudice is at this moment in their favor.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the study of medicine, I think the women of the United States have made a great mistake. The first thing to be secured is a first-rate education, such an education as Warren and Jackson, in the first instance, and later still the pupils of such men have obtained, The medical school at Paris, when it opened its doors to Miss Putnam, offered this education to all women able to go to Europe. But not one in a hundred of the women who will practice medicine In America will ever go to Europe. What has been done for the education of such women in America? Absolutely nothing, it seems to me. If the money given to all sorts of female schools and colleges had been given to the medical school at Harvard, expressly to secure medical examinations and degrees for women, and to build operating rooms for them, something would really have been accomplished. We have a few women finely educated abroad; we have many women nobly successful in spite of obstacles; but this cannot last. For exceptional women success is always possible, but we have not done our duty till we have made it sure for the ordinary student. Is it not fair to ask whether there is yet in the United States a single woman who is able to cope with educated male physicians in <hi rend="italic">general practice?</hi> Are not our women obstetricians or specialists, and should we not provide against failure from this cause</p>
                        <p>To this end let Harvard be endowed. In his recent address to the School, Dr. E. H. Clarke said this in substance, and I am sorry that a journey to Europe has prevented the publication of his paper. It was needed as an offset to the coarse and disrespectful humor of last year's address. Wealthy women should take this matter in charge; but there is one thing that only the physicians can accomplish. The formation of medical societies to meet monthly or quarterly for the reporting of cases, and reading of theses to be published in a journal, is a matter which rests with themselves alone, and properly achieved would challenge and
<pb n="26 The Woman's Advocate."/>
secure the respect of medical men. I sometimes hear individuals talk as if male physicians were to be utterly suppressed--as if their vocation were ended. A short time - since I interceded at Harvard for a young medical student, that certain privileges should be granted him because, being the son of a poor widow, it was necessary to shorten his term of study. "I thought," said some one who happened to hear of it, "that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were in favor of <hi rend="italic">female</hi> physicians?" How could I explain myself to a person capable of that remark? I hope the time will never come when noble and generous men will not dignify this profession as they done in New England from the very first year of its settlement. The work of women in this field would be poorly achieved without them.</p>
                        <p>So also in the pulpit. Let women come to it to complement the work of men, not to supercede it. In every field the two sexes must labor to secure harmony and fullness. As in music, so in science, and I have never thought that the work of the sexes could be interchanged in either. It ought to be a matter of prudence with individuals as well as associations, not to undertake, more than can be accomplished, and for each to undertake only <hi rend="italic">her own work.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When I first entered the pulpit, I was told that I was not a Radical, because I discoursed on Scripture themes and Biblical Interpretation. I was expected to touch Temperance, Anti-Slavery and Woman's Rights;--everything in short except what it was my special object to say. But it seemed to me my first duty to wake the religious nature; my next, to make myself so acceptable in the pulpit, that the propriety of my being there, would never be questioned. Then those who thought my Woman's Rights opinions "short madness," would be willing to listen to them in the Lyceum. This experiment has worked well. I advise others to try it.</p>
                        <p>I cannot see why conventions should not be called in a simple way, to discuss these subjects, Without any advertisements of distinguished names. Let the distinguished people come if they choose, let their possible presence be hinted at, but failures like those at Springfield do the cause great harm, and in the present state of public they are less readily forgiven in women than in men.</p>

                        <p>LATE last winter, in one of our more "down town" churches, there was a prayer-meeting and sermon for the unfortunate class known as "night-walkers," of the Empire City. A popular divine--one whose eloquence had stirred many a Western audience--in a visit East had expressed a desire to talk to the Magdalens; and by dint of advertising and the fame blown of the preacher's pulpit successes, a large audience was attracted together, to whom the cushioned seats and brilliant lights of a metropolitan tabernacle were strange surroundings.</p>
                        <p>Ay, it was a large assemblage, but there were well nigh as many men in the galleries to stare down, as there were women below to be converted; and sad to say, there were words and signs of recognition exchanged between the old <hi rend="italic">roues</hi>, or boys, young in all save vice, and the more brazen of the unfortunates that augured but illy for the impression sought to be created by the messenger of the Word of Life. It was an audience, by Its very flashincss and unconcern of even the respect due such a place, to move the heart to pity. The slums of vice--Water street and Mulberry, Green and Houston--were all represented; and the few minutes intervening between the assembling of the audience and the commencement of the services were spent in remarks of a by no means edifying character.</p>
                        <p>"What can the old muff tell us we didn't know long ago!" would be the exclamation of one; "lend us a wipe, Sal, mine is getting salty a-ready," would be the cheap attempt at wit of another; and a laugh, hopeless and discordant, would run around the audience, to whom the whole seemed a source of unfailing diversion. Yet there were a few among them, not wholly depraved, who manifested glimmerings of a better nature by using their influence to check their more boisterous companions, and preserve something of the respect due the occasion.</p>
                        <p>In a few minutes the minister, a man yet young, broad-limbed, and kindly-faced, mounted the pulpit. After the cries of "hush" "order," from the better portion of the assemblage had secured comparative

quiet, he gave out a simple hymn, caught up by a few in the singing, read a chapter from the Bible and at once began, in simple, unaffected language, to comment on the passages he had read. In a voice of weighty solemnity, his hand slightly raised, not a particle of excitement visible in his manner, he repeated:
<hi rend="italic">"Like sheep they are laid in the grave."</hi>--</p>
                        <p>From the first there was an awakening of interest. The manner of the speaker had won their attention. Upon a few, his words fell vainly as shot upon an iron-clad, but the sympathies of the greater part of the audience were excited. He went on, his voice gathering power:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="italic">"Their beauly shall consume in the dust."</hi>--</p>
                        <p>There was no mistaking now the impression. Rouged cheeks grew pale,' and pale cheeks kindled with interest; there was no more quip or jibe; each leaned forward to catch the next clearly enunciated word:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="italic">"But God will redeem my soul from the bondage, of the grave"</hi>--the man's utterance became rapid, joyous; his face irradiated, turned upward and faces turned upward with it--<hi rend="italic">"for he shall receive me!"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then the sermon, such as has swayed, as the wind sways the pines, the multitudes of many an open air gathering, succeeded: the perishable pleasures of a courtesan's life; the remorse following its swift career; the only healing for human guilt and sorrow, were all depicted:--only sobs broke the pauses of the speaker's voice; fountains long dried were opened; hearts, that bad parted with sentiment for years, were deeply stirred.</p>
                        <p>While some remained tearful in their seats; and some pressed forward, agreeable to the speaker's invitation, to approach the "throne of grace," one slender girl, whose features were concealed by the folds of her veil, arose and stole unobserved from the building. Gaining the street, the sharp air played upon her brow, from which the veil had been swept back, but it had no power to allay the fever which burned in every vein, maddening thought.</p>
                        <p>"'Handsome, Emmy' will take a 'stiff brandy,' she murmured, "and forget all about it; but I never can go back to that den--I can never live again as I have in the past."</p>
                        <p>Walking rapidly, as though with a purpose, she soon reached the
<pb n="29 Lost!"/>
Bowery, where she took a Third avenue car to City Hall; walked from thence to the Courtlandt street ferry, crossed, took a Bergen car, and alighted in the neighborhood of her old home. All was buried in gloom at that midnight hour. She had not shed a single tear since leaving the building; her eyes were full of a wild light that scorched them.</p>
                        <p>Long, unheeding the keenness of the air, she roamed about in that once familiar locality;--seeing the dear home where her innocent childhood had been spent--the public school where she had been so happy--the private one in which she had "finished her education"--looking now at this house where had lived the playmate most cherished of her sex--now at that of the boy who had so won upon her regard at school by his kindness in drawing and painting pictures for her, telling lessons, explaining difficult tasks, and shielding her from oft-deserved censure--here was the high-stooped dwelling where she had been at parties of pleasure, feeling a flutter of strangeness at the unwonted luxury of the surroundings--there the more modest one where other happy hours had been passed--along this avenue she had strolled so oft with ------ ere the rash step of leaving home to wed secretly, with one above her station, had been taken----</p>
                        <p>At length the agitation of her mind, as event after event in her life whirled before her, grew intolerable, and taking a farewell glance at her childhood's home, she walked rapidly to the avenue on which ran the cars.</p>
                        <p>Soon she was again at the ferry, and soon, also, on board of the boat, rounding out from the slip and heading up the river. It was now long past midnight; there was a clouded sky above, and a blackness on the face of the waters.</p>
                        <p>There were but few passengers on board, and the keen air kept those. in the lighted cabins. The girl was all alone at the stern, leaning over the broad rail. From the first she had kept her eyes on the sullenly splashing waves, removing them only to note the distance of the shore-lights of the great city, which the boat was steadily approaching, or to cast an imploring glance at the black vault of heaven.</p>
                        <p>Two or three times her lips began to move, but the might of the inward conflict, convulsing her being, prevented the articulation of words. At length, moved as by an uncontrollable impulse, she murmured
<pb n="30 The Woman's Advocate."/>
God bless' dear mother, my innocent sister, and all who have been good to me. And God bless my dar---- ah! he who was once my darling!"</p>
                        <p>As she breathed this prayer--and who shall say that it was not wafted upwards--she undid the chain near which she had leaned, and stepped upon iron-fronted edge of the boat--no guard now between her and the river. </p>
                        <p>"For their sakes God forgive," was wailed out on the night air, and she leaped.</p>
                        <p>All unseen by human eye, the waters closed above that form; another human tragedy was enacted; the boat sped on its way; life went on the same, but she, known to her companions in vice as "Lena Rivers," was seen no more on earth.</p>

                        <p>LIFE is a battle. In this world even the Church calls itself the Church Militant. Agitation is the life of a nation, when that is sapped by luxury or suppressed by tyranny, healthy existence ceases, and its unburied carcase breeds only pestilence and corruption. There was greater vitality in the Roman Republic when the Gracchi demanded the distribution of the land, than when Julius C&#x00E6;sar gained the battle of Pharsalia; more real health in Greece when Demosthenes thundered against Philip, than when Alexander of Macedon sighed for more worlds to conquer. But the warrior age has passed, and the order of those days is now reversed. Sampsons are at a discount, and even in modern war the skill of the man of science is more honored than the sword of the gladiator.</p>
                        <p>Such being the case, men of thought ought of right to rank before men of action. There are those in whose characters the two are united. Such was the case with the martyr of the Anti-Slavery war. But John Brown dying triumphantly for the Truth's sake was worthier the applause of the world, than John Brown
<pb n="32 The Woman's Advocate."/>
fiercely struggling for the same in the arsenal at Harper's Ferry. It requires a far higher order of courage to maintain calmly a correct principle in the face of an angry and riotous mob, than to die shouting victory at the head of a legion of applauding soldiers.</p>
                        <p>Neither are the merits of modern heroes less than those of the ancients if they be measured by the services they have performed for the good of mankind. What former war will compare (either in the greatness of its actions or the excellence of its effects) with the late war waged for thirty years by a handful of Abolitionists against the churches, the government and a large majority of the people of this country. And as the heroes are worthier, and the results nobler and more important to human welfare, so the theatres of operations are daily becoming grander and more extended. In the transportation of men and goods, days are now reduced to hours by the railroad, and the transmission of thought by the telegraph may be said, in certain instances, to outstrip the flight of time. Only a century ago the leading ideas of a country although triumphant, but slowly penetrated into another. The seeds of the American Revolution were Political and Religious Liberty. More than half a century passed before the former sprouted. In England in the shape of the Reform Bill of 1830, and three-quarters of a century before it blossomed in France, Germany and Spain in the admission of the rigbt of universal male suffrage. The latter, after striking root in England in the Catholic Emancipation bill and budding into vigorous existence in the admission of Jews to the House of Commons, may yet be seen wreathing its chaplet of unfading flowers around the brows of Castelar as he struggles for Religious Freedom in the Cortes of Spain.</p>
                        <p>Now, however, revolutions travel much more rapidly. Although premature and consequently subdued, that of 1848 passed like wildfire throughout Europe. At the present time the most important Reforms approach nearly to universality. The vexed questions of the Rights of Woman and the Rights of Laborers or Producers are at one and the same, time agitating the most enlightened countries. The encounters and tournaments of the past age are beggared into insignificance the importance and grandeur of the reforms of the present. Of yore, such gatherings for war or for sport rarely comprised more than tens of thousands of the 
<pb n="33 Modern Wars and Warriors."/>
inhabitants of the nation or nations interested in the affrays, but the combatants of the present period have, for their audience, the <hi rend="italic">elite</hi> of the civilized world. In former times the blows given and taken for the honor of chivalry could only be witnessed comparatively by a few; but the true words now daily uttered, by the champions of human rights resound through continents: and the names of Garibaldi and Wendell Phillips, Victor Hugo and John Bright are household words with the foremost peoples of the earth.</p>
                        <p>But a dignity yet higher distinguishes the warfare of the present period. Brute force being overthrown, the moral power which is destined to succeed it is not monopolized by the males, and knows not the favoritism of sex. The Sisters of Mercy and Charity, of both branches of the Christian Church, have striven (not vainly) for success over Bigotry, Intolerance and Barbarism, on many a well-fought field. Brutality has retired discomfited from before the peaceful confidence and calm resolution of Lucretia Mott, finding in her august presence his shield of Ribaldry an incumbrance rather than a defence. Grim War, in the Crimeas, "smoothed his wrinkled front" in the presence of Florence Nightingale; and Oppression is to-day rolling in the dust, smitten even unto death by the javelin hurled from the hand of Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>
                        <p>Well will it be for us when moral ideas take their proper, post of honor in the council halls of the nation. When the doctrine that "might is right" which has stained the records of our race with the life-blood of myriads, tyrannizes over us no longer. But this will never obtain whilst the halls where our laws are created, and the courts in which they are administered, are closed against the counsels of our mothers, our wives, our sisters and our daughters. The later wars in Europe and this country have proved that the presence of woman is needed fully as much even on the field of battle, as it is in the cottage of the laborer. Let us no longer proscribe her from any sphere she chooses to adorn with her presence. Alas! all former generations have witnessed her sufferings, but let us hope that the one now existing may behold also her triumph. If she has borne through the ages the almost mortal agony of the Curse, we know that through her also we are taught

to hope for the Blessing. Well will it be for Mankind, when the charity of woman is called upon to guide and temper the sterner and grosser decrees and enjoyments of her helpmate; when, imitating the order instituted in the Temple of Solomon, we place the Seat of Mercy above the Ark of Justice. After such amendments we may hopefully look forward for the speedy arrival of that period of peace decreed in the sacred writings, for which we are commanded to pray, when the desires of mankind shall be merged in and consistent with the will of the Ruler of the Universe.</p>

                        <docAuthor>Wendell Phillips</docAuthor>

                        <p>A FRIEND in Rhode Island writes to us that there is a wide opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment among the advocates of Women's Rights; especially among those who have not been trained in the Anti-Slavery cause. The fact does not much surprise us. Education in reform is such a slow process, simple faith in absolute right is so very rare an element, that it is natural beginners should be confused by the crafty demagogues about them and shrink from what seems such a perilous step. A little experlence and a more profound consideration will, we believe, lift them to the level of a full faith in principles.</p>
                        <p>What is the. Fifteenth Amendment? It runs thus:</p>
                        <p>ARTICLE 15.-The right of the citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State, on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.</p>
                        <p>SEC. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</p>
                        <p>The form is unexceptionable. If the thing sought is good, the language used could not be better. There is no word <hi rend="italic">"male"</hi> (odious to us all, in laws and constitutions) to be found here. Wherever and whenever women vote it will protect their rights as fully as those of men, and be as valuable to them as to men. The object sought is to oblige the States to allow
<pb n="35 The Fifteenth Amendment."/>
black <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> to vote on the same conditions that white <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> do. As men only are now allowed to vote, of course the immediate effect will be to oblige the States to allow black <hi rend="italic">men</hi> to vote just as wh1te <hi rend="italic">men</hi> do.</p>
                        <p>This is <hi rend="italic">all its effect.</hi> The talk about its giving the vote to Chinamen, Irish, Germans and other "ignorant foreigners," is wholly out of place. It does not admit one such to the ballot-box; it does not affect them in any way. Such men are excluded from the ballot-box until they are naturalized, on account of their <hi rend="italic">birthplace</hi>, not on account of their <hi rend="italic">race.</hi> These, are totally distinct elements. It is <hi rend="italic">foreigners</hi> not <hi rend="italic">races</hi> (excepting in the Negro's case) that we exclude from voting.</p>
                        <p>Race means <hi rend="italic">blood.</hi> Nationality means <hi rend="italic">birthplace.</hi> Englishmen are men of a dozen <hi rend="italic">races,</hi> all born in England. <hi rend="italic">Americans</hi> are made up of a score of <hi rend="italic">races</hi>, all born here. All <hi rend="italic">races</hi> here are equal, all Americans vote,--except  the black. The object of this Amendment is to abolish that inequality. A Jew born in New York does not change his race: he is still a Jew. This Amendment provides that he shall not, <hi rend="italic">on account of his race,</hi> be denied his vote. A Jew born in Paris is still a Jew in race. He cannot vote, however, till naturalized, because he is a <hi rend="italic">foreigner.</hi> This Amendment does not hasten his right to vote at all, does not in the least change his present rights as to voting. So of all other foreigners-Irish, Chinese, and the rest.</p>
                        <p>Let us omit therefore all this idle talk, which only confuses the question at issue. The whole object of this Amendment is to prevent a person's being shut out from voting because he is a Jew, or a Celt, or a Negro. Its immediate effect will be to prevent negro men from being forbidden to vote.</p>
                        <p>What then is the objection to it? We are told that if these negro men vote they will tyrannize over their wives just as white men do; and that so large an ignorant class voting, will make it still more difficult to get woman's right to the ballot recognized. But suppose all this were true--what then? Does it authorize us to resist the recognition, by Government, of the negro man's right to vote?</p>
                        <p>A man has the same "inherent, unalienable" right to vote that a woman has. We humbly presume that the marvellous progress of these last few months has not upset that principle, or produced any woman so terribly in earnest as to deny it.</p>
                        <pb n="36 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>If that be so, is there any intelligent reformer prepared to maintain that we have a right to deny to any human being his, or her, <hi rend="italic">natural rights</hi> because we fear he, or she, will misuse them? I should 'like to see the Abolitionist, of thirty years standing, who will look his own record in the face and maintain such a proposition. All history laughs at it. The Pope said, "I cannot allow men to read the Bible, each in his own language and pick out his own faith--the 'right will certainly be misused.'" Tories say, "we cannot let poor and unlearned men vote, 'they will misuse the right.'" What said the Declaration of Independence to that? The Episcopalian said "I cannot let the Catholic vote, 'he will misuse it and harm me.'" What said O'Connell to that?</p>
                        <p>Slave holders said "the black has a right to liberty, but we cannot recognize it, 'he will misuse the right.'" Ask the last thirty years and the war how God answered that. Capital says to the eight hour men--"Yes, an immortal being has a right to some leisure to prepare for this life and the next, but I cannot recognize it, 'he will misuse it.'" What do we reply? --"Recognlze your fellow man's natural rights--those God gave him--aid him, as you can to use them wisely--but leave him, at last, responsible to God alone for their use--art thou tby brother's keeper?'"</p>
                        <p>If the negro man should therefore, in his ignorance, misuse <hi rend="italic">his right</hi> and, delay woman's recognition many a year, we are not authorized <hi rend="italic">on that account,</hi> to forbid Government to recognize his natural and inalienable right to vote; that is, to oppose the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
                        <p>It was one of the great promises of MAGNA CHARTA, extorted from the King by his Barons, that he would "neither <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> nor refuse Justice." God lays the same duty on all of us.</p>
                        <p>We were not sent into the world responsible that negroes, or any other race, should behave themselves. But God will hold us responsible if we presume to deny to our fellow man any of his natural rights.</p>
                        <p>Fashion--woman's realm--was one of the strongest bulwarks of slavery sometimes; equal to Church and State combined. It is to-day the special bulwark of negro hate. Woman could extinguish that scourge in half-a-dozen years. Suppose twenty years ago when fashion laughed at us, it had been proposed to give women the vote and that Abolitionists had cried out "no--we've enough to convert now, selfish merchants and bigoted chureb-members; do not throw contemptuous
<pb n="37 The Fifteenth Amendment."/>
and silly women into the scale. It is an 'infamous' proposition." Should we have been justified? </p>
                        <p>But leaving this argument with those who recognize and fully trust all God-given rights, let us come down to those who settle this question by reasons of expediency.</p>
                        <p>Those friends say it is not wise to recognize these rights piecemeal. The Amendment is faulty because it does not cover whole ground, man and woman's vote too, all that relates to voting. Well then, here is Mr. A----, he believes the vote is a snare and a strengthening of the Aristocracy unless every voter is secured in a homestead, his natural right. Here is Mr. B----, he believes voting only plays into the hands, of the Capital, unless our whole system of finance is changed and -Government allowed to issue paper money at discretion, without interest. Here is Mr. C----, who believes no drunkard should be allowed to vote and no convicted criminal, as is sometimes the law abroad. Here is Mr. D----,who believes the whole method of choosing the Senate is a violation of natural right.</p>
                        <p>Shall we wait till the whole country gets educated up to all these ideas and make no change till we can settle the subject in its whole breadth? Absurd. Man gets forward step by step, the recognition of half a truth helping him to see the other half. First we had individual liberty, then separate property, then right of inheritance, then freedom of opinion, then freedom of speech, then voting: - thus, one by one, ray by ray, men got able to bear the full light of day. In what order these steps shall be taken,--which. first, which second--is God's ordaining, not of our plan. Every change large and distinct enough to serve as a point upon which to rally the nation, should have a separate discussion and be decided by itself. This is the most economical and speediest method of reform. Every other method, mixing up separate issues, is like. good Davie Deans' attachment to the Scottish Covenant. From his sick pillow he asked if the Doctor had subscribed the Covenant. That's no matter now, father," said his child. "Indeed it is," cried the old Covenanter, "for if he has not, never a drop of his medicine shall go down the stomach of my father's son."</p>
                        <p>In the present instance this great rule holds. We have drawn the weight so far up; fasten it there and thus get a purchase to lift it still
<pb n="38 The Woman's Advocate."/>
higher. There have been several different tests excluding men from voting in this country. Church membership, property, book-learning, race, sex. The first we have got rid of everywhere. The second is almost gone, except in obsolete corners like Rhode Island. Book learning is vanishing as a test. The abolition of each one has helped to get rid of his comrade. Race and sex alone are left. Abolish the first and you will clear the ground and simplify the question. It will leave the naked, bare, intolerable and illogical test of sex so monstrous as it stands isolated that it will almost topple over of its own weight.</p>
                        <p>No doubt the ignorant prejudice of the working class is one of the great obstacles to the recognition of Woman's Rights. Some over-sanguine advocates seem to forget this, and imagine that when a Legislature is carried the work is mainly done. Not so by any means. When the first line of the enemy's works,--the Legislature,--is carried, there remain two, behind--the Church and the laboring class. Whether the Church line will contest the fight remains to be seen. It looks sometimes and in some places as if it would not. But there's no trustworthy evidence on that point. The working men will, without doubt. And with that whole class the same thorough and weary work is to be done as fell to the lot of the Abolitionists between 1830 and 1850, with the mass of the Nation;  patient lecturing, line upon line, precept upon precept, "without haste, without rest." But the enfranchisement of the negro need not give us the alarm which Democrats, masquerading in Woman's Rights uniform, try to create.</p>
                        <p>This reform,--woman's voting,--will never probably be carried by national action. It will be granted State by State. Slavery would have been abolished so but for the war. It was the "war power" which brought and enabled the Nation to kill slavery. Abolitionists looked forward to the peaceful action of successive States. This will probably be the course relative to woman's voting.</p>
                        <p>The addition therefore of seventy thousand black votes in South Carolina will not retard the action of Iowa or Massachusetts on this question. It will rather hasten their action. Desirous to guard as fully as possible against any conceivable ill consequence from such sudden increase of voters, the Northern States will be spurred to call, all the sooner into the field, whatever there is of good and conservative and
<pb n="39 The Fifteenth versus the Sixteenth Amendment"/>
well intentioned in woman. Just as the lager beer infatuation of the German Republicans out West moves the Republican Temperance men there to accept woman's rights in order to correct that bias in the party so the negro vote will operate in this case. Once carry this reform in half-a-dozen Northern States, and the negro looks so much to us for his example that his vote will be sure to follow ours. If the North once accepts our principles, the time will come when Woman will find her best friend in the Negro, as the Union did. You may be sure he will keep step to the music of any improvement his trusted North initiates. </p>
                        <p>Let ignorance then believe that the only way to improve the world is to do everything at once--"I shall never get to the top of the hill by single steps; the only way is to wait till I can leap the whole way at one bound." Let selfishness cry-"He sball not have his rights till I get mine." The true reformer will say, "Let every class have its rights the very moment the world is ready to recognize them. Thus and thus only will every other class get one step nearer to the recognition of its own. 'First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.'"</p>

                        <p>THE Woman Suffrage Movement is suddenly developing a new phase. It opposes the Fifteenth Amendment. This opposition is increasing. It has been rather the fashion to accuse those advocates of Female Suffrage who oppose this Amendment of insincerity and treachery to the principles of Liberty. Doubtless some of them are thus guilty: also, doubtless many of them are not. One cannot be false to principles one has never believed. Incredible as it may at first seem, there are many workers in the Woman Suffrage movement who have never learned the lesson set this Nation during the past generation, that distinctions founded upon differences of race are fatal to a people that establishes them. They have only learned the danger of such distinctions founded upon differences of sex. Anglo-Saxon women, they desire to stand
<pb n="40 The Woman's Advocate."/>
equal with Anglo-Saxon men. They say: "If you give the ballot to us, we, of course, will then admit all races to its privileges but, if you give the franchise first to these ignorant negroes, taught by slavery to despise, women, these foreigners, these semi-barbarous Chinese they, 'drest in their little brief authority,' will use it to, put off the day of our liberation,--and meanwhile, grave-yards are crowded with our starving sisters, and streets are filling with desperate ones."</p>
                        <p>What answer? Is Democracy then a dream? Are its principles but "glittering generalities" after all? Was it all a mistake that we deemed that Mazzini and the Cretan, Stuart Mill and the Cuban, Wendell Phillips and Anna Dickinson were leading separate divisions of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> army, fighting the world over for the same end a larger liberty? Race-hatred, distinctions of caste, the aristocracy of sex, we had thought them all foes of Republicanism. We had supposed that a victory over one brought nearer the day of triumph over all, the day when the groaning, earth shall be delivered from all these monstrous shams that have cheated us with their hollow mirage for so many centuries.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>"Let justice be done though the heavens fall," as Nasby's paper very sensibly remarks, "the more justice is done, the more the heavens won't fall." Their Maker fashioned them on no such rotten foundation. He created them expressly to stand, and stand they will. If the Democratic principle of extended suffrage is correct, would it be just to refuse it to the Chinese immigrants, for fear that after they receive the franchise they will not vote just as we want them to vote? That, after all, is the question squarely put. I know its naked merits are often hidden in rhetoric, ay, and that thinking of it, trying to see it fairly our eyes are blurred with the tears of outraged, trampled womanhood, and yet, I think, this is the plain question to be decided. We have just finished a bloody war; the nation is racked yet with turmoil and bitter contention, because many years ago our fathers said, "If we expel this germ of race distinction between the black and white, the Republic we have fought for, the hope of the world is delayed for generations. Groaning millions of trampled peoples call to us,--their destiny waits upon our action. It is a little thing, let it go. It will cure itself in time." We see the error now. It is so easy to see an error a generation too
<pb n="41 The Fifteenth versus the Sixteenth Amendment."/>
late, and the judgment upon this one has been written so plainly upon the wall for, as Wendell Phillips says, though the turning from justice then was so slight, "It took a microscope of the love of justice to see it, but, in a hundred years and less, it widened, and between the two points are half a million graves and three thousand millions of debt."</p>
                        <p>Now a new question of race presents itself beside the new question of sex, as the old one stood beside the question of a Republic's existence in those early days. Fearful and shuddering, women cry,  "If we cast out, this little prejudice, our hopes are ruined. Indeed, we ought not to do it. Millions of suffering women call upon us; we cannot turn deaf ears to their cry." Oh! women of America, will you unread the past, and make your appeal to a pride of race which war has almost burnt out from the American heart? Will you fan the smouldering flames of prejudice to gain the ballot for yourselves? It is a slight turning from justice now. Your microscopes can hardly make it visible, but who can tell how far it may lead us? It is idle to suppose that in this year the nation will refuse to pass the Fifteenth Amendment out of any sense of justice to women. If it is done, the country will be prompted to such action by a prejudice against race, and an underlying distrust of democratic principles. Are the women who, in their efforts to gain suffrage for themselves, stand face to face with a similar prejudice against sex, and the same distrust of the principle of extended suffrage, prepared to inflame this kindred prejudice and increase this disbelief? </p>
                        <p>Would we then desire women to wait, to brood in silence over the wrongs of centuries, while men of all races receive the franchise? By no means. This cause is as holy as any other. We only desire that these two divisions of one army, fighting under the one banner of Equality, strong only in virtue of the selfsame truth, whose "changing affluence" alone differs in these questions of race and sex, should not turn their arms against each other. Work together or separately, but in God's name work not in opposition to each other. </p>
                        <p>Remember Anna Dickinson's assertion, "If I know myself I would go wanting all my days, die steeped in misery to the lips, ere I would gain one right or secure one privilege at the expense of any one more helpless and miserable than myself." Do you say that women are greater sufferers than these outcasts, dragged hither from Africa, or
<pb n="42 The Woman's Advocate."/>
thrown out upon our coasts from Asia's swarming lands? Remember O'Connell, who, when twenty-seven votes were offered him for unhappy Ireland if he would be silent on the slave question, answered, "Gentlemen, God knows that I have the most hapless constituency upon which the sun ever set, but may my right hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth before, to help Ireland, I keep silent on the Negro question."</p>

                        <p>A NOTABLE fact is mentioned with regard to the position of Women in the Regency of Tunis, by our late Consul there, Hon. Amos Perry, whose interesting volumes on "Carthage and Tunis, past and present," in two parts, published at Providence, R. I.,--will well repay perusal. In reference to the special topic referred to, he says:</p>
                        <p>"Female advocates are found at Tunis, whose distinct office it is to manage the cases of female plaintiffs and defendants coming before the highest tribunal in the land, and also to plead the cause of condemned female criminals, who are subjected to unreasonable sufferings in their cells. There are at Tunis three of these professional advocates, one of whom I heard make an effective appeal to the Bey, at a regular session of his Court."</p>
                        <p>That is pretty fair for a Mahommedan country, where women are almost wholly regarded as being without souls. There may be traceable in this some remnant of the Carthagenian or even older civilization which existed in North Africa, many centuries since, and the traces of which are not entirely departed.</p>
                        <p>It appears also that in Tunis there are a number of women to whom popular opinion accords celestial beatitudes, and to whose memory distinguished honors are paid. It is strange that some of our Positivist friends have not called attention thereto, deifying Humanity in the form of woman as they do. There are some of the sex who at Tunis are objects of public veneration on account of their chaste and pure lives. "This homage," Mr. Perry remarks, rendered to abstinence from sensual pleasures, in countries so corrupt, is very remarkable, in showing the * * triumph of the will over passion, and of the spirit over matter."</p>

                           <head>THE NEED OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION.</head>
                           <p>AT the recent very successful meeting of the New England Woman's Suffrage Association--a synopsis of the proceedings of which we present elsewhere--a Resolution was adopted authorizing its Executive Committee to consult with the friends of the Cause throughout the country for the purpose of forming a Woman's National Suffrage Association.</p>
                           <p>That this is a step in the right direction, no one, we think, having 
the good of the Cause at heart, will seriously question. As indispensable to the true prosecution of moral warfare is a thorough organization as it is to physical; and that the Cause, moving with such resistless momentum to a front rank in Reform, has not had a central organization, is an error that cannot too soon be remedied. Much of the success of the Anti-Slavery struggle--the most memorable moral warfare yet waged on this continent--is due, we think, to the fact that, throughout its thirty odd years of persistent agitation, it maintained one organization, presenting, without diversity of opinion or defection from its ranks, a united front, which not all the persecutions heaped upon its members ever weakened or disorganized. And in the cause of Woman Suffrage, an efficient and truly representative national movement, wisely administered, with a concentration of effort on the proposed Sixteenth Amendment and such immediate legislation by Congress as maybe obtained without any Amendment,--would effect what no desultory, local efforts, which are not <hi rend="italic">battles, but merely skirmishes along the line</hi>, could hope to accomplish.</p>
                           <p>But the exigencies of the hour call not alone for a national organization. From the scores of associations throughout the land--from the earnest friends of the Cause, working in manifold ways to promote its interests--from the thinking men and women desiring to ally themselves with the movement, comes up the demand for a POLICY. A Reform that
<pb n="44 The Woman's Advocate."/>
would invite the cooperation of the age, must breathe the spirit of the age. In demanding a withheld right, it must be careful it deny no right, even to the most hapless or degraded of God's children. In this Reform, pregnant beyond all others in consequences for good or evil, appealing, for the justice of its claim, to the highest sentiments in human nature, there should be the north-star of a principle which all eyes may behold. The standard bearing, free and broad, upon its folds, "UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE," should never be lowered by one selfish or unworthy consideration. Marching on to triumphant success, its adherents, the pure, the wise, and the noble of the land, should have the proud consciousness that not one fold of that spotless banner has been tarnished by an unworthy act, but that, every victory over hoary wrong and prejudice has been won by the power of Truth, and must endure.</p>
                           <p>Friends of Woman Suffrage! there must be a National Organization. Present unity, future prosperity, the honor of the Cause, alike demand it. No time should be lost. Let the New England Association, through its Executive Committee, issue a Call for a Delegate Convention to assemble, at some central point, at an early date. Let every existing organization unite in the combined movement. Let all parts of the country, and all diversities of opinion, be duly represented. Carry zeal, philanthropy and wisdom into council; let there be a generous emulation of devotion for principle and the results cannot but be conducive to the best interests of humanity.</p>

                           <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the recent action of the Massachusetts Senate in deciding by a more than two-third vote not to strike out the word "male" from the Constitution of that State as a qualification for voting, we see great cause for hopefulness in surveying the field and reflecting upon what has actually been accomplished.</p>
                           <p>The Lexington and Concord of the war have been fought. In the very able Report of the Senate Committee, valuable hereafter as a campaign document; in the vote it received in that body, and in the interest awakened by the several "hearings," and the discussions upon it, all

throughout the Commonwealth, a victory has been won which cannot be too highly estimated, And which affords an excellent vantage ground for future efforts. Over-sanguine friends of the Cause may have felt disappointed at the smallness of the vote, but we beg such to remember that a <hi rend="italic">one-third vote</hi> in the Senate of Massachusetts, which represents such diverse elements in population, has a significance beyond a similar vote in any one of the younger States of the West, and that it really indicates a marked revolution of opinion among the masses of that Commonwealth. As confirmation of this, we are assured by one having rare opportunities for knowing, that could the Report have been introduced into the House, ONE HUNDRED votes would have been recorded in its favor, and a verdict for Woman Suffrage have gone forth which would have rendered its enactment into law a necessity not to be delayed.</p>
                           <p>Honor to the Committee who have honored themselves by their noble Report! Honor to the NINE who have risen to the height of clearest statesmanship, sustaining such needed legislation! Honor to the men and women of Massachusetts who have labored so earnestly to secure impartial suffrage and rebaptise their State in its historic fame! So much of the work completed, we are confident the task remaining will find warm hearts and ready hands for the brief period required for its final accomplishment.</p>

                        <p>"Warrenton," in his correspondence with the <hi rend="italic">Springfield Republican</hi>, tersely says: "We do not propose to compel women to vote; and whether we should urge them to, would depend upon our views of whether they would vote wisely or not. We only propose that they shall vote if they desire to; that the Constitution and the laws shall not prohibit them. This is all we ask for."</p>

                           <hi rend="italic">The Boston Commonwealth</hi>, to which we always turn with the instinctive assurance of meeting with good things, in its issue of June 12th, says: "Woman's Cause advances! It has just given the encrusted conservatism of Boston a hard knock. Miss Emily J. Harris, a graduate of 
<pb n="46 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the Everett school, daughter of Mr. William G. Harris, the President of the Common Council has been selected to read the Declaration of Independence at the ensuing municipal celebration. By another year who knows but that a lady will deliver the oration?"</p>
                        <p>The Rev. Robert Collyer, in his oration at Chicago, on Commemoration day, as reported by the <hi rend="italic">Christian Register</hi>, paid the following beautiful tribute to Woman: "I could never hope to pardon myself, let alone be pardoned of God and my country if I failed  to speak, at such a time of woman too--and of the woman, in every respect, as the exemplar of the great qualities I have pointed out in the man. The woman stood as truly as the man by this great cause, made her sacrifice as quietly and as perfectly as he did, and on the battle field, or in the hospital, or the home, 
was hero, and patriot, and saviour, too."</p>
                        <p>Miss Mary J. Safford of Cairo, Ill., who delivered the valedictory address at the sixth annual Commencement of the New York Medical College for Women, sailed from this city on the 10th ult. for Europe, whither she goes to complete her medical education. We understand that it is Miss Safford's design to first proceed to Vienna and familiarize herself with the hospital practices of that city, after which she will visit Berlin, Paris, Edinburgh and other cities offering the best opportunities for observation in medical science. The readers of THE ADVOCATE may expect frequently to hear of her movements.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Providence Journal</hi> of a recent date contains a pleasant paper by Mrs. S. H. Whitman, the well-known writer, entitled, "Progressive Women and 'Average Young Men,'" in which there is an admirable refutation of certain views advanced by Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis, author of "Life in the Iron Mill" and other works of acknowledged ability,--in <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Monthly</hi> of some time since. Our readers will observe that our esteemed contributor, Mrs. Hooker, also makes an unanswerable reply to the same article in the very able paper from her pen which we present in the present number of THE ADVOCATE.</p>
                        <p>Bayard Taylor in his valuable "Notes on Foreign Literature," etc., In <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Monthly</hi> for June mentions "That the Kirghiz tribes of Central Asia have lately given a remarkable proof of their capacity for civilization. Some years ago they petitioned the Russian Government to allow a number of their women to be carefully educated in obstetric science, in order to act as experienced midwives for the tribes.
<pb n="47 Notes."/>
The petition was granted, and they are so well satisfied with the result that they now apply, to have certain others of their women educated in all branches of medicine. An exception to the Russian law (which prohibits the study of medicine by women) was obtained with some difficulty, and the Kirghizes are at present paying the expenses of board and study in St. Petersburg for their future doctresses."</p>
                        <p>Miss Edmonia Lewis, the young colored sculptor, with whose works and  history many of our readers are familiar, arrived in this city, from her long sojourn in Rome, early last month. Miss Lewis during her residence in Italy, which extended over five years, executed a variety of statues, groups and busts of well-known persons and objects, as well as ideal pieces, which rank her among the first of our younger artists, and which have found purchasers, or been executed as orders, at remunerative prices. The most of Miss Lewis' completed works remain in Europe, but she brings with her finely executed photographs of some of the principal ones, from which their rare merit can easily be perceived. As Miss Lewis designs remaining in this country but a few months, those who desire to secure some true work of art from her hand will do well to communicate with her at once.</p>
                        <p>Quite an excitement has been created in the Society of Friends, in Indiana, by the preaching of a Mrs. Frame, who has developed a powerful gift of ministry. Creating a revival in the Society, in Richmond, she has succeeded in drawing crowded audiences to the nightly meetings held by the Friends in that city. Mrs. Frame is spoken of as a woman in the prime of life, tall, commanding in appearance, with a voice full of music, that enchants and melts into tears the audiences she addresses. Mrs. Frame was originally a Methodist, but joined, a year or more ago, the Society of Friends, conceiving she had a mission to perform in the ministry that could be more successfully accomplished with that society than any other. Her success has been remarkable. Presbyterians, Methodists and Unitarians are now vying with each other for the privilege of having her preach to their different congregations.</p>
                        <p>A circular has recently been sent to a large number of prominent women, inviting them to attend a meeting to be held in this city on the first Tuesday in October, to organize a Women's Parliament. The object of this Parliament is to organize a legislative body of women to represent women upon all subjects of vital interest to themselves and their children. The function of the Parliament is to crystallize the intelligence and influence of women into a moral and reformatory power,
<pb n="48 The Woman's Advocate."/>
which will act definitely upon all the varied interests of society. Among the special objects  mentioned are public education, prisons and reform schools, hygienic and sanitary reforms, female labor, domestic economy, dishonesty in public life, and so on. It is promised that the Parliament will at once give to women that voice in public affairs which is theirs by virtue of their humanity. We trust that much good may result from so important a movement and await its developing with interest.</p>
                        <p>The first annual meeting of the New England Woman's Club, of which association THE ADVOCATE gave a report in the January number, was held in Chickering's Hall, Boston, May 29th, Mrs. C. M. Severance presiding. Mrs. Abby W. May read a report from the Committee on Work, containing many valuable suggestions, one of the most important of which related to the establishment of a horticultural school for girls, especially with the view of caring for hot-beds and raising early vegetables for market. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe read a report from the Committee on Art and Literature, reviewing what had been done during the past year in the way of lectures, entertainments and social reform, and interesting discussions followed concerning these and other subjects. Mrs. Severance was re-elected President. The New England Woman's Club, we regard as one of the best of existing institutions, of its character, and we are pleased to learn that it enters upon its second year with facilities for the accomplishment of much good.</p>
                        <p>One of the most noticeable features at the recent Printers' National Convention at Albany was the application of Woman's Typographical Union No 1. of this city for a charter from that Association. The Woman's Typographical Union--which was established last winter, and is, we believe, the only Union yet formed by women--deputed two of their number to wait upon the Convention and present their claims for recognition. The ladies were admitted to the full privileges of delegates by the Convention, which, after some discussion, voted to grant charters to Women's Typographical Unions complying with the requirements of the National Organization. This, we believe, is the first instance, in this country, of a Labor Union placing woman upon a level with man as regards standing, representation in council and manual ability; and we are especially glad that so intelligent a class as the printers should be the first to acknowledge to the world that they not only recognize and appreciate woman in the home and social circle, but as an associate, entitled to equal respect and consideration, in all the skilled departments of labor. As THE ADVOCATE, since its establishment, has been under the entire charge of one of those "young women compositors," our readers can

judge how deserved is the compliment paid the Woman's Typographical Union of this city.</p>
                        <p>The widow Van Cott, who is just now the topic of talk in Ulster and Dutchess Counties, and who is the only woman preacher that has been regularly Licensed in this region by the Methodist Church, is reported to be a person possessing very superior power as a preacher, and that her efforts have been attended with the best results. In person Mrs. Van Cott is considerably above the middle height, and very stout, weighing over 200 pounds. She dresses plainly, in black; her manners in private are quiet and unassuming, revealing little of the power latent in her. Her countenance, when at rest, is heavy, but in the excitement of oratory her kindling eye exercises a magnetic influence over her audience. Like most revivalists she is more declamatory than argumentative, appealing more to the passions than the reason. Her articulation is distinct and easily heard in any part of the church (we lad almost said village), and her style being varied does not fatigue the hearer. At times she amuses the fancy with familiar talk, filled with flowery imagery, fixing the attention and winning the confidence of her hearers, till rising with her theme she rushes on with the excitement of inspiration, breaking down the fortifications of the ungodly and carrying their works by storm. She is not an educated woman in the strict sense, and her influence as a consequence is chiefly felt among her own class. She is gifted with a very remarkable flow of language, her gestures are graceful, and her general style would give rise to the remark that she must have derived her ideas of public speaking from dramatic performers.</p>
                        <p>Her powers of endurance are very remarkable, speaking nearly three hours every evening through the week, and twice on Sundays. She has already been instrumental in converting sixty persons at Madalin, and upward of two thousand in the Prattsville District, and has the promise of a long career of usefulness before her.</p>

                        <p>THE Annual Meeting of this Association was held in Boston on the days of the 25th and 26th ult., commencing at Tremont Temple on the evening of the 25th, and continuing, by morning, afternoon, and evening sessions, at Horticultural Hall, throughout the following day. Large and enthusiastic audiences, to the extent of the inadequate capacities of the halls obtained, were in attendance upon every session, and the
<pb n="50 The Woman's Advocate."/>
interests of the Cause were powerfully promoted by the harmony which characterized all the proceedings of the Convention. Upon the platform--by the most of Whom able addresses were delivered--were Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, Wendell Phillips, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Abby Kelley Foster, Lucy Stone, Stephen Foster and other well known friends of Woman Suffrage.</p>
                        <p>The President, Mrs. JUILIA WARD HOWE, called the meeting to order, and presided with skill and dignity through most of the sessions. The introductory address was made by Mrs. Howe, who spoke of the work of the Association for the past year; the present hopeful aspects of the Cause, and closed her very eloquent and appropriate address by welcoming the friends from all parts of the country to the Convention. Alluding to the present advanced stage of the Cause, Mrs. Howe said: </p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>A Christian parable, not quite superceded by the progress of Brahminism among us, receives a new illustration from our experiences. We were all well-wishers to our sex before we began to help them, but our passive good-will was laid away in a napkin, and though it was a comfortable circumstance for us to remember, it was dead capital, and gained nothing. But we have now invested our good-will in effort, and its multiplication surprises us. What marvellous seed did we sow in the field that it should bear such a sudden and weighty crop? Ah! the silent centuries had furrowed it for us. The eternal sun had warmed and fertilized its bosom. When the convenient time came, we scattered our little endeavor, and the harvest is one that shall feed the future.</p>
                           <p>"Friends sometimes condole with us on our grave deficiency in means of progress. They say: 'One important thing you want. You have no opposition.' This is not true. We have an opposition, but have scarcely worked long enough to know where to place it. I think that we shall find it partly in the conventional prejudices of society, but far more in the <hi rend="italic">vis inerti&#x00E6;</hi> and indifference of women. From them, if from anyone, will come the temporary ignoring and reprobation of our reform. Intelligent and honest men--the real male power of the community--are almost unanimously agreed that women ought to have the suffrage if they want it, while the wisest see that they should have it whether or no. But among women, large numbers, particularly of the prosperous classes, are indifferent or inimical to, the enfranchisement of their sex. We must remember that reforms rarely begin with this class. To the poor, the Gospel is preached--to the poor, it means something.</p>

                        <p>Following Mrs. HOWE, the Hon. JAMES W. STILLMAN, the able advocate of Woman Suffrage in the Rhode Island Legislature, addressed the Convention. Mr. Stillman spoke at some length of the force of custom and traditionary prejudice, the right of suffrage to every human being irrespective of color, race or sex, and was succeeded by Mrs. MARY A. LIVERMORE, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Agitator</hi>, and one of the ablest advocates of Woman Suffrage in the West.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. LIVERMORE, spoke at length of the disadvantages under which women labor; of the progress of the Cause in the West; of the natural harmony of the sexes; of the good results of women voting, etc. Concerning the services rendered to the country by women, Mrs. Livermore said:</p>

back; The South is billowy with their graves. During those long years of trial we read, and thought, and grew up to the full stature of men. We cannot go back. We must examine your action and judge of your policy. We shall say this is right, and that is wrong. We have reached a grander development than ever before; and we now look for a fulfillment of the noble words of the apostle:-There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."</p>

                        <p>The address of Mrs. Livermore closed the speaking of the evening session. The following day addresses were delivered by Wendell Phillips, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Rev. Gilbert Haven, Lucy Stone, Rev. Phebe.A. Hanaford, Stephen S. Foster, Mrs. Mary F. Davis, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and Mrs. F. E. W. Harper, all of whom spoke acceptably and were listened to with interest by the audience.</p>
                        <p>WENDELL PHILLIPS, the first speaker at the morning session, was recelved with great applause. From his very able address, we present a single extract:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>"It is an error to, suppose that the Woman's Rights cause seeks to obtain for woman any more influence than she has had. What the Woman's Rights cause seeks to do is to drag the irresponsible influence which woman has had in moulding the force of events and the history of her times, up to the light and stamp it with the signet of political power and make it responsible in the face of the day. Our object is to draw her out of her own isolated realm and make her take her fair share of responsibility in the civil arena. Why does the wealth of Beacon street pour out its millions to cover every cradle of the most friendless child of the most obscure emigrant, with the finest influence of Massachusetts civilization? What produces the machinery of our public schools, the wonder of the world? Why is England on the other side of the water a whole century behind us, discussing religious schools and limited schools and private schools and endowed schools, and all sorts of schools except public schools. Because when Lord Shaftesbury looks down into the cradle of a London pauper he has no dread of it. That child will never lift up its hand to influence legislation except in some volcanic hour of absolute revolution. But when the wealth of the Republic looks down into a poor man's cradle it remembers that that tiny hand will in due time wield the ballot, and selfish, careful, far-sighted, sagacious wealth hastens to put on one side of that baby, morality, and on the other intelligence, in order that its own roof may be safe and its own cradle free from peril." (Applause).</p>

                        <p>RALPH WALDO EMERSON, in his eloquent address, paid the following beautiful tribute to Woman:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>"In all ages woman has been the representative of religion. In all countries it is the women who fill the temples. In every religious movement the woman has been an active and powerful part not only in the most civilized, but in the most uncivilized countries; not less in the Mahommedan than the Greek and Roman religions. She holds man to religion. There is no man so reprobate, so careless of religious duty, but what delights to have his wife a saint. All men feel the advantages that abound In that quality in a woman. I think it was her instinct in the dark superstitions of the Middle Ages which tempered the hardness of theology by making the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, the intercessor to whom all prayers were directed."</p>

                        <p>Letters of encouragement and sympathy were read from John Stuart Mill, George Wm. Curtis, Robert Collyer, Lucretia Mott, Anna E. Dickinson and others.

                           <p>Many of the readers of the magazines of the day have undoubtedly noticed, here and there amid the multiplicity of verse, occasional contributions far above mediocrity in poetic excellence, and learned to associate the name of the writer with the strains which had left such pleasant echo of melody.</p>
                           <p>Miss Bristol has evidently formed her taste on writers of the Jean Ingelow school, and there is an occasional unpleasantness of a borrowed phrase or figure, of which we doubt not the writer is wholly unconscious; but an imaginative and truly poetic nature has preserved her from any flagrant offence of unwitting plagiarism, as indeed there is no occasion, for assured are we that Miss Bristol has only to draw upon the rich stores of her own fancy--to develop the gifts which she possesses, to make her name one of the most cherished of America's daughters of song.</p>
                           <p>As an illustration of the boldness as well as of the sweetness of Miss Bristol's muse, we extract a portion of the touchingly beautiful tribute to the late President Lincoln:

                           <head>THINK AND ACT. A series of Articles Pertaining to Men and Women, Work and Wages. By Virginia Penny. Cloth, 372 pp. Philadelphia: Claxton, Remsen &#x0026; Haffelfinger, Publishers.</head>
                           <p>Not one of the least valuable contributions to the growing question of "Woman's Labor and Just Compensation" is the above beautifully issued volume. Miss Penny modestly states in her preface that "It makes no pretension to anything more than it is--a few sober reflections on woman and her business interests," but the careful reader will note much in its pages that betrays a knowledge of contemporary works, a keen observation of existing facts, and a close research into the underlying causes of perpetuated wrong. The author naturally attaches great importance to the need of more varied occupations for women, and a large proportion of the volume is devoted to a consideration of what these should be. Less lo(rical in thou(rht than Mrs. Dall, and less artistic in sentence construction, Miss Penny is yet no unworthy disciple of that able Writer and Thinker; and her volume, pleasant in style and rarely tiresome or unmethodical in arrangement, will well repay perusal. One of the most encouraging signs of the times is the awakened demand for such a class of literature, and we recommend with confidence Miss Penny's book to all who desire information upon the wide range of subjects treated in its pages. The volume is issued in excellent style by the enterprising publishers, Messrs. Claxton, Remen &#x0026; Co., who are fast establishing a reputation for publishing works of a meritorious character.</p>

We quote a single passage, not only as a foretaste of the enjoyment of the poem, but as evidence of what may be expected from a richly endowed race who are destined to leave an indellible mark on our literature:

                           <p>This volume, to which is added <hi rend="italic">Woman versus Ballot</hi>, has been so widely discussed it seems scarcely necessary to add a word concerning it. It consists of a series of discourses, narrow and dogmatic in character, by a New England pastor who regards the Woman Question, as <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Monthly</hi> very sensibly observes, "precisely as Slavery was regarded in the discourses of those old-time clergy men, who took 'Cursed be Canaan' for their text." In regard to the reverend gentleman's "scriptural argument," the same writer also says, "this argument is, we say, unmitigated bigotry, and will meet with nothing better than contempt from those who believe that the Bible was made for Man and not Man for the Bible."</p>

Spooner, of Boston, Mass., will act as General Agent for New England, and all subscriptions or advertisements designed for THE ADVOCATE may be entrusted to his care. Mr. Spooner is well known to many of our readers, not only as possessing fine business capacities, but as an active reformer, identified with all liberal movements, and we bespeak for him everywhere the co-operation of all friends of progress.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. E. W. Phillips, 805 Spring Garden street, Philadelphia, will hereafter act as Agent for THE ADVOCATE for the city and immediate vicinity. Mrs. Phillips is a noble woman, deeply interested in reformatory questions, and will be glad to serve friends in the above capacity as may be desired.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. J. B. Quimby is rendering THE ADVOCATE efficient service in Cincinnati, and all orders entrusted to her will receive prompt attention.</p>

                        <p>BEFORE turning away from the public life of women, let me give from my Oriental studies, such a picture of a Queen as I would gladly see our sovereign ladies emulate. The Mahrattas are a Hindu tribe living like Cossacks in the mountains between Surat and Goa. Their last shepherd prince, Holkar, sovereign of Indore, died early in this century. Among the people of rank in this tribe it is neither customary to confine nor to veil the women. Aliah Bae<ref target="wa2.202n1">*</ref> therefore offended no prejudice when she assumed the management of affairs after the death of her husband, and transacted business in open council. Her administration in Malwa stands out like a spot of sunny green from the surrounding waste. Her great aim was to raise the agricultural classes. She considered them the backbone of a State which derived its chief revenues from land, and strove to encourage the culture of the soil by light taxes and a sacred respect for proprietory rights. She made use of courts of arbitration but was herself always accessible to appeals, and on all points connected with the administration of justice, she was most patient and
<note id="wa2.202n1" place="foot" anchored="yes"> *The reign of Aliah Bae must have been before 1799, the year in which Tippoo Seib died. He was I believe the only Sooltan of Mysore but my extracts do not show the exact date.</note>
                           <pb n="58 The Woman's Advocate."/>
unwearied. A deep sense of responsibility weighed upon her. "I am answerable to God for every exercise of my power," said this Mahratta Queen, and when urged by her ministers to put a convict to death, she replied, "Let a mortal hesitate to destroy the work of the Almighty." For more than twenty years she sustained the country. Free from external aggression, it enjoyed the most perfect internal peace. It was the joy of her life to watch the increasing content and prosperity of her people. Instead of considering an increase of wealth as an excuse for increased taxation, she held it as a legitimate claim for protection. Under her care, Indore, the present capital, rose from a straggling village to a wealthy town. She constructed roads across the Ghauts which intersect Malwa, and built resting places, and dug wells for travellers throughout her kingdom. Everywhere she was admired and respected. Any man of her own people would have died in her defense. The Nizam of Hyderabad and the Sooltan of Mysore paid her the same respect as the Paishwa. Mahommedans united with Hindus to pray for her long life.</p>
                        <p>A Brahmin wrote book in her praise. She heard it read with patience and then ordered it thrown into the river!</p>
                        <p>"She was a woman without vanity, a bigot without intolerance, imbued with the deepest superstition, yet harboring no impressions save such as led to the happiness of those under her influence, exercising despotic power not only with humility, but under the severest restraints of conscience, and with a tender consideration for the weaknesses of others."</p>
                        <p>"She was goodness in its widest sense personified," wrote Sir John Malcolm, "and no sooner did she die than her happy people were plunged into civil war by the follies of men!"</p>
                        <p>How many people who read the fifth chapter of Judges, observe the significance of the statements in reference to Deborah's reign?--"The villages ceased, until I, Deborah, arose," and "The land had rest for forty years!"</p>
                        <p>But such sovereigns will not be possible to Western civilization until the wholesome good sense of the following letter prevails everywhere:<lb/>

                                 <p>In the last number of the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> I noticed a paragraph stating that the compensation of the women in the departments at Washington was about to be made the same as that paid to

men; and, as a woman and an employee of the government, I trust there can be no objection against my expressing my views regarding the subject.</p>
                                 <p>The masses of women at the present time employed in the departments are not possessed very brilliant clerical abilities. On the contrary, very many of them have scarcely education enough to tell the day of the week by a counting-house calender; and they owe their appointments and continuance in office to their personal advantages. When a man receives an appointment to a clerkship he is obliged to appear before a board of departmental officers and undergo an examination; and, although the examination is not so strict as that imposed on the graduating class of a New England college, it is so difficult that not one woman in a hundred could pass it satisfactorily.</p>
                                 <p>I, for one, claim that women-educated women, Of course-are as competent to perform the brain labor as men; but I do most emphatically object  to having girls in their teens, With no other recommendation than a pretty face or a pretty foot, place themselves on an intellectual par with men and women of education.</p>
                                 <p>I am sorry to make the confession, but the truth forces it, that the departments are filled with females-crowded, I may say, with those who serve the government in no other way except to embarrass the public officials in the discharge of their duties. I could furnish the names of scores and scores of women, whom the heads of departments have tried to get rid for months and years, as being utterly worthless, yet have been unable to do so owing to outside influences. I could furnish the names of scores of women who do not perform an hour's work per diem for the government; not in every instance because they are unwilling, but cause they do not have the work-there being too many engaged in the same labor. In the office of the Comptroller of the Currency, for instance, one-third of the force employed would quite sufficient to perform the labor. This is no speculation on my part. I know whereof I affirm.</p>
                                 <p>In the Post Office Department the law provides for fifty female clerks, and desks are arranged for that number; yet ex-Postmaster General Randall appointed one hundred and five. During the two weeks immediately prior to his exit he appointed thirty female clerks; and for what reason Heaven only knows, since nearly one-fifth of those already employed had nothing to do--nay, not even a seat in the office. I can conceive of no earthly object Randall had in appointing these women, unless it was to embarrass his successor.</p>
                                 <p>In conclusion, I hold that women who are competent to perform the same labor as men, should receive the same compensation, and be subject to the same conditions, for violating which they should be dismissed.</p>
                                 <p>Every woman employed should be subjected to the same examination as men, and personal beauty or laxity of morals ought not to be a recommendation, as is too often the case. The examining board should be women. In order to prevent corruption in all bureaus where women are employed, there should be female auditors. I have an instance in my mind where one malicious woman-clerk caused the removal of some five or six faithful men, simply cause they refused to lend money to her husband (?), a worthless blackguard, who never paid his debts. I am happy to state that the auditor who made these removals has just resigned and gone to the West.</p>
                                 <p>Congress or the President ought to afford us some protection, if they allow us to occupy offices. We ought not to be insulted by having the paramours and mistresses of members of
<pb n="60 The Woman's Advodate."/>
Congress forced upon us, and be obliged to tolerate their society day by day. Let Mr. Boutwell clean out the riff-raff and pollution of his department. Let him appoint moral and competent women; and then let us be paid according to our merits. Such is the earnest prayer of every honest woman-clerk.</p>

                        <p>There has been a good deal of discussion about the identity of Hannah Tyler, but does not the letter carry its own witness ? It is bold and faithful, and revives one's faith in the possibility of a woman's doing <hi rend="italic">thorough work</hi>. How significant it is that society <hi rend="italic">will have</hi> thorough work of its women--will let them starve unless they furnish it, although there be not a male mechanic capable of the same thing in the length and breadth of the land! The arguments in this letter apply to every field of employment where men and women meet; it is womanly in the best sense, and only sustains representations constantly made to me, from private sources. Her suggestions in regard to "Examining Boards" of women, must be followed eventually in all departments of labor open to both sexes.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of this paper, I say--" People talk about the impossibility of women being faithful to home duties, and at the same time 'absorbed in <hi rend="italic">political life</hi>.' But why should we be <hi rend="italic">absorbed</hi> in political life?"</p>
                        <p>This is the tone which it was fit to take in reference to this question, while every man's hand was against us, and only exceptional women were likely to make a stand against public opinion. But things have changed since I made a habit of meeting the popular outcry in this way. Now that clubs are forming everywhere; now that five women--whose names are not worth recording--apply for registration at Washington, in a single week, it is necessary to inquire what are the possible dangers to domestic life from the new condition of things.</p>
                        <p>I do not think these dangers are more serious in connection with political responsibility, than in a literary or business career--than they always must be, in short, to any mother whose duty it is to provide for her children while she is rearing them.</p>
                        <p>Taken against <hi rend="italic">the total number</hi> of women, the number of young mothers who are laborers has always been few, and their necessity has so far been considered a misfortune. Such <hi rend="italic">I</hi> consider it. Among all the nonsense that Michelet has talked, this at least is eternally true; that while a woman is bearing and rearing children, the charge of her own
<pb n="61 Breakers!"/>
household, is quite as much as she is capable of, without injury to them. Let her study, let her sew, let her pursue a trade even, but let it be with reference to her children's well-being, for their sakes, or for occasional rest, but let it not be under the pressure of necessity, if she can be spared. The first concomitant of happy motherhood, is an easy, restful mind--the next a comfortable, and never over-taxed body--the third the ability to put everything but home and children under the feet when a woman so pleases.</p>
                        <p>The special danger of the present moment is, that a great many quiet, little women, rushing into club life for relaxation, or into political interests from a sense of duty, should be drawn out of the safe circle where centripetal and centrifugal forces always balance each other, into that unknown ellipse, in which nothing but comets can revolve. I must speak out of my own experience in this matter, for in no other way should I be able to justify the strong words I mean to speak The apparent leaders of public movements I do not hope to influence, but scattered throughout the land on every side are conscientious women, desirous of doing their whole duty, and by them I know that my words will be heeded.</p>
                        <p>I had a double responsibility when my own children were young, and I am not supposed to have failed in it, but I have lived to see other women quoting my example, and following my mistakes, and so I feel a need to let the conscious failure cry out.</p>
                        <p>Only a little while ago, the happy young wife of a clergyman in comfortable circumstances, who had lost one infant and expected soon to find another, begged me to help her to a situation as the teacher of a school. One other in the last years of the war, left a child of ten to very doubtful superintendence, and went with a new hope in her mother's heart into the service of the hospitals for some months. Both of these women were vexed with me because I did not encourage them. When I pointed out what seemed to me their obvious duties to children born and unborn, they retorted sharply : "But <hi rend="italic">you</hi> did these things, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wrote, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> taught, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> took up all the Reforms there were going, why do you want to shut <hi rend="italic">us</hi> out?"</p>
                        <p>Truly, why should I? It is hard to show the difference in the way of doing things; to prove first an exceptional organization, capable of very
<pb n="62 The Woman's Advocate."/>
hard labor and great endurance--second, a great fondness for home and children, and the conscientious resolution never to let any hands but my wash and dress my children, never to let household duty wait on other cares but always the other cares on the home duty;--but if the women to whom I plead should allow me these, there are still failures enough, failures that could not have come, had I known no cares but those which properly belonged to the functions of that period of my life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should have staid so willingly in a narrow circle shut in by the intensest natural affections, that I needed to be goaded out of it, by every discipline and reverse, which God could bring out of my own circumstances. To-day, I see many women who seem to have so little natural love of home, that it needs to be nursed into a proper development. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never left my children to the care of servants or parted from them during the night. Our streets show crowds of little carriages now, whose occupants seldom see their mothers by daylight.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was a housekeeper born, thrifty in all the inherited instincts of a score of generations. It cannot but happen, that among the women now looking <hi rend="italic">outward</hi> for happiness there will be many to whom household cares are distasteful, and the outward life in consequence a snare.</p>
                        <p>My ideas of a happy home are very old-fashioned, but I must stand by them for all that.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough that two loving people go together to some house which is filled in the process of time by healthy and winning creatures who owe life to their love. This home must be the centre of wholesome education, for father, mother and children.</p>
                        <p>As a house it must be tidy and well kept, but not with "cold comfort." The radiance of the hearth and the lamp must flow out over the door-stone and tempt others in. It must be cozy, bright with touches of <hi rend="italic">real living</hi>, and warm with friendly welcome. Out of it must flow a beneficent stream of help for all living souls so far as they can be served without destroying its integrity. Not only the family must be comfortable, but all other families more comfortable on account of this one.</p>
                        <p>"Be ye therefore perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect," said Jesus, but how few of us ever take the words as a practical guide!
<pb n="63 Breakers!"/>
He is perfect in love, so perfect that it sometimes seems as if He could love no one else at all, He loves us so well. Perfect in beneficence, for his gifts flow in and out and on all sides, and by their very multitude keep us from being conscious of their weight. We sometimes say that men are ungrateful. God does not require them to be consciously grateful, rather to be happy, and like this Father in Heaven, the mother of a family should strive to be, the source of constantly flowing comfort and joy, unrecognized because it is steady. To such a home all the world wishes to come, its gates are always open, and it is obvious that she who presides over it must be <hi rend="italic">chiefly at home</hi>. The smallest thing that any one can give is money, and accordingly God does not provide it for every home. Love, care, thought, blessing; these richest providences are possible wherever there is a woman's heart, and through them she may suggest infinite joys to many a bewildered soul. And what is thus <hi rend="italic">given</hi> may also be <hi rend="italic">taken into</hi> her charmed circle, for why should we refuse what any offer, if it be really "more blessed to give than to receive?" Are we not willing sometimes to be less happy that others may be more so? I think we can all remember home like this--homes that were never empty; on whose hearth one welcoming presence always stood; out of whose doors the stream of hospitality always flowed. They began before clubs and evening lectures and they will long survive them. They are possible with club and lecture, but <hi rend="italic">only where these are held as of a secondary and trivial import</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Now, what held these homes together ? It certainly was not the walls of a house, for I have known them transferred from courtly halls to log cabins on the Western prairies. I believe it is generally one motherly presence, if not that alone, it is such a presence sustained by the "<hi rend="italic">house-band</hi>" of the old Saxon law. In this home the mother personally cares for every child; its bath, its walk, its daily schooling come under her charge with hand and eye she helps it; with its teachers she forms friendly relations that they may know the children through her and be warned of changes in health, circumstance or character that may influence the daily bearing. When she gathers them under her own wing, she listens to every complaint or doubt, shares every trivial confidence, and with a mind wholly free from every embarrassment, thinking only of them, she makes these complaints and
<pb n="64 The Woman's Advocate."/>
confidences supreme, and gives to them such listening as children love. By constant watchfulness, she keeps their affection, and their friends are her own. If her children have intimates--they do not become tempters. They are drawn into the sweet home-circle over which she presides and she is a mother to them all. However poor she may be, her housekeeping will show some constant thought of these young members. The daily loaf will now and then show a raisin or a taste of sugar that the cook would have left out. If a young visitor appears, something very nice will be "whipped up" unexpectedly for tea, and if a petted playmate is sick, the "delicate morsel" will surely find its way, from this hearth to the other. Oh, howl close and sweet are the ties so knitted, and not one need be lost in the "new time" provided the law of proportion be kept, and the mother remain Queen in her home!</p>
                        <p>I plead earnestly that she will do so, because I know how easy it would have been for me to have lost my throne. My husband used to laugh at me in our early days, because I set my small cares so far above the literary work I loved. One morning I sat down to write a story for which there was immediate demand. I tried it for two hours, but lily conscience kept thrusting at me, a certain inaccessible precinct of my husband's study, which I had made it a law unto myself to dust daily. I had omitted this dusting in my haste to satisfy the printer, and I tried to be callous. But that ghost could only be laid by duty done, and my husband looked up in amusement, when I went back to his shelves.</p>
                        <p>"If you had been a mere housekeeper," said he, "you would never have worried about that. It is the morbidness which comes of overtaxing yourself." And so, I freely acknowledge it to be, looking back at it to-day, and knowing that no one would have been the worse for that small neglect. If there is to be morbidness, however, I would rather see it in such a direction, but what of the <hi rend="italic">overtaxing</hi> which creates it? That is insidious--an enemy that follows and will never confront us. I should have done well, if all my difficulties had been of this open kind. My literary work was profitable. Reform work could not be. Indeed I could seldom engage in the latter without risking the former and long before I ever spoke in public, the seriousness of all the issues involved, induced a preoccupation of mind which was not good for my little ones. I thought I made them my first object. I should have resented the sug-
<pb n="65 Breakers!"/>
gestion that any children could be better cared for than mine. Did I not constantly cater with my own hands for their bodily comfort? What nurse ever dragged <hi rend="italic">my</hi> baby up "the long path?" But alas! was there no inner world of thought and feeling of which I was only half conscious? Was there <hi rend="italic">no</hi> guest at my fireside that I did not know ? I know it very often happened when my babies hushed their voices, and played at my feet, that, feeling safe about them, I lost sight of them altogether, in my work--till an angry word or a merry laugh brought me back to them. How did the angry word or the merry laugh come? I did not know. If I had sat there with my sewing, thinking more of them than my work, I could not have failed to see. As it was, I lost some of my best opportunities, and every now and then a little surprise came and made me feel that I did not know my children. A mother needs leisure to spend with her children. If God spares a whole eternity to lesson man, we may well spare time to the same end, but we are apt to lose sight of the importance of it, until it is too late. At one moment, I feared that my children might grow away from me, but I found out the danger just in time, and some common sorrows soon bound their growing hearts to mine.</p>
                        <p>I had no leisure, and therefore I could not always listen to complaints or share confidences. They felt what no children ever should feel, that their mother, no matter how kind, was apt to be in a hurry. I could not anticipate wishes that I never discovered, and it was not so often as I now desire that I gathered them both in my arms, and rocked them in the twilight. "All this might I have done, and yet not left the other undone."</p>
                        <p>Let my warning words show others where the danger lies.</p>
                        <p>My want of leisure prevented me from being an attractive hostess at the very time when it was most important to my children's welfare that I should be so. Loved by a small circle, I ought to have been liked by a larger. If women cannot see this danger for themselves they know very well that it threatens their husbands. No woman ever married a literary man, without finding it difficult to adjust and sustain her relations to society. His coy muse and his printer's devil, always seem to hover over the very hour sacred to weddings, house-warmings, and friendly
<pb n="66 The Woman's Advocate."/>
receptions. His thoughts are "somewhere else," his mood is unfriendly, his temper and his pneumo-gastric nerve are alike exhausted.</p>
                        <p>Now that women are to be generally welcomed into the wider circle of human interests, I should like to see them begin as children to share the conversation of their parents on the topics it embraces. They will deduce from this such general principles as they need, and can test by their own early  married experience. </p>
                        <p>Leaving out of view the exceptional cases which are their own justification I would have women keep outof active public life until the fortieth year is past. Then private and public duties need never conflict.</p>

                        <p>THOUGH women go to the polls, there will be faithful wives and true mothers still. The marriage bond will be as sacred, and the sanctities of home the very same that they are to-day. We do not desire to subvert any of the institutions which God has ordained.

                           <p>TWO young women crooning in the October twilight, but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> talking over their love affairs! Can the vain masculine reader credit this statement? They had been sitting there half an hour, too, in that dainty hall-chamber, talking earnestly of many things; but until the moment when we interrupt them, the pronoun "he" had not passed their lips. The inevitable subject <hi rend="italic">did</hi> come at last, however as Anne Markham demurely asked her friend: "How many unfortunates have you rejected since I saw you last week?"</p>
                           <p>"O! not a victim!" laughed the clear-voiced Margaret. "I am not quite such a Vanquisher as you always try to prove. There is the doorbell! Now, do you suppose that is any one who will stay and spoil this delicious little t&#x00EA;te-&#x00E0;-t&#x00EA;te? Tom and Alice went off so unexpectedly that the Parish doesn't fully know the fact, and continues to call. So I have some prosy interviews, I assure you."</p>
                           <p>Here the little nut-brown chambermaid and door-tender of the Rectory tapped at Miss Alden's door with a card. "The Rev. Launcelot Jones," sighed Margaret, with a shrug of her faultless shoulders, as soon as Rosa had vanished. "Well, Anne, come down. We'll try not to be entertaining and perhaps he won't, stay long. I never have any quiet chats with you now-a-days."</p>
                           <p>But Anne did not budge from the hassock where she was sitting, her elbow propped on the low window-sill. Shaking her head, with a smile of determination, she said : "I will wait for you here. Who is he? that slim ecclesiastic who escorted you home from St. Ignatius' one day last Lent, when I happened to be with you ? I have played that humble role of third party pretty often, haven't I? Of course he has come to ask you if you will 'love , honor and obey' him, and I won't make myself odious by being third party, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time! Am I too clairvoyant? Sorry, dear, but I can't help my gift of divination. Only be quick! Say 'No,' as soon as possible, and hurry up here again!"</p>
                           <p>"Nonsense, Anne, come down stairs!"</p>
                           <p>But she plead in vain. Anne composedly opened "Mill on Liberty," and began to read aloud, with an utterly absorbed expression of countenance. "Don't be afraid! I won't listen over the balluster,"--she said, stopping suddenly, her grey eyes dancing; then plunged into her book again, deaf to entreaties, unmoved by pinches and pulls. Margaret left her at last, in despair, revenging herself by declaring: "If you hadn't
<pb n="69 To Warn, to Comfort, and Command."/>
been so contrary, I might have sent him word that I was engaged. Now there is no knowing how long he may stay!"</p>
                           <p>After she had gone, Anne read a little farther by the fading twilight then the book slipped from her clasp, and she leaned dreamily upon the window-sill, looking beyond the street and its row of elms, black against the pale yellow sky, over at the river shining faintly among the green flats. She was thinking as she looked off into the fair Western light, how clear and peaceful it was--how she wished she could always live with Margaret, in some pretty place like this, and grow strong and brave and serene, like her. When I can appreciate that true, high-hearted woman so fully, why can't I be like her she thought, and a little scowl of self-disgust knotted her forehead; "Shall I always be incomplete and unstable, doing constant violence to my ideals?--with a streak of nobleness here, and a streak of cowardice there,--strong, for a little space, and then weak and discouraged? Why wasn't I poised like her, in the beginning? and then I needn't be always tinkering at myself, but could go among people to heal and uplift, as she can. I am tired of fighting these despicable foes! Margaret's faults are so different. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is of the true heroic stamp!" She knocked her slender hand impatiently against the fastening of the window-blind, and was glad that it hurt her. It was somehow a satisfaction. Then as her eyes rested again on the calm sky, and the few early stars that were twinkling among the elm-branches, they suddenly fllled with tears, and she repeated to herself the old words which had comforted her many times before: "It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves." " I am not to blame for my organization. That is very evident. I must take myself as I find myself, and He will help me to grow into something nobler than I am. I will struggle with my weakness, and grow truer to what strength I have. I really am a little stronger and steadier than I was, thank God!"</p>
                           <p>The earnest, irregular face--the figure which was not without a certain grace, but wanted steadiness of bearing, told to an acute observer just what Anne's own consciousness often and accusingly told her. "If I can only get really poised!" was her secret ejaculation, many times in every day. The type of character is a familiar one. We meet it daily. In fact, is there one of us who does not often feel that the lesson of life will be learned when the soul is justly balanced, and true to the one Eternal Magnet ?</p>
                           <p>Anne was right, too, in believing that she was growing stronger. She <hi rend="italic">was</hi> learning slowly what her impressible, easily-jarred nature most needed-that self-reliance which is born of courage and humility. In this development Margaret's rounded character was constantly aiding her by that mysterious but potent force,--unconscious influence.</p>
                           <p>Her reveries came to an end as she heard the street-door shut, and
<pb n="70 The Woman's Advocate."/>
turning her head she waited Margaret's entrance, with an amused, dimpling smile playing about her mouth. "Pink cheeks and a bunch of heliotropes are what you have brought away from that encounter," she remarked, scanning her friend critically,--"Take a seat, Miss, and tell me all about it!"</p>
                           <p>Margaret, with the indefinable grace which distinguished her from most women, sank into a low chair opposite Anne's hassock, and sighed slightly as she said: "It is too bad! but I believe it isn't my fault. I thought I had been as cool and stupid towards him as possible, ever since I saw he had the least penchant for me. But I understand now, he fancies the cool and stupid style, and calls it statuesque! Poor fellow! I hope it will not do him any harm. I do not really think it will."</p>
                           <p>Anne's hands stroked the silver-grey folds of her friend's dress caressingly, and a little silence fell upon the two girls. They had warm hearts that grieved for the disappointment of any man's honest love, though they both must have felt that the graceful, dainty-featured young clergyman was not the true mate for the woman to whom he had lifted his homage.</p>
                           <p>After a pause, Anne said, dimpling again, "I can testify that you took pains, that day, going home from St. Ignatius', to remind him that you were not a church-woman."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, I have lugged all my heresies into our conversations, and shocked him within an inch of his life by alluding to Woman's Rights meetings that I had attended, offering him a pamphlet on Woman's Suffrage, and once, out of pure mischief, but with all apparent innocence, I inquired if he had investigated Spiritualism to any extent!--I don't exactly see what he would have done with me if he had got me," she added, laughing.</p>
                           <p>"Nor I" said Anne, " it is the strangest piece of daring in a proper young man that I have heard of, lately. I suppose he thought that he and, your sister Alice and your reverend brother-in-law, amongst them, might be able to remodel your opinions. Or, in fact, I suppose the young man was just utterly in love, and that was the end of it!"</p>
                           <p>"There comes little Madge, bless her!" said Aunt Margaret, as they heard pattering feet and merry childish lingo in the hall. The door opened, letting in a blue-eyed thing with wonderful flossy hair, which was just as shiny and rippling as if nature had "crimped" it instead of that proud and devoted Nursery-maid, Katy McFarland. Four arms were opened, and the chubby three-year-old was taken into a double embrace. There was grand frolicking and kissing and story-telling, and talk about Mamma and Papa, who would be back in four days more, counted on Madge's plump fingers, and then the sweet morsel was picked up in its
<pb n="71 To Warn, to Comfort, and Command."/>
Aunty's arms, and carried off to bed. Anne, meanwhile, had time for more of Mill, and for more reveries. As Margaret came in again, she laid her hands gently on her friend's head, saying: "My dear girl, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a strange world; that is what you were thinking.</p>
                           <p>"Yes," said Anne, "Life is strange and Love is strange."</p>
                           <p>"And Love is not all of Life," added Margaret.</p>
                           <p>"No," rejoined the other, "lovers' Love is not all of life, but it is a beautiful element in it, and I hope it will some day become a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> element in yours. I am quite sure it will, and I shall rejoice! These lovers of yours, so far, have never reached the citadel, at all, I think ?" with a look which had barely the shadow of a question in it.</p>
                           <p>Margaret shook her head. "No, one or two of them are dear friends in whom I shall always trust. One I might possibly have loved, if he had lived, and I had known him better." A slight tremor in her voice was her tribute to the noble heart of that dead soldier. "But whether I ever chance to be sought by the man whom I shall love and reverence as I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> love and reverence my husband, is very uncertain, and I think,"-she added, with a smile, and the sweet, brave look in her eyes that Anne loved best of all, and secretly named her "heroine-look,"--"there is a plenty for me to do and enjoy in this world, without that joy in addition."</p>
                           <p>"Very proper sentiments, Miss Alden, but that joy <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come to you I prophesy. You are--</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>--"'planned<lb/>

                           </q>
                           <p>I spare you the adulation of quoting the first line of the couplet, besides I don't think you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> exactly a 'perfect woman,' you know. You have shown me that you were mortal several times in our acquaintance. But I think you would 'warn, comfort and command' some gentleman so finely that I can't allow your gifts in those three directions to be wasted."</p>
                           <p>"I suppose I could have done all that for the Rev. Launcelot," said Margaret laughingly, "but, if you please, you dear little Woman's Rights Advocate, I would like a chance to 'obey' once in a while, too." 
"Yes, I know--combine all the functions--'Love, honor, command and obey,' I think the service should read; and the same words should be put to both bride and bridegroom, if I had my way."</p>
                           <p>"Leaving the proportions of command and obedience to be adjusted according to the respective strength of will of the combatants, I suppose! I don't think you would alter matters very much, after all! But, Anne, you never allude to marriage as among the possibilities of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> future. I can reciprocate all these good-natured wishes of yours, I am sure."
<pb n="72 The Woman's Advocate."/>
"No," said Anne, positively, "I am an irregular, incomplete affair. And as I realize the fact, I hope I should have too much principle to impose myself upon any man whom I honored. And I suppose you would hardly want me to marry any one else?"</p>
                           <p>"If people waited until they were 'complete,' how many marriages do you think there would be in a year?" asked Margaret. You are half-mad, Anne, on the subject of 'completeness' and 'harmony.' One would think there were no virtues worth mentioning besides 'steadfastness,' 'serenity' and 'self-possession.' Don't you realize that you have qualities, which some of us whom you are so fond of calling 'steady,' may lack? Don't you suppose I ever feel myself selfish and apathetic, when I see you toiling so busily for others? Don't you know that you stimulate me, often and often ? And supposing you should fall deeply in love with some man of the 'steady' sort, don't yon think, while he would be a constant strength to you, you could often inspire him with subtle, electric energies?"</p>
                           <p>"O, I don't know, Margaret, I don't think its my vocation. I am morbid and self-conscious; sometimes elated, and sometimes depressed. In short, I have the style of faults that I particularly detest. My insight is ahead of my will, and I think I shall get on faster in whipping up my will if I work by myself. Any of the 'steady' men, unless they are stupid, and then I'm sure I don't want them, would be worthy of somebody different from me. So, if you please, I will be a nun I and I will teach on in the Bunn street Primary until I happen to be promoted to a higher salary, which is the goal of my ambition, just now, and I shall grow strong, as the years go on, and put a little money in the bank beside, after Harry and Johnny are educated, and in my old age I shall retire to a very small cottage, and entertain my brothers and my future nephews and nieces, and you and your children, and by that time I dare say I shall have been knocked and thumped by this queer world into quite a self-possessed old lady! In the meantime, Margaret, I want the pattern of that pretty, gored apron!"</p>
                           <p>Margaret untied it smiling, folded and handed it to her, saying: "Take the apron itself, I have another just like it, and am going to make some more. As to your programme for life, you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> alter it. At all events, we both have our I 'dragons,' which we will fight as bravely and cheerily as we can, and we shall both grow stronger for the struggle."</p>
                           <p>Their "dragons" were unlike certainly, as were their lives. Margaret was an orphan with property enough to free her from the necessity of earning her livelihood, --with a happy home in her sister's family--with a face and manner which were an "open sesame" to the hearts of men, women and children--with leisure for the amenities of life which her ar

tistic nature thoroughly relished, and for the charities which her warm, womanly heart constantly prompted. These pleasant circumstances, seemed to Anne the vitalizing sunshine which was best suited to develop a rich, harmonious nature, like her friend's; while as for her own daily experience, she accepted it as best she might--household toil, friction with the petulant disposition of an invalid step-mother, the endless care and contrivance needful to make her salary eke out the little income of the family, the struggle to provide for her two young brothers all that their true welfare demanded, and to be to them, in the midst of all her anxieties, an inspirer of noble aims,--the drudgery of the school-room, and the constant crucifixion of her delicate tastes. These were the conditions of Anne's life, which were slowly educating her. In the conflict with them, and in her fervent admiration of Margaret's single-heartedness, she was learning, little by little, to drop the encumbrances of vanity and self-seeking, and to give to things their true perspective. She knew that Margaret, too, had had the discipline of sorrow. The bereavement of double orphanage, only a few years before, had been to her a solemn baptism, hallowing her life, and adding to her experience a tender depth which made sufferers instinctively turn to her as to a fit comforter.</p>
                           <p>The light faded at last, and Anne, with a sudden recollection of -the partly-knit stocking which she had "stinted" herself to finish before bed-time, for that staving lad, her brother Harry, exclaimed: "Madge, dear, light the gas and read Mill to me, while I knit for dear life!"</p>
                           <p>"We will go down into the back-parlor, then. And, Anne, by the way, I have been pining for knitting-work, lately. Last winter I did such piles of stockings for Tom and little Madge, that Alice declares she hasn't house-room for any more. So I have nothing to knit, and I hereby instal myself as <hi rend="italic">chausseur</hi> to your boys. Give me their measure and hereafter, take no thought for their stockings. It will be a kindness to me, for knitting just suits us 'steady' women, you know, and then I am so fond of your lads that I shall take special delight in doing it for them. So that is settled."</p>
                           <p>Anne threw her arms around Margaret's neck, with one of her impulsive hugs, saying: "Yes, dear, do It, and go on, loading me with kindnesses! How few people there are, to whom I can endure to be under obligation, and yet how little I mind it, with you! Here you are, constantly ministering to my needs of mind, body and estate, and I letting you do it and only occasionally feeling oppressed. While if other people try to do me favors, I either fling them back in their faces, or if I can't quite do that, I smart and chafe under the burden. It is because I love and trust you so fully, isn't it? and know that we understand each other?"</p>
                           <pb n="74 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"And because, you know that if you were in my place, with my leisure, and I in your busy, toiling life, your ready wit would teach you -twice as many ways of serving me, as I ever think of. We won't bandy compliments any farther, my dear little friend, but I will have the last word before I take up Mill, by reminding you that you are a constant help to me. You always understand me. You teach me what it is to work. Well never mind what else you do for me! Be quiet, now, while I read.</p>

                           <p>Anne Markham in her darkish school-room on a drizzling Monday morning. Sixty-eight little boys and girls, some of them clean, and some of them dirty. Miss Jackson, the sallow-faced assistant, in her yellowish-greenish-brown dress that made Anne shudder, speaking in tones even more weak and plaintive than usual, under the dismal influence of the weather. Out of the windows a view of unlimited ashes, thistles and old hoop-skirts. A picture vividly before Anne's mind of a stormy scene at the breakfast table, where Mrs. Markham had exasperated her stepson Harry by her peevish, senseless fault-finding and the boy, defending himself with hot words, had, at last, in utter desperation at fresh accusations, jumped from the table, dashed his tumbler into atoms, and rushed from the house. An unpaid butcher had dunned her at the last moment, as she was hurrying to school, after washing dishes, dusting rooms, and making beds. "James Malbry, come out, and sit on the edge of the platform !" "Mary, take that pin out of your mouth!" "Third class in Arithmetic." While watching the little troop, as they matched out to their places, she was thinking of Margaret in the cosy back-parlor at the Rectory, with its bright wood-fire on the hearth, sewing for little Madge, perhaps, and "talking things over" with Tom and Alice, before the minister shut himself up in his study. No wrangling there, no disgusts! How happy it all seemed! Then she pulled herself up, suddenly, remembering Margaret's words: "We will fight our dragons bravely and cheerily!" "Margaret has her trials, too--foes within and without. And, after all, her way is not marked out so clearly before her, as mine for me. She has often to find the suffering and sinning, while I am among them, all the time. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, so help me God, rise to the level of my trials!" With a clear light in her eyes, and a quiet, strong look about her mouth, she opened the dirty Arithmetic which Mike Falvey offered her, and met her class, as if they were a band of princes. and princesses in disguise. Such thorough attention did she give them; such respect suddenly seized her for their little stunted individualities, such faith in their possibilities, such determination to
<pb n="75 To Warn, to Comfort, and Command."/>
make them, as far as in her lay, worthy of their destiny as <hi rend="italic">real</hi> princes and princesses. All irritability vanished from her heart, and a yearning love for the little things filled it instead. Jane Thomson was disagreeable and over-wise as usual; Mary Smith wore her half-impertinent, half-stupid stare; Tom Derby was as hopelessly dirty, Johnny White as clean and happy-eyed, Susy Barker as stolid as ever.  But they were all transfigured, and she faced them with a prayer that she might deal with them strongly and gently as each soul needed. As the last question was answered, and they turned toward their seats, there was, a tap at the door. Jim Malbry was sent to open it, and returned with a bouquet of tea-roses and heliotropes and a note. "From Margaret!" was Anne's instant thought, even before she saw the film, graceful handwriting which was so characteristic:</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>
                                 <hi rend="italic">Pax Vobiscum!</hi> dear Anne. These are from my own plants, and carry with them my most Ioving greeting.</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>Anne's eyes brightened, as did those of many of her pupils, at the sight of the delicious flowers, which Jim Malbry carefully placed in the broken-edged vase, making the teacher's desk an altar for the rest of the forenoon.</p>
                           <p>At noon, Miss Markham hurried to the door of the Grammer School room, just in time to secure Harry. "Where is Johnny ?" she inquired. "Ask him to tell mother that you and I will not be home to dinner. I want you to go on a little expedition with me."</p>
                           <p>Harry was still sore from the morning's conflict with his mother, and eagerly nabbed Johnny out of a game of "Tag."</p>
                           <p>"Why! what's up?" asked breathless, sturdy Johnny. "Where are you going? I'm going too!"</p>
                           <p>"No," said Anne, "one of you at a time, and you must go home in season for dinner." Then, walking rapidly off with Harry, she said: "I am going to see a poor family. Some of the children are scholars of mine, and I have just heard of the mother's illness. I want to see her, and perhaps there will be something that you can do for the children. First, we will fortify ourselves with a lunch." So saying, she invested twenty-five cents in egg-biscuits and oranges at the little corner-store with its minute ice cream saloon, where, seating themselves behind the faded red curtain, the sister and brother had a merry meal. Harry pronounced the enterprise "jolly,"--"so far," he added cautiously. I ain't so sure about the dirty little Paddies we are going to see. Who are they, anyway, Sis?"</p>
                           <p>"They are not dirty little Paddies, at all, but Yankees, quite as clean as you are," answered his sister, with a smiling glance at two boyish paws, stained with ink, tar and other indelibles in which boys delight,

"and their name is Middleton. The mother is an honest, industrious woman who has worked harder than you or I ever dreamed of working, from five in the morning till late at night, day in and day out, doing anything she could find to do, to support her five children and send them school. One boy, Jack, earns something, but the others are too young, and now that Mrs. Middleton is ill, they must be very needy."</p>
                           <p>"Why, I know Jack Middleton. He's in the class below me. He carries papers, mornings. He's a first-rate fellow." These Delphic utterances were somewhat indistinct, proceeding, as they did, from a mouth stuffed with the last of the egg-biscuits.</p>
                           <p>Reaching Mrs. Middleton's house, Anne selected at random one of the three little door-bells, and ringing softly, they were admitted by an anxious-faced little girl, who brightened as she saw her teacher. In answer to Miss Markham's inquiries, she said : "Mother was very sick. The Doctor was in the other room. Would they please sit down?" In a moment the Doctor came out, and recognizing Anne, said heartily: "Miss Markham, I am very glad to see you. Mrs. Middleton needs all her friends now." Then followed a little talk upon "ways and means." Both the poor young Dispensary-physician and the poor young schoolteacher had more "ways" in their busy brains than "means" in their slender purses, and it was by dexterous planning and a wise expenditure of other people's money that they usually arranged affairs when they met in houses of poverty and sickness, as they had done, before this. Their acquaintance, in fact, was limited to such occasions, having commenced in Anne's school-house over a battered little pupil. As they sat, talking rapidly about Mrs. Middleton, an idea flashed through Anne's mind, where ideas always <hi rend="italic">were</hi> flashing, for that matter--"The man for Margaret!" "To command and obey?"--and while giving very sensible suggestions as to the best way of securing comforts for Mrs. Middleton, she was inwardly resolving to do a little match-making, convinced that she should only be acting in harmony with the grand "fitness of things." While she listened understandingly to instructions about beef-tea and medicine, she was also dreaming a pretty dream of the noble couple those two would be--this man with his dark-blue eyes telling of a rich and tender heart,--with his fine chin and mouth, saying plainly to a duller student of character than Anne Markham, that he was a brave man as well as a loving one--why should he not be worthy, even of the rare Margaret?</p>
                           <p>As he rose to go, he said, frankly: " Miss Markham, we have met in this way before, I feel as if we were friends."</p>
                           <p>"So do I," said Anne, as frankly, extending her hand--"and I should be glad to meet you again. I live at 34 May street, and I would

like to see you there." This was one of Anne's unconventional days, when she was her real, unaffected self. She was as fitful as she had accused herself of being, sometimes bowing "to the pleasant old conventions of our false humanity," and even wearing little affectations, fancying they were a shield; then in disgust, throwing them all aside, and striding on for a while, in the strictest asceticism. </p>
                           <p>With this earnest man she could easily be natural and simple. He thanked her for the permission to call, acknowledging smilingly, that he had half-begged it, and with another word about the sick woman, withdrew. Anne sent Harry upon one or two errands, then went into the little bed-room, and with few words and many gentle touches, made everything more cheery and comfortable. Leaving Margaret's flowers in a tumbler, and telling Mrs. Middleton that she would spend the night with her, and that a friend of hers would aid in any way that should be needful, she busied herself quietly and most efficiently in the adjoining room, until the school-bell rang.</p>
                           <p>To pen an emphatic little note to Margaret, describing Mrs. Middleton's needs, and to dispatch it by the irrepressible Jim Malbry, whose spirits needed vent as often as she could find any excuse for sending him outside of school-house walls, was the work of a moment. Then to her disguised princes and princesses in the foreground, and to pictures in the background of serene Margaret and blue-eyed Dr. Waltham, side-by-side.</p>
                           <p>With the faintest possible blush, she remembered the interview. in Mrs. Middleton's sitting-room, and the simple way in which he had said: "I feel as if we were friends!" That was worth while! To have the prospect of a friendship like that. "There must be something good about me, when such people as he and Margaret claim friendship. So pluck up courage, foolish heart, and grow worthy of them!" Of course another possibility suggested itself. The girl for a moment fancied how sweet it would be to have such a lover. He was rather different from the two men who had hitherto sought to honor her with their surnames. Then she checked herself: "Stop, Anne Markham!" If you are good for anything, it is for discerning the true spirits of people, and you know that you are not the peer of that man, and that Margaret Alden is. You shall introduce them to each other, and nature shall do the rest!" So saying, Anne closed the spelling-book, feeling very much like a priest who had just joined a pair in the bonds of matrimony, and dismissed the class, detaining Jim Malbry who had had time to do his errand, return, and convulse his neighbors by his pranks. The clock struck five at last. Margaret was at the door, clad in waterproof armor, for the drizzle had settled into a driving rain. Anne slipped her arm through her friend's, gaily chattering. "Now we will be strong-minded and jolly! Not
<pb n="78 The Woman's Advocate."/>
another woman out! Very unsuitable, Miss Alden! How I do like to g hold of your arm and go careering, with nobody to molest!"</p>
                           <p>"So do I," laughed Margaret, "but don't career through that mud puddle if you please! Now about Mrs. Middleton. I am going to watch with her to-night, and I will provide some one for to-morrow night. You are not to work by night, after toiling all day. That is settled.</p>
                           <p>"I will take turns with you," Anne began, but Margaret cut her short.</p>
                           <p>"No. I have. too much regard for your scholars, if I hadn't for you. It is absurd for a teacher to think of watching with sick people. I pity Jim, Malbry, the day after!"</p>
                           <p>"Both, girls laughed, but Anne said: "O, Jim isn't the one to be pitied! His spirits carry him through everything. Pity Jane Thompson and Tim McCarty and Tom Derby. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> have to suffer, when I'm awry. But I knew you would come to the rescue in Mrs. Middleton's case, and now that you and Dr. Waltham have taken charge of her, I think she will get well."</p>
                           <p>"Dr. Waltham, the Dispensary? I heard Dr. Arnold speak very highly of him last evening. I had never heard of him before. How odd it is that a name always comes to one in that double way!"</p>
                           <p>"You ought to know him," remarked Anne, quietly. (Ah ! Anne, if all matchmakers were as unselfish, and machinated as innocently as you, who would forbid them the avocation!) "I have met him a few times, and I like him immensely. I have a feeling that we are going to be excellent friends--in a Platonic way. You needn't laugh !" as she heard a little, tinkle of amusement. "My impressions and divinations are generally right, as you <hi rend="italic">know</hi>. There is the gentleman, this very moment." A chaise was splashing toward them, and Margaret looked up in time to see: a lifted hat, and a bright smile of recognition. "He has only just established a chaise," said Anne. "Until lately he has tramped around among his patients, almost as poor as themselves. Old Mrs. Vickers, who lives in our chambers, knows the pedigree of everybody in town, and who ever passes her window, as she sits knitting, serves as a topic. Then off she launches into Biography. Dr. Waltham in this new chaise, was the occasion of a very interesting monologue, the other day. His father died thirteen years ago, leaving him, a boy of fifteen, to support an invalid mother and a little sister. He left school, went into an apothecary's shop, for his fixed plan, even then, was to be a physician, and that seemed his only track towards it. He used to wait upon his mother with all the gentleness of a girl, doing housework when she was sick. Mrs. Vickers declares she has seen him wash dishes as handily and gaily as if it were his chosen pastime, quite unabashed by her pres-

ence. He studied by day and by night, whenever he could find time. He was twenty-four years old before he had saved money enough to support his mother and sister, while be should attend the Medical School. There he studied with all his might, earning something occasionally by literary work in addition, graduated with the highest honors, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> predict, will become an eminent physician. His sister has much of the same pluck, Mrs. Vickers says. She is teaching in some seminary. The Doctor is a native gentleman, self-possessed and courteous, though there is sometimes a half-sad, repressed look in his eyes that reminds one of what he has foregone, that would have made his youth bright. He has had little time or opportunity for social delights, yet he is a man who, you feel instinctively, would enjoy keenly all that is graceful and genial in society, while, of course, he sees through all its shams. With his training he could scarcely fail of that."</p>
                           <p>"I wonder if he knows your history as well as you have learned his?" said Margaret, smiling.</p>
                           <p>"Why no !--though he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> acquainted with Mrs. Vickers, isn't he? Well, perhaps he does, then. Only there isn't much to tell about me !"</p>
                           <p>"I think there is," said her friend quietly.</p>
                           <p>"Here we are at Mrs. Middleton's," said Anne, and shaking the rain from their water-proof cloaks, the Sisters of Charity entered, to soothe and cheer the anxious household.</p>

                        <p>The astonishing progress that the question of Woman Suffrage is making in the minds of the people throughout this country is evinced by the quantity of newspaper articles that daily meet the eye, pro and con; the most of them amounting to little as it regards the main question, yet serving like the wooden spoon to stir up the dish and keep alive the agitation.</p>
                        <p>The great fear with our excellent friends of the opposition seems to be that we of the weaker sex shall be <hi rend="italic">unsexed</hi>--that Milton's type of womanhood will be lost in the whirl of political excitement. I think his lines run in this wise, and I will quote them in full, for I much fear that though our disturbed Bachelors who have been polished and refined at Yale, Cambridge, Amherst,

or some other one sided institution have found time to perfect their knowledge of what a woman <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be, by studying the old poets, our bright-eyed "girls of the period" have not had such leisure--but here is the type:

                           </q>
and the "lords of creation" are sorely afraid that the simple act of voting will destroy all of this "type."</p>
                        <p>When the women of England began to clamor for a little share of the book-learning that was so lavishly dealt out to men, and here and there a "Harriet Martineau," or some one else in cap and gown, stirred the nicely adjusted equilibrium of "<hi rend="italic">men's rights</hi>," they cried out as lustily against the "blue stockings," and seemed to be in as much mortal fear and terror that they should lose their "<hi rend="italic">type</hi>," as are the same class of the present day.</p>
                        <p>Sidney Smith told those trembling knights of the quill, twenty years ago, not to be alarmed, there would be fools enough left for them, even if education in its broadest sense was allowed to women.</p>
                        <p>So as we read the current articles of the hour--the sermons that are poured forth on sultry afternoons to sleepy congregations on the "spheres" and "duties" of woman, and all the prating (whether by the men or the women) of the danger of the sex losing itself and all its "sweet attractive grace," by gaining the ballot--we only want to say in answer: Dear, good souls, there will be "soft sweet creatures" enough left for you all, for the next half century at least. Men vote, but they do not all become Presidents, go to Congress, or hold offices; do not all drink, smoke, chew or swear; do not all neglect business or degrade themselves in club rooms, or saloons.</p>
                        <p>There is not a dram shop in these United States that would not allow me to enter in and <hi rend="italic">refresh</hi> myself with a brandy sling if I chose to go in and ask for and pay for it. What keeps me out? Can you tell good friends? Will the "right of suffrage give me one particle additional right to do so evil a thing? There is not a scrap of law to prevent me now from the low practices and vices of the lowest humanity; will voting make them more attractive to me than now?

                        <p>Many a poor woman, soft as unbaked dough and sweet as 
sugar kisses, and as attractive as frizzles, flounces, flowers and fidgets can make her, lives with the "degradation of politics" from babyhood to good old age, first with father and brothers then with husband, sits at the same fireside, eats at the same table, and lays head on the same pillow, breathes in the f&#x0153;tid breath, listens to the profanity, and endures the madness of public life, which is brought home to the "sacred hearth" and retains to the last her softness and "sweet attractive grace." If the contact at home and abroad, with the politicans, (for every man is a politician) three hundred and sixty-three days in a year, Fourth of Julys and New Years' days thrown in, has not spoiled us wholly in the last century, do in mercy let us try the other two days and see for a little, whether <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can <hi rend="italic">be</hi> any worse than we are.</p>
                        <p>But why multiply words, there is, there can be, no argument in the matter. Woman will be woman, and the man that writes it, down that "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall not be so polite to her or love her so well if she votes," writes himself down a dunce--that is all.</p>

                        <p>[The following paper, prepared for the July number, was unavoidably deferred.--ED.]</p>
                        <p>THE extreme advance of democratic sentiment in America is symbolized in the pending Fifteenth Amendment to the National Constitution, now on its passage through our State Legislatures. It caps the arch of "manhood" suffrage, the partial approximation to Human suffrage thus far achieved by the advocates of self-government.</p>
                        <p>Ten years ago four millions of our countrymen, without "rights," formed part of the personal estate of our people. Two convictions which fed the real life of America and gave it dignity and power, were these: Human existence is enduring and invaluable,--Duty attaches to existence and requires freedom for its fulfillment. These convictions gnawed away the basis of Slavery. When the violence it engendered and relied on proved incompetent
<pb n="82 The Woman's Advocate."/>
to resist those convictions, then religious sanction and force of habit let go, while prejudice of race, tyranny of caste and instinct of property were wrenched asunder, and all the ponderous inertia which had seemed to strengthen the abnormal system, swung over on the other side and crushed the wreck it could not animate. We dared not hold the slave; so unwillingly, sullenly, Pharaoh-like, weary of plagues we let him go. The conscience of the Nation heaved off the nightmare which had broken its peace, but the prejudice of the North and the revengeful jealousy of the South left the freedmen in a plight so helpless that common sense is ready now to recognize the need of the second step--suffrage, to make practical the first step--emancipation. Moreover as the swift years since the war have passed, prejudices have fled with the departing souls who cherished them; the perverted vision of our people has been adjusting itself to the more normal light of a freer era. The remembrance of the patient suffering of the Negroes under generations of bitter wrong-- of their manly gratitude and brave help in the first days of their liberty, has plead eloquently with the white man's nobler nature in behalf of "the Nation's wards." We dare not trust the former South to fulfill a pledge of justice unwillingly assumed, the fulfillment of which is nevertheless an essential condition precedent to all self-defence and self-improvement by the feeble victims of its old tyranny. So we fought for and have won for them this Magna Charta of their race in America.</p>
                        <p>Until recently every brave and freedom loving soul thanked God and watched with eager interest the slow dropping of the affirmatory ballot by Legislature after Legislature. But now from among old friends of freedom and the advocates <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of Human Suffrage, an unexpected voice of jealous protest has arisen. "Arrest the ratification." Why? Because the admission of all men to suffrage leaves only women disfranchised, thus seeming to assume sex as the line of ostracism, while this has not hitherto been alone in its disfranchisement. Also, because the blacks whom we propose to enfranchise, being widely ignorant and therefore prejudiced, are likely to throw many more votes against than for our claim of Human Suffrage, as embodied in the proposed Sixteenth Amendment now to be urged in Congress.</p>
                        <p>Emancipation, like a great wave, followed the volcanic efforts by which our "nation" struggled with and threw its enemy, a
<pb n="Be Just and Fear Not."/>
wave that surging far inward purged our Republic of legalized felony. And Negro suffrage, following the first reaction, now sweeps the tyranny of race and caste into the abyss. Surely this is vantage not lost but gained for a further onset which shall unseat the power which now sustains the inequality of sex. Surely it must make the Victory for Human Suffrage more speedy and complete. "No," it is said, hitherto the disfranchisement of class of men prevented the discrimination which now rests distinctly women alone." But is not this a temporary earthwork thrown by a retreating foe? The Reform which has successively freed and promises to enfranchise the slave, is not a technical contest as the respective rights of men and of women. It is the replacing the old <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of force by the new <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of choice. It is reversal of the old decision "might makes right" by the new decision "right makes might." It cannot be that any paltry logic based on the fact that all males have first gained concession of seIf-government can retard the extension of the same measure of simple justice to women. The argument and the verdict were not for manhood suffrage <hi rend="italic">as against woman suffrage</hi>. It is distinctly new ground won for the broad principle of Human Suffrage. By that spirit have its advocates been inspired, and by that sign they have conquered. Of our millions of citizens none look on the Fifteenth Amendment as a concession made to black <hi rend="italic">men</hi> merely for logical consistency because white <hi rend="italic">men</hi> previously were voters; order to recognize masculinity and twenty-one years as the true and invariable basis for the franchise. On the contrary, with the Fifteenth Amendment a flood of fresh light falls on the idea of <hi rend="italic">self</hi>-government and illumines it in the eyes of our people. No congressman designed and no constituent understood that in conceding the justice and necessity of self-government to men of every race, they by that act denied the justice and necessity of self-government for women. "But the blacks, being largely ignorant and therefore prejudiced, will use their newly acquired votes more to oppose than to help the extension of suffrage to women." This is an assumption. Generally the attainment of satisfaction for a just claim, disposes people to value the justice they have longed and striven for, and inclines them to concede to others a right by whose denial they have themselves suffered bitterly. If there be any indication among the colored race, of special opposition to
<pb n="84 The Woman's Advocate."/>
woman suffrage, it probably springs from a natural unwillingness to couple their claim, which has received national assent, with that of women which has not yet been able to command it. Themselves possessed of suffrage, the average <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> of the blacks will probably be quite as reliable for the support of a humane and righteous measure, the average <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> of the whites. We need not dread the arbitrament of the <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> of either race. But if it were otherwise, has the school of the New Testament and of our Independence taught us to hinge right upon expediency, or that we may prolong a cruel and unjust disfranchisement because we cannot read the future and we fear lest the franchise may be abused? If this argument holds against the Fifteenth Amendment it is good against all previous steps in the interest of self-government or what is identical with it, universal suffrage.</p>
                        <p>Am I justified in saying, "My neighbor shall not govern himself because in so doing he may incidentally misgovern me: Until my right is recognized, my neighbor's shall not be: Until the nation shall assent to woman's righteous claim which it does not yet admit, that nation shall not do its admitted duty and place in the hands of its "peeled and scattered' freedmen a shield against the horrors of the Ku-Klux-Klan?" I have not so learned duty. As to policy, we shall advocate the cause of woman suffrage before the mixed jury of the future with more confidence and consistency on the ground of simple right, which is its one unanswerable plea, if we can say to all objectors white and black who may doubt the expediency of our claim: "Our Fathers conferred suffrage on all <hi rend="italic">white</hi> men despite that doubt. We conferred suffrage on all <hi rend="italic">men</hi> despite that doubt, now do unto women as we have done to you, 'Be just and fear not.'"</p>

                        <p>SHALL we ask a great nation, whose government has just shown that it can pardon the vilest traitors and restore them to all the rights and privileges of citizenship, to do a single act of justice in the enfranchisement of woman? Or shall we stoop to policy--flatter the ambitious designs of office-seeking men, and say to them, If you work for us now, we will remember you when we are in a position to be of service to you? Shall we sugar-coat all our arguments saying we have no cause of complaint, but the time has come when you need our help, and we are waiting to help you? We are anxious to step in, only to clear away the rubbish, clean up the filth of this <hi rend="italic">pool</hi> of <hi rend="italic">politics</hi>, and polish up things so that your handy work may shine, with a brighter lustre. "You need our hand to help in the State, just as you do in the family. We won't go to any extremes in politics; we will be just as good at home as we have been, even better, if you will only allow us to show how much we can help you in these matters. We won't wear "<hi rend="italic">bloomers</hi>," or make any attempt to imitate you in our dress, manners, or occupations; we will do nothing to offend the most fastidious, <hi rend="italic">we will be women still.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Are we to use such arguments as these, while we bow low in the dust, and meekly petition to be admitted to our rightful place as equals?

purposes? I do not believe in the extreme views which I have heard advanced at some meetings. I do not think that our present system of government converts one sex into tyrants, and the other into slaves. It simply allows them to become such. The man who is a tyrant by nature can thrive under the system, and the woman who is inclined to submit naturally can do so to her heart's content, and find at last, when submission has ceased to be a virtue, that there is no power in the laws to prevent her master from governing her by his own absolute will, no matter how unreasonable or inhuman that will may be. It is absurd to say that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men are tyrants or all women slaves, for there are men, thank God, who could not become tyrants under any system, but would be wise, loving husbands and fathers, regardless of all laws; and there are women also who could never be slaves, though bound in chains. Who has not seen them in the humblest walks of life, oppressed with sorrow and cares, yet bearing upon their brows the mark of God's nobility, their husbands and children reverencing them next to the Deity? We are not <hi rend="italic">slaves</hi>, nor do we complain of the tyranny of our husbands, but we do complain of injustice, inasmuch as the stronger sex have assumed to control us in any degree. And we ask for simple justice; we want no more, and we will take no less. We make no promises of good behavior; we shall be governed by our own good sense. We ask not favors, but that this Nation shall cease to be governed by Expediency. It has had enough of it in the past. Slavery was tolerated by expediency, and after all the woe it brought upon us, no man can claim that the slaves were emancipated by a simple act of justice. Not till it was found to be expedient to save the life of the Nation, did our government do anything to break their chains, and to-day, the black man holds the ballot through <hi rend="italic">expediency</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The time is fast approaching when it will be <hi rend="italic">expedient</hi> to grant the petition of woman. Would to God this Nation would do this one single act of justice for justice' own sake, rather than wait until it shall seem <hi rend="italic">expedient</hi>.</p>

                        <head>THE LAW AND THE TESTIMONY.</head>
                        <p>THE movements for the legal and political freedom of "Woman" have commenced in a manner similar to that in which the Anti-Slavery Reformers first tried to carry their point in their late agitation. It is believed that the petitions so numerously spread before the public, appealing to Congressional and State Legislatures, will meet the same fate, as was awarded to similar appeals made by the advocates of the abolition of Slavery to the Churches. In the latter case it was, and in the former it is, merely applying to the malefactors themselves for the rendition of the thing they have stolen. The answer of the Churches, when the question was pressed upon them as to whether Slavery was a sin, was given in 1860, when it was declared, "that it was not <hi rend="italic">Malum in se</hi>." It is only natural to expect that the answer of our Legislators will also be a similar attempted justification, rather than an admission of their guiltiness and a promise of their amendment.</p>
                        <p>It must be confessed that in both cases such a plan of operations was tempting. Who could conceive that Churches calling themselves Christian would be so readily willing to permit Christ to be recrucified in the person of the negro? Who can believe that a government, theoretically democratic, can continue to deprive half the people of their rights because the injured are physically too weak to compel restitution of the same by force ? It is no answer to assert that the majority of Women are content with their present servile position, for this article is not written for such, but for those who think differently. Dr. Adams informed us that many "slaves" also were happy in their condition, though the Box Browns, Margaret Garners and Douglasses, were certainly non-contents. But where now are the negroes who wish to fall back into slavery? So, in the near future, there is every reason to believe that the women, who now are silent, passively acquiescing in their present forlorn condition, will be equally unanimous in rejoicing at the success of their common deliverance from such thraldom.</p>
                        <p>The Revolutionary War has fixed the status of the American Government to all women desirous of representation. Really they have no
<pb n="The Law and the Testimony. 91"/>
right of appeal to a tribunal in whose construction their wishes were not consulted. Before public audiences, which at present are mainly composed of males, they should never allude to it as "our" or even "the" government, but call it what it really is--"your government." Ignored themselves, politeness requires that they should return the compliment. If British Legislators, in former times, were tyrants and robbers, what are American Legislators to women, under similar circumstances? Let us cease appealing to the latter, and organize missions amongst the people for their conversion. Let us carefully examine the charts laid down by the Fathers for our guidance, and see if these semi-sanctioned Legislators are fully warranted in the course of injustice they are now pursuing against probably the greater moiety of the people in this matter. Above all, let us never forget that this is not a question of strength and weakness, but one of might and right.</p>
                        <p>But how shall we prove that we are right, for that will come next in order? The Jewish Reformers, as the Scriptures instruct us, usually appealed to the Law and the Testimony. Until God sent them a king in his anger, they, like ourselves, were governed by a written authority which their Judges expounded. Our great State papers unquestionably are, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. The former of these is the foundation on which the latter is built. It will do us no harm to appeal to the doctrines contained in them as laid down by the Fathers, on the important question of the Right of Suffrage.</p>
                        <p>There are but few passages in either of these on the subject, and whilst it is claimed that a fair construction of these ratify, it is asserted that no one of them excludes "women" from the exercise of the political power of the ballot. In so grave a cause, extending over and vitally affecting the status of more than half the people in the community, we should from the foes of the movement, be justified in demanding a specific authority in the aforesaid papers excluding women from the polls. Waiving that argument for the present, it is intended in this paper to prove that 
they not only do not forbid, but that in certain instances, by a fair and just interpretation of the words used, both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution may truthfully be said to endorse the affirmative of this very important matter.</p>
                        <pb n="92 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>The only sentence in the Declaration of Independence which bears upon the question of Suffrage is this: "that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted amongst men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." From this it may be inferred that governments using power without soliciting (or basing their actions on) this consent are unjust and tyrannical. Cavilers may point to the word "men" in the above extract, but if such limitation be correct, the endowment by the Creator of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness is also circumscribed by the same term to the same sex, which is preposterous. On the contrary if the word "men" be used, as submitted, in its wider signification, it is a logical and unanswerable indorsement of the Right of Women to the Suffrage as contended for in this Magazine.</p>
                        <p>Repudiating the "Fourteenth Amendment," which might better be termed the "First Disfiguration," and appealing to the Constitution as it came to us from the Fathers, we find only two sections bearing upon the point under consideration. The first of these is the fractional foolishness "three-fifths of all other classes"--which has been settled or rather abrogated by the war of the Rebellion. The second, which is to be found in Article 1, Section 2, reads as follows: </p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>"The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year, by the people of the several States; and the Electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous branch of the State Legislature."</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>With all proper respect for the Constitution, it Is evident that here there are two conflicting propositions; one of which instructs us that Members of the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the people, and another that they shall be chosen by a specified part of the people. As we cannot perform both commands, it is advocated that it would not be amiss in us, as Republicans, to follow that which is most Democratic. This brings us to the queries, in which the affirmative can well be maintained: Are not women "people," and is not their Right to Direct Representation endorsed and sanctioned by the Fathers in this section of the Constitution?</p>
                        <p>If common usage could sanctify injustice, slavery would now be conqueror instead of conquered. To appeal to it in answer to these allegations will be vain. The claim of the States to legalize paper as
<pb n="The Law and the Testimony. 93"/>
money was held and maintained by them ever since we were a nation, until the necessities of the war compelled the dominant part of the people to assert through their Representatives their Constitutional Right over the currency. Even the Dred Scott Court has moved half way towards the truth in that matter. Mr. R. J. Walker declared that he had noted its illegality for the past twenty years. It would be a nice question for a debating society, whether reticence in a great public officer, under such circumstances, was not criminal? However, regardIess of its long life, the Nation purged itself of the wrong, and freed itself, we trust forever, from such State usurpation. If, as is claimed, the Constitution sanctions the right of women to the suffrage, let us hope that ribaldry, debauchery and brutality, which at present garrison the polls against the advance of modesty, sobriety and piety, will likewise be overthrown; common usage to the contrary notwithstanding. In conclusion, we call upon our opponents to face the music, appealing to the Law and the Testimony, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.</p>

                        <p>JUSTIN MCCARTHY, a highly educated, liberal young Englishman now residing in this city, in a thoughtful paper on George Eliot says: "Probably no other novel-writer, since novel-writing became a business, ever possessed one tithe of her scientific knowledge. Indeed, hardly anything is rarer than the union of the scientific and the literary or artistic temperaments. So rare is it that the exceptional, the almost solitary instance of Goethe, comes up at once distinct and striking to the mind. English novelists are even less likely to have anything of a scientific taste than either French or German. Dickens knows nothing of science, and has indeed as little knowledge of any kind, save that derived from observation, as any respectable Englishman could well have. Thackeray was a man of varied reading, versed in the lighter literature of several languages, and strongly imbued with artistic tastes; but he had no careful science. Lord Lytton's science is a mere sham. Charlotte Bronte was all genius and ignorance. Mrs. Lewes is all genius and culture. Had she never written a page of fiction, had she never written a line of poetry, she must have been regarded with wonder and admiration as a woman of vast and varied knowledge."</p>

                           <p>IF to any friend of the Cause, the tone of THE ADVOCATE has in aught seemed captious, we trust it will be believed that whatever there has been of criticism has been in the spirit of kindness, with only the welfare of the Cause at heart, and with no desire to impugn the motives of those differing in judgment respecting what should constitute a CREED, or be the POLICY of the advocates of Woman Suffrage.</p>
                           <p>To us, who have brought love for all of Humanity with the devotion we would pay one of the noblest and most sorely needed of Reforms, the peculiar attitude of some of its prominent advocates has been a revelation from which we would have shrunk, believing the spectacle of such opposition and want of charity--</p>

                           <p>But as week after week such views have been enunciated with a boldness challenging dissenting judgment, and winning converts even by persistency of iteration, we, reluctantly, have felt it our duty to protest against what has seemed to us a violation of the very essence of Christianity--a proper regard for the Rights of even the most hapless of humanity. That the women of the land eventually could endorse such sentiments, we, have never done them the injustice to believe; but there was a danger-now happily averted-- of their <hi rend="italic">misapprehending the true needs</hi> of the Cause, and thus unwittingly dishonoring a Movement they would fain urge to a speedy consummation.</p>
                           <p>But better counsels have prevailed. The rock, upon which the preciously freighted vessel might have been dashed, has been safely passed.

                                    <p>As all persons supposed to be in favor of suffrage for women are also supposed to be unanimous in their likes and dislikes, and are charged by the opposing party with holding the same opinions, you will permit me to put in my disclaimer to being one of these opposers of the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
                                    <p>When the war first closed and it was said by Mr. Phillips and others this is "the Negro's hour; let us settle this question of <hi rend="italic">race</hi> before that of <hi rend="italic">sex</hi>;"--I, with many, felt aggrieved, thinking that the two great questions could go on together if pressed with the same persistent energy. But be that as it may--the Congress of the United States has spoken its will in the words of the Fifteenth Amendment, and the States will ratify or not as they see fit; and if they do ratify the Amendment, colored men will enter the open doors of freedom a little in advance of us of the opposite sex.</p>
                                    <p>The argument of the opposition is that "Negroes being ignorant and debased through Slavery, and knowing but little of any class of women save their own companions in ignorance, will be violent opposers of the right of suffrage for all women." But even if that be the case, a great principle will have been gained for the Nation, and a million of men, who to-day will not admit that either women or negroes should vote, will immediately see and feel the right and necessity for the-like privilege and power for their own wives and daughters.</p>
                                    <p>Could I with a breath defeat the Fifteenth Amendment, I would not do it. That Amendment will let the colored men enter the wide portals of human rights:--keeping them out, suffering as now, would not let me in--then in God's name why stand in their way? Bid them enter, and I will bide my time, which is coming and all the sooner, I believe, that he has gone before.</p>

                           <head>TRUE PHILANTHROPY.--MR. PACKARD.</head>
                           <p>MR S. S. PACKARD of this city, the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Packard's Monthly</hi>, has a Business College in which, without distinction of sex, mathematics, book-keeping and other branches of useful knowledge are taught those who desire to enter upon a business life. Mr. Packard, whose College has been a number of years in successful operation, finds the young women who have sought its instruction quite as quick to learn as their fellow students of the opposite sex; and states, as the result of his experience, <hi rend="italic">that equal training and advantages give equal proficiency and expertness</hi>. The commendable course pursued by Mr. Packard receives its crown in the generous proposition recently made by him to gratuitously educate, during the next year, fifty young women in his college, the only requirement being that they should come well recommended, possessing a moral character. At the recent Commencement, after expressing the opinion that every girl should be prepared to take the position she is fitted for, and to support herself with brain or hands, he concluded by saying:</p>
                           <p>"I propose, during the next year, to make a speciality of educating women for business, and I shall offer, as I have already done, to educate gratuitously any fifty young women who will come, poor but honest, and well recommended; and then I will undertake to get them situations."</p>
                           <p>This is practical Woman's Rights! Well may the country take hope, with such instances of philanthropy in our midst. While a Stewart digs deep the foundation for the stately pile which is to make fair and inviting a Home within the means of the poorest of our working girls-while a Mrs. Phelps endows a Bureau or Center of Thought, more important perchance than either--fraught with even greater consequences for good--a Vassar or a Packard offer to woman the facilities

for the acquirement of that business knowledge which will secure to her a profitable, independent position in life, equally with man. May this noble offer of Mr. Packard's be wisely improved.</p>

                           <p>Among the Conventions destined to make the present year memorable may be assumed: the World's Woman's Convention, called at Berlin for the 5th and 6th of November, 1869. At this Congress of the thinking women of all Nations, measures will be taken looking to the establishment of an official communication between the various woman societies for Education, for Instruction in Science and Art, for Industrial and Domestic Training and their relations to Labor. The objects to be discussed will be as follows:</p>
                           <p>1. How to form a regular official communication between the existing associations.</p>
                           <p>2. How to form Industrial, Scientific and Art Schools for women.</p>
                           <p>3. How to form Co-operative Associations for woman's labor, with institutions giving the same advantages to women as has been given to men by their large, and now becoming international, Working Men's Associations.</p>
                           <p>Delegates to the above Convention are invited from all parts of Europe and the United States, and the desire is expressed that-our country in particular may be duly represented. Several of our Societies, following a general movement in England, have already taken steps in the matter, and among those whose possible attendance has been hinted at are Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and Mrs. C. M. Severance, as representatives of the New England Woman's Suffrage Association. We trust that this gratifying intelligence may prove correct, as the presence of these well-known and honored advocates of Woman Suffrage, alone would be a guarantee that the Cause in America would be faithfully and efficiently represented. We learn, through private sources, that Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose and Miss Mary J. Safford, both of whom are now in Europe, will also be present and participate in the very interesting proceedings.</p>

                        <p>A Woman's College is to be established at Chambersburg, Pa., which, it is hoped by its friends will surpass even Vassar College in its appointments. A beautiful farm just north of the town has been purchased for

                        <p>A London telegram of July 19th says: "The first general meeting of the Women Franchise Society was held here yesterday. Among the notables present were the following: John Stuart Mill, the author and statesman; Lord Houghton, Right Hon. James Stansfield, Junior Lord of the Treasury; Henry Fawcett, member of Parliament for Brighton; Rev. Charles Kingsley, the author, and Louis Blanc, the author. There were also many ladies present. Addresses were delivered by many well-known speakers, and a resolution was unanimously adopted favoring female suffrage."</p>
                        <p>A wealthy lady of New York--Mrs. Elizabeth Langdon--has purchased four hundred acres of land about forty miles from the city, on which she proposes to establish an industrial farm for destitute children. Boys and girls without natural protectors will be admitted when under twelve years. The farm is to be planted chiefly with small fruits. It is thought the children will be well adapted to gather these, and can also be employed in manufacturing the baskets for the fruits. A commodious building is to be erected as a home; and when the children have been properly trained they will be sent into permanent country homes.</p>
                        <p>A Boston correspondent of the Chicago Republican says: "Everywhere I go, I hear the great question of Woman Suffrage, discussed in its different bearings, showing that the public mind is being deeply agitated on the subject. Riding recently from Boston to Medford in the cars, I overheard two men earnestly discussing the question--one evidently a physician, the other, I should judge, a lawyer. Says the latter, 'would you wish your wife to mix with low, rude men, in public; to witness all the drunken coarseness and low ribaldry of town-meeting day; would you not be ashamed of her in such a place?' 'I should be ashamed of the men,' was the doctor's quick reply."</p>
                        <p>It will be seen by the advertisement of the University Courses of Instruction at Harvard for the current year, that these courses will be given to competent persons, "men and <hi rend="italic">women</hi>." Thus it appears that the ladies are admitted to the outer court of the temple at Harvard. Is this a sign that the whole academical course will yet be thrown open to them? At all events the present innovation is a good one. The lessons

Of the course to be given by such men as Profs. Bowen, Hedge and Lowell, Ralph WaIdo Emerson, Mr. Howells and others, are just as well adapted to one sex as to the other, and will be appreciated by both alike. This is doubtless one of the forms of the new President of Harvard, it is certainly auspicious of his administration.</p>
                        <p>Lucia Gilbert Calhoun, under the heading "A Woman's View of Dr. Bushnell's Book," makes a capital reply to the objections of that volume in the <title>Hearth and Home</title> of the 31st ult. We extract the closing paragraph:</p>
                        <p>"For the rest, we acknowledge our belief that God made both men and women, and that his loving care will conserve both the centrifugal and centripetal forces that keep them in their orbits. Man will be man, and woman will be woman, while the world is, because neither can pass the divine limit, and the sooner both pass the conventional limit, and become <hi rend="italic">humanity</hi>, the better for both. We confess that we are not in the least alarmed at the muttering or the noisy approach of any Reform against nature."</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Sophia M. Tuckerman Eckley, well known to many of our readers as a lady of artistic and truly literary tastes, has lately returned from a residence of fourteen years in Europe, devoted to artistic studies at Rome and elsewhere. During her protracted sojourn abroad, Mrs. Eckley was a frequent contributor to English and Continental journals, winning the reputation of an able and graceful writer; and within the year an edition of her poems, entitled "Minor Chords," has been issued by the well-known London publishers, Bell &#x0026; Daldy, Covent Garden, which has received very favorable notices from the press, and of which we will speak hereafter. Liberal in thought, Mrs. Eckley had excellent opportunities for forming the acquaintance of trans-Atlantic reformers, and has sustained intimate relations with Miss Emily Faithfull and the principal workers in the Womans -Movement in Great Britain and elsewhere. She is at present a contributor to Miss Faithfull's Magazine, and will, we trust, be an added strength to the Cause in this country.</p>
                        <p>Very pleasant were the exercises that took place at Newport on July 3d, in connection with the presentation of an elegant life-boat to Miss Ida Lewis, as a token of appreciation of her heroism in rescuing two drowning soldiers near her father's light-house in March last. The boat, which is of the finest workmanship, is called the "Rescue;" and the presentation was in Washington square, which was filled with a crowd of enthusiastic people. An appropriate presentation address was made by
<pb n="101 Notes"/>
Francis Brinley, formerly President of the Boston Common Council, to which Col. T. W. Higginson responded on behalf of Miss Lewis. He commenced by saying: "I am requested by Miss Lewis to return thanks in her name to the donors and to the citizens of Newport. Miss Lewis desires me to say that she has never made a speech in her life, and does not expect to begin now. She has worked out the problem of woman's rights in a different manner. She has been accustomed to assume the right of helping her fellow-men without asking any question. She receives this boat with pleasure, not only as an earnest of the good feeling of her fellow citizens, but also as a means of doing a little more hereafter if occasion should come." . . . . At the conclusion of Col. Higginson's speech, an elegant rudder-yoke, made of rose-wood, with solid silver mountings, was presented by the Narraganset Boat Club; and two silk flags, a miniature anchor of galvanized iron, with cable, an elegant set of cushions, boat-hook, and a velvet carpet were contributed by Captain Kenny and the officers of the steamboat "Newport." The demeanor of Miss Lewis throughout the exercises was lady-like and composed, alike free from embarassment and affectation. This presentation was in the morning; and itt the afternoon the "Rescue" was launched from Long Wharf in the presence of a vast crowd. At the appointed hour, amid much applause, Miss Lewis seated herself at the oars ; and by her quick and vigorous strokes the beautiful boat was guided rapidly toward its destination, the Lime Rock Light-house.</p>

                           <head>HOW LISA LOVED THE KING. By George Eliot, author of "Adam Bede." 16 mo. Boston: Fields, Osgood &#x0026; Co. </head>
                           <p>Scarcely has the first flush of pleasure, excited by the perusal of "The Spanish Gypsey" abated, ere the public are offered a similar delight in a fresh production by this gifted author. "How Lisa Loved the King" can add nothing to the reputation of George Eliot. That may be said to have been crowned by the production of "The Spanish Gypsey," which was one of the few poetical works really enriching our modern literature. But it is the sweetest of trifles--a rosebud dropped in her garlanded path, the fragrance of which will linger Iong with every lover of lofty or graceful thought wedded to verse. This being the case, it would be unfair to institute any comparison between it and its immediate and remarkable predecessor. The seven hundred or so lines tell only the simple story
<pb n="102 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of a Sicilian maiden, of a sensitive and highly imaginative nature, who finds the hero of her dreams in King Pedro, whose noble beauty, bravery and knightly skill in arms has awakened a passion consuming her yet half-child life by its intensity:</p>

                              <p>"--the glances of the King 
Flashed on her soul and waked vibrations there 
Of known delights love-mixed to new and rare."</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>But this intense love preys upon her life, and she slowly sinks beneath the load of her secret, and the hopelessness of being loved by the king in return. Her parents watch with dismay the fading away of their treasure:</p>

Of seeking what will soothe her, promising 
That aught she longed for, though it were a thing 
Hard to come at as the Indian snow, 
Or roses that on Alpine summits blow, 
It should be hers. She answers with low voice, 
She longs for death alone-death is her choice, 
Death is the King who never did think scorn, 
But rescues every meanest soul to sorrow born."</p>

                           <p>At length, however, the sick girl slowly reviving asks her father to bring Minuccio, the great singer, to her bedside, and to him she confides the secret of her love for the King, and her earnest desire to acquaint him with that love:</p>

Moved greatly by Minuccio's song, King Pedro desires to know the full meaning of his enigmatic words. Made acquainted with the touching story, his kindly heart prompts him to appoint an hour for an interview with the dying girl, which takes place, and such grace comes to Lisa with the unexpected fulfillment of her brightest dream, that she might be near and hear the voice of the King, that she

PART THIRD.</head>
                        <p>MARGARET ALDEN was a "Vanquisher," as Anne used to call her. Belonging to the race of natural charmers, not so much by virtue of her beauty, as by the rare grace and tranquility which surrounded her with a magnetic atmosphere, she walked, despite herself, straight into unoccupied masculine hearts--feminine hearts, too, for that--matter,--for her discerning sex felt, whether they philosophized upon the fact, as Anne did, or not, that in her case, a Grecian chin, a perfectly poised head, a free, queenly walk, and a pair of clear, deep eyes <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> something, that they were the true exponents of a noble, tender and gracious womanhood, not the false, fair mask which nature sometimes allows her daughters to wear, deceiving the one sex, but never the other.</p>
                        <p>She knew her power, of course, as all queens must, and since the first intoxicating wonder and thrills of vanity with which she had learned it, upon her entrance into society, she had used it as a sacred trust. When she could, she turned her lovers gently from her, before an avowal, but when an avowal was inevitable, the scene was sure to be one of those which make men believe in women. The rejected suitor would pass from her presence, feeling as if he had been knighted and sworn to love Truth and Purity above all things else. His self-respect was never wounded; her graceful, sincere deference to his manhood, her respect
<pb n="106  The Woman's Advocate."/>
for her own womanhood, appealed to all that was real in him, and gave him a glimpse, at least, into the truths of Life.</p>
                        <p>The experience had so often come to Margaret, in its varying phases, that we cannot wonder if she hardly felt a tremor, when on looking up one May afternoon, as she sat sewing with her sister in the Rectory parlor, she saw a middle-aged, unmarried piece of propriety named Stephen Dawson, alight from a trim buggy, and walk decorously up to the door. "Mr. Dawson!" she remarked to her sister.</p>
                        <p>"Well, is it you or Tom he wants to see?" asked the pretty matron with a smile.</p>
                        <p>"Tom, I hope, but in case it isn't--quick! where is my Woman's Suffrage Petition? I think I can frighten the timid bird away with that!"</p>
                        <p>"I'm going up-stairs," said Alice, mischievously, picking up her work: "I must oversee that dressmaker."</p>
                        <p>"Now, Alice, stop! I won't have any such pranks!"-and seizing Mrs. Grey's little wrist in her firm grasp, she held her until it was too late to escape, discreetly dropping the hand, just before the parlor door opened to admit Mr. Dawson.</p>
                        <p>Straight, drabbish hair, pale eyes, and a wide, thin-lipped mouth were not personal charms, though they belonged to an exemplary man; neither were vanity and a timid regard for appearances, traits particularly calculated to master Margaret's soul. So it is not strange that in all her acquaintance with Mr. Dawson, she had scrupulously held him at a distance. But as in the case of the Rev. Launcelot Jones, her efforts thus far seemed only to charm this man of mould so much weaker than herself, and he was irresistibly attracted by her very strength and self-reliance. Leaving the conversation to him and Alice as far as might be, Margaret served in silence. At the first pause in a somewhat incoherent talk about the church-choir, the gentleman, turning to her asked if she would "take a drive with him, this pleasant afternoon."</p>
                        <p>"Thank you," said Margaret, "I believe I cannot leave all this sewing-work," turning it over in her work basket, and as she did so, disclosing a roll of paper. "O! here is a petition which Alice and I have signed; and here are pen and ink, you see, ready for you."</p>
                        <p>"Not a petition for Woman's Suffrage!" exclaimed the horror-stricken
<pb n="107 'To Warn, to Comfort, and Command.'"/>
Mr. Dawson, as he glanced at the heading. You have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> signed that, Miss Alden!"</p>
                        <p>"Why, certainly," said the young lady, lifting her eyes with a look of calm surprise, which, it must be owned, was a small piece of acting in our usually honest Margaret. But she thought she knew her patient, and administered her tonic accordingly.</p>
                        <p>"You do not really think--I mean--why, it is so unwomanly--excuse me!" Blushing at his unintended rudeness, he added: "I cannot imagine either of you ladies desiring to walk to the polls among the crowd of low fellows that hang about them."</p>
                        <p>"We can go in little squadrons," laughed Margaret, "under the escort of our gentlemen friends, if it is really such an ordeal. Though I have dropped letters into the post-office sometimes, and found it a very brief ceremony, which must resemble this of depositing a ballot, I should think."</p>
                        <p>"Ladies usually know so little of politics," murmured the drooping Dawson. Then, remembering the few, forcible words and the unassuming manner with which Margaret had incidentally explained to him, a few evenings before, certain differences in the laws of two States, he added humbly: "Exceptional cases like yourself and Mrs. Grey, would hardly prove the contrary."</p>
                        <p>"I know many quiet, domestic women, who are better versed than we, in such matters," replied Margaret, "and I am sure there are countless women of common sense, all over the land who would inform themselves, if there were a necessity for the exertion."</p>
                        <p>The conversation lasted some time, and we spare our readers a report of the arguments on each side, which they have heard so often, in these latter days. Although Margaret spoke as one who had given the subject attentive thought, and presented her views clearly and vigorously, she was by no means prepared for the result. Nor can <hi rend="italic">we</hi> fully explain what happened. Was it because Mr. Dawson was convinced by his opponent's logic? Was it the magnetic force of a beautiful woman's presence and will? Was it partly the pleasure of seeing his, name so near the free, smooth autograph--"Margaret B. Alden?" <hi rend="italic">What</hi> was it that constrained the man to take a pen from the bronze inkstand, and write his name on that hitherto odious petition? Margaret and Alice
<pb n="108 The Woman's Advocate."/>
exchanged looks which were a comical mixture of dismay and triumph; Mrs. Grey's sewing-work actually dropping from her hands. But, in aspect to Mr. Dawson, when quietly advocated by this elegant young lady, sewing deftly, and talking in her high-bred tones. It <hi rend="italic">did</hi> seem suddenly a little presumptuous in him to be telling her and her accomplished sister that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were not capable of having a voice in affairs which concerned them as closely as they did himself. We may be morally certain that after he went home he shook at the thought of his rashness, but at the time he was galvanized into heroism. When he had taken his leave reluctantly, at last, with a tender glance which Margaret <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not see, from his drab eyes,--when he had closed the door after him, and embarked in his trim buggy--the two women looked at each other again, and this time with a ringing laugh.</p>
                        <p>"O, Margaret," gasped Alice, that was too rich ! I wish Tom had been here! O! dear, if I don't have precious opportunities of seeing love-lorn men! It's worth while to have a young and attractive sister to matronize. My dear, unless you take to smoking and drinking, Mr. Dawson will propose, and I really think you had better! It is dreadful to go on, walking over people's hearts as you do."</p>
                        <p>Margaret looked at the signature in amusement. "Infatuation! I would never have believed it. There come Anne and Dr. Waltham!" she exclaimed suddenly, seeing two figures at the gate.</p>
                        <p>"Will there be a scene of any kind this time ?" asked Alice, checking a hiccough, and wiping away a tear.</p>
                        <p>"Never fear!" said Margaret gaily, hastening to the door.</p>
                        <p>Since the day, six months before, when Anne had first spoken of the physician to Margaret, the three had often met. First at Anne's home, where Dr. Waltham had called, as we saw he intended doing, and Anne, knowing, either by one of her "divinations," or in some other way, when, he would be likely to come, had contrived that Margaret should be visiting her, that very evening. She was determined that her two friends should know each other, and moreover, it is possible that she felt it prudent to bring Margaret early into the field, lest she should find herself some day in love with this man whom she admired so greatly. "And that shall never be," she said to herself, with a look as firm as Margaret's,
<pb n="109 'To Warn, to Comfort, and Command.'"/>
"I will be duenna, and they shall be hero and heroine." A- merry, unsuspected duenna she was, that evening, and the trio enjoyed themselves rarely.</p>
                        <p>Through the Winter they had often met, and had grown to be such a friendly triangle that it seemed very natural now to Margaret to see the other two at the door, after Anne's school hours, asking her to walk with them over the hill. "Yes," was the ready response, "come in, while I get my hat and sacque."</p>
                        <p>As she re-entered the parlor, equipped for the walk, Anne was exclaiming over Stephen Dawson's name, and Alice with a slight, roguish glance at her sister, who repaid it with a quick little frown, remarked: "Yes, that was for the special benefit of Margaret and myself. Very few other women are capable of voting, you understand, but Mr. Dawson was too gallant to refuse our request that he would enfranchise us."</p>
                        <p>"It isn't canny!" said Anne, solemnly, shaking her head. "Poor Stephen Dawson was in some abnormal condition. Did you drug him, or mutter an incantation over him, or what did you do? He has repented in sackcloth by this time, you may be sure."</p>
                        <p>"Have you signed it, Anne ?" asked Margaret.</p>
                        <p>"O yes, and Dr. Waltham, too. It isn't so very ignominious, after all," she continued, running over the list of names. "Here are Mrs. Butler, Mrs. Dillwynn, Dr. Arnold, and the Tremonts! In fact Mr. Dawson is in very respectable company, and that is what the good man has always desired through life, I believe."</p>
                        <p>"I heard a man declare yesterday," said Dr. Waltham with a smile, that the only men on any of the lists were hen-pecked husbands, who were coerced into signing, by their strong-minded keepers."</p>
                        <p>"My brother-in-law signed this, you notice," remarked Margaret demurely, buttoning her glove. Whereupon Mrs. Grey shook her little fist at her, and the three friends retreated in haste.</p>
                        <p>They were soon out of town, and up on the hill-road, strolling along like happy children, in the blithe May sunshine. As they walked under the maples and elms just veiled with a green film of young leaves, Dr. Waltham exclaimed: "Is there any time in the whole year, when the earth seems so like a thing bewitched, and is so utterly bewitching, as in this leafing season? I always feel bewildered, like a guest at some won-

derful fairy transformation. It is a miracle to which I never become accustomed."</p>
                        <p>"No," chimed in Anne, "and the mornings are the strangest and most intoxicating: times of all. Life seems unreal and glorious then,--but by noon I am apt to be sobered down, and find the world a contrary, dingy old place after all. That, however, is from no change in the weather, but because I am so easily jostled and disgusted by things I meet."</p>
                        <p>Anne made this confession rather by way of penance for the days when it <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been her experience than because this was one of them. She had been all day in one of her exalted moods, happy and strong, moving mountains as if they were straws. Even if she <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been feeling weak and discouraged before, the presence of Margaret and the Doctor would probably have rested and restrung her. When worn by the narrowness and selfishness and vulgarity of the people with whom she often came in contact, this was her unfailing balm.</p>
                        <p>Feeling acutely the countless unnamed currents and counter currents of daily life, lacking by nature genuine self-respect and self-reliance, she found it difficult to follow through fogs of self-distrust, her own ideals. Seeing too clearly sometimes for her own progress, the slender thread of truth that is entwined with most errors,--the vein of beauty that runs through many social fallacies, she often halted, fancying that it was presumptuous for her to hold aloft those standards in which her soul, at its truest, fully believed. Many young women and men know this bitter, corroding experience. May emancipation come -to them, as it did to Anne Markham, and doubtless, when it comes, it will be through the same avenues. On the one hand the blessed ministry of drudgery, suffering and self-conquest, which shall open the eyes of the sufferer to the stern and naked and awful realties of life. On the other the inspiration which such natures are quickest to feel--of ennobling human fellowships, teaching reverence for one's own individuality, and in consequence, a delicate respect for that of every fellow-being.</p>
                        <p>The solemn joy of introversion was almost new to Anne, and she walked quietly this afternoon, happy that her friends were with her, but hardly heeding what they said. The lesson which, by their example, they had unconsciously taught her, of possessing her own soul, was one
<pb n="111 'To Warn, to Comfort, and Command.'"/>
with which no stranger, and no friend, even, can intermeddle. They were the priests who had led her to the altar; there she found her God, and communed with him only.</p>
                        <p>Were they priests to each other, too, this man and woman? Did each feel an, accession of richness and sweetness, such as true friends always know? Surely they did. And was there, too, another element present in their happiness, that fair May evening? Was there, in both hearts, possessing and glorifying both, a love which was its own assurance of response ? The slanting sunshine which fell in blessing on their, brave, earnest faces, knew. The tender, eager, green leaves on the brown maple branches understood, for was not that the very meaning of the Spring which they were trying to utter? Longing and Life and Glory, asserting themselves out of Death and Dullness? - There had been dullness and the shadow of death in the lives of these two, but they had endured them humbly and hopefully. They had looked, awestricken into the depths of life, and walked afterwards with chastened, but unfaltering steps. Now the time of their supreme joy had come, and they met it with glad hearts. Dullness and Death would come again; that they knew, but this illuminated hour taught them what grief and penitence had as surely told them in the past, that Life and Love are eternal.</p>
                        <p>Anne had strayed musingly down the hill, looking for anemones. The others stood under the maples, watching the boats on the glittering river, feeling in some subtle way, that each was filling the other's heart. So it was easy for Dr. Waltham to turn to Margaret, saying: "It is strange that I am not afraid to ask you. But this golden hour seems like a prophecy, and gives me courage. Can I claim you, Margaret? Is it possible for me to be to you anything of what you are to me?"</p>
                        <p>The calm woman who had fronted so many lovers unmoved, found herself trembling for very bliss, and answering only by quiet tears. The strong man at her side rejoiced in them, and drawing her arm within his, said words which were the sweetest she had ever heard.</p>
                        <p>Anne chanced to look up from the meadow below, saw with a sudden flush of joy, the two figures standing side-by-side, and knew that it was for life. With a quick kiss of her hand and gesture of goodbye, she turned, and walked through the field towards home. </p>
                        <p>Happy lovers, and happy Anne! Tears ran down her cheeks as she

shared the joy which had come to her friends. No envy, no vague longing, even intruded. The fair portion which had fallen to them in this earthly life was very different from hers, but she felt to-night that she could walk alone. Her soul possessed itself, and though she knew it would often falter and faint in the march, it would never quite lose its hold of the heavenly things it had grasped in its highest hours. It had been on the Mount of Vision, and could never again be utterly blinded by the dust or darkness or glare of its daily path.</p>

PART FOURTH.</head>
                        <p>John Waltham had struggled for thirteen years. Poverty, toil, exhausting study, anxiety for those he loved, loneliness--these had been, until very lately, his familiar friends and his faithful teachers. Was it strange that in entering the happy school where "lovers' love," as Anne called it, was the wonderful master, the man was bewildered? After he had left Margaret at the Rectory door, he walked on, the feeling growing stronger every moment that it was only a beautiful dream, a degree more distinct, than the visions that the solitary student had sometimes had--that every young man has,--of the peerless, unknown being, whom he shall some day call wife. He walked and walked, that night, out of the city again, into the darkness, trying to realize his happy destiny--trying to find his place again in life. He had been calm when he told Margaret his love. Now he was dizzy, and could have wept. The wonderful revolution in his life had turned the very heavens. It was a new earth that he was treading, and he must become acquainted with it anew. He had been Margaret's friend, but who could have believed that he would ever be her accepted lover? How had that strange courage come to him in the sunset hour on the hill?</p>
                        <p>When he entered his house, in the dead of the star-lit night, he carried home with him the quiet and solemnity, the wonderful peace which night can infuse into the seeking soul.</p>
                        <p>The next morning as Margaret, Mr. and Mrs. Grey and little Madge, sat at the breakfast table, the former dreamily eating muffins without any butter, the nut-brown Rosa brought in a note. Pretty Mrs. Grey peered over the tall coffee-pot--"Whose writing? Mr. Dawson's, I suppose. To say that, as a slight reward of merit for his performance yesterday,
<pb n="113 'To Warn, to Comfort, and Command.'"/>
he would suggest himself as a candidate for the office of Consort and General Protector to Miss Alden, and would like her to vote for him at once. Is that the way his petition reads? Why, you sinner! not going to let me read it, when I was present throughout that memorable interview and he all but offered himself in spite of me! Tom, I do believe the creatures will get to proposing before me, some of these days. They soon won't mind me any more than if I were a deaf, blind old duenna.".</p>
                        <p>I don't believe the note is from Mr. Dawson, said Mr. Grey, who had given Margaret a shrewd, investigating glance. If it is, Alice, you and I are going to have Stephen for a brother-in-law, and I shall retire to my study at once to write the dismalest sermon <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever gaped at. Now, Margaret, there is no escape for you! I never saw you eat muffins without butter before, and I never saw you blush so prettily over a note. And there is no Stephen Dawson in the affair, and you shall say who <hi rend="italic">is!</hi> Here is some butter for you. Now give us your confidence! And Alice, my dear, mark my words, your arduous career as duenna is over."</p>
                        <p>"Why, Tom--Margaret, what do you mean?" cried Alice, in bewilderment.</p>
                        <p>Margaret, putting the note into the envelope, and then into her pocket, said: "Tom is right. The note is from the man to whom I am engaged."</p>
                        <p>"Dr. Waltham!" exclaimed Alice by an inspiration, and jumping from her chair, the little lady hugged her sister vehemently, laughing, crying and scolding because she had not told her before.</p>
                        <p>"Why!" said the smothered Margaret, "I was going to, of course, but Tom saved me half the trouble."</p>
                        <p>--"And deserves to be rewarded," said the clerical gentleman kissing her heartily. "I am almost as much delighted as when your sister made that capital match a few years ago."</p>
                        <p>Alice pinched him, declaring, "O, that fellow proved to be a conceited, saucy creature!"</p>
                        <p>Tom continued more gravely: "Dr. Waltham is the very man for you, Margaret, and you the woman for him. I can bless you both with all my heart!"</p>
                        <pb n="114 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"O! dear, so can I," said Alice, still crying and smiling, but I can't bear to have Margaret engaged, after all."</p>
                        <p>Little Madge had climbed into her aunt's lap, and with her fat arms wound tightly around her neck, declared firmly "It was her own aunty! What for was aunty 'gaged? Was Dr. Walfam 'gaged, too?"</p>
                        <p>Then the wondering blue eyes were taught that the little red lips mustn't tell callers, yet, that "aunty was 'gaged."</p>
                        <p>"Though, Margaret," said Alice, if you are merciful to the Dawson species, you will announce the engagement before long. It will save, let me see, three proposals, I should say!"</p>
                        <p>The council was now reinforced by the arrival of Anne, who rushed in, breathless and bright, on her way to school, declaring that "Things do come right sometimes in this crooked world!" Seeing by the smile which met her oracular sentence that Tom and Alice knew, she sat down for a rhapsody which was abruptly cut short by the sound of her inexorable school-bell.</p>
                        <p>The following summer was the brightest any of the "Triangle" had ever known. Margaret and the Doctor were "models," Alice said. "So sensible and patient, never making you feel that yon, were <hi rend="italic">de trop.'</hi> Anne fully endorsed this praise, though, with her old horror of being "third party," she was not very likely to intrude, unsummoned, upon any <hi rend="italic">t&#x00EA;te-&#x00E0;t&#x00EA;tes.</hi> The deep friendship which existed between her and the others grew stronger, if possible, day by day.</p>
                        <p>The time fixed for the marriage was in October, and in one of the Rectory councils preceding it, Anne said suddenly to Mr. Grey "Why, you are a clergyman! You will marry them, won't you ?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh!" said Tom, with a wry face, "You know Margaret is a naughty dissenter, and devotedly attached to her own pastor, Mr. Baldwin, who is an old friend of her father's besides. So I am to give her away."</p>
                        <p>With a merry glance at Margaret, Anne said: "It is because your service says 'obey', I verily believe! Consistency forbids this strong-minded young woman, who has circulated a petition for Female Suffrage, to promise anything more humble than to 'warn, comfort, and command!'"</p>
                        <p>Dr. Waltham looked up brightly at Margaret. He thought it an odd coincidence. He had been repeating the poem to her, that very after-

noon. "I do not feel afraid," he said, "I hardly think she will domineer!"</p>
                        <p>"There is no telling," replied Margaret--(how "fair and <hi rend="italic">debonnaire</hi> she looked, as she spoke!) "Allow me to remind you that I am

                        <head>CONCERNING ONE OBJECTION.</head>
                        <p>A FEW months ago an article appeared in a county paper which, being a fair specimen of those with which the opposers of the "woman question" are flooding the country, I propose noticing a few points which this "Objector" urged against a reform, now pressing forward, as we trust, to a speedy victory.</p>
                        <p>The main argument which Mr. "Objector" uses--and it is about the only missile left which those of his opinion venture to use--is, that woman is too good to vote; altogether too pure and angelic to "dabble in the dirty pool of politics." Now we must confess to a quiet laugh in our sleeve, when we recall what we have read of the objections urged far more vehemently several years ago.</p>
                        <p>It used to be argued that woman's inferiority was sufficient to bar her, not merely from the ballot-box, but from positions which she is today filling nobly and well. If our revered grandmothers and great-aunts could read, write and cipher, their education was deemed complete. When the extension of educational facilities for woman first began, it was met with strong opposition. Her mental capacity was far below that of man, and above all, her weak physical frame could never endure the weight of even Algebra and Latin, much less that of Logic and Men
<pb n="116 The Woman's Advocate."/>
tal Philosophy. But the High School system admitting girls, was established first in the good old Bay State. By-and-by, Western Colleges began to spring up and open their doors to young women; and as the somewhat fearful professors witnessed the ease with which the daughters kept pace with, and often outstripped the sons, they could but proclaim their success to the world. So it was when the early advocates of "woman's rights" took the field; they were everywhere met with taunts about the inferiority of the sex. As the years have rolled on, and our educated ladies are now found in the physician's office, the artist's and sculptor's studio, with the mighty pen in their hands, upon the lecturer's platform, at the book-keeper's desk, before the compositor's frame, and in all our schools, no one ventures to deny them the right of suffrage on the score of inferiority.</p>
                        <p>Think you then that the mouths of objectors can thus be closed ? Far from it; for with a skillful "Right-about-face," they now present their latest weapon, namely, "woman's superiority." Says our objector, "people may talk as they please of the equality of the sexes, but I don't believe a syllable of it. They are not equal, and what is more, they never can be. Woman is certainly superior to man." My dear sir, such a remark as this, years ago, would have been sufficient to brand you as a traitor in the camp of your brothers, but now you undertake to use It as a final settler of the "woman question." Verily, a "change has come o'er the spirit of your dreams." Well, put it upon this ground if you choose; we are willing to meet it fairly and squarely. First, we would ask why pure and upright men (like yourself, for instance) have anything at all to do with that which is so vile and corrupting as the politics of to-day ? Can one descend into the mire and come forth spotless, because, forsooth, he is a man? We think not; and if our political system has indeed become as foul as you represent, we insist that all of those possessed of a true and noble manhood should shun the slightest approach to its vicinity.</p>
                        <p>What! shall our pastors, those appointed to break unto us the "bread of life," descend from their exalted positions, mingle with the "common herd," and wend their way to the ballot-box? Shall our elders and deacons, and other brethren in the church, leave the prayer meetings, where they are expected to do all of the praying and speaking for the
<pb n="117 Concerning One Objection."/>
edification of those whose "name is holiest," but whom custom will not permit to rise and say that they love their Lord and Saviour--shall these pillars of the church pass out from such scenes to engage in the "villainies of office seeking?" Shall the devoted young men of the Christian Associations of our land, throw off the garb of religion and assist in the skimming of our seething political cauldron, such a very witch broth as it contains? Shall our Boards of Education and School Superintendents, in whose hands are the interests of thousands of young immortals, go forth, and forgetting their high calling, meddle with so gross a subject as the government of their country? And the thousands of tradesmen, honest laborers, and aspiring students, who by their true lives are witnesses that "God made man in the image of Himself"--shall these touch pitch and not be defiled? Nay, verily! My good sir, if politics are indeed past redemption, so shocking in their reaction upon all that have aught to do with them, we beg leave to sound a note of warning for the benefit of that half of the race which is so surely and speedily rushing on to destruction. Shall those noble men, who periled life and limb for our country's sacred cause; who formed about as an irresistable living breastwork, and to whom under God we owe our present peace and prosperity, shall these our noble defenders be permitted to degrade themselves, without a single remonstrance from grateful and loving hearts? Flag of our country, forbid! If, as you affirm, you can only keep woman pure and worthy of your regard by not "permitting her to tamper with that which has a tendency to degrade," so we affirm that in the same manner would we provide for the welfare of our brothers. But you say, perhaps, that <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> should be pure and angelic (ahem) at all hazards, but as for man it doesn't matter. In an exalted standard for true womanhood, we allow no one to exceed us, but where do you get your authority for lowering that of true manhood ? Not from the Scriptures, surely; for where will you find commands relating to purity and goodness, more binding upon women than upon men. Does the Bible teach us that "God cannot look upon sin in woman with the least degree of allowance?" Hence we claim that your argument either includes all the good of your own sex, or else it falls to the ground. A mother, mature with the experience of fifty years, may not go to the polls to deposit a slip of paper which makes known her choice of those who shall dispose of her
<pb n="118 The Woman's Advocate."/>
taxes and make the laws to which she is amenable; but her boy, the pride and delight of her heart, upon whose brow has fallen the light of but twenty one summers, walks off conscious of the dignity conferred upon him by his carefully cultivated mustache and the reaching of his majority, to mingle with those whose presence would degrade that noble mother, who follows him with her blessing. Away with such false notions of truth and justice, and let them hide their heads with shame, as the Right comes proudly marching on. Again what noble magnanimity is shown in not "permitting" us to soil our garments by having a voice in the election of our rulers. A youth following the example of his elders, gravely informed a young lady, that "<hi rend="italic">they</hi> didn't consider it proper that she should receive the ballot," whereupon she coolly informed him that she preferred to be her own judge in that matter. Sift the subject closely and see the unparalleled impudence (not always intentional, we grant) exhibited by those who say "we are men, the 'lords of creation,' we intend to make the laws to suit ourselves; we are going to tax you, to try, fine, imprison or hang you, <hi rend="italic">just as we please</hi>, and you are not going to be '<hi rend="italic">permitted</hi>' to say anything about the matter either, for <hi rend="italic">we</hi> don't think it is best." Thank you, gentlemen, for your <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> generosity, it is worthy of the Dark Ages.</p>
                        <p>But you say that women don't wish to vote, that they would not if they had the opportunity. We admit that a majority are indifferent about it, although the cause is advancing rapidly. But if there is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> who wishes suffrage (and there are <hi rend="italic">thousands</hi> who do), what right have you as fellow mortals and fellow citizens to refuse it. If, as " Objector " says, "woman occupies the dearest place in the heart of man," let him show "his faith by his works." Again, the comparing of woman to the delicate vine and man to the sturdy oak, may sound very prettily in a sentimental poem, or fancy love story, but in the stern realities of life nothing can be more absurd. Certainly in these times, after the laying low of so many of our "noble oaks" upon the altar of our country, it would not be very seemly or expedient, for women to undertake to play the role of the vine. We greatly fear that some of them will never have aught to lean upon, save their own exertions. Seeing that so many of us are trying to fight the battle of life bravely and single handed, don't, we beg of you, call us "vines" any longer. At least may we not be likened, to the graceful

elm which bows before the passing storm, but losing none of its strength, is soon as erect and beautiful as before. And as the elm needs and receives the same nourishment from the air and soil, the same sunshine and rain, as does the oak, so woman needs and should receive the same rights and privileges as man, in this great field of life.</p>

[PART FIRST.]</head>
                        <p>COMPOSITORS WANTED.--Compositors out of employment will hear of good situations by making immediate application at the office of THE UNIVERSE. Women compositors preferred. A School for Learners is connected with the office.</p>
                        <p>Marian Eveleth sat with a copy of the paper in her hand containing the above notice, a new train of thought awakened in her mind by its perusal. Bereft of both her parents by a malignant fever, which had visited their village home a few months previous to the opening of our story, deprived of the sweet companionship of brother or sister, Marian Eveleth at eighteen found herself alone in the world, realizing, after the first benumbing of sorrow, the necessity of--
<q direct="unspecified">--"taking fate in her hands"</q>
and resolutely shaping for herself a new existence. While her parents lived, the pension settled upon Major Eveleth for gallant services rendered his country, had been sufficient to afford them the means of comfortable support and enable Marian to gratify the few inexpensive tastes of her retiring nature; but with his death this dependence ceased, and the suddenly bereaved girl after paying the last sad rites of affection and faithfully discharging every incurred obligation, found herself the possessor of only a few hundred dollars, which the sale of the household effects with which she could bring herself to part, had realized. And now the problem of life was before her. Putting gratefully but firmly aside the invitations of kindred or friends to eat the bread of charity beneath their roofs, she seriously pondered in her mind the different methods whereby she could secure independence and the means of livelihood. Living within a few hours ride of the metropolis, with which, from occasionally visiting in earlier years, she was somewhat familiar, she decided, without gravitating in her mind to any particular vocation that the battle of life was to be fought out in New York.</p>
                        <p>With Marian Eveleth to think was to execute, and the cheery sun of a May morning shone upon her, sitting in the far-up little room of a
<pb n="121  Thrown Upon the World"/>
Broadway hotel which she had temporarily engaged while she could institute the search necessary to obtain employment. Poor girl! Alone and in New York! How much more of an ordeal it was all than it seemed, thinking it over in that village home that was no more hers! More than human would she have been--as she gazed out upon that splendor and bewilderment of life, myriads, no one of whom had knowledge of or interest in her--that city so fair to seeming, yet whose concealed, ever-opened jaws of destruction had engulphed thousands as lovely and as pure--if something of her courage had not forsaken her, and a wave of desolation swept across her soul more bitter perchance to endure than the first uncontrollable grief of bereavement. But this revulsion was but momentary. Bravely crushing the tears forcing their way to the clear gray eyes, she suppressed all outward signs of emotion, and once more perused the notice which had so forcibly arrested her attention. Yes, why might she not be a compositor? Teacher or governess she could not endure to be; the shops were over-filled with saleswomen toiling from early dawn to long after dark frequently for a moiety of compensation; with her needle she had no skill, even if work of that kind were procurable; but, though she had not before thought of it, here was something she was confident she could do--set type. True, it would take time to learn. It might be several months before she could earn what it would cost to live in the city, but girls did make good wages at it, she knew, and perhaps her little, carefully hoarded sum would be sufficient to support her, in a very economical way, until she could be earning wages and no longer need to draw upon it. Swiftly these reflections flashed through her mind, and, determining that her first application should be in answer to the advertisment, she cut it out, placed it carefully in her portemonnaie, hurriedly made the few preparations needed, and sallied out to seek the address indicated.</p>
                        <p>The office of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, one of the great metropolitan dailies, forming an attractive feature of Printing House Square, was easily found by Marian. At the date of our story, a peculiar phase of affairs, well remembered as of so recent occurrence, was being witnessed in that establishment so powerfully contributing to the formation of public opinion in our Republic. A strike, threatening the entire derangement of its ordinary working machinery and even that crowning mortification

of a New York daily--its regular morning appearance-was in progress. The most thoroughly organized and potent labor organization in the land, the National Typographical Union, in consequence of the culmination, of a long-seated and growing difficulty, had issued its verdict. The "sticks" dropped from the skilled fingers of two-score and more of men at the fiat; remonstrances on the part of the Manager, and even of the Editor-in-chief, who left his sanctum where undisturbed upon ordinary occasions he forged his thunderbolts,--were unavailing to avert the calamity. What was to be done? To miss even a single issue, affording a theme of merriment for envious contemporaries, was too appalling a mishap to be thought of. A council of the entire office staff and principal stockholders was held. All sorts of expedients were resorted to. Unwilling reporters and sub-editors, who had risen from the composing-room to higher positions, were pressed into the service; old matter standing upon galleys, with the mould of time upon it was carefully exhumed; advertisements were kept standing to save composition, yet with all the expedients that fertile brains could suggest, matters steadily approached a crisis. One of two policies was inevitable: <hi rend="italic">the employment of girls as compositors</hi>, or a submission to the terms of the Union. The former, regarded as less degrading than a concession to a dictorial body, was the one adopted. Advertisements inserted in the leading papers, and handbills posted in conspicuous places, offering women compositors the same rates of compensation as hitherto paid their refractory workmen, produced the desired effect. Despite the threats of the more villainous members of the Union, many of whom were now roaming the streets out of employment, the girls eagerly availed themselves of such good fortune, soon measurably filling their places; while, in the stress of emergency, even novitiates were taken tenderly by the hand and promised the speediest introduction into the mysteries of Faust and Guttenberg.</p>
                        <p>It was at this favoring stage of affairs for applicants--the first successful bridging of the difficulty--that Marian Eveleth presented herself at the open door of the long, airy composing room of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, somewhat reassured by the first glimpse of its attractive appearance, with the rows of tidily-dressed girls standing or sitting at the stands arranged in methodical order throughout the many-aisled room. A slight ring of the bell brought a bright-appearing boy, by whom, at her re-
<pb n="123  Thrown Upon the World"/>
quest, she was conducted to the inner room of the "Manager." Typesetting at the time of which we speak, although rapidly growing- in favor, was yet regarded as something of a novelty. The barriers of prejudice precluding women from this as from other callings, were yet far from being removed. Applications for instruction in the office of the journal whose offer had been regarded as something of a heresy by its natural constituency, had not been numerous, and Marian found herself even warmly welcomed by the urbane Manager, who was possessed of sufficient discernment to see that the girl before him was superior to the class in their employment, and likely soon to prove a valuable acquisition at the nominal rate paid to learners during the period of tuition. Blandly acquainting Marian with the terms upon which all applicants, were received, the duration of the contract, etc.,--not forgetting to mention the rapid advancement of one or two girl compositors in their employment,--Mr. Stetson soon had the pleasure of seeing Marian to the door of his "den," with the promise of her appearance on the following morning.</p>
                        <p>Days rolled swiftly away. Spring and Summer both were passed; late Autumn came, and Marian Eveleth was still in the composing-room of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, but no longer as a learner. From the first, under the instruction of Mrs. Waldron, Superintendent of the Department, herself a thorough compositor, her progress had been remarkably rapid; and now, although the period of probation had not expired, its conditions for some time had been practically disregarded, she herself, at an increased salary having been promoted to the position of her former instructor, whose failing health had compelled her to seek some less laborious employment. Marian indeed was in her element. From a child fond of books, having formed, under her father's careful supervision, habits of discrimination and criticism upon works, she was enabled, with her rare enthusiasm, to make rapid progress, mastering the intricacies of the art with an ease and celerity rendering her the wonderment of all her fellow compositors. Insensibly, upon all questions relating to orthography or sentence construction, she grew to be regarded as authority; and ere the Summer was over, she had assumed, by tacit assent, almost the entire final supervision of "proofs," hitherto the undisputed province of Mr. Jobson, the somewhat testy yet kindly-hearted old proof-reader.
<pb n="124  The Woman's Advocate."/>
Indeed, could some of her old acquaintances, who received the intelligence that she was setting type with sundry shrugs of the shoulder and ill-natured comments to the effect that Marian Eveleth would soon weary of that sort ot thing;--have looked in upon her as she busied herself with her varied duties, finding the day all too short for their discharge, they would, in very shame have desired to retract assertions so derogatory to her true character, and the admiration extorted by her sedulous discharge of duties.</p>
                        <p>Among the twenty or more girls employed as compositors in the office of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, Marian found a great variety of character and temperament, connected with a uniformity and conservatism of ideas that pained and astonished her. Reserved by nature, she had felt it a duty incumbent on her to cultivate friendly relations with those around her, and seek, by such quiet ways as might suggest themselves, to remove the injurious impressions which pernicious teaching or ignorance had allowed to grow up in their minds. A few weeks following her first connection with the office, while she was yet a pupil with kind Mrs. Waldron, an opportunity was afforded of inculcating the first of her moral lessons. A committee of ladies, canvassing for signers to a Woman Suffrage petition, had visited the workroom and besought, with little success, the girls to unite with the names already appended to the petition. To subserve several political purposes, <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> for a time had lent its broad pages to the publication of matter more or less connected with the growing question of Woman's enfranchisement, while the employment of girls had been adduced as an evidence of its sincerity; and this, in connection with the intimate relations existing between the members of the committee and certain conductors of the journal, rendered the ladies exceedingly desirous that as many signatures to the petition should be procured among its employees as possible. But they had miscalculated the weight of the impression produced by the half-patronizing, half-satirical articles of the would-be American "Thunderer." Over their "copy" the brighter of the girls, many of whom were foreign by birth, not infrequently converted into ridicule the outspoken opinions of the champions of Woman Suffrage, denying any right or desire to participate in political affairs; and when members of the committee approached them separately, earnestly beseeching their
<pb n="125  Thrown Upon the World."/>
co-operation, our Marian was the only one willing to trace her, name upon the paper.</p>
                        <p>"Why, girls!" said the leading spokeswoman, the well-known Mrs. ----, losing, in the vexation of the moment her usual suavity of manners, "do you know that you are doing the most impolitic thing for yourselves imaginable! I do not appeal now to conviction or principle, but ask you in the light of common sense, how you can be so blind to your own interests! At this moment you hold your positions by the uncertain tenure of an accident, which any day you may lose. Baffled men, who have pursued you with threats even to the doors of this office, wait only the first favorable opportunity to hurl you from the places which, with their consent, they mean you shall never fill; yet while the avenues of employment, whereby you may secure fair remuneration for your labor, can only be properly opened by woman's participation herself in government, you stand back, through indifference or abject cowardice--the fear of being termed 'strong-minded'--losing all these beneficent results and allowing the injustice of centuries to be perpetuated."</p>
                        <p>"Come, Mrs.----," said the Manager approaching the corner of the room where she had drawn a knot of the girls by her eloquence, "you must not sow treason among these young ladies. You are not on the platform of Cooper Hall now, and they have no time to listen to your eloquence. <hi rend="italic">The Universe,</hi> with your address, comes out to-morrow, and if they are not converted by the labor of composition, you may send the office a score or more of tickets to your next lecture, and we will afford you an opportunity of making proselytes of all of us."</p>
                        <p>Laughingly concealing their discomfiture the ladies withdrew, but the subject introduced afforded the chief theme of conversation that afternoon in the composing room; and Marian improved the opportunity of speaking of the necessity of such petitions, giving her views at length of the "Woman Movement," the effect it would have upon society, and why all women--especially working--women should favor it, for whose condition the repeal of oppressive laws and obliterating of tyrannical forms of custom would do so much. She spoke calmly, yet with that earnestness which is the result of a deep-seated conviction; and was gratified to see that she was listened to with attention, and that the array of<pb n="126  The Woman's Advocate."/>
testimony which she brought forward to substantiate her position was not without its effect.</p>
                        <p>I shall make converts of some of these poor girls yet, she said softly to herself, as one by one she made a satisfactory disposition of their objections; and when meek, little Lizzie Fay, the pet of the office, stumbled on the name of a certain well-known advocate of Woman Suffrage, whose cognomen for coarseness was in all mouths and brought it forward as the crowning objection, she was enabled to say hopefully:--</p>
                        <p>"Nay, Lizzie, we judge not the many by one: we condemn not a society for the unauthorized action of one of its members. Miss ---- may have done many indiscreet things, but are follies confined to Reformers? Think of the thousand absurdities practiced by the followers of fashion, and marvel not if earnest, thoughtful women, seeking to right these flagrant evils--the tyranny of fashion on the one hand, and the horrors of legalized degradation on the other-should err occasionally in the opposite extreme. And after all, the woman reformers, whose strongly-marked individuality or coarser fibre of being permits them to take positions or give utterance to sentiments which enables the public (itself more culpable) to cry "unsexed" "mannish,"-- are but few. I venture to say that in no society of which women are members, be its purpose what it may, are there more pure, unselfish women, true-hearted and lofty in purpose, than in the so-called Woman Movement. The scroll is blazoned with their names. Ah, Lizzie, I wish you could know some of those noble spirits as it has been my fortune to know them! You would feel that an atmosphere of purity was surrounding you; your soul would be elevated by the contact; glimpses would come to you of a higher life than your unillumined nature had before realized. My father, in a quiet way, was a Reformer, and in my earlier life our house was the stopping-place of the few lecturers, men and women, whom a Paul's burning love for humanity, brought to our quiet village. Then the Anti-Slavery movement--the mother of the Woman Question--was the all-absorbing subject of discussion. How well I remember those days--the little school-house gatherings-the needed but oft unpalatable truths of the lectures--and the, to me, priceless hours of intercourse with those wandering, self-sacrificing missionaries who obeyed literally our Saviour's command of providing naught for their journeys,--beneath my father's

roof Then Abby Kelley-now the Mrs. Foster <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> so reviled yesterday-was a frequent visitant. One of the most fearless of speakers, her coming was always a notable event; and, in her tarryings with us, her words of wisdom and inexpressibly beautiful example made an ineffaceable, impression upon my mind. Dear Abby Kelley! she lies upon a sick bed now, but surely there are those, beside the bondmen for whom she labored through those weary years, who, remembering what a faithful Mentor she was to their undisciplined natures, will 'rise to call her blest!' Then, too, our guest-chamber was once honored by the occupancy of Lucretia Mott--the distinguished Quaker preacher and philanthropist of world-wide reputation. What sanctity and benediction she brought to our roof! In the afternoon she delivered a regular sermon, but in the evening she lectured upon the sin of slavery and such a lecture as it was! Indeed she spake as one inspired. People, attracted by her reputation, came many miles to hear her. It was a large audience, but long ere she concluded there was scarcely a dry eye in all the house. Her husband, James Mott, who takes almost an equal interest in reformatory matters, accompanied her, such a tender affection existing between them that only some imperative necessity is permitted ever to separate them. After the lecture, quite a number followed Lucretia to our house, eager to hear yet more from those lips of eloquence. As she sat that evening in our parlors, the center of an admiring circle, wearing her simple Quaker garb, that became her more than the costliest robe an empress, I could only think of some divinely-annointed priestess ministering to the spiritually hungering, to doubt the holiness of whose mission was a sacrilege. Ah, girls, could you know these noble women whose lives are a constant labor for humanity--who count toil, privation, and even persecution, as nothing so wrong may be righted and human suffering alleviated, you would feel as grieved as I to see their names held up to ridicule by those incapable of appreciating their heaven-recorded sacrifices."</p>
                        <p>Marian ceased, scarcely conscious that she had been drawn into such unwonted length of speech, and the more pressing work of the office prevented further conversation upon the subject. But in more than one mind thought had been awakened, and Marian pursued her task with a
<pb n="128  The Woman's Advocate."/>
light heart, more than ever satisfied that the "seed" sown must bring forth precious fruit in the end.</p>

                        <head>THE PREVAILING FEAR OF GENUINE DEMOCRACY.</head>
                        <p>WHAT strikes one as the chief point in all the arguments of such as Dr. Bushnell, is the evident dread of genuine Democracy on which they are founded. It is pitiful to notice how this fear permeates many so-called thoughtful circles. Every evil, social and political, <hi rend="italic">born of the limitations of the Past</hi>, is regarded as a striking proof of the dangers of a free and unqualified participation in the functions of Republican citizenship. The idea of limitation, of caste and class, has in some form or another been the rule of all the governments the world has hitherto seen. The resistance among these circles to the practical realization of the opposite, seems to increase with the nearness of its advent.</p>
                        <p>Especially is this the case with a certain type of intellectual culture, best represented perhaps at one of its poles by Dr. Bushnell, and at another by David A. Wasson. The Doctor shows the feelings which animate his opposition to Woman's Suffrage when, in speaking of the Chinese, he says: "God forbid that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> ever be so far captivated by our dreadfully cheap way of suffrage as to give up their cadetship way of promotion for it; a plan that has put the <hi rend="italic">whole nation</hi> climbing upward, and will keep it climbing to the end of the world." We add, and will continue to produce the same results. It is a "way of promotion" which has existed for twenty centuries, and makes the millions at the end, as all through, "hewers of wood and drawers of water;" utterly ignoring the entire womanhood of the nation, allowing no freedom in marriage, the most sacred and important act, compelling maternity to commit murder, and deeming it wrong to give them education.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bushnell's Chinese "cadetship way of promotion" results, as the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> forcibly put it a few days since, in discussing the question of "John's" emigration into this country,--in the
<pb n="129  The Prevailing Fear of Genuine Democracy."/>
making of a people patient, laborious, industrious and pains-taking but without moral stamina and none of that vigorous robustness which is required to lead. More than all, the twenty centuries of competitive examination on which Dr. Bushnell expatiates so admiringly has left as its main legacy a class of cultivated persons, who are there, as here and elsewhere, the chief obstacles to progress to the reception of new, ideas, to the establishment of new forms. It seems to be just as much a necessity of literary culture or scholarship to establish hierarchical limitations, as it is of theological training and practice, to endeavor to do so. Of course there must be a belief in superior fitness to rule, as there is in the priesthood of a conviction of their divine right to guide morally, and control religiously, the characters of those who are about them.</p>
                        <p>All the objections to the suffrage for woman are born, when analyzed to their primary ideas, of a distrust of Republican institutions. All that we hear from such minds as Mr. Wasson's of the dangers of democracy, results from an unacknowledged fear that <hi rend="italic">their</hi> ideal of life may not rule, and from a too lively conception of such evils as exist to-day, born of the oppressions of yesterday, and not properly or at all to be charged to the account of Democracy. </p>
                        <p>The advocates, even, of woman suffrage--that logical outcome of Democratic premises--are not entirely free from these doubts. Of some, at least, this is true. Those who exclaim constantly against ignorant men having the ballot, in the limitations of their logic fail to see that a whip is at once placed in the hands of their enemies, were these latter but brave enough to squarely face the true ground on which all of them stand. If an artificial rule of intelligence and not humanhood, is to be the test of one's right to participate in the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, then, on what ground can the ballot be claimed for the great body of the women? Certainly, as a rule they are ignorant of political affairs, and, the very restrictions against which we are protesting, have narrowed and belittled them to an astonishing degree. This, of course, is one of the reasons that animates such men as Dr. Bushnell in opposing this movement. But then, like all the reasoners of whom he is so excellent a type, he confounds Cause and Effect, or rather ignores the former and builds his antagonism on the latter. The wrongs of a thousand years culminated in the French Revolution of 1793.
<pb n="130 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Ever since, shallow but plausible writers and talkers on history and politics, have descanted on the horrors of the Reign of Terror, forgetting or ignorant of the fact, that far worse horrors growing out of oppression oligarchic misrule and autocratic tyranny, daily afflicted the PEOPLE for centuries before the crimes of the Government culminated in that mad vengeance of outraged humanity. Ever since we have had the incompetency of the French to sustain a free government thrust in our faces, forgetful of the fact that under exceptionally favorable circumstances this Nation itself, with but eighty years of tradition and precedent behind it, had to bathe itself in the bloodiest of sacrificial seas ere it could be cleansed of a wrong that was eating out its vitals.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bushnell declares suffrage is not a natural right, but an acquired privilege, bestowed by the State to secure the public good. This definition utterly ignores the fundamental question of "Who are the State?" Judging by Dr. Bushnell's complimentary reference to the Chinese, it ought to be only those whose skill or wisdom enables them to reach a certain degree of culture, and secure position in the administration of affairs. From the stand-point from which American Independence was wrought out, the PEOPLE constitute the State. Of course it cannot be ignored that the term PEOPLE is a convertible or moveable one, and has a narrow or broader scope attached to it in different ages. But the American idea admits of but one interpretation,--that of all who are governed by law participating in the formation thereof. Every evil that has seriously threatened this Nation has grown more or less directly out of attempts to limit the meaning of the term PEOPLE, just as at the present time the most threatening evil found in American thought and discussion, is the fear which intelligence or culture exhibits at the idea of broadly embracing all the People within the Government. Suffrage may not be, in a strict logical sense, such a natural right as is the right to life, air, water, food or motion. But experience proves it beyond doubt to be the necessary shield of those natural rights; the best weapon with which in a Republican community they can be defended, and the surest lever by which individual position can be advanced, and the security of the whole be ensured. The American idea is <hi rend="italic">inclusion</hi> not <hi rend="italic">exclusion</hi>. It is a safe rule to work with. If the Dr. Bushnells
<pb n="131  Broken in Spirit"/>
would only stop opposing the inevitable and turn in and educate and prepare the masses for it, they would really show themselves "wise in their day and generation." But there is a radical and irreconcilable difference. They believe only in individual leadership, and fail to see that the truest way to gain that, is to merge oneself in the modern "the word <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>"--accept Democracy and use all <hi rend="italic">their</hi> energies, to make the units worthy of that all comprehensive idea.</p>

                        <p>THE Winter of 1868-9--as will be recollected--was remarkable for its mildness, and up to the first of March there had been no possible opportunity for the farmers of southern Ohio to fill their ice-houses for their Summer use.</p>
                        <p>February had given us only sunny days and frosty nights. The sugar trees were pouring out their juices in profusion. The peach-buds were showing the stir of life within, and the golden crocus lifted its head saucily among the emerald spires beside the door. The boys said the "bottom of the road had fallen out," and one suggested that old Winter

                                 <l>And silently passed away."</l>

                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>March introduced himself in a flurry of snow and sleet, and might be said to "come in like a lion," and <hi rend="italic">the boys</hi>--those same six-foot boys that fought the enemies of freedom through all those terrible years of war--were really cowed before the prospect of an empty ice-house.</p>
                        <p>"No ice for your butter next Summer, good mother," said Mark.</p>
                        <p>"Pho!" answered the energetic house-wife-"No ice for your ice-cream parties, you mean; I know who wants the ice; I've made good butter many a year without it, and I'll be bound I can again. Guess my cream won't suffer so much."</p>
                        <p>Mark and Tom winked at each other and at me and passed out.</p>
                        <p>I was an invalid confined to my arm-chair, and many a jolly laugh I

had with my stalwart nephews. The second of March it grew colder. The third, the frost pinched our fingers and nipped the fair cheeks of our russets and pearmain that were left on the sideboard. The fourth--the glorious fourth, that was to wreathe the brow of the hero of Vicksburg and Appomattox with the brightest laurels our country has to bestow--came upon us with a fearful northeaster.</p>
                        <p>"Hurrah!" shouted Tom as he came in at night. The ice on Rainbow Creek is four inches thick. It will be six by morning. Let us have a hot breakfast by five to-morrow morning, mother dear, and we'll fill the ice-house before night. Whoop, Hurrah! we'll save your butter yet"</p>
                        <p>"Alas, for the cream!" said the happy mother with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
                        <p>The morning of the sixth opened on one of the most fearful of Winter days,--"It blewed, it snewed and whewed;"--the fierce wind, that pierced like a knife, whirled the snow from house-tops and trees, and filled the air with frozen points that cut like knives. It was fearfully cold.</p>
                        <p>But we were all up betimes. Steaming coffee, hot cakes and juicy steaks told of the mother's loving care for those who had shed their on the plains of Shiloh and Antietam, and grown all the more dear to her through wounds and dangers survived.</p>
                        <p>"Better wait till to-morrow," said mother-love.</p>
                        <p>"Can't trust March weather for ice. Better wind and snow than thaw and rain."</p>
                        <p>"Wish I could help you," said I to Tom, as he sat by my side at breakfast.</p>
                        <p>"When you women get to voting," answered he, curtly, "you will have to help fill ice-houses."</p>
                        <p>"To be sure," said I.</p>
                        <p>"By George! I'm not going to wait on the girls, get in the ice, make the cream and foot all the bills, after you get the right of suffrage."</p>
                        <p>"Of course, my boy," I answered, cheerily--"Equal rights involve equal labors."</p>
                        <p>"Mother, where are my mittens," shouted he.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="135  Filling the Ice-house."/>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Here! I sat up 'till midnight getting all your traps ready. Putting broad-cloth patches on the fingers and thumbs to keep your hands from freezing."</p>
                        <p>"Are our coats all ready?"</p>
                        <p>"Every one; and your pants double-wadded at the knees. Be careful. Get home by eleven for dinner. I'll have all ready for you," and she watched them from the door until the wind filled her eyes with tears. "Poor fellows!" she sighed, as she turned to her work. "Now I must hurry. Milk the cows, (it will be a cold job); hunt the eggs to keep them from freezing, and catch and kill a chicken for the boys' dinner, (poor fellows, what a day they'll have of it) and they must have something nice and warm, or they'll think they are not rightly served. And Anne is gone too; she said she'd come to-day, but its too cold and terrible, unless she walks the whole twelve miles over the hills."</p>
                        <p>And so the good mother talked as she drew on her overshoes and tied up her ears preparatory to' braving the storm. "But I'll get through, never fear. I haven't been a farmer's wife forty years for nothing.</p>
                        <p>There were no daughters left in this household but the mother was a host in herself. The cows were milked, the eggs secured, the chicken killed and dressed, the dishes washed and the cream churned. Husband, who was confined with rheumatism, had his porridge and then had his back rubbed; while Ned, an elder son, and crippled at Antietam, was duly waited upon.</p>
                        <p>At half-past eleven the dinner smoked upon the table.

were ready for the ice-gatherers.</p>
                        <p>A complete change of garments-not a thumb-patch or extra heel-tap missing. The wet overcoats were dried and the frost-fringed neckties all in order before the nooning was over. Not a bite did we eat till all was done and they off in good order--hired men and all--to their work again. Nannie came at night-fall. She had tramped it over the icy hill twelve miles--"because she said she would."</p>
                        <p>The ice-house was full at five P.M. The third warm, wholesome meal eaten, and the boys (or men) fresh as from a game of base-ball, cracking their jokes over the chess-board before the parlor fire.</p>
                        <pb n="136  The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>But the  woman's work was not done. All the dishes were to be washed and preparations made for breakfast. Father's rheumatic back to be rubbed once more, and divers chores too numerous to mention would keep the mother trotting until nine or ten at night.</p>
                        <p>Tom again attacked me on the suffrage question, declaring that "if we voted we must fill ice houses, go to war, and drive oxen."</p>
                        <p>Ned, who was just now laid up with the pneumonia, looked up from his couch: "I tell you, Tom, they'll do it whenever you'll change work with them. But you'll have to sit up at night and patch the mittens, be up at 4 A.M. and get the breakfast, milk, hunt eggs, kill chickens, churn, make beds, sweep, build fires, rub lame backs, make porridge for rheumatics and broths for bad colds, pare apples, wash potatoes, get dinner, dry and fix all the clothes, make every one comfortable, and then get the supper and work till ten at night; while your lady dears are enjoying chess and apples. That will be fair, aunty, will it not?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, if, when Summer comes, he will agree to skim his own milk, make his own ice-cream, and wash his own dishes and floors while the girls enjoy it!"</p>
                        <p>"Please Ma'am," said Tom, with his finger in his mouth, "I will fill the ice-house--may I go to bed?"</p>

                        <p>ALL movements which combine the co-operative energies of many persons, and thus closely bind together the interests of the community, point to a new era of progress. The more varied the talents and functions of these joint workers, the better for the amount and breadth of their accomplishment. Doubtless socialism may have sought too eagerly for an air-line route to the desired goal, for nature approves of but few straight lines! Yet even the mistakes of the past are an earnest of good for the future! When we become nobler as individuals we shall find better modes of co-working for mutual assistance; for the best good of one is the best good of all. Woman must become a broader and more rational worker; more self-forgetfully remembering the well-being of the whole community; while man must equally learn that charity begins with the necessary, unending, small details of home and its inmates; so shall their several talents interweave far more beautiful and perfect results than those which their separate efforts have yet achieved. -<bibl>Studies. -Antoinette Brown Blackwell.</bibl>

                        <salute>
                           <hi rend="italic">To the Editor of the Woman's Advocate:</hi>
                        </salute>
                        <p>IN your August number I see a letter from Mrs. Gage in which she says:</p>
                        <p>"When the war first closed and it was said by Mr. Phillips and others this is 'the Negro's hour; let us settle this question of race before that of sex,'--I, with many, felt aggrieved, thinking that the two great questions could go on together if pressed with the same persistent energy."</p>
                        <p>I never made the assertion above attributed to me; I never said, let us settle this question of race before that of sex ;" I never denied that these two great questions could and should go on together; I never denied that they could and should be pressed with the same persistent energy.</p>
                        <p>I know it has been said, a hundred times, that I have done all these things; but said on a level where self-respect forbade me to notice it;--said by those who were perfectly well aware that the assertion was false, but who had no objection, on that account, to continue to circulate it.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Gage, however, is a woman of integrity and intelligence, and I have, three times at least, in her presence publicly stated my position as to the woman movement;--stated it with such elaborate distinctness that friends present begged me never again to waste time in the explanation, assuring me that all who were willing to understand me, must have done so. Such a misstatement, after all that, by a woman of Mrs. Gage's fairness and ability does indeed surprise me; maintaining, as I have done for thirty years, that woman's sharing in politics would elevate and purify them.</p>
                        <p>Unwilling that fair-minded persons should be misled by Mrs. Gage's mistake, I will once more state my relation to, and views of, the Woman Movement. When, thirty-two years ago, the Abolitionists welcomed women to their platform, I was one of that class of Abolitionists which claimed that woman's right to stand there grew out of her right to share equally with man In all civil affairs. When ten years later an organized
<pb n="138  The Woman's Advocate"/>
movement was started in her behalf, I gave it all the, help I could. it was, practically, in the hands of the Abolitionists. They carried it on, step by step, and side by side, with their other enterprise. No one of us ever postponed one cause to the other. When, and how, and how much respectively, we should aid either, was decided by common sense, having regard to the best economy of our means at the given moment. Mrs. Gage will remember our effort in the West in 1859 and 1860, when she was herself one of the Agents we employed there. When the war came, common sense showed us all that effort in this direction would be waste of means. At its close we resumed our agitation. It was with my cordial vote that our Committee expended, in 1866 and 1867, two thousand five hundred dollars to aid the agitation in New York and in Kansas; and at my suggestion we put another thousand dollars aside to be spent in Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>When the Fourteenth Amendment was pending I protested, both in public addresses and before our Legislative Committee, against bringing the word "<hi rend="italic">male</hi>" into the Constitution. When, early in 1867, a leading member of Congress applied to me for such form of Constitutional Amendment as would satisfy me, I sent him one which recognized woman's right to vote, and informed him I should never rest until this right was secured to her. Up to the present hour I have never refused pecuniary assistance or my aid on the platform. I have done my share before Legislative Committees, and attended meetings as frequently as I ever did. I spoke at the Conventions held in New York city as long as the managers of the cause there deserved the confidence of its friends. I never intermitted contribution or effort, and never advised any one else to do so. I never postponed woman's claim to that of any one else, and never advised any person to do so. I never counseled the giving up, or the slackening of the agitation in behalf of woman's right to vote. What others are now doing, I am doing, so far as I get opportunity. I give, speak and print. The only instance in which I have differed with any of my comrades in the Women's Rights Movement is this: In 1866 and again in 1867 it was proposed to have the American Anti-Slavery Society adopt the Women's Rights Movement as a part of its object,--to unite the two questions. This union I opposed; and <hi rend="italic">this is the only point upon</hi>
                           <pb n=" 139  Woman's Rights."/>
                           <hi rend="italic">which I have ever differed with the single-hearted friends of the movement.</hi> In all their other measures I sympathise with, and aid them.</p>
                        <p>I opposed the union of the two questions in one society mainly on this account,--because they were not equally ripe. I saw no reason for changing the policy which the friends of the two movements had followed during all the previous years. We never united them, because we saw that they were essentially distinct, and also that one of them was more advanced than the other. Although the woman question had gained marvellously from 1850 to 1865, it was still far behind the Anti-Slavery movement, even in 1865; as subsequent events have shown. The public was more ready for one than for the other. Thirty or forty years of agitation, followed by five years of war, had made the Nation fully ready to grant all the negro needed and asked. It was not ready to concede woman's rights. I said that to unite two questions of such different ripeness would be like making a wagon with wheels of different size. To unite them would be like expecting Grant, when in command of the Department of Virginia, to threaten Richmond and Vicksburg at the same time. They should be separate Divisions of the same great Army, both engaged in the same general assault; different waves of the same sea--"Distinct like the billows, one like the sea." "The two great questions can go on together," although not joined as the common objects of one Association or Society. Men and women may walk together on the same road without being married.</p>
                        <p>Union would hurt one cause, more than it could help the other. Indeed such union is impossible. The attempt, by the very parties I have mentioned, to form one, has failed.</p>
                        <p>This difference in the ripeness of the two questions was no work of ours. It came in the providence of God. It grew out of events. I did not create it or rejoice in it. I only recognized it and planned my action accordingly.</p>
                        <p>It was in this sense and in this connection that I made the claim, this is the negro's hour"--meaning, as my argument and context showed, that this is the hour of his success; the hour whose ripeness, makes it wise and economical to labor specially for him ; but not an hour in which we could ever be justified in laboring <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi> for him or in smothering any other just cause in order to help him to an unfair advan-

tage. When we mow our grass in July, and dig our potatoes in September, but put off gathering Baldwin apples till October, it is economy and good sense--but no injustice to the Apples. July is the "Grass's Hour;' October is the "Apple's Hour."</p>
                        <p>I never gave up working for woman, or omitted any one possible effort in her behalf on this account; or to help the negro at her expense. Indeed Mr. Powell and myself have given to the Women Rights question, during the last three years, nearly double the space in THE STANDARD that was ever devoted to it there before. I have never said that the Negro's cause could claim that the Woman's should be set aside, for one single-instant, to give him a better chance: that any hand should be tied, or any lips, gagged, on her platform, in order to secure him a speedier success. On the other hand the Woman's Movement has no right to steal any strength from the negro's success; no right to ask that his full recognition be delayed to help her, or until her rights are granted.</p>
                        <p>I only counseled to let the two movements stand separate, each on its own foundation. This is good policy on the whole. This is exact justice to each. Whoever complains of it is more of a Woman's Rights man than an Abolitionist; is a partisan and not a philanthropist; his zeal has eaten up his discretion and his sense of justice.</p>

                        <p>As the details of the internal arrangements of Mr. A. T. Stewart's hotel for working-women become more fully known to the public they seem to promise with great certainty to each occupant the comfort and convenience of a hotel at an exceedingly small cost. Even the eighth story will not seem formidable, as elevators will run on each side of the staircase from the first to the upper story. The sleeping-rooms are to be lofty and well-ventilated. There will be two kinds-the larger ones sixteen by eighteen feet in space, and intended for two sisters or two friends rooming together; the smaller ones, eight feet by nine, for one person only. The dining-room, thirty by ninety-two feet in dimensions, will be conducted on the restaurant plan, and food will be furnished at cost. Each person can therefore regulate her expenses according to her ability and inclination. For the hundreds of working-women who desire such a home this will be found superior to any at present established, and the scheme reflects great credit on the kindly heart of our millionaire merchant, who is rapidly earning the title of a public benefactor.</p>

                           <p>OUR readers will rejoice to learn that the movement for a National Organization is making satisfactory progress, and that a Call for a Delegate Convention may be expected at an early date. The Committee of the New England Woman's Suffrage Association, appointed by that body to correspond with the friends of the Cause throughout the country relative to such a measure, have received, we understand, many favorable responses to their inquiries and earnest requests that the preliminary steps for a National Organization be at once taken.</p>
                           <p>That what we have so earnestly advocated is about to be realized is especially gratifying. Believing it vital to the welfare of the Cause, we trust that nothing will be permitted to delay the consummation of a work fraught with the hopes of thousands of the earnest advocates of Woman Suffrage. Let no hand be stayed. It cannot come too soon. With a truly representative National Organization; with a policy wooing to its ranks every lover of humanity; with co-operative local associations, it cannot be doubted that the way to victory will be easy, or its full fruition long delayed.</p>

                           <p>THE West is ablaze with Conventions. Calls are issued for State Conventions in Illinois, Ohio, Missouri and Indiana. The Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri, which leads in point of time, holds its Convention in St. Louis on the 6th and 7th instant; Illinois follows on the 9th and 10th ; Ohio on the 15th and 16th ; while the date of the Indiana

Convention at our latest advices was not definitely fixed, but presumed would occur within the month.</p>
                           <p>Concerned in all these movements are earnest, indefatigable workers, and the masses of the liberal West never fail to make a generous response to the demands upon their time and means, insuring to each fresh effort for the advancement of the Cause a gratifying success. The Call for the Ohio Convention is signed by scores of the influential, well-known citizens, men, and women of that State; the St. Louis gathering will be a rally of the generous-hearted sons and daughters of Missouri; while that of Chicago will doubtless be one of the largest and most enthusiastic assemblages yet convened in the West for the consideration of the subject.</p>
                           <p>To each of these Councils of the People THE ADVOCATE extends its kindliest wishes for a season of pleasant and profitable discussion, while for the <hi rend="italic">Agitator</hi> and other Western journals so powerfully contributing to the welfare of the Cause, it would desire thrice the share of well-merited prosperity which they are enjoying.</p>

                           <p>To even the most superficial observer the "Woman Question," at this moment, must appear in the full tide of success. Not only are journals specially devoted to its discussion increasing all throughout the country--not only, at home and abroad, are Conventions of the most gratifying character held with a frequency never before known, but a class of individuals and journals, that hitherto have held studiously aloof, are now coming forward and powerfully contributing to a better understanding and appreciation of the Question. As a proof of this we might cite the able contributions of Mrs. JULIA WARD HOWE to <hi rend="italic">The Galaxy</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly;</hi> those of FRANCES POWER COBBE to <hi rend="italic">Putnam's Magazine;</hi> Mrs. ISABELLA B. HOOKER's articles to the same monthly, and more recently to the <hi rend="italic">Nation;</hi> the scholarly editorials of GEORGE W. CURTIS in the <hi rend="italic">Harper</hi> Publications; the various papers in <hi rend="italic">Packard's;</hi> and other contributions, from writers more or less distinguished, to our leading journals.</p>
                           <p>But the most valuable support, perhaps, yet lent the Movement is found in a series of leading articles in the <hi rend="italic">Hearth and Home</hi>, from the

potent pen of Mrs. HARRIET BEECHER STOWE, for which we could wish a yet wider circulation than they will achieve even through the medium of that valuable journal. In the last of these papers in the issue of August 28th, entitled "What Is and What Is Not the Point in the Woman Question," Mrs. STOWE makes a lucid presention of the Movement; recapitulates its progress at home and abroad, and strips the Question of all verbiage by thus briefly stating it:</p>
                           <p>"The practical question now before the American public is this: Have Women the same right to suffrage that men have? In discussing this question, the only logical way is to determine what are the qualifications that give men, a right to exercise suffrage, and to show that women have or have not those qualifications."</p>
                           <p>Further on, after showing the inapplicability of Dr. Bushnell's vital point, "nobody has a right to vote," Mrs. STOWE says:</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>"'<hi rend="italic">Governments owe their just power to the consent of the governed.</hi>' <lb/>
"'<hi rend="italic">Taxation without representation is tyranny.</hi>'
"We do not propose to raise the question whether they were right or wrong in these axioms of government: the simple question is, whether these axioms do not logically lead to Woman's Suffrage?"</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>Still farther, in commenting upon the taxes paid by women, Mrs. STOWE remarks:</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>"Now the question arises, Which is in fault, the Declaration of Independence or the customs and laws of America as to women? Is taxation without representation tyranny or not?"</p>
                           </q>
                           <p>In order further to illustrate her position that the course of women upon this subject has been a strict logical sequence from the fundamental doctrines of our Government, Mrs. STOWE quotes from the Resolutions adopted by the first Woman's Rights Convention held at Worcester in the year 1851, and concludes by saying:</p>
                           <p>"We are curious to see a fair, dispassionate <hi rend="italic">argument</hi> on the other side, that shall meet this statement of the case. None such as we know of has been offered."</p>
                           <p>We rejoice at the appearance of these articles. We rejoice that the trenchant pen of Mrs. STOWE, which did so much to abolish one wrong, is to be employed to enlighten public opinion in regard to another glaring evil. The pleasure experienced by reading her temperately written article, all the more valuable therefor, is heightened by the knowledge

that the conductors of <hi rend="italic">Hearth and Home</hi> have made arrangements for the publication of a series of papers, from week to week, by the best writers on <hi rend="italic">both sides of the question</hi>, which will still deepen the hold of this excellent journal on public favor.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. STOWE has cleared the ground. Her woman gauntlet has been thrown down: let us see the knight hardy enough to pick it up, and measure swords with so powerful a champion of her sex!</p>

                        <p>Madame Dumergne, who recently took the degree of Bachelor of Medicine, has opened a <hi rend="italic">pharmacie</hi> in Montpelier, France. This is the first establishment of the kind in France opened under the direction of a lady.</p>
                        <p>The Vermont "Council of Censors" have recently reported in favor of so amending their State Constitution as to permit women to vote. Is the "star that never sets" to be the first, of all, to beam upon Woman Suffrage.</p>
                        <p>The heroism of Ida Lewis is by no means an exceptional case. One of the most recent instances of courage in "tender woman" is that of Miss Borie, daughter of the ex-Secretary, who lately rescued a young Baltimorian from drowning at Cape May. The young man had ventured beyond his depth, and was sinking when Miss Borie, being an expert swimmer, struck out for him, seized him by the hair and drew him to the shore.</p>
                        <p>Lydia Maria Child, in a pleasant paper Concerning Women, in a late Issue of <hi rend="italic">The Independent</hi>, says, "When I was a young girl the aged Hannah Adams was pointed out as a great curiosity, because she had written a short History of the Jews.

only to be unconscious of a hole In her stocking, but to be absolutely unable to recognize her own face in the glass; and if that was not being unfeminine, pray tell me what could be? When I published, my first book, I was gravely warned by some of my female acquaintances that no woman could expect to be regarded as a lady after she had written a book."</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Home Journal</hi>, in speaking of women physicians abroad, says: "Doctress Garrett, of London, is described as fragile and youthful-looking. Her talk is easy, chatty, bright, animated--no disquisitions, n o ponderosity, no obtrusion of heavy theories and abstract views of life. If one were to look out for a contrast to the typical strong-minded woman, he could hardly find it anywhere better illustrated than in this bright, animated little creature, with her pretty face and graceful, winning ways. Yet this is the terrible, resistless woman who has actually fought her way into the medical profession, in defiance of the bitterest opposition of the most prejudiced and immovable of all the learned 'bodies.' I believe Miss Garrett stands absolutely alone in England--the one only female member of the medical profession."</p>
                        <p>Among the most pleasant and effective writers upon reformatory questions may be ranked Mrs. Mary F. Davis, the wife of the well-known writer, Andrew Jackson Davis, a name synonymous with spiritual reform and progress. Mrs. Davis has recently contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Banner of Light</hi>, of which journal she is corresponding editor, a series of papers entitled "Education for Girls," from the conclusion of one of which articles we make the following, extract:</p>

                           <p>* * * Many and encouraging as are the signs of the times, public opinion has yet a deep gulf of prejudice to span before woman can take her appropriate place in the educational spheres. But never in the history of the world was there so great need of her thorough culture. Such advance has been made In intellectual pursuits since the date of the American Revolution, that this seems almost the fruit-bearing period, of the centuries, and woman must keep tally with the spirit of the age. Such, a lack of acquaintance with the rudiments of learning as is shown in a letter purporting to have been written by the venerated mother of Washington, would no longer be tolerated even among school-girls, to say nothing of "the first families of the land." Unconsciously the progressive minds of the age expect and demand a fine, high culture of the womanly nature. Opportunity should equal this demand. Interspersed through American society is a strata of noble girlhood and maturity. In

all those, contemptuous flings at the "girl of the period," "the modern women," etc., with which some of our current dailies abound, this class knows itself to be misrepresented and maligned. In it may be found the daughters of toil more frequently than of wealth; those who looking afar off to the advantages which ample means secure in schools like Antioch and Vassar, aspire with all their souls to such advantages. Supreme is their love of learning, and they would fain "rend the rock for secret fountains, and pursue the path of the illimitable wind for mysteries." Shall these noble girls be any longer compelled to give double the time and toil that their brothers do to earning the means necessary to reach their goal? Shall the injustice be continued of paying young women but half the wages of young men, for the same kind and amount of labor, thus making the task of clearing their own pathway to the temple of wisdom doubly long and arduous? Let justice be done to all, and we shall soon see the happy results in a higher type of womanhood and of civilization.</p>

<text id="wa2.330" n="Letter from George W. Smalley, Esq.">
                              <body>
                                 <p>"I went on Saturday to a meeting of the London National Society for Woman's Suffrage. Although a private meeting, to which admission could only be had by invitation, it was largely attended. It was, I believe, the first meeting, of the Society, and the managers were so far from desiring publicity that they excluded reporters. Nevertheless, a pretty full account of the proceedings appeared in one or two papers, and they have made a strong impression. If the meeting had shown nothing else, it showed a capacity for organization, which in English meetings is commonly remarkable for its absence. I don't know when I have known a meeting so well managed. There was a programme of resolutions and speeches, from which no departure was allowed, and the speeches were kept within due bounds. The credit of this is due to the lady who presided, and who is the executive officer of the association, Mrs. P. A. Taylor. You may search some time before you will find one of the nobler sex to go through the duties of a position both difficult and novel with so much dignity and grace. Next to the public championship of Mr. Mill, I think the woman's cause in England owes most to the wonderful energy of Mrs. Taylor. She has had many and very capable assistants, but has, I believe, been the real head of the society since its foundation. </p>
                                 <p>"There were about a dozen speakers, all of them celebrities. Mr. Mill's address was the great attraction to many, who have few opportunities of hearing him. I send you a report, on which you will, I dare say, have comments of your own to make, less favorable than mine. He was followed by Charles Kingsley, who has such a horror of being reported that he spoke only on condition that the press should not be represented. You will discover from the presence of a man holding Kingsley's peculiar position, and from the letters and speeches of the So-

Its rapid progress is due in no slight measure to the moderation and good sense shown by those who have had charge of it. They have limited it to a suffrage movement, and they have not allowed it to become ridiculous by the advocacy of mere mountebanks, nor made it odious by such selfish bigotry as some American champions are now showing in their opposition to the XVth Amendment on the ground of its failure to include woman."</p>

                           <p>The world-wide reputation won by Mrs. Stowe in her first great work of fiction would have been a greatness sufficiently oppressive to have precluded any mind less powerful from again essaying the path which led to such bewildering fame. But the laurel of being the most widely read and known of living fictionists has not been sufficient to satisfy a mind ever alive to the interests of humanity, and admirers of Mrs. Stowe's genius in two hemispheres have since had numerous opportunities of learning how keenly throbbed that heart, and how tireless was that pen that had written so much and so well.</p>
                           <p>The Crime of the Nation, which produced an "Uncle Tom's Cabin" or a "Dred," having been washed out in blood, Mrs. Stowe, in later fictions, has naturally turned to the delineations of those scenes and characters which her earliest published sketches give such evidence of being the nooks of fancy in which her thoughts most love to dwell. To her, New England is not only the Motherland, but the rich storehouse whose varied treasure she seeks with the love of a Whittier, a Lowell, or a Hawthorne. In this volume her object has been to interpret to the world the New England life and character of its formative period. Marked in early history by strong theological opinions, Mrs. Stowe has been faithful to her purpose in giving searching delineations of the Orthodoxy of that date. Puritanism stern and cold; gentler human nature; minds quaintly common sense, inquisitive, or groping in the night of unbelief, are all depicted; and so life-like are the delineations, in the illusion, the reader deems them the flesh and blood characters of every day life.</p>

                           <p>As a writer upon graver themes Mrs. Dall is well and favorably known to the public; and, in her newer field, the volume before us will go a great way towards winning for her as many warm admirers among young as older readers. Some writer has said that "a good book for children is the most difficult thing to create in literature," and we can easily credit the assertion, for, amid the multiplicity of story books, we can recall but few that we would unqualifiedly recommend to parents for their children.</p>
                           <p>But <hi rend="italic">Patty Gray's Journey</hi> is one of the few truly meritorious contributions to our juvenile literature. The entertaining and instructive are blent together in its pages in a manner that must endear it to every story-loving child, who at the same time possesses the natural desire for the acquisition of knowledge. This volume--the first of a series--takes Patty from her native Boston home to Baltimore, and the new sights and scenes of the journey are recorded with a fidelity to nature as well as with an artistic perception of the beautiful. Her visit is after the close of the late war, and Mrs. Dall renders good service to the cause of freedom by pointing out the cause of the desolation which is everywhere apparent, and laying stress upon the fact of the wrong done to the African race, which brought the terrible war upon the country.</p>
                           <p>It is issued in a neat and attractive style by the publishers, the picture of Patty Gray in the frontispiece, giving a pleasant introduction to this interesting little personage. We trust that the entire series may meet with the circulation which the merits of the initial volume assure us that they should attain.</p>

                        <head>THE NEWBURYPORT WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE CONVENTION.</head>
                        <p>THE Woman's Suffrage Association of Essex County, Mass., held a large and interesting Convention at Newburyport, July 28th. Among the well-known friends of the Movement present, by the most of Whom addresses were delivered, were Mrs. JULIA WARD HOWE, WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Rev. PHEBE A. HANAFORD, OLYMPIA BROWN, Rev. GEORGE H. VIBBERT, Mrs. WILLIAM IVES and Rev. B. F. BOWLES. Letters were received from RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Prof. ALPHEUS CROSBY, and others. The Convention was continued, by morning, afternoon and evening sessions, throughout the day, with a deepening of interest and
<pb n="150 The Woman's Advocate."/>
increasing attendance until the close. A series Of Resolutions, excellent and comprehensive in character, were offered by WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, and unanimously adopted. From the very able address of JULIA WARD HOWE, in the afternoon session, we make the following extract:
<text id="wa2.332" n="Address of Julia Ward Howe">
                              <body>
                                 <head>ADDRESS OF JULIA WARD HOWE.</head>
                                 <p>* * * And this brings me to one of the most common and most polite arguments advanced now-a-days against our measure, viz., that womankind at large do not desire the suffrage. The immorality of this argument is obvious to me; perhaps I can make it so to others. Do mankind at large desire the best things? Do all the children cry for the slate and spelling book? Does the youth demand to be made acquainted with the higher mathematics, and the doctrine of pure reason? Does the little girl, as soon as she can speak, inquire concerning the shape of the earth, the doctrine of eclipses, the records of the Assyrian Empire, etc., etc.? . Yet you feel it a disgrace, a dereliction, to withhold these things from those who are ignorant not only of their value but of their existence.</p>
                                 <p>Let us suppose that one of you has a ward, born heir to possessions of which he can, of himself, have no knowledge. You who hold him in tutelage are careful not to impart to him this knowledge. He grows up the servant of your pleasure, or the pensioner of your bounty, never dreaming of that which belongs to him in his own right. A third party steps in and says, "You are withholding, your ward's birthright. Why do you not give it to him?" You reply, "He has never asked for it." The next question certainly would be, "Did you ever tell him of it?"</p>
                                 <p>Man on this wise has naturally held woman in tutelage--man, naturally the inventor of politics, from his greater freedom from the burdensome conditions of nature, his earlier and wider enjoyment of the advantages of education. The opposition of sex suggested to him the political opposition of activity and passivity, control and submission. He has exerted all his predominance and force of authority to continue the mind and habit of the sex in this direction. The friends of woman now say "You are keeping women out of their estate. They are born as free as you are, as capable of the individuality of thought, and the directness of moral inspiration. But you have made them secondary and derivative. You limit their education, prescribe their work, keep down their wages, control their persons and  their offsprings and spend their money.  Why don't you give them what nature gives to both of you alike, and what superior culture and opportunity enable you to keep for yourselves?" And man replies, "She don't want it." But the further question is, "Have you ever told her of it?" "Not such a fool as that," says the man.</p>
                                 <p>But now earnest men and women are telling of this to the less thoughtful and instructed. They show woman a new ideal, erect, free-souled, free-handed. "This is what you would be," say they. Half of your rights, all of your political estate is kept from you; only so much is doled out to you as will enable you to appear in a conceded equality with men. On an actual equality they have never
<pb n="151 Home Intelligence."/>
allowed you to stand. And I would have the world take note, awakened by admiration and encouraged by the earnest sympathy of true souls, womankind are asking for their own. * * * * * * *</p>

                        <p>Rev. PHEBE A. HANNAFORD, at the conclusion of her eloquent and deeply impressive address, spoke as follows:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>* * * It is too late to sneer at the Woman's Rights Movement; it has risen to be acknowledged as the foremost reform of the age, second to none, not even to the great temperance reform, and it is advocated by master minds on both sides the Atlantic. John Stuart Mill lends the weight of his logic, and Henry Ward Beecher and Wendell Phillips the might of their eloquence. Mrs. Dall, with her store of knowledge; Mrs. Howe, with her poetic genius; Mrs. Livermore, with her womanly eloquence; Lucy Stone, with her unanswerable arguments; Lucretia Mott, with her wisdom and dignity of four-score years, and in the beauty of her green old age; Anna Dickinson with her words of power; Olympia Brown, with her life-long enthusiasm and her patient industry and triumphant success; Antoinette Brown Blackwell, with her scholarly pleadings; Madame Anneke with her German, and Madame D'Hericourt with her French experiences and eloquence; all these, and more also, men and women of moral worth and intellectual power, are enlisted in this good cause, and are carrying it on to a final and glorious success. * * * * * * * *</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>Forcible addresses, at various stages of the Convention, were also delivered by WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, Rev. OLYMPIA, BROWN, Rev. GEORGE H. VIBBERT, Mrs. E. F. BOWLES, Judge AMES, Rev. B. F. BOWLES, Rev. Mr. WRIGHT and others; and the evening session was prolonged until a late hour in the desire of the audience to hear all the promised speakers.</p>
                        <p>Announcing the intention of the Association to hold a series of meetings throughout Essex County during the summer and fall, the Convention adjourned leaving an awakened interest in the community as the result of its labors.</p>

PART SECOND.</head>
                        <p>THERE was a buzz, a flutter of excitement in the composing room of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>. Two young men were lounging listlessly through the apartment, pausing occasionally to note some typographical improvement, or to bestow a second glance upon some more than ordinarily attractive face among the girl compositors. One was a junior editor of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, with whose appearance all were familiar; the other was its noted "special correspondent," whose flying visits to the metropolis and the editorial sanctum, were always an event out of the ordinary.</p>
                        <p>To the latter named of the two saunterers-George De L'Estrange nature had indeed been bounteous of the gifts which she occasionally showers upon mortals. Although yet scarcely three and twenty, by versatility of talent be had risen from obscurity and office boy drudgery, step by step, to the position of a favorite reporter upon a metropolitan journal, towering as a Saul above his fellows, and receiving from all the <hi rend="italic">attaches</hi> of the office scarcely less consideration than the editor-in-chief himself Beginning with local reporting, George De L'Estrange had early exhibited such a marvelous talent for investing trite or unimportant subjects with interest, that he was soon detailed by his superiors for distant and more valuable services, all of which were so satisfactorily discharged that he was formally transferred to the "Foreign and Secret
<pb n="156 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Service Repertorial Staff," charged with all delicate, or important missions, and drawing a salary, whether at home or abroad, that would have been deemed fabulous in an earlier day of journalism. A roving adventurous life led De L'Estrange. Constantly "on the wing," in the five or more years preceding the date of our story, he had wandered over half of the habitable globe, familiarizing himself with languages, climes, and the ways of men, and acquiring a knowledge and experience of humanity rarely attained even by the veterans of his profession. Wherever--whether in his own country, where he first won his spurs of correspondent on the embattled fields of the South, or in remoter lands--the magnitude of transpiring events drew public thought and the hearts of men as to a common center, <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> sent its correspondent, and not more familiar to De L'Estrange were the waters of the Hudson or the Potomac than of the more distant Rhone, from one of whose valleys emigrated the sire whose flashing black eyes and swarthy hue of skin he inherited.</p>
                        <p>And while fortune, was thus favoring De L'Estrange--while he was thus climbing the giddy rounds of popularity, how was it with his inner nature? The life he led, sharpening every faculty, bringing into keenest activity every gift of intellect, was not adapted to foster conscientious conviction, and little pretension made he to the virtues of Iconoclast or Religionist. Yet not depraved, or grossly sensual, was George De L'Estrange. He was ambitious--intensely so. He had a pride in his profession. To be first in the field, to outstrip his fellows in the pursuit of "specials" or freshest intelligence, was the one glory for which no toil or bodily risk was counted too great a sacrifice by De L'Estrange, or any scruple of sensitiveness, not actually conflicting with professional honor, allowed to prevent. More dear to him were the tidings of an enemy's movements, though won from beneath the cannon's mouth, than any honor or pleasure the world could offer beside; and though not all exempt from the vices, or follies of his class, George De L'Estrange had less to reproach himself with than many so flattered by man and woman. Indeed, any element of baseness was foreign to his nature, and when, in hours of ease, perchance he had turned aside to sun himself in the smiles of woman, it was with no intention beyond the light gratification of the moment. Veneration for her he certainly had not: of such a thing as
<pb n="157 Thrown Upon the World."/>
inherent virtue he was even skeptical. His mother had died while he lay a babe in the cradle, and tossed about the world as he had been, it had been his misfortune to meet principally with that large class of women who had deepened the loose impressions which he entertained of the lightness or infidelity of the sex.</p>
                        <p>"Tell me, Everson," he said to his companion as they strolled more than once through the aisles of the busy work-room, "tell me where is the paragon of whom such glowing accounts reached me even at Florence. I have peered, closely as my fastidious sense of politeness would permit, beneath each wavy or ringletted brow, without seeing sparkle of orb or dimple of cheek I could for a moment, even with the aid of a powerfully excited fancy, imagine to belong to your favorite. With the exception ot that shy, rose-bud of a little girl there in the corner, they are as ordinary a set of mortals as I have beheld in a long while. Has the goddess strayed from her earth-born subjects, and if so, have you a courtier's art to secure us an admittance to her retreat?"</p>
                        <p>"I presume she is in Mr. Jobson's room, reading proof with him," was the rejoinder, "but whether you or I can obtain admittance is beyond my powers of divination. It is a busy hour of the day, and Mr. Jobson's little snuggery is his castle, inaccessible when he pleases even to our chief. If I remember, however, you are something of a favorite with him, and it may be the sight of your travel-bronzed face will be the '<hi rend="italic">sesame</hi>' of admittance. At least we will make the assay."</p>
                        <p>"Oh, yes; Mr. Jobson and I are old friends. He was kind to me years ago when I used to bring in my first reports of a 'Destructive Fire in Division Street,' or 'Pugilistic Encounter in Tompkins Alley,' prophesying I would one day be the Great Mogul of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>. The dear old-gentleman will never refuse <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and now I think of it I am really anxious to see him. Lead, your highness, and your most dutiful will follow."</p>
                        <p>Laughingly the two young men turned their steps to the door of a little room in the extreme rear of the larger apartment where, after going through with the required formalities at the portal, they were admitted, the, kindly-hearted old man almost overwhelming his boy <hi rend="italic">protege</hi> with welcomes and questionings when he realized that he indeed stood in flesh before him. "Why, my dear Georgie, how well you are looking!
<pb n="158 The Woman's Advocate."/>
And you have been at Gibraltar, at Constantinople, Moscow, Pekin, Burampooter and all those barbarous and unpronounceable places since I saw you last! Do you know, my dear fellow, that I never would allow one of your letters to go into the 'form' I until I had put on my glasses and seen that our thick-headed compositors had made all the final corrections properly, so that when <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> reached you in some of those outlandish seaports you would not feel like blowing us all up for the errors you would see. Ah, a pretty time Miss Eveleth and I have had of it. Our hands have been kept busy I can assure you. But bless me, here I have been talking all this time and not made an introduction yet. Can you excuse me for such negligence. Miss Eveleth this is Georgie--Georgie De L'Estrange--of whom I have spoken about to you so much. Miss Eveleth, you and Mr. Everson, I believe, are already acquainted."</p>
                        <p>Marian Eveleth, who had remained standing during this animated monologue, with a half smile upon her face at the old man's volubility, honored Mr. De L'Estrange with, as Lizzie Fay was wont to express it, one of her stateliest courtesies, while she extended her hand to Mr. Everson with a pleased look and a frank word of welcome. Much had she heard of George De L'Estrange-his beauty, his powers of fascination; and though she had been interested in his correspondence, touched, even, at times by the lightly-told hair-breadth adventures or the poetical imagery of his descriptions, her knowledge of the character of the writer had prevented her from overcoming the aversion with which she had early been inspired. So, shrinking from direct intercourse with him, she skillfully turned the conversation into a channel from which he was of necessity excluded, and managed, during the remainder of their brief stay, to avoid exchanging more than a few commonplace remarks, for which coolness she was taken to task, immediately after their departure, by Mr. Jobson, who resented almost as a personal indignity such treatment of his favorite. He was a good boy, he remonstrated in reply to Marian's briefly-stated reason for desiring no intimacy, they might say what they pleased, but no living being could stand up and show that they had been illy used by Georgie De L'Estrange. He had a winsome face, and he had, may be, indulged in a few follies, as other young men,
<pb n="159 Thrown Upon the World."/>
but there was no more gallant nature, that he knew, and a few years would show what a position in the world he would attain.</p>
                        <p>Days passed. There was a lull in the outer world, and, longer than an opportunity had been afforded for years, George De L'Estrange lingered around the office of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>. More deeply interested than he had ever been in the pursuit of a secondary object--though he could not himself account for the attraction--was the man of the world in winning the ear and interest of Marian Eveleth; and the continuance of the icy barrier of reserve, which he had been accustomed  to seeing dissolve when he chose to exert his powers of fascination, only stimulated the ardor of the pursuit. That she was of a higher mold than the many who had crossed his path he could readily perceive, and that, to create even a favorable impression upon the fair compositor, all the latent powers of his nature must be aroused and called into fullest activity. And well he played his part. Perchance not even in fashionable circles, the gay, wild assemblages of Washington or other Capitals, to please some fastidious dame or belle accustomed to homage, had he more exerted himself than now to win a kindly place in the thoughts of Marian Eveleth. There was something in the atmosphere of purity that surrounded her--something in her lofty purpose, her clearness of moral perception, that, as he had opportunities for studying her character, appealed powerfully to every prompting of his better nature; in her presence the <hi rend="italic">blas&#x00E9;</hi> man of the world experienced a novel sensation of pleasure, accompanied by a feeling that there was a higher life in which she lived and moved, from which, by grossness and violated laws of nature, he was excluded. Yet brief and few were the occasions afforded him for the interchange of more than the ordinary civilities, or the removing of the barriers of frigid reserve, which it was evident she meant should exist between them. Occasionally he would stroll into the little room where Marian sat so much of her time with Mr. Jobson, by whom at least he was always sure of a hearty welcome; and once or twice, before she could furnish a reasonable pretext for withdrawing or would herself be aware of the interest, she would become an animated listener to some one of his glowing descriptions of some clime or spot she herself had trodden in fancy, and be chatting with a freedom concerning these and

other subjects that would cause the hot blood to rush to her cheeks afterwards at the recollection. </p>
                        <p>So passed time. It was nearing the holiday season. Well nigh a month now had, George De L'Estrange led the life of inaction we have described, and though during that period of idlesse he had had but the one purpose, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> to subdue the icy indifference of Marian Eveleth, he could not flatter himself that he had even secured, the least of what he so ardently coveted, a place in her respect. "Why do I not tear from my breast this passion," he soliloquized as he strode up and down the outer room of the sanctum in the early gathering gray of the winter evening,--"It is unmanly of me thus to remain, wasting my powers, and sighing for a girl to whom I am as nothing. A word from me, and the mission to Berlin awaits me. I will mingle again with men: I will summon back the old dreams of preferment that once were sufficient to satisfy my nature. I will rise above this weakness: cast out from my breast the image of one who so wrongs my motives, who does not credit me even with a good intention, cost what it may the effort."</p>
                        <p>Filled with this resolution, on the following morning he sought an audience with the Editor-in-chief, the result of which was that ere nightfall it was known to every employ&#x00E9; of the establishment that George De L'Estrange would be off by the next steamer for the Continent, to be absent months, and, possibly, years again.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Georgie," said the old proof-reader, as later in the day, with a moody brow, that young man indulged in a leave-making tour of the building, "so you are going to leave us again. It grieves me to think of it, my boy, but take courage. I know what is on your heart, and I could whisper, that haughty as Miss Marian is, and indifferent as she assumes to be, you are not alone in your trouble. I have watched her closely since the news was first brought to us of your intended departure, and she has not succeeded in blinding me as to her real interest in you for an instant. Why, just now she made a mistake as unlike her usual methodical ways as you could imagine, and when I questioned her as to the cause--for I was determined to quiz her a little, in your interest, Georgie--she attributed it to a nervous headache, but she seemed well enough until Mr. Everson came up and told us of your intended departure. There she is now, superintending that awkward squad of learners,
<pb n="161 Thrown Upon the World."/>
and you can see that her face wears a constrained look, very different from its ordinary expression. Go over to her, boy, with a stout heart, and make your adieu. She may say but little, but I warrant you that a God-speed will go with you over the Atlantic, and that, hereafter, a pair of bright eyes will look for 'specials' and 'foreign correspondence' as they have never before."</p>
                        <p>The young man crossed the room to where Marian stood by a window, through which the Western sun streamed full upon her, turning to gold her hair, and, in the ardent imagination of De L'Estrange, causing her to resemble one of the Madonnas before which he had hung so oft enraptured in some Italian or Peninsula gallery. Intent upon her work, the explaining of some doubtful "copy" to a pupil, she failed to notice his approach until that delicate perception of contiguity, which precedes even actual vision, caused her to lift her eyes to find him standing closely by her side.</p>
                        <p>"Miss Eveleth," and there was an affection of gayety in his tone to which his heart at the moment illy responded, "have you heard the good news which will relieve the industrious bees of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> of at least one drone in the hive? I have at last my orders. Can you believe that one an idler so long can brush the dust of inaction from his wings and easily resume habits of industry? I need not ask if I may bear with me your good wishes, for the relief you will all experience at my departure would insure that, methinks, even from one who holds me in as light esteem as Miss Eveleth."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, Mr. De L'Estrange," and there was more of feeling in the tone than he had before noted, "I have heard of your departure, and can, truly wish you '<hi rend="italic">bon voyage.</hi>' With your acquirements and your capabilities you should not be idle; you were meant to play no useless part among men, and doubt not that we shall always be glad to hear of your movements, and to know that you are achieving that measure of success to which you may so well aspire. Within yourself lies largely the power to determine your future career, whether it shall be ignoble, or far surpass the past. Can I doubt that you will decide wisely?"</p>
                        <p>Thus speaking Marian frankly extended her hand, which De L'Estrange pressed fervently for a moment, uttered the simple words, "<hi rend="italic">vertraue auf mich,</hi>" (trust in me) and left the apartment.</p>

                        <p>So sang a school-girl poetess, and day by day its beautiful truth comes with renewed earnestness to our hearts. The Past, with its glowing deeds and heroic lives, needs no touch of pen or brush to render it more attractive. The Future, towards which we turn with eager, hopeful faces, and which looks all fair and bright is yet uncertain. The path which seems strewn with flowers, may prove a thorny one; but the Present, the noble, active, living Present is ours. Do we mistake when we make the assertion, that none other since time began has been its equal? And if so, how important that the present actors on the world's "great stage," should have their zeal quickened, and souls inspired with great and noble purposes. And let not those purposes be merely pleasing fancies, to be indulged as a kind of offset to inefficient doing. Shall we not arouse again to action--action as vigorous and determined, as when our Nation lay bleeding and struggling for existence? As during the war, our sisterhood formed the important and devoted "left wing" of the Grand Army of the Republic, so now, in the great battles for justice and equal rights, which have but fairly begun, duty calls on <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, as well as man, to arise and prepare for the conflict. </p>
                        <p>Let those scout who will, and proclaim a speedy extinction of the progressive ideas which are daily being pressed upon the minds of the people; many of them shall yet live to see the objects of their contempt making a triumphant march throughout the civilized world. Aye, may we not predict that when our land shall have completed the century of her independence, she shall proclaim, not merely by word but by <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>, her belief in the truth of her corner-stone maxim "That taxation without representation is tyranny." Womanhood suffrage has everywhere been defeated, but, "though fallen it shall rise again," and press on to the victory. The proof of its propriety and right has been given by far abler pens than ours, and needs no repetition here, though we would fain urge its further consideration by the candid, and the necessity of woman's faithful co-operation in order to insure speedy success. We
<pb n="163 Work for Woman."/>
have no reason to be discouraged by the action of various legislative bodies in regard to the subject during the past year. Ten years ago, or even five, the idea that such a subject would receive the consideration of those bodies, would have been scouted as a wilder fancy than the expectation of a sudden removal from slavery. Antoinette Brown Blackwell was received with hisses even by <hi rend="italic">professed</hi> ministers of the Most High, but a few years ago. Now, no lecturer in the country secures larger audiences than Anna E. Dickinson. Such being the state of affairs, there are none among our great sisterhood, who are unable to do something for the farther promotion of these ideas which sooner or later are sure to prevail.</p>
                        <p>We would suggest a few of the ways in which this should be done. First, let every young woman in the land resolve to educate herself not merely by attending a convenient school or academy for a longer or a shorter time, but by profitable reading and attention to the workings of the great country of which she is a citizen. No young lady should neglect the perusal of <hi rend="italic">at least</hi>, one standard newspaper a week. Again, let her not be content with completing the course of study pursued in most Academies and Seminaries, and which is usually deemed sufficient for a woman; but let her aim be, if it is possible, to secure for herself the course marked out in the great colleges of the land. Some of these colleges in the great progressive West, open their doors to ladies as well as gentlemen; but even <hi rend="italic">these</hi> present a course of study for ladies, which omits the Greek and Latin languages; and being shorter and easier, is generally pursued instead of the thorough college course. Thanks to these noble Institutions for thus enabling woman to educate herself, but we would pray them to go still farther and banish these departments for ladies from their catalogues. By so doing, they will cause young women to see and feel that their standard of education should not be one jot lower than that of their brothers. "But women have not the time or strength," repeat the objectors to their elevation. No time say you? Indeed! but they seem to find plenty of time in which to embroider and dress, make calls, attend parties, etc.</p>
                        <p>"But they are physically incapacitated for anything so severe as a thorough Collegiate course," remarks some pompous divine or small lawyer. My dear sirs, consider the rounds of gayety into which so many
<pb n="164 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of the feebler sex plunge. See them dance night after night, oftentimes to the decided exhaustion of their sterner partners. Look at most of our farmer's wives; how they toil early and late; to be sure they are often so over-worked as to fade and die quite early in life, but let their husbands try the same round of unceasing toil, and, if we mistake not, the, result would be the same. Granted that she is weaker than her brother, yet her powers of endurance carry woman through more difficult paths in life than the securing of a complete education. So long as her education is generally so incomplete, thus long will she remain the gay butterfly or unthinking drudge. Ladies of wealth, who are giving of their abundance to endow colleges for the exclusive education of young men, are committing a great wrong against their own sex. Such colleges are already well endowed and too numerous. The minds of all true philanthropists should be turned towards those which offer equal advantages to young women.</p>
                        <p>Again, the sneering remarks upon the deficiencies of most Ladies' Seminaries or so-called Colleges, made by the opposers of a more thorough education of woman, are far too often founded upon facts. How many Ladies' Colleges are there, which offer to young women a course similar to that of Yale, Williams or Oberlin, and at their graduation grant them the A. B. degree? We must confess that if there are such institutions in the land, they are entirely unknown to us. Yet this is the standard which all Ladies' Colleges should maintain. The idea that women cannot, need not, or should not study the Greek and Latin languages, is one that should be exploded at once. Being in part the foundation of our own language, it seems far more important that they should be studied, than even the higher mathematics which most Ladies' Departments include. All young men do not go through College, neither do we expect all young women to obtain a liberal education; our purpose is to urge those who can be educated if they will, not to stop outside of genuine College walls. Sometime ago we read an article entitled "Room up Higher," which very justly argued that one reason why ladies received such small compensation as teachers was because of their all crowding Into the common order of schools, being incompetent to teach those of a higher grade. Yet even when she is thus fitted, woman is unjustly deprived of her real earnings. We have a lady ac-

quaintance in the East, who is said by good judges to be perfectly competent for a college professor. Yet in the same school she received more than a third less than a young man who has since entered college as a student.</p>
                        <p>When, it is asked, will women receive their rightful dues? Not until as a united body they insist that the ballot shall be placed in their hands, and declare that they will no longer teach or do any other work for the paltry sums now doled out to them. Oh, the thousands who feel every day how relentless is the custom which thus cheats and crushes them! And are any to be found in their ranks who will not work long and earnestly to remove such customs? If so, how abject the soul which would thus clasp hands with its oppressor, instead of striving mightily for its destruction.</p>
                        <p>Aye, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> work for woman to do, and far greater than in previous years. She must combat with prejudice, that hydra headed monster, and show by her own life, the capabilities and determination of her sex. Again, she must instil the principles of right and progress into the minds of the youth of the land. The foggyism of the present controllers of our nation's affairs, may not disappear except with their death; but most assuredly when those yet in early life command the field of action, there will be changes made which would have horrified our revered grandmothers. The strong, clear voice of Anna E. Dickinson, is sounding through the land like a trumpet before the morn of battle. May the Lord ever bless and protect her as one of the noblest and most efficient champions for the right. Few may expect to fill her position, but each one can and should do service for such a cause. It does not require the bravery to make known to-day one's adherence to this cause, that it did even two or three years ago. Now a young lady will not of a certainty be called strong-minded, masculine and the like; hence the greater culpability of those who, from carelessness, ignorance or prejudice, refuse to assist in the speeding on of the Right.</p>
                        <p>Women of America! Mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, are ye aroused to the needs of the hour? We fear not, and would beseech you in behalf of your weary, long suffering sisters, who need the ballot as their protector, to give the subject candid consideration. We remember the self-denying zeal and patriotism, which you exhibited but a few years
<pb n="166  The Woman's Advocate."/>
ago. How with trembling hands, and tortured but brave hearts, you "buckled on the sword" for those dearer than your own lives. Oh, we know by sad experience your patient watchings and waitings, and your devoted love for the principles of right and justice, even when your hearts were crushed and bleeding, and you were shedding bitter tears for those <hi rend="italic">immortal</hi> ones, who are sleeping beneath the Southern soil. And knowing this, we trust that through your speedy and efficient efforts, the noble cause of Woman Suffrage shall ere long surely triumph. Do not scornfully cast it aside as unworthy of your attention. The dignity of woman can never be lowered by careful investigation. Do not trouble your minds with the idea that you will be subverting the teachings of the Bible, by adhering to these principles. That Holy Book has been used to uphold iniquity too long already. Slaveholders and drunkards have, with as much plausibility as the opponents of Woman's Rights, proved their ways to be righteous and just. If there is anything which should cause woman to love the religion of Jesus with warmest fervor, it is for the fact of its elevating her sex. Where Christianity has greatest freedom, there woman has the most privileges. "Last at the cross, and first at the sepulchre," her Lord will never permit "Peace on earth," till Justice and Equity are extended to all of his creatures. Then arise daughters of this fair land, and declare that "the home of the brave" shall in deed and in truth become "the land of the free." In this time for action, you surely will not sit with hands folded, or do ought to discourage those laboring for your elevation. Rather promote, by pen and tongue, by every means in your power, their sacred cause; and when the smoke of battle shall be cleared away, and we stand beneath the bright heavens a free and happy people, then shall all mankind bless you, and reverently return thanks, that unto woman has been given that crown of honor, the elevation of her race, and the speeding on of that glad day when all the nations shall know and love the Lord our God.</p>

                        <head>OPPOSITION.</head>
                        <p>NATURE is continually reporting herself. Everything is busily engaged in writing its own history. Animals leave their bones in the strata of by-gone ages, and the fern pencils its modest epitaph on coal. The rock tears the mountain side in its descent, and the river cuts its bed in the soil. The rushing water rounds the rough stone to a smooth pebble, and the sun gives us shadowy pictures of the tulip and the tree. The falling rain-drop makes its sepulchre in the sand, and the snows of winter reappear in the golden grain of the harvest-field.</p>
                        <p>Man too, has been equally industrious. From the time when he made rude hatchets of stone, and left them in caves beside the mammoth monsters of twenty thousand years ago, till he became wise enough to harness steam to take him round the world, and send the lightnings of heaven to do his errands, has he been writing his name, and his fame, upon every conceivable object.</p>
                        <p>And Woman;--what of her deeds and history? We can say comparatively nothing. Were an inhabitant of another planet to be suddenly landed upon this, sent to learn of men by their achievements in the past, he would naturally suppose the race is represented by one sex alone. So persistently has woman been kept down in all past ages, that with a few bright exceptions, she has appeared only as the slave, the appendage, or the relict of man; solely to minister to his comfort while living, and the insignificant part of him yet above ground, after he has left.</p>
                        <p>Debased, stultified, she became an object of contempt. Of course, those whom men had ruled through all time, were fit only for servitude.</p>
                        <p>But now, when physical might is giving place to mental ability, when brain competes successfully with brawn, woman is slowly but surely, rising to her proper place in the scale of humanity. Slowly, because of the opposition she meets. There are several classes that would still keep her within the narrow bounds of kitchen, nursery and parlor.</p>
                        <p>Among the most bitter and powerful of these, are unprincipled
<pb n="170 The Woman's Advocate."/>
politicians. Those who, with an love of power and the emoluments of office, are determined to obtain them, by any means at their command. These, trample under foot considerations of virtue and friendship and affection, in their eager race for the most prominent places. They enter gambling saloons, they patronize grog-shops, they are on familiar terms with the "rough" and the rowdy.</p>
                        <p>As they succeed in getting the votes of these men, and begin to rise in the political scale, so does their influence increase. Success commands success and admiration, at least among the superficial and the thoughtless. The words of these men are quoted, their actions imitated, their company eagerly solicited, and their advice followed. When they return from the Legislative Hall, they are banqueted and toasted and serenaded. The one who receives any marks of attention from them, considers himself especially honored.</p>
                        <p>Such a man has more influence over a certain part of community than has a clergyman, or a professor in college. And this influence is almost always on the wrong side. There are women in many places in this broad land, who look forward to his leaving town with a sigh of relief, and anticipate his return with terror and dismay, because they cannot keep the boys they love better than their own lives, away from his influence. Many a one has told me weeping, that it is just this man who is enticing her son into grog-shops and gambling saloons, and she is powerless to prevent it. She cannot vote him down from his high official standing, put an honest, temperate man in his place, and save her son from perdition, because, forsooth, she would be out of her sphere!</p>
                        <p>Now, these men fear the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> influence of woman at the polls. They know that when she votes, they will be displaced; therefore they oppose her enfranchisement by every means in their power. One said to me not long since: </p>
                        <p>"Perhaps you women will vote, but I hope it will not be in my day."</p>
                        <p>"Then you will have to die within the next five years," I replied, for by that time so surely as the sun rises to-morrow, so surely women will be enfranchised throughout the length and breadth of
<pb n="171 Agitation."/>
the land, and this Government be in fact what it is now only in name, a model Republic."</p>
                        <p>Men of this stamp, with other ambitious ones, who yet hope to obtain office, combine to block our path to the ballot-box. Here is a large and powerful class against us; and we can scarcely imagine the bitterness of their 'opposition, and the firmness with which they will resist Woman Suffrage. We have engaged in a conflict which will be no holiday affair. Wise and good men in every Legislature will vote for us, long before the ignorant and depraved masses, controlled by these unprincipled politicians, can be induced to ratify that vote. But having girded on our armor, let us fight valiantly, not with carnal weapons, but with the sword of Truth, the rifle of Argument, and the bayonet of Justice and Equal Rights, till every opponent shall acknowledge his defeat. Then woman will have finished the first chapter of a history, whose every page shall glow with yet more brilliant deeds, till time shall be no longer.</p>

                        <head>AGITATION.</head>
                        <p>AGITATION is the hand-maid of progression. Every movement is characterized by excitement, agitation and discussion. The more agitation, thorough examination, and individual thought, the greater the promise of success, if the cause be founded on principles of right. Agitation and education go together in bringing a people up higher. Christ meant agitation when he commanded: "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature."</p>
                        <p>The oft-repeated war-cry "We must agitate," must also be ours. The masses of women need to be aroused from the torpid state engendered by continual dwarfing,--need to be awakened to what they might and should be,--need to be taught the wants of their natures,--need to be elevated to the highest, purest womanhood. The torpidity of woman balks her progress.

                        <p>The enfranchisement of women depends upon the interest awakened among women. A mighty power is presented in an avalanche descending the mountain, gathering strength and velocity as it goes; a mightier power is presented in the vast hosts of marshalled men actuated by one common impulse of patriotism; but a grander, a subtler, an irresistible force would be embodied in a nation of women, who, throwing aside caprice and folly, would claim the heaven-born right of full development. Could that unity be attained, success would be certain. It can be approximated only by agitation and discussion, "line upon line, and precept upon precept."</p>
                        <p>"Continual droppings wear away the hardest stones." Preaching makes converts. The meetings, discussions, lectures, and journals in behalf of women voting have their influence. Every once in a while, some one, who has hitherto opposed or remained silent, falls into the ranks.</p>
                        <p>Agitation is a privilege. The waves and currents of the ocean keep its waters pure. But in the general stirring up, so much filth and scum are found floating on the ocean of current literature, that one is astounded at the display of human depravity, until memory recalls the electioneering papers and stump-speakers. The misconstruction, the defamation, the ridicule, and the false statements concerning the "Woman Movement" and its champions, now going the rounds of the would-be witty press, is but a continuation of the Billingsgate for which our corrupt men-politicians are notorious throughout the land. Every candidate for office, however moral, conscientious and upright in character, has been the object of its foulness, but it mostly subsides the day after the election. Of late years, one party has refrained, somewhat, from its extensive use, and it is to be hoped that all speakers and journals, claiming to be respectable, may yet be shamed into decency.</p>
                        <p>Every brainless fop, every ignorant boor, and every foul-mouthed <hi rend="italic">roue</hi> cracks his jokes upon the "impending crisis," as some of them term it. Every speaker and writer expresses his opinion concerning it. The question is discussed on the street corners, in the legal and medical offices, in the lyceum halls and in the pulpit. It is well, it shows the movement is gaining ground. Our modesty may shrink from the publicity, but great wrongs have to be publicly probed. The oppositionists
<pb n="173 Agitation."/>
fight doggedly, but if the onward march and attack be continued faithfully, they must retreat or surrender.</p>
                        <p>In a recent issue of the <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Independent</hi>, a Chicago divine, (the Rev. Mr. Hatfield) offers arguments, in an article entitled "Woman and the Ballot," which differ somewhat from the old, stereotyped logic. His first proposition--"The advocacy of the cause is for the most part in bad hands and is badly managed"--is not new. It is an assertion common to many who wish to see the cause fail, yet are unable to answer the arguments in behalf of its justness. It would be a miracle, if there were not some impolitic advocates, and some <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> management. Human managers and management cannot be perfect. They never were, and never will be. Men and women, whose common-sense, refinement and morality are unimpeachable, may be incapable of properly managing a public cause. The Reverend gentleman does not refer to incapability when he asserts: "This Woman's Rights movement is largely in the hands of a class of women with whom the sensible wives and mothers of the country have no sympathy, and for whom they can feel no respect."</p>
                        <p>The fact Is, the great majority of married women, who advocate and favor "woman's rights," are "<hi rend="italic">sensible wives and mothers.</hi>" The foundation principle of the movement is the elevation and full development of women, and the immediate consequences of a practical adoption of that principle are true, pure wives, and educated, affectionate mothers; notwithstanding the assertions of editors and divines to the contrary. Witness the active interest of Mrs. Horace Mann in the Kindergartens, the spicy common sense of Mrs. E. Cady Stanton, the excellent papers on the proper rearing and culture of children by Mrs. E. Oakes Smith in the <hi rend="italic">Herald of Health</hi>, etc., etc. Multitudes of wives and mothers, pure and womanly as Dr. Holland's "Kathrina," are claiming <hi rend="italic">human rights</hi> for their sex.</p>
                        <p>He says further: "Many of both sexes who would give the question of Woman's Rights careful and candid consideration are repelled and disgusted by the atrocious sentiments of those who advocate it. How can it be otherwise, when these women proclaim from the platform and through the press that there are 'too many children,' and that when Cornelia finds her children too many for her they are 'Tarpean jewels?' These women 'wonder children do not open their mouths and curse the
<pb n="174 The Woman's Advocate."/>
fathers begat them and the mothers that bore them.'" There are too many children unless their parents can be induced to care for them more and protect them better. Look at the numerous inmates of foundling and orphan asylums. Look at the multitudes of forlorn children whose mothers were killed by lust and by child-birth pain; at the hosts of worse than orphans subject to the abuse of drunken, licentious fathers and inheritors of their brutality. The stamina which should have been given to one is diffused among five or six, thereby swelling the lists of mortality among infants, and the number of effeminate, prematurely old men and women.</p>
                        <p>Women believe that "Cornelia's jewels" form the most radiant crown woman can wear; but one of the saddest sights on earth is a woman whose soul and body has been dwarfed, health sacrificed, life shortened, and children defrauded by the sensuality of her husband and the oft-repeated pangs of travail.</p>
                        <p>Children do curse their parents, when they learn through science how they have been robbed of their inheritance of health and strength. Yet, when women, who know of those terrible and almost unmentionable wrongs hidden in the marriage state, dare to expose and denounce them, men accuse them of want of refinement, of maternal instinct, and of true wifely affection.</p>
                        <p>He quotes from an address that "At the time she became a mother, when there should have been joy alone at the thought that a babe was born into the world, she had turned her face to the wall and wept because her babe was a girl;" and asks "What reputable woman in a Christian land ever before made such an avowal as the one I have quoted?"</p>
                        <p>Hundreds of thoughtful mothers daily make that avowal to themselves, as they think of the dangers with which custom, society, conventionalism and ignorance have surrounded their daughters. One, who has reflected upon the degenerating, hot-house culture of women, upon her oppression from the laws, upon her degradation by man, upon the wounds her too delicate nature must receive, upon the physical suffering she must endure from others' sin and ignorance, cannot look upon a prattling girl-baby, or upon blithe innocent girlhood, without sending up a wailing prayer, God protect her, and God help her!</p>
                        <pb n="175 Agitation."/>
                        <p>Is it so very atrocious for a woman to weep for sorrow, because her babe belongs to a sex wronged and dwarfed, when, as a trenchant writer expresses it, "the silliest man who has ever lived has always known enough, when he says his prayers, to thank God that he wasn't born a woman."</p>
                        <p>"The strapping Amazons who are now haranguing the public on the rights and wrongs of woman have for their babes when born into the world no better welcome than tears of vexation and disgust." (A. libel). "Who wonders that the destruction of unborn children has become a hideous national crime? They that sow to the wind must reap the whirlwind." The gentlemen who prate of maternity, seem to forget that every case of infanticide, every murdered unborn one, and every sickly, mewling child had a father. Is woman alone guilty? Is there no word of condemnation for the men who ruin an innocent girl, who patronize the fallen woman, who debase the wife? So long as a woman can earn more by selling her soul than by honest labor; so long as the betrayed one finds no channel in which to return to respectability ; so long as girls are taught that marriage is a necessity; so long as their intellects and bodies are dwarfed until they feel they are unfit to become mothers, and so long as a woman has no right to assert that the marriage ceremony does not make her a legal prostitute,--so long will the "social evil" and the "national crime" increase. The advocates of woman's rights are battling against these evils, and trying to elevate woman to true womanhood, wifehood and motherhood. The main difference between the advocates of woman's rights and the class, of which the Chicago divine is a courteous specimen, is, the former take woman as a human being, as a foundation to build upon, while the latter take woman as a female. Let them turn the rule <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> and see how it will work. If women are to be wives and mothers, men are to be husbands and fathers, but they are far from making that a prominent point in their education.</p>
                        <p>The substance of his second proposition is that the ballot has not been shown a remedy for the evils complained of. That it will not open avenues of labor, will not make wages equal with those of men, and will not break up the liquor traffic. In 1774-5 the American colonists believed that representation and suffrage would remedy the evils imposed
<pb n="176 The Woman's Advocate."/>
on them; and failing to obtain them by persuasion they gained them by war, for which they have been commended ever since. In 1868-9, numbers of the best, wisest and shrewdest men of the nation declared the only way to relieve the negro and make him a man, was to give him the ballot. Still it won't help woman any.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the liquor business, he says: We need something more than votes to suppress the business. What we want is a moral power that will demand prohibitory laws and insist on their enforcement." Where, is that "moral power" to come from? Not from the men, and not from women in their present condition. Woman has tried, persuaded, pleaded and labored; she must become something more than she has been ere she can do more.</p>
                        <p>His third proposition is: "There is little doubt that female suffrage would greatly augment, if not double, the political power of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States." Because ignorant, Irish Catholic women would abuse the privilege, it must be denied to intelligent American women. "It is a poor rule that won't work both ways." Not only are there Irish Catholic men, but ignorant Germans, and ignorant, corrupt Americans both North and South, who cast their vote "solidly on the side of political corruption and against an honest and efficient government;" hence no man in the United States should have the right of suffrage. Why didn't our political Solons think of these things--of misplaced power,--when they gave the right of ballot into the majority of the hands which but a short time ago were fighting against the government? "O Consistency, thou art a jewel!" When woman suffrage is to be dealt with, <hi rend="italic">policy</hi> must be considered; when man suffrage is to be dealt with, policy is ignored and "<hi rend="italic">inalienable rights</hi>" are prominent.</p>
                        <p>He further asserts, "for years to come there would be no corresponding vote in favor of law and good government to counterbalance the one given by these bigoted and ignorant Catholic women." The Catholics will work energetically for the wrong, but American women will not move an inch in behalf of the right. A compliment indeed! Awaken American women to a sense of duty, and they are ready and willing to perform it. Our women, I do not mean vagrants or butterflies respond when called upon. The women of '76 were applauded to
<pb n="177 Women as Rulers."/>
the derogation of their descendants, but the war proved the women of '61 equal to their great-grandmothers.</p>
                        <p>"Four-fifths of the American women are utterly opposed to the whole Woman's Rights movement," says our reverend authority. If they are opposed to it, it is because they have not been properly enlightened as to its principles and aims. Every woman who has thought upon the condition of women, feels that as a sex they are dwarfed and defrauded.</p>
                        <p>Some, there are, who delight in their chains, as subjects reverence their despots. Many of the Old World think a monarchy is the best form of government, but their thinking so does not prove it. Many prefer that form, but does that prove that they would not be more happy and enlightened in a republic? Some of the slaves preferred slavery to liberty, but does that prove that slavery is better than liberty? or that they would not desire liberty when awakened to its benefit?</p>
                        <p>Only one who has been a slave can fully realize the blessing of liberty ; but a slave, while a slave, cannot comprehend liberty.</p>
                        <p>Let thorough investigation go on, let the <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> of the question be handled, the more there is said, the more will be heard. Agitation will finally cleanse the waters and throw the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> ashore. Specious arguments and paltry excuses show, to us, who are working and waiting, that we can exultingly exclaim with the old Philosopher "And yet it moves."</p>

                        <head>WOMEN AS RULERS.</head>
                        <p>WITH regard to the fitness of women, not only to participate in elections, but themselves to hold offices or practice professions involving important public responsibilities, I have already observed that this consideration is not essential to the practical question in dispute; since any woman who succeeds in an open profession, proves by that very fact that she is qualified for it. And in the case of public offices, if the political system of the country is such as to exclude unfit men, it will equally exclude unfit women, while if it is not, there is no additional evil in the fact that the unfit persons whom it admits may be either women or men. As long, therefore, as it is acknowledged that even a few women may be fit for these duties, the laws which shut the door on those exceptions cannot be justified by any opinion which can be held respecting the capacities of women in
<pb n="178 The Woman's Advocate."/>
general. But though this last consideration is not essential, it is far from being irrelevant. An unprejudiced view of it gives additional strength to the arguments against the disabilities of women and reinforces them by high considerations of practical utility.</p>
                        <p>Let us at first make entire abstraction of all psychological considerations tending to show that any of the mental differences supposed to exist between women and men are but the natural effect of the differences in their education and circumstances, and indicated no radical difference, far less radical inferiority of nature. Let us consider women only as they already are, or as they are known to have been, and the capacities which they have already practically shown. What they have done, that at least, if nothing else, it is proved that they can do. When we consider how sedulously they are all trained away from, instead of being trained toward, any of the occupations or objects reserved for men, it is evident that I am taking a very humble ground for them when I rest their case on what they have actually achieved. For, in this case, negative evidence is worth little, while any positive evidence is conclusive. It cannot be inferred to be impossible that a woman should be a Homer, or an Aristotle, or a Michael Angelo, or a Beethoven, because no woman has yet actually produced works comparable to theirs in any of those lines of excellence. This negative fact, at most, leaves the question uncertain, and open to psychological discussion. But it is quite certain that a woman can be a Queen Elizabeth, or a Deborah, or a Joan of Arc, since this is not inference, but fact. Now it is a curious consideration, that the only things which the existing law excludes women from doing, are the things which they have proved that they are able to do. There is no law to prevent a woman from having written all the plays of Shakespeare, or composed all the operas of Mozart. But Queen Elizabeth or Queen Victoria, had they not inherited the throne, could not have been intrusted with the smallest of the political duties of which the former showed herself equal to the greatest.</p>
                        <p>If anything conclusive could be inferred from experience, without psychological analysis, it would be that the things which women are not allowed to do are the very ones for which they are peculiarly qualified; since their vocation for government has made its way, and become conspicuous, through the very few opportunities which have been given; while in the lines of distinction which apparently were freely open to them, they have by no means so eminently distinguished themselves. We know how small a number of reigning queens history presents, in comparison with that of kings. Of this smaller number, a far larger proportion have shown talents for rule; though many of them have occupied the throne in difficult periods. It is remarkable, too, that they have, in a great number of
<pb n="179 Women as Rulers."/>
instances, been distinguished by merits the most opposite to the imaginary and conventional character of women; they have been as much remarked for the firmness and vigor of their rule, as for its intelligence. When, to queens and empresses, we add regents, and viceroys of provinces, the list of women who have been eminent rulers of mankind swells to a great length.</p>
                        <p>Especially is this true if we take into consideration Asia as well as Europe. If a Hindoo principality is strongly, vigilantly, and economically governed; if order is preserved without oppression; if cultivation is extended, and the people prosperous, in three cases out of four that principality is under a woman's rule. This fact, to me an entirely unexpected one, I have collected from a long official knowledge of Hindoo governments. There are many such instances: for though, by Hindoo institutions, a woman cannot reign, she is the legal regent of a kingdom during the minority of the heir; and minorities are frequent, the lives of the male rulers being so- often prematurely terminated through the effect of inactivity and sensual excesses. When we consider that these princesses have never been seen in public, have never conversed with any man not of their own family except from behind a curtain, that they do not read, and if they did, there is no book in their languages which can give them the smallest instruction on political affairs, the example they afford of the natural capacity of women for government, is very striking.--<bibl>

                        <p>FULL justice has never been done to the influence of woman on Literature and Society. Neither the classic nor the feudal age had anything deserving to be called Society. What we call by that name was born in modern times, and owes its existence to woman. Society, the natural outgrowth of the New Testament, without which Christianity was only a dogma, a hermit or a monster--was never born till woman was allowed her true place, and men learned that really, under Christ, there was neither male or female--Society, the only field where the sexes have ever met on terms of equality--the arena where character is formed and studied--the crucible of ideas--the cradle and the realm of public opinion--the spur and the crown of ambition--the world's university--the tribunal which unmasks pretension and stamps real merit--at once a school, and a theater-which gives government leave to be, and out-runs the formal church in guiding the moral sense of the age--who shall fitly tell us the power of this marvelous agent over the civil and religious world? What else can as rightfully claim the first place among the controlling elements of the last two centuries? Yet this is the throne of woman; the throne which, like a first conquerer, she founded and then filled.--<bibl>

                        <docAuthor>M. F. Burlingame</docAuthor>
                        <head>WILL SUFFRAGE DEMORALIZE WOMEN?</head>
                        <p>THE above question is seriously asked by many who favor the principles of the woman movement, yet fear its practical results. They fear that women will lose their feminine characteristics, their purity and modesty, and will descend to the roughness, the brazen effrontery, and the vices of men.</p>
                        <p>Said one gentleman: "We now give woman all the rights which will elevate her, and withhold only those which would degrade her."</p>
                        <p>There is no human right degrading in itself. Its surroundings and abuses may be degrading, but not the right. The right of suffrage is not degrading to a man, but the profanity and intoxication attending elections are. The right to hold office is not degrading, but fraud and bribery are. The right to labor in any occupation is not degrading, but the companionship of vicious laborers is.</p>
                        <p>Shall any man forego those rights because of their degrading circumstances? Can not a true, conscientious man exercise those rights without becoming degraded by those circumstances?</p>
                        <p>Let every woman ask herself, "Will I be personally degraded by acting upon any principle, and by possessing any liberty and right involved in the Woman's Rights movement?"</p>
                        <p>What woman will assert the affirmative?</p>
                        <p>What man will assert: "<hi rend="italic">My</hi> wife, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> mother, and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sister would become coarse, degraded, and vicious by possessing the liberty and rights advocated by the movement?"</p>
                        <p>If there is one, God help and pity him in his affliction.</p>
                        <p>As a woman, aiming at pure and high development, I feel and know that no human right can degrade me.</p>
                        <p>There are no such things really as "woman's rights" and "Man's rights." Human rights is the expression. Man and woman equal in the sight of law and society, without distinction as to liberty and right, without partiality or aggression, even as they stand before God.</p>
                        <p>But will not the mass of women be demoralized?</p>
                        <p>Do inalienable human rights, not assumed rights, founded on license
<pb n="182 The Woman's Advocate."/>
instead of liberty, demoralize the mass of men? If so, is not the suppression of those rights, a question of expediency ?</p>
                        <p>What will demoralize women will demoralize men.</p>
                        <p>Now comes the humiliating admission. The mass of men are rough, profane, and vicious, and we do not want our women to descend to their level.</p>
                        <p>The roughness, profanity, drunkenness and other vices of men are not men the results of liberty and human rights, for they exist among men deprived of liberty and human rights--in kingdoms, in empires and in bondage.</p>
                        <p>The fraud, intrigue and knavery found in politics are not the legitimate fruit of liberty, but the abuses of liberty. </p>
                        <p>Shutting woman up within four walls, and depriving her of the rights of a human being, do not deter her from the vices of men, for a class of women descend to those vices despite law, custom and society. Equal rights would not augment the ranks of degraded women, but, tend to thin them. The arbitrary laws, by which man thinks to preserve woman's morals, do not restrain her, but her own conscience and high appreciation of virtue do.</p>
                        <p>Reverse the position of men and women, or suppose the mass of men to take the present political position of American women, subject to the same restrictions and aggressions at the hands of a privileged few forming the government, and would the morals of men be improved? Would not their aimless, dwarfed lives lead them into greater excesses than at present? </p>
                        <p>This fact stands pre-eminent-wherever women approximate nearest to equal rights, there is found the highest civilization; where women approach nearest the nonentity of bondage, there is found the lowest barbarism.</p>
                        <p>So as woman rises, man rises, and society progresses toward a higher state.</p>
                        <p>Contamination is the bug-bear of the woman movement. It opposed the education of women in the same schools with men, opposed the employment of women as clerks, saleswomen, printers, etc., and opposed the entrance of woman into the medical profession. Yet, in every direction wherein woman has experimented, she has proved the alarm false.</p>
                        <p>Suppose a reformer should go to Turkey and propose to the women
<pb n="183 Will Suffrage Demoralize Women?"/>
of that country that polygamy be abolished, that women appear upon the streets unveiled, that they mingle in the general society of men, that they attend religious services in company with men, and that their daughters be educated in the same schools with their sons; would not every Turkish man stand aghast and protest against the contamination and demoralization of Turkish women?</p>
                        <p>Yet American women possess and use all those privileges and many more, without any resulting contamination and demoralization.</p>
                        <p>No doubt, temporary evils would arise if the American woman's privileges were granted to Turkish women, but if they were educated up to the point, every one must admit that the Turkish nation would be greatly elevated.</p>
                        <p>The woman movement strikes so deep and overturns so many social wrongs, that in the tearing down and building up, some temporary confusion and evil must arise, but order and system will soon prevail.</p>
                        <p>There will always be fools and ninnies. We shall always see the sad sights of men and women perverting their talents, abusing their physical powers, and misusing their time. Under the new dispensation, there will be degraded men and women, frivolous, heartless men and women, and selfish men and women, as there are now, but the general tendency will be upward. There will be desolated homes, neglected children, and, excitement-hunting women, but not more than there are now--not so many.</p>
                        <p>Plato said, "When a man is made a slave, God takes from him half of his soul." The same is true of woman. Their souls have been dwarfed, human liberty and human rights will develop their true proportions. Women are learning more, thinking more. The chrysalis is opening. The coming woman will be better educated, better disciplined. She, will aim at a higher standard. Having knowledge and actuated by high purposes, she will strive to restrain the evil, the animal, in herself, in man, in society and in the nation; and to foster the pure, the spiritual.</p>
                        <p>The weak, dwarfed woman of the present may need to shrink from contamination, but the educated, well-developed woman of the future will perform her mission unscathed.</p>
                        <p>How unwilling men are to trust woman. They elevate her to angel-hood in their theories at the expense or her womanhood, yet they are
<pb n="184 The Woman's Advocate."/>
afraid to let that angelhood be tested. The world does not need angels, serfs, or dolls, but women, with a brave, strong love for humanity, with unfearing, uncompromising consciences, to penetrate and purify by their womanliness.</p>
                        <p>Men have stood supinely while corruption ate at the vitals of society and government; while vileness polluted and villainy defrauded the rights of a free people; but will not woman's energy arouse them to action?</p>
                        <p>The very fact that woman will walk along political avenues, will stimulate men to remove the filth and vileness, that her pure eyes may not be offended.</p>
                        <p>H. W. Beecher says, "If women were to vote there would be an end of indecent voting places;" and the same is true of all the other indecencies men fear to have women encounter.</p>
                        <p>Minor points, the principal of which appears to be the working of roads, will be readily settled when the great questions are carried.</p>
                        <p>Pure, true women will not neglect their duties or forget their womanliness, because, instead of partial liberty, they have perfect liberty.</p>
                        <p>Suffrage will not demoralize women, because the degrading circumstances accompanying political affairs are not the consequences of human rights but the fruits of man's evil propensities. They are not among the rights that woman claims, but among the wrongs she will fight.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, these degrading circumstances will in a great degree be removed.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, suffrage, including all it means, its changes and reforms, will not demoralize women because <hi rend="italic">it is right.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"O ye of little faith!" wrong cannot result from right. The world moves forward when justice reigns over policy.</p>

                           <p>SINCE our last, in which we made a synopsis of Mrs. HARRIET BEECHER STOWE's admirable presentation of the "Woman Question," the <hi rend="italic">Hearth and Home,</hi> in which journal the article appeared, has contained the second of the promised series, from the pen of Hon. HORACE GREELEY, who, picking up the glove of the lady, takes a counter view of the question.</p>
                           <p>To thousands of the educated men and women of the country the words of the veteran Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> come with a greater weight than the utterances of any living American journalist. Irreproachable in moral character, honest in intention, identified with many of the reforms of the day, a careful, pains-taking investigator after truth, whatever its guise, the well-known eccentricities of the writer have never prevented a large class of readers from ascribing to the opinions of HORACE GREELEY almost the weight of authority of an oracle. To the more discerning, however, of his friends, his singular obtuseness upon certain subjects has been a cause of unceasing regret. Especially concerning the growing question of Woman Suffrage, it had been hoped that the scales would have fallen from his eyes, and that he would be annointed, as Saul, to see the Right, and lend his influence in the direction of the broadly democratic principle of Universal Franchise. This last carefully prepared article against Woman Suffrage leaves, we regret to say, but little room for the further indulgence of that hope; and the New World, which leads the Old in so much that is worthy, must yet longer rest under the mortification of seeing lent to the Cause abroad a weight of names, among statesmen, philosophers, and men of letters, which our country is slow to emulate.</p>
                           <pb n="186 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>Mr. GREELEY commences his "Notions of Woman's Rights" with the proposition that "God created our race, male and female, with a clear-seeing intent that it should thereby be rendered more efficient, nobler, happier, than it otherwise could be and that this diversity relates not to a single function merely; but extends to our entire physical, intellectual and emotional nature."</p>
                           <p>Enlarging, somewhat, upon this, and the division of labor between the sexes in the ruder forms of early society, Mr. GREELEY proceeds to his third proposition that when the time arrived for establishing a government or State, other than that oldest and simplest patriarchal rule which doubtless sufficed for a season, the men assembled for the purpose, whether generally or by delegates, leaving the women at home, attending to their proper business, and this because of a mutual and general intuition that such was the Divine Order, dictated by the highest good -of the entire human family."</p>
                           <p>Proposition fourth affirms "that the appointed sphere of man is broader, not higher than that of woman--that the household is her kingdom, within which her influence should be paramount, and her decisions have the force of law. Of course, a true wife will consult her husband on all matters of importance, and will evince great deference to his wishes, tastes, feelings, aversions; just as a true husband will evince like deference to those of his wife; but Nature has assigned to each a distinct, definite sphere, and the happiness of both, the due development and well being of their children, the comfort and enjoyment of their guests, dictate that each should recognize the others' precedence within the proper radius of his or her dominion."</p>
                           <p>Following these, are several kindred propositions explanatory of Mr. GREELEY'S convictions, to which, in detail, space will not permit us to refer. The right of woman to do whatever she can do well, Mr. GREELEY admits, but he deprecates all promiscuous mingling together of the sexes, whether in the shop, the field, the college, or hall of legislation. Touching affairs of Government, Mr. GREELEY would be willing for the women of the country to choose their wisest and best to assemble as delegates, consider the needs and wrongs of their sex, and memorialize Congress for the removal of those wrongs. Valuable suggestions, such as the
<pb n="187 Editorial Department"/>
National Legislature would gladly second, Mr. GREELEY believes might be expected from such a deliberative assemblage of the "gentler and purer sex;" but to make up a Congress of men and women, and such women as would naturally aspire to and enjoy seats therein, he considers would be fraught with deplorable consequences. Concerning the ballot and the holding of office, he thus writes: "Of my seven children, but two survive, both girls, for whom I would make life as fair and hopeful as may be. I presume them quite as capable as most other girls to do their part in whatever befits their sex and their station. I would have their lives active, useful, beneficent, and respected. If I thought it well for them to be voters, jurywomen, electioneerers, and candidates for office, I have no conceivable motive for seeking to interpose a barrier to their following such a career. But I do not, cannot believe that such is the sphere for which they were designed by an All-wise Father. I believe that their chances of usefulness and of happiness would be seriously diminished by precipitating them on such a course. I greatly prefer that they should be women, such as Milton portrayed in Eve, and Shakespeare in Imogen."</p>
                           <p>We have quoted thus at length from this article of Mr. GREELEY'S, preferring so to do to offering much of comment thereon, leaving its force or weakness to the discernment of the reader. That it is most remarkable for its admissions, we think it will be the judgment of every student of this question now agitating to its center all civilized society. The recommendation of an Advisory Congress, of itself is an admission of Woman's fitness and duty to participate in affairs of State, which surely goes far towards covering the entire ground claimed by the most strenuous advocate of Woman Suffrage. When it is once admitted that Woman can fitly and wisely counsel with Man concerning National affairs, the precise manner in which she can best perform her work will be a matter easily determined, nor need we say that when that hour arrives the <hi rend="italic">ballot</hi> will be placed in her hand.</p>
                           <p>Mr. GREELEY is not yet old. Years of usefulness, we trust, are before him, and, to the mighty changes witnessed in his life, may be added the crowning revolution in politics of the extension of the ballot to Woman, causing, by its elevating influences, a reconsideration of judgment which he now regards as impossible.</p>

                           <p>OUR readers will remember that in THE ADVOCATE for August we printed a letter from Mrs. FRANCES D.

As certain sentiments therein ascribed to WENDELL PHILLIPS called forth the article entitled "Woman's Rights," from that distinguished pen, to be found in our September number, we cheerfully give place, to the following letter from Mrs. GAGE, In which it will be seen full justice is done to Mr. PHILLIPS, as one of the truest Reformers of the age; while the duty of every well-wisher of humanity is so simply yet clearly defined that we could wish its brief words might penetrate every home and heart in the land:</p>

                                    </salute>
                                    <p>PERMIT me to say to the readers of THE ADVOCATE a few words with regard to the sentence in my article on the Fifteenth Amendment in your August number. When I wrote the words quoted as the expression of Mr. Phillips, I wrote them honestly thinking I was writing the truth.</p>
                                    <p>As Mr. Phillips asserts in his denial of the words, "I know it has been said a hundred times that I have done all these things," and I had heard a hundred and more times that he had so spoken, and not having been present at the committee meetings to which he alludes, I accepted the words as his and so wrote them; meaning no more than that he, (Mr. Phillips) felt that the negro's position should be made secure before that of woman, as the greater necessity. I regret that I made the mistake, and rejoice that he has so promptly corrected me and so positively defined his position. I know that by many he has been misunderstood. As an active, earnest and generous friend of woman there is no man who can take precedence of Wendell Phillips. If he had bidden women wait a little, I for one, although "grieved," should have entirely forgiven him, in consideration of his vast philanthropies and his far-seeing sense of fitness and justice.</p>
                                    <p>Now, a word for myself. When I engaged in the Reforms of Anti-Slavery, Woman's Rights and Temperance, forty years ago, they three seemed to me like

a three-strand cord, so bound together that to leave either out would weaken the whole. I had lived where I saw clearly that drunkenness added greatly to the horrors of the slave's fate, and to the cruelty of woman's life, under the unjust and tyrannical usages of society. I saw, too, that the majority of those that were pro-slavery, were largely the intemperate. I never knew or heard of a mob, a tarring, or feathering, the burning down of a hall or destroying a printing press, the whipping to death or burning of a negro, where whiskey was not the fuel that added fire to the fury of all the diabolical wretches. The most savage wife beaters and wife murderers were always inebriates; and I believe, to-day, that intemperance has whetted nearly every knife, and aimed nearly every bullet, that has made the South such a pandemonium since the war. Sober men do not do these things. Whiskey was not the principle but the bulwark of defense.</p>
                                    <p>The Fifteenth Amendment, though a broad and needed justice, would not screen all from drunken rebel hate; nor would the right to the ballot give women protection against the husband who "has tarried long at the wine," or the whiskey bottle. But the right of suffrage will give to both the negro and the woman a foundation for future protection, upon which, if they are wise, they can build beautiful structures of Liberty, Equality and Temperance in the years that are to come. So thinking and feeling I have ever worked for these three great reforms as parts of one great whole. Yours truly,</p>

                           <head>A DISTINGUISHED WOMAN ON SUFFRAGE.</head>
                           <p>OF the women identified with our Nation's literature, who, from the retirement of their homes, send out thoughts to instruct and elevate mankind, few are more endeared to the liberal reading public than LYDIA MARIA CHILD. In the wide range of reformatory subjects there are few themes that her pen has not touched to inspire with respect or interest; and, let volumes multiply as they may, thousands of readers throughout the land will yet turn over the pages of those dear, delightful "Letters from New York," or, maybe, some graver philosophical work, to dwell upon passages which have afforded them so oft a pleasure. Less identified than of yore with editorial or public life, later years have witnessed no abatement of zeal, or flagging of her industrious pen; and, in addition to numerous volumes given to the press, the liberal journals
<pb n=" 190 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of the day have been enriched with frequent contributions from her pen, of more than ordinary interest. From the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Slavery Standard</hi> of August 28th we quote the following letter, possessing an especial value at the present moment:
<text id="wa2.431" n="Women and the Freedmen.">
                                 <body>
                                    <head>WOMEN AND THE FREEDMEN.</head>
                                    <p>For more than a year past, I have observed in the writings of some advocates of women's suffrage, sentiments, more or less openly expressed, which have excited a fear in my mind that rotten timbers were getting introduced into the foundation of our cause. In allusions to the freedmen's right to vote I have occasionally noticed something of the sneering tone habitually assumed by slaveholders and their copperhead allies. Complaints that negroes were allowed to vote, while women were excluded from the polls have been followed by a very obvious readiness on the part of some to set aside the rights of the colored people for the advancement of the woman cause. </p>
                                    <p>Mrs. Stanton, in a letter of invitation to a Convention of Women, last Spring expressed her surprise and gratification at the number of sympathizing letters she received from Southern women. I probably should have been surprised also, if my mind had not previously been excited to watchfulness by the symptoms to which I have just alluded. If the Pope should join the Free Religious Association in Boston, I should at once query with myself how he was calculating to use the Association for the benefit of Rome; and the singular spectacle of Southerners, especially of Southern women, in love with progress, at once gave rise to similar questions. I could not but observe that while <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were said to be zealous for women's voting, the freedmen were charged with being opposed to it. Years ago, I used to say that negroes were anti-slavery, as naturally as hens were anti-hawk; and I asked myself, Are their instincts true in this matter also? Do they "feel it in their bones" that Southern women will be certain to aid Southern men in their determined efforts to deprive them of the right to vote? We all know how proofs of that unrelenting determination are piled up mountain-high in the accounts of elections at the South. It requires no great acuteness to perceive what an advantage will be gained by the enemies of the United States if they can secure the elective franchise for rebel women, and take It away from loyal blacks. In the days of slave-holding supremacy, the aristocracy of the South always had a party of male politicians at the North, who, while they talked loudly about human rights, were ever ready to rivet more firmly the chains of the slave, for the sake of securing Southern patronage in carrying out their own personal and party plans. And now, when Southern women manifest a tendency to enter the
<pb n="191 Editorial Department"/>
political arena, we see a party of female politicians at the North ready to sacrifice the rights of colored men in order to secure the co-operation of Southern ladies in their efforts for the enfranchisement of women. What an argument is this to put into the mouths of those who deny that the suffrage of women would tend to purify politics!</p>
                                    <p>I was glad to see, in THE WOMAN'S ADVOCATE, an article from Wendell Phillips rebuking these women for their faithlessness to principle; and glad to notice also that Mr. Smalley, in one of his Letters to the <hi rend="italic">Tribune,</hi> expresses his disapprobation of such a course. For myself, I find it requires a good deal of restraining grace to speak in moderate terms of a compromise so utterly wrong in principle, so shamefully mean and selfish in its spirit. God forbid that women should ever consent to take one iota from the rights of others for the sake of advancing their own! Will human beings never learn that no good thing can ever be firmly established on a basis of violated principle? There may seem to be some present advantages gained by such a course, but, in some form or other, the wrong is sure to return and plague the doer. Grant that women might be allowed to vote a few years sooner in consequence of exerting their influence against the freedmen's right of suffrage, what would be the consequence? They would have obtained an external good at the price of a great internal injury to themselves. They would show that the conscience of woman was in the auction-room, for hackneyed politicians to bid upon its price. They would prove themselves unworthy to vote, unfit to discharge the responsible duties of citizenship; and by so doing they would hinder the real progress of women more than any legal disabilities could possibly do.</p>
                                    <p>I am glad to know that many women view this subject as I do. They see, as I do, that when a thing is radically wrong, no array of possible advantages can make it right. As American citizens, we profess to believe that every human being has a right to a voice in the laws by which he is governed; and if we do not believe this, our professions of freedom are hollow brass. The people born with dark complexions have this right in common with all human beings; and, in addition to this universal right, they have an especial claim upon our gratitude, as well as our sense of justice. They hid our hunted soldiers, they fed the famishing, they tended the sick, they guided our wanderers to places of safety. Many a wife and mother among us owes the return of dear ones to their loyalty, intelligence, and tender care. And shall we allow ourselves to become accomplices of their oppressors? Shall our influence go to strengthen the, murderous hands of the Ku-Klux-Klan? If we think our rights would be more perfectly secured if we were allowed to vote, how much more true is it of them, who are living in the
<pb n="192 The Woman's Advocate."/>
midst of cunning and malignant enemies! I regard it as a shame to womanhood that any one should think of bartering away their rights for the sake of more promptly securing her own.</p>
                                    <p>I have never been so sanguine as many concerning the great purification that would be wrought in politics by the admission of women to the polls; and therefore I am not much disappointed at this proof that they have the same human nature as men; I am only a little surprised that they should so <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> begin to follow the crooked ways of politicians. It does not, however, in the least change my conviction that women ought to vote, and that, their voting would, on the whole, have a beneficial effect upon themselves and the community. In the first place, we are human beings; and I regard it as an eternal principle of right that every human being should have a voice in the laws that govern him. In the next place, the exercise of that right involves large responsibilities, and necessarily ennobles character, in proportion as those responsibilities are understood and appreciated; and we can understand them and appreciate them only by incurring them. Lastly there are several subjects on which it is obviously for the interest of women to vote wisely. The cause of temperance, for instance, would doubtless find powerful allies in them. Some of them will exhibit a talent for politics, which practically means indirectness and compromise; but that class I think will always be a small minority, and will do no more harm than the corresponding class of men do.</p>

                           <p>To the outcry raised by the press at Mrs. Stowe's "Defence of Lady Byron," no one of our metropolitan journals has more contributed than the <hi rend="italic">N. Y.

                           <p>Concerning either the facts of Mrs. Stowe's article, or the wisdom of giving publicity thereto, it is not our purpose at this moment to speak. Of the former, she will doubtless give, in her own good time, fitting evi-

dence; and of the judiciousness of such a step, or the purity of her  motives, abler pens than ours have already pronounced an opinion. But whether it all be ill or well done, for a journal which has played the part of the <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Sun</hi>--which has defied decency, torn the veil guarding the most sacred of privacies, and, at one unmerciful blow, would have blighted the prospects of a rising young man, one of the brightest lights in American journalism,--to sit in judgment concerning a moral question is a coolness and obliviousness of its own past record of which we had scarcely believed it capable. Lord Byron is dead. To the grave in which he lies no earthly word may reach to disturb; but a living, breathing being was selected as the <hi rend="italic">Sun's</hi> target, and having aimed his poisoned shaft the archer waited secure to see the victim drop from the shining heights of prosperity which he had reached. Perhaps not in journalism has there been a more wanton, unjustifiable assault upon individual reputation than that of Dana's upon the standing and good name of JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG. Let Mr. Dana, if he aims to be the Mephistopheles of American journalists, at least study <hi rend="italic">Consistency.</hi>

The object of the Convention, as heretofore stated, was to 'bring together the workers and leaders of the Woman Suffrage Cause in the several Western States, to unite on some definite plan of action for the future, to form acquaintance with each other, and to arrange for a more general and complete movement in the West. Hon. C. B. Waite presided temporarily. Among the speakers present were Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Kate Doggett, Madame D'Harricourt, and others of Chicago; Lucy Stone, Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Longley, Mrs. Hazard, Miss Lizzie M. Boynton, Mrs. Bishop, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Ballou, and others from abroad. Many distinguished men, from the East and West, were also present, and took part in the deliberations. Mr. Livermore was called to preside permanently, with Mrs. Longley, of Ohio; Mrs. Willhete, of Indiana; Mrs. Hazard, of St. Louis; Mrs. Adams, of Iowa; Mrs. Bishop, of Minnesota, as Vice-Presidents. Amanda M. Way, of Indianapolis, was appointed Secretary, and Mrs., Kate Doggett, of Chicago, Treasurer.

                           <p>If, as has been remarked by some writer, the selection of a subject is the first pledge of the excellence of a work, Mr. May may be congratulated on the wisdom of <sic corr="choosing">chosing</sic>  a theme which, perhaps, of all others offers the rarest opportunity for a work of absorbing interest. If Slavery was the tragedy played upon the great stage of American history, so, for the last Thirty Years previous to its bloody abolishment, the Abolitionists were the actors around whom clustered the interest which no time will lessen in the recollection of a grateful posterity.</p>
                           <p>Turning over the pages of Mr. May's volume--the various contents of which appeared originally in the <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> (Boston) <hi rend="italic">Register,</hi> and are now collected with the author's revisions--one meets with the brief biographical sketches of the well-known pioneers in the Anti-Slavery Reform; that handful of earnest men and women, who, more than a third of a century ago, presented the grandly moral spectacle of assembling and giving birth to that <hi rend="italic">second</hi> and <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> Declaration of Independence--the Declaration of Sentiments--to which they adhered, with a fidelity such as the world never contemplated, through all those years marked by an obloquy and spirit of persecution such as a repentant Nation would gladly efface from its escutcheon. With what delight one, who has grown with the slow growth of the Reform, and received the ineffaceable impressions of its champions,--lingers over each scrap of by-gone history, as familiarly set forth by the writer! A generation has stepped upon the stage of active life since the first Philadelphia Convention, and many of revered memory, of that "advance guard," were not permitted, in flesh, to behold the fulfillment of their most fervent aspiration. Yet, calling, as Mr. May, the roll, whether still in active life, or promoted to the "higher sphere," battle-scarred and wearing the familiar look, all seem to arise, to rejoice in the fulfilling of their work and the fast obliterating, from the land, of human bondage.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps as well as reasonably could be expected, Mr. May has performed his task. As stated in his preface, he neither hopes nor expects his "sketches" to satisfy the desire for "a more thorough history of the conflict with slavery, in our country and in Great Britain." Noticeable omissions there are of biography and of allusion to distinguished services, which a more complete history, or enlargement of Mr. May's work, should correct. While, amid so much that is
<pb n="198 The Woman's Advocate."/>
fascinating, it is almost impossible to select any particular article or passage, we <sic corr="">we</sic> would say that, perhaps, Charles C. Burleigh's consecration to the Cause touched us most deeply; while "George Thompson's First Year in America," or "John G. Whittier and the Anti-Slavery Poets," impressed us as furnishing the best illustrations of the pleasant, graphic style of the author. Still, throughout its pages one can scarcely go amiss for agreeable reminiscence, or entertaining bit of history. As an illustration of the high purpose which animated the founders of the American Anti-Slavery Society, as well as of Mr. May's style, we present a single extract from the paper entitled "The Convention at Philadelphia":</p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <p>"If I ever boast of anything it is this: that I was a member of the Convention that instituted the American Anti-Slavery Society. That assembly, gathered from eleven different States of our Republic, was composed of devout men of every sect and of no sect in religion, of each political party and of neither; but they were all of one mind. They evidently felt that they had come together for a purpose higher and better than that of any religious sect or political party. Never have I seen men so ready, so anxious to rid themselves of whatsoever was narrow, selfish, or merely denominational. I was all the more affected by the manifestation of this spirit, because I had been living for ten years in Connecticut, where every one who did not profess a faith essentially 'Orthodox' was peremptorily proscribed. In the Philadelphia Convention there were but two or three of my sect, which you know at that time had but few avowed adherents anywhere except in the eastern half of Massachusetts, and was then, much more than now, especially obnoxious to all other religionists in the land. Yet, we were cordially treated as brethren, admitted freely, without reserve or qualification, into that goodly fellowship. They were indeed a company of the Lord's freemen, a truly devout company. And the scrupulous regard for the rights of the human mind, no less than for the other natural rights of man, was shown from the beginning to the end of the Convention."</p>

                           <p>The volume is neatly issued by the well-known publishers, and, we trust, may command an extensive sale.</p>

                           <p>From our earliest reading of <hi rend="italic">Adam Bede,</hi> the first work which on this side of the Atlantic found an extended audience, we have cherished a profound admiration for the writings of George Eliot. For each of the succeeding creations of her genius, which in the estimation of the public may scarcely have held the place of the first favorite, we know not that there is less of endearing remembrance; for while as fictions they may not possess quite the absorbing interest of the initial romance, which at once stormed the hold of public favor, they bear a rich equivalent in the ripened fertility of invention, in philosophical dissertations, in the elaboration of character, and in the care bestowed upon the descriptive and the most trivial details of her finished works.</p>
                           <pb n="199 Items."/>
                           <p>To those who have with us enjoyed the healthful vigor of her writings, from the first portrayal of the English preacher girl, in the volume the scenes of which were laid on the soil she loved, to the flowering of her creative genius in the person of Romola, the high-bred artistic-natured Italian maiden, breathing, moving amid the classic "spells" of her clime, in the depiction of which the author's skill, severely taxed, was equally manifest,--no word of ours at this late day, is needed to stamp George Eliot as one of the writers the world holds justly dear, and to whom is entitled its warmest gratitude.</p>
                           <p>In obedience to the wide-spread desire of American readers, and with the approval of the author, whose printed autograph letter by its frankness of tone adds value to the edition, the publishers have added to their <hi rend="italic">Household Collection,</hi> in a series uniform with those of Reade and Thackeray, the six volumes of George Eliot, four of which are already on our table. To say that the publishers, Messrs. Fields, Osgood &#x0026; Co., to whom the reading public are so deeply indebted, have well done their part is no over tribute. The dainty green of the morocco cloth binding, the clearness of the type, the excellent quality of the paper, are all of a character to afford pleasure; while the astonishing cheapness of price (<hi rend="italic">one dollar per volume</hi>) should place it, not alone in every library but upon the humble shelf of thousands.</p>

                           <hi rend="italic">Studies in General Science,</hi> by Antoinette Brown Blackwell, has recently received a highly favorable review by a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly,</hi> a leading English periodical.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. G. P. Putnam &#x0026; Son, among their forthcoming works, announce Mrs. Hawthorne's "Letters from England and Italy," a book which the public will await with interest.</p>
                        <p>The English press still teems with contributions to the Stowe-Byron controversy, with a settling of opinion in favor of the soundness of Lady Byron's mind, which has been so assailed by the detractors from the weight of Mrs. Stowe's article.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, it is said, is engaged upon a work of fiction, of a reformatory character, to be issued the coming winter. If this announcement be correct, the thorough identification of Mrs. Howe with reform, and her pre-eminent ability as a writer, will lead the public to expect a rare treat in the forthcoming work from her pen.</p>
                        <p>The "Autobiography" of Andrew Jackson Davis has been translated into German, in which tongue it is having a wide circle of readers. It has been reviewed at some length by Rudolf Gottschall, a noted <hi rend="italic">savan,</hi> who accords to
<pb n="200 The Woman's Advocate."/>
it great ability, while denying that more than human significance should be ascribed to its experiences or the teachings of the writer.</p>
                        <p>A work which is receiving more than ordinary attention abroad, is "The Brook-Miller and his Daughter-in-law," a romance in the Esthonian language, published at Dorpat. The author is Lydia Jansen, a young lady of twenty. The critics who are able to read the book, are enthusiastic in its praise, for power and chasteness of language. The Esthonian is properly a branch of the Finnish tongue, but, unlike the latter, it possesses very little literature.</p>

A WALK OVER THE HOMESTEAD.</head>
                           <p>ABOUT forty years ago, one sunny February morning, a young husband and wife stood on the door step, looking off into the distance with dreamy eyes which indicated that neither saw anything of the pleasant, glittering landscape which lay spread out before them. Pleasant and glittering it was, however, as though the whole earth had become one fairy land of pearls, in honor of the bride who had come only last evening to the home of her bridegroom. The low, brown eaves over their heads were hung with long, sparkling pendants, a slender unpainted trough, which came down to the side of the house, was turned into a grand, dark band with a transparent diamond veneering; terminating in a reversed tower of solid, massive diamonds; and the whole dingy house-front was over-laid with mother-of-pearl. Scattered about the yard were shrubs and two or three trees, all nodding and laughing to each other in their new suit of holiday brilliants, and off in the distance lay a wide, rolling plain of forest and field, dotted with occasional houses; all resplendent enough in the morning warmth and sunshine for some outlying province of the celestial country.</p>
                           <p>The bride, in a neatly quilted hood, a half-worn, warm shawl, and a stuff dress already less fresh in color than when she bad first made it up; and the bridegroom in the just coming thread-bareness of his second best; both so fresh, and plump, and hopeful, were quite in keeping with all the unwonted radiance about them. But the grave, absorbed look on both young faces was not that of simple lovers,
<pb n="206 The Woman's Advocate."/>
each tenderly absorbed in the other. Their four days wedded life had already budded out into the practical consideration of mutual interests.</p>
                           <p>"The mortgage you say was just eleven hundred dollars, John; but how much back interest is there?"</p>
                           <p>"Well! I don't know exactly;" stepping out into the path, and with his restless heel crushing a magnificent pane of glass which the winter gardener had lately placed there to let the morning light into the dark earth below. "I havn't added it up lately; but I suppose a hundred or two dollars or more. It runs up so fast; and we've cut off a good deal of the large timber already to keep it down."</p>
                           <p>The bride stepped out also into the yard, and their eyes went together over the little farm which lay on both sides of them. "No! there is not much more wood to spare," she replied, musingly.</p>
                           <p>"We'll do the best we can together, now, Susy, to clear it off. Mother and I never spent when we could help it; but I was only a child when father died, and the mortgage was on the place then; and somehow I don't think either of us know very well how to manage. You don't feel quite discouraged, Susy?" He looked up and scanned her face inquiringly, and with a tender solicitude.</p>
                           <p>"Oh no! indeed, John;" and a smile of hope and confidence beamed from her eyes, which shed more sunshine over John's heart than a whole sky full had done before. "We are both young, and we're not afraid of work. Besides, I always had to save and manage at home, you know. It will be ever so much easier here! I only want to know just how it is, John. Your farm ends with the fence over yonder on that side doesn't it? and with that little wood in the other direction ?"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, Susy, <hi rend="italic">our</hi> farm ends with that fence and that wood, only thirty-five acres now. Since you adopt me, you must take the farm, and the debts, and all."</p>
                           <p>"No very hard task that, Johnniekin!" laughed Susan, springing from a leaning rail to the top of a low fence which they had approached, and reaching up to the over-hanging bough of a tree.</p>
                           <p>The sun had been shining to some purpose. A shower of loosened gems came tumbling about them at her touch, and a long slab of silver separated from tile rail, falling with a tinkling crash upon the sheet of silver below.</p>
                           <p>"That's the music of Spring, John. We shall have none too much time to get fairly started with the Spring work. How much land was there before mother sold any?" jumping over into the next field, followed by John.</p>
                           <p>"She sold off a twelve acre wood lot; that cleared land just over yonder. There was no one to cut it for us; and we got a pretty good price. The interest was lagging and we had to put up a barn. The old one had nearly tumbled down, and was so small."</p>
                           <pb n="207 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>"And how much is the store debt you spoke of?" The wife slipped her arm within her husband's; speaking as softly as she might have done if she had asked after a lost friend.</p>
                           <p>"Nearly seventy dollars;" answered John. "Groceries, you know, and everything; but there's grain enough to more than pay for that; and vegetables."</p>
                           <p>"Yes. Anything else, John?" gently caressing the hand which she had taken into her own.</p>
                           <p>"Not much, Susy. Just a few dollars here and there. Does it seem such a great deal?"</p>
                           <p>"Not if we meet it face to face, as we will! We've a good deal of corn left, haven't we, and rye, and salt pork?"</p>
                           <p>"Oh yes, plenty." They walked on silently a few minutes.</p>
                           <p>"This is nice land, isn't it? We can make a capital market garden of it!"</p>
                           <p>"Do you think so?" The husband opened his eyes very wide at first; looking about him with new interest and doubtful assent; and ended by fixing them upon Susy's face with a glow of warm admiration. They were mild brown eyes, and the cheeks bronzed with Summer suns had not bleached yet with the Winter's snow; but were still brown, ruddy and comely. Susan was fair-faced, blue-eyed, tall and well built; and they formed as pleasant a picture of a young American yeoman and his wife, taking their first walk over the ancestral acres, as one need wish for. Susan's gentle persuasive tones were very grateful to the ear, and yet there was an emphasis in them as though two notes were blended in one--the deeper tone representing a groundwork of clear conviction which was not to be easily shaken.</p>
                           <p>"If this field were taken in hand first, it would bring large returns almost at once. Do you know I have a plan already, Johnniekin, and you must let me carry it out." Her eyes looked up coaxingly into his, smiling, while the glow deepened, on her cheek, and there was just a slight falter in the voice as she spoke. I want to turn market woman next Summer and sell the vegetables and the fruit. I see there is a large asparagus bed already, and there ought to be a great many cherries in the Spring, and peaches in the Fall, if it is a good fruit year, and there'll be no end of wild blackberries and such things out there in the clearing. One way and another we can find things enough to help us a great deal. I like to weed in a vegetable patch. I should like it always if you were working in the next row."</p>
                           <p>"Oh, Susy, don't!" cried the young husband, looking pained. "I didn't marry you to drudge like that! You may come and see me in the fields; but mother is getting old and feeble. You will have enough to do in the house."</p>
                           <pb n="208 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"We'll both help mother. I'll do up the work in the morning before I go, and you can wipe the dishes for me in the evening, as you did last night when we came home and knew that mother was tired enough already. Your mother says you were always the best boy in the world and helped her a great deal in the house. It will be nice to work together. If you are not ashamed of woman's work then I'm not ashamed of man's work;" and Susan looked up bravely. "You'll see!" shaking her head and looking in John's eyes bewitchingly resolute. Then speaking low and with an undertone of deep feeling: "I'm going to do it, John, till we clear off all the debts and the mortgage. It will do us good, both of us."</p>
                           <p>A mist came over John's eyes, a cloud darkened his face. "Dear Susy, if I was only rich or a moneymaker!"</p>
                           <p>"Money grows, John, at least I know it will on this farm. We'll try it and plant the right seed." She spoke in a ringing, singing tone, which he had never heard before, keeping time with her feet as she stood before him. "You know we are bound to leave the dear old homestead without encumbrances to-to-somebody coming all in good time." And with a little, laugh the brave young wife, who knew how to meet debts "face to face," ran forward into a copse beyond to continue a more careful survey of the rather tumble-down fences.</p>

HOME.</head>
                           <p>"MOTHER let me pare the potatoes for dinner! I know how to make a capital Johnny-cake. Shall I try today?"</p>
                           <p>"If you like, Susan; but I'm not much used to being helped all the time. If you don't mind, I'd rather not give up work. There'll be plenty of sewing for you. There always is. Patching and darning are as unfailing as sunshine. I often wonder what industrious women would find to do in the odd hours if Eve hadn't eaten the apple and made her children take to wearing the clothes which keep our fingers so busy." </p>
                           <p>"I can't imagine, I am sure; but I suppose that in her time idleness hadn't become the mother of Mischief. Does John like corn-bread ?" </p>
                           <p>"Oh yes, rather." </p>
                           <p>"And rye?"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, sometimes;" spoken rather doubtfully. "Why, Susan?"</p>
                           <p>"Because I like them, and John and I ought to eat from the same cake. Isn't that the old rule?"</p>
                           <p>"I guess he'll do it heartily enough!" said the old lady, while a queer smile
<pb n="209 The Market Woman."/>
puckered up her wrinkled face. She was a tidy, not very old lady, in a plain white cap with a wide border, a dark calico dress, and an immense checked apron. Her hand was shriveled on the outside and horny on-the inside; but it was always an open hand, free and generous in all things. She was constitutionally a poor economist and a good mother. To her son, she had till now been all in all. She had a nice motherly look, with an amplitude of person suggestive of restfulness and comfort; and breadth of mind sufficient to take the only son's wife into her heart at once.</p>
                           <p>"John;" she asked, looking up with the same quaint smile as her son entered, "Will you promise to eat half the Johnny-cake, if Susan makes one and I don't like it?"</p>
                           <p>"Half? oh yes! I promise always to share half and half with Susan in everything, down to the meat and drink."</p>
                           <p>"It's a rash promise, John!" said Susan, turning towards him as she went on stirring up the golden batter.</p>
                           <p>"Is it though? Try me!" retorted the jovial young farmer. "I will take anything which you do, whether it's as short as pie-crust or as tough as shoe-leather. Give me a test then, and see;" as she shook her head. "I promise blindfolded."</p>
                           <p>"Will you? Will you eat the bread that I eat, and drink the cup that I drink. Don't promise; for I shall certainly take advantage of you!"</p>
                           <p>"There, then! don't make a serious thing of it, children!" said the mother as she went in search of something in the next room.</p>
                           <p>"I promise, Susy, and seal the contract so;" stooping till his lips left a cluster of kisses on the white forehead.</p>
                           <p>"But it's something really very hard, dear, and you won't like it. I don't want to entrap you."</p>
                           <p>"Well, I say again, try me, Sue!"</p>
                           <p>"Then I promise not to taste tea or coffee, or to eat wheat bread, or butter, or sugar, or cream, in our own house until after the mortgage is paid off."</p>
                           <p>John gasped, and nodded without speaking, while Susan turned to the stove, depositing the corn-cake in the oven. Then she returned to him with a saucy face. "I'll let you off still, John, if you say so. One must make promises with his eyes open."</p>
                           <p>"Rather steep, Susy!" he began with a grimace, put on to hide some deeper feeling. "But what of <hi rend="italic">Mother?"</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Oh, mother must have everything she has been accustomed to; with a few luxuries added now and then when the marketing goes right. But you and I are
<pb n="210 The Woman's Advocate."/>
young John; we shall soon get used to it, and I can toss up a great many nice things with what we raise on the farm. I wish it was possible never to eat or wear anything which we couldn't produce ourselves. That would tell in the end, and how much better than having a sheriff's sale always hanging over our heads, ready to fall upon us whenever we are sick or unfortunate or in any trouble so that the weight will be sure to crush us!"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, Susy, I promise heartily; but won't that do without the market plan? I had rather do the marketing and work by moonlight to make up the time lost at home."</p>
                           <p>"No! no! Johnniekin; the moonlight is always sacred to lovers! That won't do. We couldn't get through a day's work without an evening's leisure. Why, John, the marketing will do me good. I need go only in the warm weather, and women always get mopish by staying at home too much. Why you are not afraid to trust me, are you, John?" looking into his face with a demure mock gravity.</p>
                           <p>"Bless you, Susan! I've trusted you with heart and soul, and I don't think you would cheat me by keeping yours back in the exchange. But market women are always a coarse set!"</p>
                           <p>"Then I'll be an exception. I'll keep the market stall as tidy as mother does the kitchen here, and my apron shall be as clean as hers. But that's not all, John. There are a great many <hi rend="italic">very nice</hi> market men!" With this Parthian shot Susan went to turn the cake in the stone oven, laughing into it meantime with the shrewd consciousness that John would be ashamed to seem to mistrust her prudence, and that her point was virtually won.</p>
                           <p>The generous girl had thrown all her interests into the new home, and was honestly intent upon retrieving the steadily failing fortunes of the family, which seemed to have long been in a chronic state of decline, and were now near reaching a serious crisis. It may be too that there was a spark of ambition in her future schemes. She had a consciousness of business capacities which she was eager to exercise, and she thoroughly despised the trifling occupations of many women. Her steady convictions carried weight with them and in the end prevailed.</p>
                           <p>"When I find time to cut up nice calico into little diamonds to make stars in bed quilts, mother;" she said one day, "I go out instead, and dig in the garden for gold. Queer people are always digging for gold, and sometimes they find it."</p>
                           <p>The mother-in-law smiled, well pleased. She liked her new daughter; but after all her son was her own son, and if their fortunes were too low to keep a hired man, she was relieved to have some one help the poor boy. He worked so
<pb n="211 The Market Woman."/>
much more cheerfully with Susan at his side, and as Susan, like a sunbeam, seemed always active and never tired, the three soon fell into the new order of things as though there had never been any other; and Susan worked outside of he house far more than within.</p>
                           <p>The old garden was dug deeply, enriched as it had not been before since the days of Adam, planted early and planted well, with a large variety of seeds; everything perennial was worked about and daintily fed, and the whole gave early promise of being a fixed, marketable nucleus. Then the chosen field was taken in hand in like manner, and in time the long rows of vegetables came peeping up green and thrifty, over-topping the red-brown earth in conscious beauty. Susan had already churned many rolls of tempting butter; but she and John ate coarse bread and the buttermilk, and called it delicious. Faith can remove mountains; but Hope can remove privations; and Love has a philosopher's stone of its own, which substitutes delightful privileges.</p>
                           <p>A new energy had entered into the whole household; but oddly enough it was shared by every live thing on the farm. The chickens never laid so many or such large eggs, the pigs never grew so fast or seemed so appreciative of cleanliness, the cows never gave so much or so creamy milk; so that the amount of butter was something fabulous; the calves never grew so fast though they were fed on warmed skim-milk at three days old, the horses did more and better work, yet they never looked so plump, sleek, and handsome in all their lives before. Early salads and early pease, spinach, pie-plants, currants, cucumbers, and cabbage; and all the great family of roots to a tuber, shared in the unwonted vitality. The whole outlying precinct of barn-yard and its environs had become a good deal littered and untidy--this was scraped nicely clean and the refuse buried in field or garden, the loose floor of the old barn was taken up, the rich mould which had been gathering beneath it for fifty years was worked in amongst the small fruits and asparagus, and the floor replaced more securely and snugly than before. The persevering leak in the house roof was conquered, loose-principled clap-boards here and there were reclaimed, and even the fences looked as much improved as a German does after he has reached the crisis of transfering the customary beer money into a replenished wardrobe.</p>
                           <p>All this was mainly accomplished by two heads and four hands with the necessary tools; assisted sometimes by two half-grown sons of a neighboring farmer, who on the whole preferred work and small wages to sitting still and over much study.</p>
                           <p>"It is a very nice place, mother;" said Susan, as she came in one day hot and tired and stood looking out, leaning upon the closed lower half of the old-time door, split in two at the middle.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="212 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           </p>
                           <p>A pleasant landscape it was and is, as many New York business men have learned since then; but whether Susan thought of the pretty view or only of the snug little farm itself is not apparent. Her day's stint was ended, and she was more than usually content. Something of sunset comfort, and it may be of beauty, had stolen into her heart.</p>
                           <p>"Everything is growing so well! If I had time enough, I think I would watch one day to see them grow. Somewhere among the little, young, green things, which shoot up an inch in an hour or two, don't you think I could catch a sight of it really pushing out? It would be nice to try, and I shall when I get a play day! Wouldn't you, mother?" she said, turning to the old lady with a childish caressing movement.</p>
                           <p>The mother's eyes moistened. She smiled and shook her head. "That's a gift even beyond you, child. But 'tis a nice place, Susan. I came to it as young and hopeful as you are, though it has changed enough since then; but many times I have thought that maybe I should not lay down to my last sleep here, as my husband did and his father before him. It seemed slipping away from us! You have changed all that, or will in time, if you are spared and go on as you begin. I don't understand it; but the garden looks as different from ever before as a moss rose does from a wild briar. It never came into my head to take hold as you do!"</p>
                           <p>"You see I am stronger than you, mother; and it's easy to work with John, who always saves me from everything hard. And then it is you who take the burden of the house-work or I couldn't do the other?"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, we all help."</p>
                           <p>"It's <hi rend="italic">growth</hi> of ever thing which does it after all. I couldn't work so for anything that wasn't alive, and wouldn't go on and double itself over and over."</p>
                           <p>"Ah, you have it hard enough, both of you; your face is as red now as a lobster, And when you came in first you might have been rubbing it with my scarlet petticoat. It was just the color of it!"</p>
                           <p>"If you knew how I pity you, who must cook something to be eaten up the next hour; and wash the dishes without seeing them grow after all your care. There is nothing like gardening, nothing;" laughed Susan, half in joke and half in earnest.</p>
                           <p>"I must say I don't like the market plan, Susan. And I can't like it! It makes our way of going on so public!"</p>
                           <p>"Whoever wins may laugh, mother. Let's try it at least."</p>
                           <p>"It will mortify John dreadfully, and at bottom I know you don't like it either."</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="213 The Market Woman."/>
                           </p>
                           <p>"I don't know that! I want to do something and that will be easier than working in the garden all the time, and pay better. Next year we shall want two or three men, and John can superintend them a great deal better than I can."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, that's so."</p>
                           <p>A half smile stole to the girl's face as she leapt a little farther out, plucking a lilac leaf. "You'll see how very discreet and dignified I shall be, mother, and when we get used to it we shall all be reconciled."</p>
                           <p>Maybe, maybe!" repeated the poor old lady, nervously and doubtfully. She was thinking of sharp-tongued and sharp-eyed neighbors, and shrunk from losing caste in her old age. Her independent daughter-in-law made her ashamed to admit her real feelings; but they had been rankling and corroding her heart for weeks. She sat silent and unconvinced.</p>
                           <p>"A door opening in this way, half at a time, is a real comfort;" began Susan by way of breaking up the unpleasant musing. "I like it better than a window."</p>
                           <p>"You'll find it convenient when there are children creeping about the floor," retorted the old lady pointedly, as if she were tartly putting together two and two in thought and speech. She glanced keenly sidewise into the daughter's face to scan the rising flush.</p>
                           <p>"Yes, I suppose so," was the cool reply. "It saved poor John many a time from a tumble down the steps, I suppose. He told me about climbing on a chair and trying to swing out over the top."</p>
                           <p>"I don't understand how all that will agree with the marketing;" were the words just rising sharply to the withered lips; but at the mention of this long-ago feat of John's, which came so near terminating in grave disaster, the ice melted from the old motherly heart, and the old lady began at once to relate the deeds and prowess of her child in the years long ago. So a dew drop may extinguish the smouldering embers, or a puff of air fan them into flames.</p>
                           <p>Speaker and listener were alike interested in the narratives which followed, and when the hero himself appeared, both women had resolved anew always to forgive and forget; and to bear and forbear each with the other's cherished wishes, even if need be to her own hurt.</p>

SETTING OUT.</head>
                           <p>THE market wagon stood at the door in the early morning. It was a long, single-horse wagon, with a covered top, black and shining; a well-conditioned horse stood in the shafts, and vegetables, butter and eggs were snugly packed away inside; the whole establishment looking thoroughly nice and respectable.</p>
                           <pb n="214 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>It had been fitted up from an almost disused, shaky old wagon, which bad been re-tired by the blacksmith, and re-topped by the united skill of the whole family. Of course it came out as many another such establishment has done before and since--a highly creditable specimen of home-made manufacture.</p>
                           <p>Susan stood in the door-way wearing a dark, print dress, a neat shawl, and a pink calico sun-bonnet--a hood they called it; but it was starched stiffly and came well over in front, partially shading the cheery face beneath. "To-morrow morning, mother, I shall help you to do up the work before I go;" glancing at the table which was standing in the background, in the uninviting state that most tables present when thrifty people with wholesome appetite have cleared away nearly everything eatable.</p>
                           <p>"Don't think of it, Susan. If there is nothing to do, I shall be lonesome enough while you are away."</p>
                           <p>"There will always be dinner to get, mother, and the ride will give me a topping appetite. Take care you have enough," looking and speaking as though the dinner were to be the sole reward for the morning's toll.</p>
                           <p>"There'll be plenty of potatoes, skim milk and Johnny-cake," retorted the old lady, with a grim effort at pleasantry. She had fallen into the way of eating these things largely herself, in spite of all protest; and her tea got weaker and weaker, and was put to steep half an hour beforehand whenever she made it herself, and she covered up the fact with miserly craft. There is nothing half as infectious as a hearty self-sacrifice! You might as well try to keep a sunflower from catching the sunshine as to keep anybody from sunning and brightening himself under its steady warmth.</p>
                           <p>The mother-in-law felt on this occasion rather more like tears than smiles, though the best outlet for her present mood would have been a grand outbreak of general scolding; but she was deterred from this for very shame. It was only May and scarcely three months since the stranger first crossed her threshold. She had entertained her kindly for her son's sake, often crushing back the maternal jealousy of the supplanter, but she knew now that she had entertained the guardian angel of the homestead unawares. Now she was going out day after day alone to meet the endless friction of a huckster's but little respected calling and the old lady understood perfectly that it wag not all for herself. But if Susan could only have found some other way of helping them! Must it be just this way, and no other? Thus she tasted the waters of bitterness; but with the consciousness of being a recipient of the good to be secured, she checked even the thought and still more its expression. She began also to have some dawning appreciation of the fact that possibly even a market woman might be born and not made; so she bade her kinswoman God-speed as resignedly as she might.</p>
                           <pb n="215 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>Susan had purposely left the unwashed dishes; for she knew that this first day would be a trying one to mother and perhaps a little also to John; who really felt a good deal as a guilty man must who should see an innocent person going away to punishment for his crime. Little to him was the thought of what the neighbors would say. His wife and his mother were his world, and everyone outside could hardly weigh it down in the balance; but he felt as any tender and generous soul must feel when yielding under protest to be benefited by the sacrifice of another, because circumstances beyond his own control made this inevitable. Susan's steady purpose was too inflexible for him to cope with it. An apple as it mellows and reddens under the influence which comes up to it with the inflowing sap cannot repel the charity. Susan's feelings and temperament seemed to be getting mingled with his own confusedly by some process of new but stimulating circulation.</p>
                           <p>Besides his reason was convinced of the wisdom of the market scheme; but not his heart. So he took the cup she offered him like a stoic; as I think he would have taken it knowing it had been filled with the old Socratic hemlock, if offered with the same smiling perseverance. Undoubting faith in one self must always command allegiance from others.</p>
                           <p>"Good-bye, mother! I shall have lots of news to tell you both, and that will be the next best thing to going yourself."</p>
                           <p>"No doubt you will do your best, Susan child; so success to you and a brave heart to the end; Good-bye."</p>
                           <p>"If you should get envious of my privileges, mother, we'll take turns now and then, and you shall be market woman too."</p>
                           <p>The old lady smiled affably, but shook her head. "Not in my old age, Susan. Old people don't like new fancies."</p>
                           <p>"Oh! If you can get time, mother dear, just do look a little after these plants. I see they are drooping, and I may find them dried up and vanished at noon like Jonah's gourds. If you could put up a screen before the sun gets high, unless John has time to do it," turning, suddenly to him, with a wife's remembrance. Susan stepped into the wagon as she stopped speaking, and picked up the reins.</p>
                           <p>"John hasn't time! I'll do It,", said the mother tartly; but with a dim eye.</p>
                           <p>"Don't be lonely, Johnniekin! We shall work together in the afternoon. Good-bye." And the market woman drove slowly out of the yard.</p>
                           <p>"Well, it's done, John. I hope it's for the best," the old mother said in a quavering voice, as the farm-gate swang back to its place.</p>
                           <p>Oh, yes, I'm sure it is. Good-bye, mother." John strode back to the field, occasionally grinding the earth a little with his heel as he went; and when there
<pb n="216. The Woman's Advocate."/>
working all the morning as he had never worked before, determined afresh, it may be, to bear his share of the family burdens.</p>
                           <p>Susan plodded along the new road slowly, mindful of eggs and sundries; but her thoughts ran forward, as thoughts often do, far into the future and back also into the past. Thoughts are Time's telegrams. They can bridge over the chasms of centuries, laying down the telegraph wires as they go along, and outvieing any lightning. But Susan's thoughts were less ambitious and kept much nearer to the present, yet they ruled over space also, sweeping from continent to continent. Her's was a Dutch ancestry, and her own grandmother had been a market woman in the Netherlands. From her childhood up she bad heard honorable mention of those better days of honest toil and traffic. At the mention of that early time, she remembered the sudden lighting up of the old grand-dame's eye even long after it had regained its second sight; and the old quavering and often querulous voice, always grew young again when it recounted any of the pleasant incidents of that coveted past. She knew that those were her grandmother's only prosperous days, and that the sun of her good fortune had set when she gave up her huckster's calling.</p>
                           <p>Her own mother also had often wrought in the fields of the Lowlands, she herself had been born to the truck patch of the new country, the profits of which bad been grudgingly handed over to the market men, to the life-long regret and annoyance of the producers. To her, therefore, the market stall was a golden gate to steady and sure gain. It opened into the only road to competence familiar to her limited experience.</p>
                           <p>Yet she was born and reared in a country where girls had other ideas than these. She had mingled with them in the schools and at the social gatherings, imbibing their thoughts and feelings; and something of shame at her own temerity in becoming an ignored market woman flushed her face when she thought of it. Her heart was beating with strong excitement, and the tears sometimes dimmed her eye as she jogged moodily on. She was quite capable of applying the social tests of the country to her chosen calling, and public opinion seemed closing about her like a nightmare. Before her marriage, she could hardly have made the deliberate sacrifice; but now she was steadied by a strong purpose.</p>
                           <p>Yet those at home were feeling even more keenly than she herself. They had only reluctantly consented, and if she had been aware from the first of the strength of the almost silent opposition, and of all the hot and bitter feelings which it represented, even as she did now, she felt in her soul that she might have been overborne in her purpose. But happily now it was all ended. Her market outfit was a tangible fact. Her stall was already engaged, she and her

husband had been together and settled everything, and she was even now drawing near to the new duties of her first market day. The half corduroy roads always rough, were now also muddy; and as she approached the city she was rather glad to be obliged to steer carefully in the midst of deep ruts, and to have a pretty constant demand made upon her attention by her various crocks, baskets and boxes. If her face was flushed, all that might be a reflection of the pink sunbonnet. She thought of the old brown farm-house, whose once fresh paint, white on the road side and red on the back, was now alike dingy; and of the eleven hundred dollar mortage with its terrible arrears of back interest, suspended over their heads like the sword of Damocles, hanging only by a single hair; and she drove herself on, wearing a quiet, staid smile, like one resolute on her way to seek her fortune.</p>

                        <head>THE MEETING OF THE WATERS.</head>
                        <p>OF the Reforms at present agitating the Community, three stand out pre-eminent: These are the movement for the Liberty of Woman, the Temperance Reform, and the Rights of Laborers. There is no reason why the advocates of these great movements should not unite their forces, and there are good reasons for presuming that policy will induce them to do so. It may be said that the first steps to coalition have already been taken, for the right of women to represent and be represented has been fully conceded by the Labor Union and it is almost impossible to successfully run a Labor Paper unless it advocates also the cause of Temperance.</p>
                        <p>There is also a singularity connected with all these movements which consists in the fact, that the members upholding them are now beginning to find out their true strength lies rather in elevating or seeking to elevate the oppressed, for whom they are now doing battle, than in attacking the oppressor. This is the true Christian method of procedure. Thus the stalwart Artisan of the North finds his strength in associating with himself the cruelly wronged Agriculturist of the South; the reform of Inebriates more powerfully advances the cause of Temperance than the denunciation of Rumsellers, and the virtuous Matron, who abhors the sin, may yet prove that the stoutest weapon in her armory of truth will be " her CHARITY to the Sinner."</p>
                        <pb n="218 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>In addition, it may be stated that they are now all entering, with banners flying, upon the field of Politics. Those women are to be pitied, who are incapable of perceiving, that, in the various Reforms already projected for the benefit of Woman, the Ballot is the only method by which such can be accomplished. The Advocates of Temperance, in General Convention at Chicago, have decreed to throw their gage of battle into the lists, and have already opened the war in Maine. The Labor Unionists at Philadelphia have also come to the conclusion that it is now expedient to test their power also at the polls, and consequently they have commenced the battle in Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>There is yet a third peculiarity distinguishing these great Reforms which is also well worth noticing. It is, that neither of these great movements is nationally bounded, each being almost as extensive as enlightened civilization. Not only counties and States but mighty Nations are calling to one another and cheering each other forward in these grand efforts for the regeneration of mankind. In September last, American Delegates, properly authorized by the National Labor Congress, were deputed to represent the Workingmen of the United States at the European International Labor Congress held at Basle in Switzerland; a closer alliance has been demanded and is being cemented between the Sons and Daughters of Temperance of the Old and New continents; Americans delight to honor the memory of Father Matthew, and Englishmen glory in the eloquence of John Gough; while to carry forward the International Interests of the Woman's Movement, six delegates (Julia Ward Howe, Laura C. Bullard, Kate N. Doggett, Mary J. Safford, Mary Peckenpaugh, and Ernestine L. Rose) are appointed to confer with their European sisters in the Industrial Congress which has been called to meet in the capital of Prussia.</p>
                        <p>These harmonious gatherings of representatives of the nations of the earth appear like a commencement of that "Solidarity of the Peoples," so long wished for by the Hungarian patriot, Louis Kossuth. When that takes place, and surely it is even now rapidly approaching, it needs no prophet to foretell that wars will be fewer, red tape cheaper, and eight hour laws will not be made to be broken, but to be enforced by those officials who are paid by the people for the performance of such duties.</p>
                        <pb n="219 The Meeting of the Waters."/>
                        <p>It is no wonder, that, under these circumstances, the old political party hacks and wire-pullers are, as the saying is, "all abroad." True, they are beginning to recognize dimly that their vocation is one, and that the people, of both sexes, have discarded them as advisers, and are commencing to think and act for themselves. The Daily Press (with some honorable exceptions) subsidized by the powers that be, perceives the advances of the armies of the Reformers, and neither knows how to advise its patrons, or how to act itself in the crisis. The best it can do for its supporters is to abuse Temperance as Tyranny, to sneer at the reasons of those Women it cannot otherwise answer, and to ignore as much as it dares, the doings of the Labor Reformers now agitating America and England.</p>
                        <p>But, in the meantime, these moral storms, so long gathering, are beginning to darken the face of creation. Even those who have followed with awe the shining footprints of the Deity through our last great war, and seen the modern Israelites again led into liberty by the pillars of Smoke and Fire, have reason to tremble lest "Tekel" be written upon their labors for the good of mankind. This will not be, however, if, when they lay their gifts upon the altar, there be found in them no enmity of heart against their brethren, but only abhorrence of the crimes it is a Christian duty to make all efforts to remove.</p>
                        <p>It may be said of our country that here the second grand curse, viz., "that of Confusion of Tongues," is rapidly becoming a myth of the past. Thus here is again exhibited a Pentecostal gathering of the peoples of all nations, who rapidly melt their peculiarities in our Union, and speedily become, if not yet of one accord, of one speech. The international courtesies heralding and advancing the great and good Reforms above specified are simply an extension of such Christian influences, and are destined eventually to obliterate all the woes of humanity. Not only individually, but nationally and universally, will His word be made good, who still cries unto all who are oppressed--whether they be Laborers defrauded of their hire, Women starved into crime in our cities, or Children over-tasked in mines and factories--"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." </p>

                        <head>HONOR.</head>
                        <p>As the face we love is always near, and, at first glance, each passing form suggests it, so ideal excellence appears at the sight of an heroic word. Honor! In its aspect high and beautiful, noble kindred come to mind. Integrity, Forbearance, Delicacy, Charity, Courage: venerable articles of the sacred constitution which is our organic law.</p>
                        <p>All stars lead our vision to the sky, but each has its own light: as Aldebaran his fiery splendor, Lyra her violet ray. Honor, born of moral strength, responds to the claims of weakness. Consideration for the feeble is the germ of this stately flower which blooms, like Milton's amaranth, "fast by the throne." Meanness ensnares the ignorant; Honor shews the clue and snaps the chain. Meanness breaks the bruised reed; Honor raises those who fall. Meanness, lurking, counts upon surprise and fear with a cruel joy; Honor, strangling the snake, prolongs the free bird's song. Honor strengthens, aids, advises, to its own hurt, shall I say? No, but to immense mutual advantage. It scorns one-sided gain, rejects acquisition wrung from want, abhors indulgence stolen by temptation; but it wins the love of suffering souls, shares the guerdon for which Jesus died, and attains the very highest gladness,--happiness in making happy. This is the serene felicity of the Most High. We are placed here side by side, weak and unwise; yet each endowed with a kind of strength and degree of discretion somewhere and sometime
<pb n="222 The Woman's Advocate"/>
available. To bear the torch and wield the lance, loyally, at our king's behest, in behalf of the frailer and more ignorant, is Honor's privilege. It is the manly effort of the comparatively strong; the saintly office of the comparatively wise.</p>
                        <p>If you and I, my friend, with Honor for our counsellor, look forth upon familiar things, we shall lose much century and national vanity and be incited to unwonted vigilance quite near home. What might not Honor teach us of the Freedman? a citizen by sufferance, his ballot <hi rend="italic">Ient</hi> not given: of the Indian? what there is left of him which we have not consumed: of the Chinaman ? timidly tolling on our Pacific coast with face turned towards home, kept an alien by our injustice. What might not Honor say about the common texture of our public spirit, of the ordinary motives of our public men? of the frequent practices of trade ? of the comparative dividends to money and to toil, to shrewdness and to industry, to monopoly and to merit? of the candor of ordinary speech and silence on fundamental theories and practices, or as to the frankness of common intercourse? What, as to thoughtfulness and faithfulness between employers and employed? What, of the paid and forgotten heathen of the kitchen and the garret? And what of that domestic spectre which the noblest minds among us may have thought of least, yet the thought of which for half an hour must make us blush and burn; the frequent conviction, the very general assumption that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> whom each husband has vowed to honor is and must be his inferior? that he has a claim upon her service and self-sacrifice which she has not upon his, and, in every sense of the ignoble words, that his will should be her law?</p>
                        <p>Nature's sweet influences assert their power. The implanted tendency in our mental make is to a just sentiment of equal and considerate regard. But what must be the dreadful exceptions, where this cruel and dishonorable assumption bears its fruit of tyranny and woe? Think of the shocking items of each day's newspaper, telling of brutal wilfulness so prolonged and intolerable that the wife appeals to the coarse interposition of the police or drops her mangled body for the coroner to interpret her mute plea or with frantic dread seeks refuge in suicide when, hopeless of human aid, she springs vaguely at the grim chance of fate or the possible mercy of an unknown God. "Horrible exceptions!" Yes, thanks to Heaven's unconquerable limitations by the kind charities
<pb n="223 Honor."/>
of nature but no thanks to the base theory. Its ripened fruit can be none other than such "apples of Sodom."</p>
                        <p>Between the hard decorum of conscientious "headship," which freezes Mrs. ditto's married life, and the grumbling tyranny which threatens and, knocks down "my woman," how many grades of gross assumption and wretched submission intervene! Some husbands cherish the respectful deference of courtship undiminished in their wedded life. But many, perhaps, having never really felt the respect they once affected, drop even the poor counterfeit. And how many who in the generous hope of first attachment, sincerely promised themselves to make the highest mental development and perfection of the fair girl they sought, equally with their own, the leading object of future life, have failed even to try to make that promise good.</p>
                        <p>When a man by years of effort has garnered their normal harvest, wealth, influence, consideration has he meanwhile schemed and wrought to lead with equal step into his enlarging sphere of power or of usefulness, her, who through those years shared his narrower circumstances with never faltering love? She, faithful to their mutual vow, has planned and endured for him. Has he considered the incessant exactions of the family duties they assumed together? Has he guarded her health, and rest, meeting her half way in every sacrifice and self-denial? Has he labored for her mental progress, and sought to help her to a full participation in the acquisitions of his own experience? Has he really <hi rend="italic">honored</hi> his wife as he would wish to have been honored were their individualities and positions exchanged ? If he has done less than this, though true to others he has been false to his wife. He has surely failed to redeem that debt, beyond all others one of honor, which he assumed when, in the solemnest of all his pledges, he surrendered all to her as literally and utterly as she to him.</p>
                        <p>Love prompts the wife's unselfish devotion to her husband's welfare. Honor and love together prompt the husband's unselfish devotion to her good. For nature and usage both favor him with immunities and facilities which Honor urges him to make good to her with conscientious care.</p>
                        <p>Until this just equality of husband and wife be advocated in theory and exemplified in practice by worthy and religious people, as a recog-

nized moral duty, how can the relation become ennobled among those who shape their actions by no law, but blindly pattern on the common prejudice? From a bad theory they can only deduce a worse practice. The common law with its <hi rend="italic">"femme couverte"</hi> tends to extinguish the wife. The common morality with its family "headship" tends to dethrone the mother. Of course the common prejudice despises womankind.</p>
                        <p>The aggregate dishonor in man and the aggregate suffering in woman, born of this heathen creed, none can know till the secrets of all hearts stand revealed. And who can estimate the injury, largely wrought by this unmanly sentiment, on some erratic intellects, followed by a baser crowd with whom it has brought the dear tie of marriage into disrepute and has even ranged some womanly hearts against that law of inseparable union which gleams with the benison of Christ--the Woman's Friend. It is not for man's convenience mainly that nature sets our race in families. It is for ultimate and universal good that the equal union of one with one glitters in the New Testament, a characteristic star.</p>
                        <p>Honor awakens Honor. Give and it shall be given unto you; good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over will men give into your bosom." So will women! "With what measure we mete withal it shall be measured to you again." And still it is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>

                        <p>THE question is often asked: How would you like to see your mother, your wife, or your sister at the Polls? Seen darkly through the glass of distance the appearance, to some eyes, is not enchanting ; but "face to face," as we recently had opportunity to observe it, it is less appalling.</p>
                        <p>In a remote Michican village, a few of the most intelligent women, readers of the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi>, WOMAN'S ADVOCATE, etc., having found that the Law recognized all residents in the School District, possessing taxable property, as legal voters in the School Meeting concluded to avail themselves of the acknowledgment. On the evening of the first Monday in September the school-room was
<pb n="225 Woman Suffrage, Seen As a Fact."/>
well filled; and a very noticeable feature of the assembly, was the disposal of its members. On one side of the room sat the <hi rend="italic">time-honored</hi> and <hi rend="italic">time-serving</hi> voters, bearded and bloated, for the most part an ignorant school-opposing set, headed by the proprietor of the hotel, (a liquor establishment); on the other side sat the ladies, with the more gentlemanly men. After questions of school interest were discussed, when put to the vote, the votes of the ladies were not challenged, until after they were deposited, a very significant point, as it, showed the spirit of opposition, and at the same time the powerlessness of the opposers. As successive measures were put to the ballot test, the women with one accord sustained the liberal and progressive; until at last one of the inebriated ignorant foreigners, shouted in that voice. of "thunder," so highly eulogized by the. Rev, Dr. Bushnell, "women agin! women agin!" The only response made to the intimated sneer, was when several motions, for limited outlay and short school terms, having been made and sustained by the lowest men present, one gentleman cried "whiskey again!" thus bringing out very clearly one point of opposition.</p>
                        <p>Some may say that this is very trivial, there being so wide a step between balloting at a school meeting, and casting a vote for a Governor or a President. Yet those will scarcely be able to say it who have so long indulged in toasting our Common Schools as the "Pillars of the Republic." The act of voting in both cases remains the same, and in a country where the Director of a School District may become President there is no incongruity in the thought that those who may vote him into the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> may as well sustain his claim to the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> office.</p>
                        <p>From this one school meeting we gain one fact and two questions. In this instance, not the coarse and ignorant women were the ones to first avail themselves of the Law, (a fear is often expressed that they would be), but the most intelligent and refined ladies in the community. Every District holds two classes, beside the competent, school-loving men. One composed of men who never think of entering the school-room, but at one time and for one purpose: Time--Annual Meeting: Purpose--To oppose every liberal outlay, and every measure of progress. The other, composed of intelligent women who will resist no outlay beneficial to the school, even though it involve a taxation which will demand

sacrifice of no ordinary character. Which is the better qualified? Which the better right to guide the school? Shall we more reverently listen to whiskey-breathing, oath-laden "thunder" than to Purity and Progression though piped in an ear-offending treble? </p>

I can understand, without sharing the misgivings of those who fear that, when the vote drops from woman's hand into the ballot box, the beauty and sentiment, the bloom and sweetness of womanhood will go with it. But in this matter it seems to me we can trust Nature.

PART THIRD.</head>
                        <p>WHEN the interview which has been recorded closed, neither Marian Eveleth or George De L'Estrange expected to meet again previous to his departure, which was to occur on the following day, but a woof was even then being woven in the web of events, which in a few hours was to bring them face to face, and under circumstances which would forever establish a bond of gratitude and sympathy between them.</p>
                        <p>At a somewhat earlier hour than her wont Marian left, that evening, the work-room of <hi rend="italic">The Universe.</hi> By her instrumentality and unwearied exertions, some months previous a "Woman's Typographical Union," embracing some forty or fifty of the more intelligent girl compositors of the city, had been formed, in which she was deeply interested, and of which she was at that time the President. It was the evening of the regular weekly meeting of the Society, from which nothing but illness ever prevented her attendance, and she hastened her departure to make the needed preparations previous to the time of assemblage. In the earlier days of her working--the days immediately following the "strike," the girls employed upon <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> had suffered not a little persecution and annoyance from the men hitherto engaged as compositors upon the paper, and more than once the friendly interposition of the police had been invoked to shield some belated girl from the indignities of the more worthless, whiskey-drinking street-roamers, who lived literally from "hand to mouth," and never failed to regard the girls as tho cause of their smarting failure--the one obstacle between them and their old, palmy days of monopoly. Still, by leaving early, and securing as much as practical, some protection or companionship, the girls had managed to prevent the commission of any serious outrage; and as time wore away and the employment of women compositors grew to be less of a novelty, the dread of violence or danger from such a source had almost faded from their minds. Marian, naturally of a fearless temperament, although, through her leadership and established influence over those of her sex, the object of many a curse and muttered
<pb n="228 The Woman's Advocate."/>
threat of vengeance, had never betrayed any uneasiness even when the storm of menace lowered most darkly; and the one or two slight assays at intimidation had found her so calm and self-possessed--so ready to foil their efforts, bringing to shame their ignoble attempts at injury, that latterly she had been allowed to pursue the even tenor of her way unmolested. But in the minds of a few of the most desperate--wretches who sully and degrade, as a body, the character of New York compositors--the thought of vengeance had only slept, nursed to a fiercer desire by the lapse of time which they had vainly hoped would have brought failure to the experiment of "Women Compositors,"--and only needed a favorable opportunity for it to give vent to its ferocity.</p>
                        <p>That night, while Marian presided with her accustomed grace and sweetness of manner over the little Society which she had called into being, a small knot of ill-favored men were congregated in the back room of a low groggery--one of the vilest resorts on the East-side of the Metropolis. That it was not merely for the ordinary dissipation of an evening they had assembled, was at a glance evident. Liquors of various kinds, with pipes, were upon the long, coarse table at which they sat, but they were there sparingly, and the carefully closed door leading to the outer drinking room of the notorious "den," and the air of secrecy which marked their deliberations, all betokened something which they did not care should be whispered beyond their little circle.</p>
                        <p>"I tell you, boys," said one of their number, their leader evidently by the respect paid to his opinions, "the job is to be done, upon that we are agreed, and it may as well be put through to-night, as for us to shilly-shally about it as we have for the past six months. A better opportunity Old Nick himself could'nt have furnished us than we have this evening. Pretty Miss is now at that d-d 'Petticoat Society ' which she has hatched out; she'll be on her way to the 'Home' in an hour; the night is as black as a hangman's hat; she'll be all alone, or only have that sickly little shadow of hers, they call Lizzie, with her; we can waylay her at the dark alley by old Mother Crawley's, and--although murder is an ugly thing--if We can't bring her to our terms and make her promise to leave the city, it will be no great harm if the East river does float another body before morning. I tell you, fellows, the girl must be got rid of, and for good! This thing of women compositors-of putty-faced
<pb n="229 Thrown Upon the World."/>
girls sticking their noses into our business must be stopped, or it won't be long before we'll have them in every office in the city and our bread-and-butter be gone beyond the power of all the "Men's Unions" in creation to save it. What do you say? Shall this job we've talked so long about be put through to-night, or shall we just write ourselves <hi rend="italic">sneaks,</hi> and give it up altogether?" </p>
                        <p>The words of the speaker, hissed out with the venom of baffled rage, and accompanied by an irony of Manner which was not lost upon his companions, had the desired effect; and drinking a bumper around to the success of their nefarious enterprise, they passed into the outer room, settled their bills, and, attracting as little attention as possible, stole from the reeking atmosphere of the polluted apartment. </p>
                        <p>All this while, wholly unconscious of the vile plot against her, Marian was disposing as rapidly as practicable of the business of the meeting, and having brought the proceedings to a close, accompanied by her <hi rend="italic">proteg&#x00E9;,</hi> sweet Lizzie Fay, had set out on the dark walk homeward. Totally dissimilar in character, the one all strength and independence, the other all softness and compliance,--these two girls, by associating together in the hours of work and boarding at the same house (the well-known "Home" in ----) had been both-subjects of that strange law of attraction bringing together and closely cementing in friendship those directly the opposites of thought and character, and no opportunity was omitted by either that brought daily walk or duty into a yet closer connection. And, as is always the case in such intimacies, each giving and receiving of the magnetic influence, while Marian imparted to her friend something of her own sturdy independence and liberality of thought, she in turn received daily lessons in the beautiful sweetness of her companion's disposition and in the modesty which seemed to shield her, as a wall, from any contact with the thousand rude surroundings of her life. </p>
                        <p>On this evening the two girls, leaving the hall at which their meetings were held, hastened their steps wherever the condition of the streets or the obscurity of the night would permit, anxious to gain the friendly shelter of the "Home" as soon as possible. </p>
                        <p>"Do you know, Marian," said the more timid Lizzie, half-clinging as she spoke to her companion, "that I can never divest my mind of the idea that our troubles with those "strikers will" yet end in something
<pb n="230 The Woman's Advocate."/>
fearful happening. Those, men are so vile, so wholly the slaves of drink, that, in some moment of intoxication and passion, they may wreak upon some one--and who so likely to be the object of their vengeance as yourself!--the outrage with which they have so long threatened us. You may think me silly, Marian, but I never look around me of an evening like this, but what I fancy some evil-minded person is pursuing me in the darkness, and were you not with me now I know not what I should do to still my own apprehensions."</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Lizzie, we always suffer more from imaginary than we do from real evils. True, we are the objects of dislike by a few, but the whole moral force of the "Union" is now upon our side, and these men, threaten as they may, dare not venture upon what would be regarded as a crime in the eye of the law, or of the better disposed portion of their own organization. No, we are in no bodily peril, and you must disabuse your mind of fears that should have no place in my girl's nature, which is to be brave and above all such weaknesses. Come take my hand, little trembler, lest you should make a misstep. We will soon be where the walking is better, and then a few moments will bring us to the 'Home,' where you can smile at all these fancies.</p>
                        <p>Yes, '<hi rend="italic">Home</hi>' it is indeed since I knew you, but ah, Marian, it was lonely enough for  me there until you came! I often wonder now how I endured the life I led as well as I did. Its great walls shut me in as a prison; the regulations were as so many gyves fettering my freedom, and, although with so many girls, all of whom strove to be kind, you could not say it was positively lonely, amid them all there was no one who could understand me as you; with whom, as with you, I could share all my thoughts; who was so compassionate, yet so wise, so far above me--nay,"--as a caressing movement was made to check her,--"Marian, I must speak; you do not know the half you have done for me, and think not I am not grateful to you for all your kindness. Oh, in more ways than I can tell you have been my benefactor! I think sometimes of that early conversation upon 'Woman's Rights' which we had in the work-room the day those ladies with the petition visited us, and as I recall the discussion that ensued, I blush to think what a creature of prejudices I was to refuse even to sign my name to the paper. The scales have fallen from my eyes, since, thanks to your patient teaching, and I 
<pb n="231 Thrown Upon the World."/>
have grown, at least, into an appreciation of those noble pioneers of progress whose names I then only uttered to ridicule; while their teachings, patterned after His 'who died for Man,' I trust will be my guide throughout life. I wonder if Lucretia Mott will indeed preach next Sabbath in Brooklyn? She is one of the few divinely annointed apostles of this present day whom I have not yet beheld; and all that I have read, and all that you have told me, only intensifies my desire to behold her. Past the three-score-and-ten! and yet able to travel and deliver sermons said to equal in power even those of her earlier life. How wonderful it is that her interest, her zeal, in doing good can be maintained! You promised, also, to tell me something more concerning Lydia Maria Child, whose writings I have so enjoyed latterly, and who you say leads life as beautiful as her own chastest thought, shunning fashion, and almost toiling herself to give yet more largely to the needy.--Ah, Marian, will poor me ever do any good? Will I ever be of any use in the world?</p>
                        <p>To this unwonted outpouring on the part of her companion Marian could only offer a few soothing words; and, as by common consent, the two girls quickened their step to cross the dark, narrow alley stretching across the street which they were traversing, only a few blocks from the "Home." Suddenly a figure, which unperceived had closely followed their movements, brushed up against their persons; a low whistle was given, and, before the terrified girls could give utterance to more than a smothered cry, their assailant was joined by three or four of the gang by whom they were at once overpowered wad dragged several paces into he deep gloom of the alley.</p>

I am told that the young ladies, thinking that the privileges of that great institution had been long enough denied to women, silently walked in, one morning, and took their seats among the other students, and that eminent professor who was about to give the lecture, only recognized their presence by a slight change in the form of his address. Instead of merely saying "Gentlemen," he said "Gentlemen and Ladies."

                        <head>A PLEA FOR DAUGHTERS.<lb/>
FIRST PAPER.</head>
                        <p>THAT Most illustrious of women, Miss Betsy Trotwood, displayed not a little of the independence and force of character for which she was so justly distinguished, when, the expected daughter of her nephew proving to be a son, she squared at amiable little Dr. Chillip, made as if to beat him with her bonnet, "put it on bent, walked out, and never came back." Unlike Miss Betsy, the world in general is disposed to offer unqualified congratulations when any antenatal doubts of sex are solved in the masculine certainty attendant upon the advent of young David Copperfield.</p>
                        <p>The day has indeed gone by when a female infant was but the personification of a family curse, and the wretched little unfortunate was either condemned to immediate death or what was yet more to be deplored, doomed to a life of utter, hopeless degradation. But who can deny that relics of this barbarism exist even in our own enlightened age? In some countries the father of ten sons is dowered by the Emperor, and the mother of such a progeny regarded with not a small portion of the honor bestowed of old upon the mother of the Gracchi. On the contrary, the father or mother of ten daughters would be very universally marked as an object for rather special condolence, and when the day arrives that this parent also shall seem the worthy recipient of public favor, the millennium, I think, will be much nearer its dawn than at present.</p>
                        <p>Truly, in view of the actual existing requirements of society, who cannot readily comprehend the reason of this? Ten daughters! It is not a question of so many mouths to feed and so many forms to cover during the period of childhood and youth; of so many struggles with measles, whooping-cough, scarlet fever, and the train of evils whereto infant flesh is heir; of multiplied hours of parental solicitude and wakefulness, of separate educational accounts and the numberless little household bills which add up to such amazing results. Ten daughters demand no more in this way than ten sons; and in very truth, as full
<pb n="233 A Plea for Daughters."/>
ready regard is ordinarily paid to the early claims of daughters, claims being always considered from the conservative point of view as those of sons. It is later that the real distinction begins. With sons, parental responsibility ceases at manhood. But until the daughter marries she is very generally supposed to require the protection of her father and be dependent upon him in a greater or less degree for her personal support. The continued care of even one child entails no trifling expenditure, and such care being unnatural, must always, to a certain extent, be irksome; but when the individual instance is multiplied by three or by four, as how often happens in our non-marrying, extravagant age, can any one wonder that a household of daughters is at best regarded as a not unmitigated blessing.</p>
                        <p>It is not strange, in view of the current opinion touching this matter, that a certain claim is put upon the subsequent life of the daughter quite unlike anything ever demanded of the manhood and ripened powers of the son. A young man is never expected to leave his profession, his trade, or even the preparatory studies and apprenticeship with which he begins his career, to meet any emergency that may arise on the farm or in the workshop of his father, or to assume any care about his father's business. Yet how frequently does it happen that the girl, engaged in some honorable, remunerative employment away from home, is recalled when any pressure is felt in the domestic circle, which, ordinarily, as is well understood and universally acted upon in the other exigency, might speedily relieved by hired labor. Still more absurd would it be to ask young man to abide at home as the companion of his parent, or to perform the lighter portions of the work; which would indeed save a trifling present expense, but could not half occupy his hands or keep his parental powers from utter stagnation. But this is even more frequently required of the daughter; and very often, I am quite sure, when she would prefer to be independently and actively employed abroad. Moreover a good show of justice accompanies this when the popular notion of woman's work and the fact that she is so rarely provided with aught save temporary employment are alone regarded; but a deeper consideration of the matter, a keener insight into the workings of the scheme, must surely prove that this is not only an unquestionable general evil, but also very often the source of unmerited individual pain. "O, that cannot
<pb n="234 The Woman's Advocate."/>
be," say the parents. "It is really nothing for our daughter to give up a situation wherein she labors from choice during the years of her unmarried life; and indeed, if it were a sacrifice, if she voluntarily deprived herself of some present gain to aid us or give us the pleasure of her company, it will all be made up to her in the future."</p>
                        <p>There are certain time-authorized views of filial duty which are not without weight in this matter, and make it worth one's while to consider precisely how far extend and where are limited the just claims of kindred upon the mature life of a woman; the more because at the present stage of progress in the Woman Question these claims may often become a peculiar obstacle to its rapid advancement. Thus far only one sphere has been recognized wherein woman's best years may be cast for the symmetrical development of her individual being. This, of course, is marriage; and in this alone she is exempted from any claim that could in the least prove detrimental to her marriage interests. But now a future is clearly foreshadowed wherein she will prove herself competent to engage successfully in business on her own account and to her own profit, and wherein she will fill with equal grace many positions of honor and influence now open to man alone. In sure anticipation of which are the improved means of education so lately placed within reach of woman; yet how can she avail herself of these while she is subject to certain external relations that may at any time command the total expenditure of her time, strength and ability.</p>
                        <p>By a sort of tacit understanding among the members of a large family it sometimes happens that one daughter is made, as it were, a sort of reserve force to minister in all cases of emergency to the various individual needs of parents, brothers and sisters. It is settled that this one is to be an "old maid." If there is sickness in one branch of the family, thither she must speed. If company is expected elsewhere, her presence is again demanded. A brother needs a housekeeper for the few months previous to his marriage; and as the parents advance in years the other children are relieved from any personal care of them because their infirmities and the increasing wants of old age become the special charge of this daughter. Not unfrequently the pressure of family claims is so strong that even if the woman does not devote her entire life to her kindred, very many of her best years are quite monopolized by them.

And be sure it is not the butterfly of the household upon whom these demands are made. It is the most practical and sensible, the clearest-headed of all the sisters. In fact, this thoughtful, unselfish woman, the best daughter and sister, with the will and the courage to be self-reliant, she who would soonest strike out into the new paths now opening to woman were she at all free to do so.</p>

                        <p>WHEN Mr. Adams was in Congress battling the Slave Power to prevent the annexation of Texas to the Union, he presented a petition from women of his district against that infamous and wily scheme of the slaveholders and their pro-slavery abettors of the North. The Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs took ground, not only against petitions in general relating to this subject, but made it a special point to attack the Female Petition on the ground of the sex of the petitioners. He said: "He thought these females could have a sufficient field for the exercise of their influence in the discharge of their duties to their fathers, their husbands, and their brothers, instead of rushing into the fierce struggles of political life. He felt sorry at this departure from their proper sphere, because he considered it discreditable, not only to heir own particular section of the country, but also to the national character." </p>
                        <p>To this, among other remarks, Mr. Adams replied as follows: "Why does it follow that women are fitted for nothing but the cares of domestic life? for bearing children and cooking the food of a family? devoting all their time to the domestic circle--to promoting the immediate personal comfort of their husbands, brothers and sons? I admit it is their duty to do these things. But I say that the correct principle is, that women are not only justified, but exhibit the most exalted virtue when they depart from the domestic circle, and enter on the concerns of their country, of humanity, and of their God. The mere departure of women from the duties of the domestic circle, far from being a reproach to them, is a virtue
<pb n="236 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of the highest order when it is done from purity of motive, by appropriate means, and towards a virtuous purpose. And I say that woman, by the discharge of such duties, has manifested a virtue which is, even above the virtues of mankind, and approaches to a superior nature. That is the principle I maintain; and I hold it to be proof of pure patriotism, of sincere piety, and. of every virtue that can adorn the female character."</p>
                        <p>Were the "Old Man Eloquent" now alive and in Congress and the Sixteenth Amendment before that body, who can doubt that it would receive his eloquent plea and his emphatic <hi rend="italic">Yea?</hi>

                           <head>A COMMENDABLE ENTERPRISE.</head>
                           <p>MISS EMMA MARWEDEL, an intelligent, cultivated German woman, to whom we have more than once alluded, is now in this city industriously engaged in promoting the enterprise which has already made such gratifying progress, viz., the establishment of a "Horticultural School for Women."</p>
                           <p>This plan--with which the public, through its appearance in the <hi rend="italic">Herald of Health,</hi> and republication in many journals, are familiar--consists, briefly recapitulated, in the establishment of an Institution which shall organize within itself a well-ordered business by means of the practical labor of the pupils, who shall be employed in profitable occupations--such as cultivating delicate vegetables, fruit, berries, and flowers; collecting seeds, making pickles, and preserving fruit, arranging bouquets and wreaths, and perhaps in preparing and arranging hanging vases and flower baskets. There can also be united to these the raising of bees and silk-worms, and other kindred things. A dwelling-house with twelve or thirteen rooms, a barn, about thirty or forty acres of land, and a green-house should be obtained. There should also be in attendance a matron, a gardener, a female servant, a gardener's assistant, and the necessary household furniture and implements. During the winter there should be teachers of theoretical branches of study, such as botany and entomology, agricultural economy and chemistry, practical drawing, chorus singing, and some foreign language. As pupils are admitted free, and also have their board and washing gratis, they must bind themselves not to leave before the end of the time agreed upon. As soon as the institution becomes self-supporting, and there is a surplus of money, each pupil is to receive such a portion of it as corresponds to the work she has performed. The pupils must also bind themselves to fulfill their duties thoroughly and conscientiously.</p>
                           <pb n="238 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>That there is a necessity for thus enlarging the sphere of woman, and furnishing at once a healthful and remunerative employment is painfully evident; and with a competent, efficient manager, such as Miss MARWEDEL is represented to be, we have no doubt that the enterprise would prove in practice, successful, and become the pioneer agency of great public usefulness. Miss MARWEDEL has already gained for it the confidence and enlisted the hearty co-operation of Mrs. HORACE MANN, Miss ELIZABETH PEABODY and other sterling sympathizers with Reform. In this city, in addition to the sympathy extended to Miss MARWEDEL in her scheme by the Editors of the <hi rend="italic">Herald of Health</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">National Anti-Slavery Standard,</hi> both of which excellent journals have been freely opened to disseminate her views; valuable co-operation has also been secured among the philanthropic which promises to greatly facilitate the inauguration of the enterprise. As a Principal of the Hamburg Industrial School; Miss MARWEDEL acquired a fund of valuable experience, to which she adds the knowledge derived from an extended study of the best Industrial Institutions of France, England and Belgium.</p>
                           <p>One of the most pleasant incidents that has lately fallen under our observation and one, too, powerfully illustrating the progress of the movement for the amelioration of the condition of woman, was the attendance Of Miss MARWEDEL at a recent meeting of the New York Fruit Grower's Club, whither, through the President, AARON M. POWELL, she was invited to present her plan for a Horticultural School, which awakened much interest and drew forth a Resolution, unanimously adopted, expressive of the full approbation and hearty sympathy of the Club. The announcement was made that President WHITE, and Mr. CORNELL of Cornell University, have offered to present to Miss. MARWEDEL several acres of good land adjoining the University farm, at Ithica, N. Y., for her proposed school, and also to afford to the girls who may become students therein full and free advantages of the University lectures. This is a very timely, encouraging offer, and it will doubtless be promptly accepted. In the course of the very interesting discussion which ensued, Mr. A. S. FULLER, a leading, practical horticulturist, an associate editor of Hearth and Home, and an active member of the Club, warmly expressed himself in favor of the scheme, declaring that he would agree to stock with plants as much land as
<pb n="239 Editorial Department."/>
Cornell University would give Miss MARWEDEL for the purpose-an offer which met with hearty applause from the Club.</p>
                           <p>Capital for the necessary buildings, implements, etc., will be necessary, and this it is proposed to raise by shares, at the low price of five dollar each. Share-holders will be entitled to a dividend of surplus profits. We presume when the arrangements have bee a fully completed those especially interested in the success of the plan, the needed capital can be easily secured.</p>
                           <p>Our heart goes out to Miss MARWEDEL for the success of her enterprise. She is a "stranger in a strange land," but friends have risen up who are kindred in instinct, and her German heart has had cause to glow with the sympathy which has been extended to her undertaking. It is auspicious for the future of the women of our land that an enterprise, promising so much in the way of improved physical health and better compensation for skilled labor, should be so cordially received, and we trust that no untoward circumstance will prevent the speedy establishment of so needed an Institution.</p>

                           <p>FRIENDS! as the next number of THE ADVOCATE closes the Second Volume, and the year 1869, we desire, at this time, to say a few words to you concerning a new Volume and the year 1870.</p>
                           <p>From our Prospectus you can learn the minor details of Terms, Premium, Offers, Club Rates, etc., to all of which we respectfully invite your attention, but here, in the familiar manner which a year of close, sympathetic association seems to warrant us to speak, we want to say something concerning the general principles by which we shall be governed, and of the scope and character of THE ADVOCATE for the second year of its existence.</p>
                           <p>And first let us assure the generous friends who have stood by us in our efforts thus far, that in no respect will THE ADVOCATE be less worthy of confidence in the Future than in the Past. To provide the public with a magazine which should be truly representative of the enlightened sentiment of the age, as embodied in the movement for Woman's elevation, has been our earnest endeavor; and the success which thus far has attended our efforts warrants us in the assumption that THE ADVOCATE has a mission to fulfill in the crowded field of journalism which may not lightly be abandoned. We have faith in our work. At every stage we have been cheered by the unwavering support of the press, and the kind exertions of a widening circle of sympathetic friends. Writers, interested in the Cause and in our efforts, have freely given their best, strengthening our hands by their generous cooperation. For 1870, in addition to our present able corps of contributors, we confidently expect to be favored with choice original matter,--Tales, Poems and Essays,--from many new writers whose names are a guarantee of excellence. A careful watch will be kept of home and foreign periodicals, and, from time

to time such selections will be made as best illustrate the progress of the Cause abroad, or may be regarded as especially worthy of republication.</p>
                           <p>Untrammeled by any pledge or organization, free to admit or reject as we deem the interests of the Cause will be best served, we have been and will continue. For our Future we only ask to be judged by our Past. If we have ever swerved from the line of principle which we have marked out for our guidance it has been unwittingly. Friends!--Whose faces are strange to us, but whose "well done" has often come to us, lightening our labors--may we ask for the year to come, in view of the necessity of such an organ of opinion, the same generous cooperation of pen and efforts to extend our circulation which thus far have rendered THE ADVOCATE such an acknowledged means of usefulness! That we may not lose a patron, but that our friends, more tried as each month passes, will be induced yet more earnestly and effectively to aid our efforts, is our hope, to deserve which realization we shall spare no endeavor.</p>
                           <p>OUR CONTRIBUTORS.--Since the establishment of THE ADVOCATE many inquiries have been made, by letter and otherwise, respecting this or that contributor to its pages. As all of these interrogatories appear to be prompted by the most friendly interest in our magazine, a somewhat gossipping mood induces us to impart the little of information which our own knowledge, or a sense of what is due to editorial confidence, will permit. "L. B. C.," who is particularly inquired after, is a young lady of culture and superior endowments, a native of New England, who contributed the article on the Fifteenth Amendment under a sense of duty requesting that her name might be withheld from the public. Respecting her wishes, we can only say that we deeply regret not to be more frequently favored with articles from her pen--a regret we know that is shared by many of our readers. "Jane O. De Forest," whose frequent spicy, highly original articles have rendered her a general favorite and won for her larger audiences than our columns, copied as they frequently have been in other journals, is a resident of Ohio, and, as may be inferred from the tenor of her articles, is a teacher in one of the many flourishing Seminaries in that State. Yet young, highly educated, holding a ready pen; a fair future is before this "Buckeye girl," and we congratulate ourselves that THE ADVOCATE has been the medium of extending her sphere of usefulness. "M. F. Burlingame," whose clear, logical
<pb n="243 Notes."/>
articles have elicited numerous inquiries, resides in more distant Indiana. Western Conventions and Western readers know her well. She also, we believe, is in the ranks of the youthful Reformers whose coming tread is already heavy upon New England hills or Western prairies, marching with the assured step of youth and hopefulness, to a speedy victory over Ignorance and Error. There are other contributors, valued by us, also eagerly inquired after, but for the present we must close these imperfect notes. Concerning the well established writers who we rendered us such efficient assistance, Caroline H. Dall, Frances Dana Gage, Wendell Phillips, Lucy Stone, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, Samuel J. May, the Brothers Blackwell, George H. Burleigh, Isabella B. Hooker, and others,--the world knows them too well and justly holds their names too dear, to need any special mention, beyond the tender of our most grateful thanks.</p>
                           <p>WE invite especial attention to our new story, "The Market Woman," the first installment of which we present in the present issue of THE ADVOCATE. To those who deplore the highly seasoned fiction of the period Mrs. Blackwell's story will be found a charming relief by its simplicity, while the happily sketched incidents of the opening chapters awaken a lively interest in the subsequent fortunes of the courageous heroine.</p>

                        <p>"Berlin, Germany," says the <hi rend="italic">North German Correspondence,</hi> has now a lady doctor. Mrs. Hirschfeldt, who was born in Holstein, and left Germany in 1867 to study in America, has lately returned with a diploma from the Dentist College in Philadelphia, and has obtained permission to practice as a dentist in the Prussian Capital."</p>
                        <p>Mrs. E. A. Kingsbury of Vineland, N.J., a veteran and effective speaker, will lecture for Lyceums and other Associations the coming winter. Among Mrs. Kingsbury's excellent addresses are "Scattered

Clouds," "Suffrage for Woman," "The Law of Compensation," "Woman in the Future," etc. Committees desiring to communicate with Mrs. Kingsbury will address as above.</p>
                        <p>Miss Kate Field, whose brilliancy and talent have won for her an enviable reputation in the world of literature, began the lecture season in Boston on the 20th inst., under the auspices of the Mercantile Library Association. She gave graphic sketches of what she saw and experienced "among the Adirondacks" last summer, and her quaint humor and power of description, made the theme more than ordinarily entertaining. Miss Field is in great favor thoughout the country, and her winter campaign promises to be as extended as that of many of our veteran lecturers.</p>
                        <p>The wealthiest woman proprietor of a journal in this country is Madame Ottendorfer of the <hi rend="italic">Staats Zeitung</hi> of this city. This well-known journal, the German <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> for its value as an advertising medium, became the exclusive property of Mrs. Ottendorfer on the death of her husband, since which period, now eight or more years, Mrs. O---- has in person attended to its management, devoting so many hours of each day to business, riding to and therefrom in her own carriage, with as self-possessed a manner as the Bennetts or the Bonners of the metropolis.</p>
                        <p>That accomplished woman of letters, Mary Somerville, a name of which not England alone but the civilized world may be proud, is thus spoken of by the N. Y. Times: "This phenomenon of her sex, in her eightieth year, lately published an abstruse and admirable work on <hi rend="italic">Molecular and Microscopic Science,</hi> reviewing and criticising the most recent researches and discoveries of the philosophers In the world of nature. Her masculine brain has been wonderfully disciplined by exercise, and is still in good working order, like that of Humboldt at her age, and her mind resembles his in the great purpose of observing and proving instead of theorizing and making systems. When she dies she will leave a void which no one else of her sex can readily supply."</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Liberal Christian</hi> of this city, a journal which, for its liberal views, we always peruse with interest, says: "The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> Association show their interest in the Woman Question by publishing a complete and uniform edition of Margaret Fuller's works, in six 12mo. volumes. Margaret Fuller was the pioneer of the Woman Movement in this country, a sort of female John the Baptist, going before and preparing the way for the great company of Apostles which is now following after. And,
<pb n="245 Notes."/>
in very many instances, these do but pick up the pearls of thought which she dropped without noise on her often unwelcome path, and repeat her splendid prophecies in another tense. Among the truly great women of America Margaret Fuller holds scarcely a second place."</p>
                        <p>The formation of the recently organized "Woman Suffrage Association" in Ohio, calls from the pen of Frances Dana Gage, in that excellent journal, <hi rend="italic">The</hi> (Dayton) <hi rend="italic">Woman's Advocate,</hi> which is rendering the Cause, yeomanry service in the West,--a letter of congratulation and of interesting reminiscences in relation to the growth of the movement in that State--for so many years Mrs. Gage's place of residence. We have been greatly interested in looking over this letter, overflowing with love for the Cause, to note the important part played by the sons and daughters of Ohio in the "bygone days" of the movement; and we congratulate the thousands of earnest advocates of Woman Suffrage in that Commonwealth on the marvellous change in public sentiment since the "Salem Convention"--the pioneer movement in the West.</p>
                        <p>A St. Petersburg correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">London Daily News</hi> contributed the following:</p>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                           <p>It may be of interest to those of your readers who are interested in the 'Woman Movement' to learn that even Russia is becoming excited on that subject. Mr. Mill's work on 'The Subjection of Women' is enjoying a wide circulation in this country, and three extended reviews of it, all highly approving its sentiments, have recently appeared in the journals of Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is proposed to hold a grand Woman's Rights Convention at St. Petersburg, to which Mr. Mill--a sympathetic letter from whom to some feminine reformers of that city has already been published--is to be invited. It is even claimed that the Czar himself is not unfriendly to the principle of the equality of the sexes, and, at least there has been thus far no public manifestation of any objection on his part to the agitation which has already given rise to one public meeting."</p>

                        <p>At a meeting of the "Social Science Society," held in Boston on Monday evening, September 20th, at which Hon. Josiah Quincy presided, a very interesting paper was read by Rev. Charles F. Barnard upon Mrs. Batchelder's Industrial School of that city, the subject which the Association was called to consider. Mother Bickerdyke of Kansas made some effective remarks in support of Mrs. Batchelder's School, which has recently received an appropriation of $3,000 from the School Board fund and addresses from Mrs. E. P. Peabody, Mr. Otis Clapp, the President, and others, in warm commendation of the plan, closed the proceedings. We are happy to learn that the good work which Mrs. Batchelder has commenced, the generous-hearted men and women of Boston will not

suffer to languish for want of funds, and that she will be enabled to prosecute it with fresh assurances of success.</p>

                           <hi rend="italic">Die Neue Zeit</hi> is the title of the new weekly, which the growing interest among our German residents in the "Woman Question" has caused its projectors to establish. While chiefly devoted to the advocacy of the Woman's Rights movement, <hi rend="italic">Die Neue Zeit</hi> will in no sense be a partisan journal, but aim to be the friend and promoter of all just and beneficent enterprises. It has a field of much usefulness before it, which the interesting character of the numbers already issued give earnest it will fill. Surely there is vitality in the Cause when papers thus increase among all classes in the community, and this latest born of journals which the movement has evoked, will find many well-wishers even among those to whom its tongue is strange. May it merit and receive the largest measure of support! The publication office is at No. 19 Ann street. It is edited by Dr. Hoeber. Terms $4.00 per year.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">London,  Daily News</hi> of Sept. 25th, speaking of the progress of liberal ideas on the Continent, says:
<q direct="unspecified">"Mr. John Stuart Mill has triumphed in at least one European capital. Austria used to have a name for despotism, and the rigid adherence to ancient usages. It is now in many respects quite radical in its tendencies. If we may credit the local and special correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Independance Belge,</hi> the municipal body of the town of Vienna has decided that 7,000 women inhabiting the town, paying its taxes, and otherwise complying with all legal conditions, shall be admitted to the right of an elective vote. The most curious part of the affair is the comparatively speaking utter unconcern of the male population of Vienna. In this respect, however, Austria is as England. In the last session of Parliament a precisely similar extension of the municipal franchise to women was made without exciting even the faintest opposition. Many in the country have not been aware that the question of woman's rights was at all considered in Austria."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In pursuance of a Call issued last June, a preliminary meeting to organize a "Woman's Parliament" was held in this city on the 21st ult. About seventy ladies were in attendance, among whom were Mrs. Fanny Fern Parton, Mrs. Mary F. Davis, Mrs. Elizabeth P. Peabody, Mrs. Dr. Densmore, Mrs. Charles S. Pierce, Miss Marwedel and others well known in Reform and Literary circles. Mrs. Pierce was chosen President of the Convention, and Miss Emma C. Ward, Secretary. After several interesting addresses and extended informal remarks, a Committee upon Organization was appointed, and the meeting adjourned until Saturday, October 23d, when several important and interesting papers will be read, and measures taken to organize a permanent Woman's Parliament. As
<pb n="247 Premiums."/>
a conservative middle movement, enlisting the co-operation of many worthy, influential women, we believe that the establishment of such a Parliament as proposed will be the means of effecting much good, and we await further proceedings with interest. From the proceedings of the 21st. ult. men, even to the ubiquitous reporters, were rigorously excluded.</p>
                        <p>It has been noticed in England, and indeed it is a noticeable fact, that almost all the magazine literature of England is monopolized by lady writers. Two of the magazines are edited by ladies--the <hi rend="italic">St. James Magazine,</hi> by Mrs. Roddell; and the <hi rend="italic">Argosy,</hi> by Mrs. Henry Wood; both of these ladies also are writing for <hi rend="italic">Tinsley's Magazine.</hi> There is another monthly, the <hi rend="italic">Packet,</hi> which Miss Yonge edits; and Mrs. S. C. Hall assists her husband in running the <hi rend="italic">Art Journal.</hi> 
                           <hi rend="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</hi> of last month, besides the extraordinary article from the pen of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, contained articles from Mrs. Muloch-Craik, Miss Olney, and Hon. Mrs. Norton. The leading story in <hi rend="italic">Temple Bar</hi> is by a lady, and Miss Edwards's "Debenham's Vow " is the principal in <hi rend="italic">Good Words.</hi> Even the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi> opens its columns to Miss Emily Davies, and a lady has an article on Bells in the <hi rend="italic">Churchman's Shilling Magazine.</hi> There seems also an inclination on the part of gentlemen requiring private secretaries or amanuenses to employ ladies. Sir Charles Lyell, the geologist, employs one ; and Sir Francis Goldsmith's secretary, another lady, has translated "Schleiermacher."</p>

CHAPTER IV.<lb/>
THE MARKET.</head>
                        <p>IT is still an early hour. Most of her future neighbors are not yet here; but our market woman has already conveyed a part of the contents of her wagon to the stall, still keeping a reserved force in waiting if needed. Her horse has been taken from the shafts and stands by his wagon out in the open market place quietly picking at his hay, and Susan is busily arranging, her produce that it may be displayed to the best advantage.</p>
                        <p>There are heads of crisp, green lettuce, long rosy radishes, and young onions with their blended white and green; spinach, kale and chard; all grouped in neighborly clusters like flowers on a parterre. A pretty, shallow basket of delicate young cress is green and fragrant enough for a parlor ornament, the long bundles of mammoth pie-plant lie quietly side by side, and the green and purple clumps of asparagus rest daintily against a white napkin which has been thrown over an old box. It is too early yet for many vegetables; but last year's potatoes, still round and plump, thanks to careful preservation, seem not yet out of season, and even cabbages, beets and parsnips are quite presentable. Then there are nice dried apples, and dried cherries and peaches--the mother-in-law's offering to her daughter's stock in trade. Thrifty young cabbage plants and a few delicate flowers in pots are also for sale here; and a pile of fine eggs make a pleasant
<pb n="254 The Woman's Advocate."/>
contrast to the general greenness. Through the slightly open lid of a long basket is seen the golden gleam of little one and two pound rolls of butter, nicely stamped; and at the other end of the basket are dainty cottage cheeses, in keeping with the snowy plates and napkins with which the whole interior is lined.</p>
                        <p>Susan remembered the few tables of tempting food and flowers which she had seen mingled at fairs and festivals, and acting upon the hint she had set out her market stall in simple and cleanly beauty. In later years, when she had secured her regular run of customers, many of her choicest articles were kept carefully covered to preserve their freshness; now she puts them forward with as much care and ingenuity as the advertiser does his wares, when he is anxious to catch the public eye. No sign-painter ever gave more heed to the construction of every letter and ornamental stroke than Susan did to the placing of every bunch of radishes and every little pot of sweet elyssum and mignonette.</p>
                        <p>"What do you ask for your asparagus?" called a loud, strong voice at her side, as she stood taking a last survey of the general effect.</p>
                        <p>Susan had seen the whole table over and over again spread out before her mental vision within the last week or two, but now that it was here really before her eyes, it still affected her like a surprise; and she had almost forgotten, in the interest of her work, that there might be any lookers-on. "It is really very pretty!" she was just saying to herself, when the strong voice gave her a sudden and unexpected start.</p>
                        <p>The great, burly man who stood towering above her gave a good-natured, audible laugh. It seemed so odd for a market woman! It made him think of an old maid standing in the dim light of her best parlor; absorbed in admiration of the pretty little gewgaws which had cost her so much time and thought; and he was prepared to see a sharp, thin face with a drawn down mouth and a sad smile look up at him from under the sunbonnet. He repeated his question more gently; and with a touch of commiseration at the thought of another old maid Pyncheon driven by stress of want into such a calling.</p>
                        <p>The market woman looked down fixedly at her vegetables, as she answered "fifteen cents."</p>
                        <p>"Fresh, eh?"</p>
                        <p>"Cut this morning, sir; every bunch by my own hands." Susan was herself again, self-poised, alert, and ready for action. No room now for commiseration. She looked a genuine born huckster from top to toe, as she lifted a fine bunch, and held it towards him.</p>
                        <p>"Give me three bunches. It's the finest I've seen this Spring. Grow it yourself?"</p>
                        <pb n="255 The Market Woman."/>
                        <p>"Why! well, is it you, Susan? Didn't know you! Well, this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a surprise!" offering his broad, open hand cordially.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, sir; I grew the asparagus, at least I looked after the top dressing myself this Spring;" said Susan, demurely, as she took the offered hand, well-pleased.</p>
                        <p>Such genuine hand-shaking from an honored acquaintance in the market place had hardly occurred to her in the reckoned probabilities of her experience.</p>
                        <p>"Glad to see you here, Susan, it's sensible. Most women are dolls now-a-days, and at first I thought you was one of them, playing at marketing as a fine art; but now I see that you mean business."</p>
                        <p>"I mean business; and this is my advertisement, you know. I must get started."</p>
                        <p>"Right, quite right! I heard you were married; but didn't know you had turned market woman. That's what I call pluck. It's good grit, and you'll succeed!"</p>
                        <p>"I shall be here every day, Mr. Verplank, and thank you for becoming my first customer."</p>
                        <p>"Am I? That's right, and I'll stand by you till the last if you are on hand promptly every morning with a set out as nice as this to-day; and if you go on gathering your own vegetables, eh Susan!"</p>
                        <p>"Here in the market I am Mrs. Reband, if you please, sir. Come and see us at home, Mr. Verplank, and you may call me Susan as they all do there."</p>
                        <p>"Eh, yes!" laughed the eccentric lumber merchant, evidently pleased by the naive expression of her wishes. "Mrs. Reband, you see my market basket is quite full already. I am always an early customer; but I'll take a pound of your dried cherries. They look tempting. Did you dry these, too?"</p>
                        <p>"No, sir. My mother-in-law did that. But I made this cottage cheese only yesterday. Here is nice thin paper to wrap it in, and it would go on the top of your basket."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, so it would. Put me in two or three balls; say four, that is not too many if, they are good."</p>
                        <p>"I'll make the cheese to order if this does not suit; milk or buttermilk, just as you prefer. This is mixed, a part of each."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, there, that will do! twelve cents, eh! that's right. Have you a good vegetable garden to draw from through the Summer, Mrs. Reband?"</p>
                        <p>"Pretty good, sir. Everything is thrifty and forward."</p>
                        <p>"Work in the garden yourself?" </p>
                        <p>"Yes sir, when I have time."</p>
                        <pb n="256 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"I like that. You start right and you've got the spunk--that's everything. You wont die off with consumption at thirty-five, or be ailing and codling all your life. Women are not worth a cent now-a-days; but if they would do something they would get well. That's my doctrine, madam. A fine lady that's ashamed help herself don't deserve to be helped, I say. There is too much false pride. Your old grandmother had more spirit than a dozen sick, kittenish, white things that lie on the sofa and sleep or sew all day, and raise children as puny as themselves. You may keep up heart, for you will win the day. Good morning, Mrs. Reband; you deserve to find customers as thick as black-berries in an old clearing!"</p>
                        <p>"With the thorns, too, sir?" asked Susan, quietly.</p>
                        <p>"Goose-berries lose their prickles by cultivation; and they say there are such things as white black-berries. If you don't look for the thorns you won't feel them often. You'll find this is a sensible world at bottom after all. Its bark is worse than its bite." And with a bow as civil as he would have given to a millionaire, the eccentric democrat had said his say, and was gone.</p>
                        <p>The market woman looked after him gratefully and smiled as she looked down at the money in her hand, eyeing it for a moment with a far-off look. Fifty-two cents cash in hand, and a grand customer and well-wisher secured. It was a good beginning and far more than she had allowed herself to expect. But she became conscious of the sharp eyes of neighbors peering at her, and the money went hastily down into her pocket. She stood sedately ready for the next customer who was already there in waiting.</p>
                        <p>"A good thing ye've made of it, too, Mrs.," said the gossipy Irish woman who had stood a little way off listening, and now came up to the stand. "He's a right down liberal-handed gentleman, that, and sensible like, and not a ha'penny proud. My son Jim works for him; and I wish ye joy of the luck. His good will's a fortune to a poor woman, let alone the custom. How much thin for the young onions; for I'll be afther thrading wid ye, too, in a small way, if ye'll be raisonable. How much the bunch?" picking up a handful and eyeing them admiringly.</p>
                        <p>"Only three cents, ma'am; you'll find me always asking no more than the even market price, unless the things are extra good."</p>
                        <p>"The salads are all in the dew yet, I can see that for meself, so I'll take a head of lettuce and three bunches of the onions and a measure of the potatoes. They look splendid. Ye are a rare one for a fine show of things, I warrant."</p>
                        <p>The Irish woman handed her silver and copper coins and went on her way.</p>
                        <p>They fell with a jingle to the bottom of the market woman's pocket, and to her
<pb n="257 The Market Woman."/>
heart the chime was as musical as the refrain of a pleasant song. These first earnings were the forerunner of an honorable independence. "No mortgage-- no more mortgage!" was the song that her ears heard all the morning. </p>
                        <p>"You are in luck for a beginning, Mrs.," called a market man not far off, after disposing of a customer of his own; and I see you've a knack for the business better than most."</p>
                        <p>"Have I?" said Susan, quietly. "I shall keep my eyes open to learn all I can from the ways of you all, and I shall improve in time, I hope."</p>
                        <p>"Little need of that, I reckon;" said a woman whose stand was nearest her own, speaking rather tartly.</p>
                        <p>"All is fair in fair trade," said the man. "We have no need to begrudge a new-comer. Good luck to you, Mrs. Reband, I say, and so say we all."</p>
                        <p>"Thank you," was the civil reply; and all three turned again to their own affairs, and were soon busy with the inflow of customers. One and another came up to look or ask prices, or perhaps to buy a few articles of Mrs. Reband, who received them all graciously but with few words, never soliciting custom or seeming greatly anxious to obtain it. "To the market born!" she said to herself as she saw how easily she fell into the ways of her business, easily meeting all her would-be customers half way. "Yes, I am bound to succeed. It is my heritage!"</p>
                        <p>Those who passed on sometimes returned to purchase; but for a good while the sales were very few, and her crusty left-hand neighbor began to regain her affability. Presently a small, carefully dressed gentleman, leading two children by the hand and followed by a black boy carrying a huge basket, came walking briskly forward, when his eye fell on Susan and her wares at a single glance.</p>
                        <p>"New market woman; better class; nice set out;" was his mental preface. "Are these things raised in your own garden?" he asked, halting promptly. </p>
                        <p>"They are, sir, all of them."</p>
                        <p>He ran his eye over everything, tasted the butter and cheese, looked through half-a-dozen eggs held against the sunlight, and ended by nearly filling his basket with a goodly variety of articles. "Now, Peter, go forward and wait for me at the meat stall. You ask the regular market price for all these things, of course?" turning back to Mrs. Reband with a penetrating look. </p>
                        <p>"Certainly, sir. A penny extra for the extra quality possibly, if anything is remarkably fine of its kind."</p>
                        <p>"Certainly, certainly! I'm quite willing if it's worth the difference! Is your garden well stocked with everything for the Summer?" </p>
                        <p>"Pretty well, I think, sir."</p>
                        <pb n="258 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>"And if it isn't you can buy what's wanting of the others, I suppose."</p>
                        <p>"No, Sir. I shall never sell anything which we don't raise ourselves. The profits I make shall be clear profits."</p>
                        <p>"Excellent principle. Don't vary from that rule with me; for I hate second-hand dealing."</p>
                        <p>"I never will, sir, you may rely on that."</p>
                        <p>Well, I'll try you. Will you bring me a gallon jug of fresh buttermilk every Saturday?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, sir, and I'll be sure to remember it."</p>
                        <p>"Do you know <hi rend="italic">him?</hi>" whispered her neighbor; nudging her.</p>
                        <p>"No, I don't know his name or anything about him."</p>
                        <p>"He is the best buyer in the market; and you've caught the big fish; but I won't envy you, for he's awful particular and I can't suit, and don't want to; but you will, I guess."</p>
                        <p>"'Live and let live,' is all we both want, Mrs. Hawks."</p>
                        <p>"Here is a dominie's wife coming, and she s a little of the same sort," was whispered back confidentially.</p>
                        <p>"A pleasant-faced lady approached, looking about her with the practiced eye of a careful purchaser, touching, tasting, and questioning with shrewd, practical sense. "The dominie's wife," too, liked the finest and freshest of its kind; but evidently she was not in favor of high prices. A clergyman's family must generally look well to see that they get the worth of their money, and Susan forgot in this case to allude to the possible extra penny for prime articles, but contented herself with pushing some of the most attractive trifles a little to the front; while she looked and answered with a steady self-reliance. This lady, too, became a considerable patron, and had evidently taken a special fancy to the new market stall.</p>
                        <p>Once more Susan repeated over her whimsical parody: "To the market born! To the market born! Well, there might be a worse calling, and one less entertaining. My grandmother was a sensible woman after all. I rather like it, and a fig for what silly people say or think!" But her eye was arrested by the figure of an old acquaintance hovering in the distance--an early school-mate lately married like herself, and now a resident of the city. Susan had been an invited guest at her wedding; but the fashionably-dressed lady would ignore the pink sunbonnet and the market stall. Susan caught the flash of her black eye as it turned away from her in feigned unconsciousness; and her face flushed suddenly much more than the sunbonnet would justify.</p>
                        <pb n="259 A Plea for Daughters."/>
                        <p>"She will not come here today. I guarantee so much," thought the market woman. "By-and-by I shall have her for a customer. She who Wins may laugh," and she turned to supply the needs of a small boy who was in quest of radishes; but heart and brow were both ablaze, and they went on burning and would not get cool again till the market broke up.</p>
                        <p>Noon came, when the remaining articles were locked away in a box or packed in the market wagon, the patient horse was kindly patted and offered a few refuse green leaves, which he took with manifest thanks and good will; and horse and driver set their faces homewards with lightened hearts, lightened boxes and baskets. Mrs. Reband had a heavy, heavy pocket. Those were days when copper and silver were both in circulation and everywhere abundant. Nearly thirty dollars, chiefly in small coin, she was carrying home as so much clear profit going to liquidate the mortgage.</p>
                        <p>"Better than I ventured to hope," she mused as she drove on at a brisk trot. That will help to reconcile mother. John, too, poor fellow! they felt it more than I did. I shall like it in time; but will they? I can hardly tell."</p>

SECOND PAPER.</head>
                        <p>IN the older portions of our country the number of unmarried women is constantly increasing, and of this number may be found many of the most energetic, the strongest minded and the strongest hearted of the sex. It is to this class of noble single women who feel within themselves a fund of native, unemployed power that the advance of thought upon the Question of woman's work is largely owing. These women would do much if they could; the world is acknowledging their ability, and society at last making a way for them; but until woman's time is held of as much value to her as man's time to him; until woman's strength and talents are as sacredly at her own disposal as man's strength and talents at his, under what obstacles are they placed! But there are certain claims which arise in families of the middle classes, including neither the poor nor yet the wealthy of our country, that ought particularly to be considered.</p>
                        <p>The mistress of a large family needs help. Who so efficient in rendering it who so pleasing to the mother as her own daughter? Inas-
<pb n="260 The Woman's Advocate."/>
much as there is no imperative need of the daughter earning her own livelihood abroad, and as food and raiment can well be afforded her at home, the question never enters the mind of either parent whether the world and society have not the highest claim upon the maturity of a well-educated child, especially when all the personal needs of her kindred may be readily, if indeed a little less agreeably, supplied by hired labor. But herefrom also arises a strong and subtle temptation to the daughter. A conscientious, energetic girl, unsparing of herself in the generous purpose of sparing her friends, responds to this demand for personal aid without the faintest suspicion that by so doing she is not treading in the path of the very highest duty life can open before her. How adapted is she to the place! How well acquainted with the requirements of the household, the family tastes, interests, peculiarities! Who so easily as she can please every member thereof! Moreover there springs up within her a delightful consciousness of living in constant forgetfulness of self, and what principle so fascinates while it is at the same time so injurious to certain earnest natures, as this of self-abnegation! Indeed, are there not many who will exclaim, what can be nobler than the spirit of sacrifice? Is it not the very breath of heroism and martyrdom? And are not martyrs and heroes the loftiest souls of earth?</p>
                        <p>Surely the virtue of martyrdom lies only in necessity. And true heroism is hardly more than the resolute pursuit of all that is high and pure in the noble scorn of sacrifice; while the obvious purpose of every soul should be the attainment of perfection, or, at least, the most complete possible development of every faculty. And inasmuch as education is paramount to the more accident of birth in determining a person's true value to society, so, other things being equal, it must also determine the particular field wherein a man or woman may labor most effectually and achieve the greatest usefulness. If the claims of kindred also allow the widest range for the culture of heart, mind and body ; if they permit the greatest freedom of thought, the loftiest energy of purpose; if they carry the soul upward to an atmosphere that promotes the quickest, strongest growth of the inner life, then these must indeed represent the sphere an Infinite Being would have his creature fill. Women are indifferent to the demands of their nature more often than men because their liberty is more restricted; or they fail to assert themselves, because
<pb n="261 A Plea for Daughters."/>
heedless of the great truth that an individual Is responsible for the perfection of his or her entire nature and that only the utmost of every faculty can please God--hence not a little of their personal suffering. And how is it with the unquestioning submission to these long-established family claims? It is very easy for the daughter to adopt her strong, young shoulders to a burden of care which is gradually, almost mechanically, shifted thereupon from the mother's. Yet how much heavier is this burden for her than for the parent upon whom it fell naturally in her capacity of wife and mother. And once accepted, if the daughter is the pains-taking, conscientious girl she is assumed to be, it must require no slight struggle to cast it off again. Family interests grow around her and cling to her until her very life is woven into their fabric. Months, years slip by. Can she be spared now? Not yet. Now? Not yet. The parents may be truly unconscious of any injustice done their child because they think, "She will lose nothing in the end. She has a good home with us, and protection; and we shall amply compensate her hereafter." But ought this to be so? Such devotion may be praiseworthy, is it justifiable? Such unselfishness would be truly beautiful in her own household where it would also be natural, is it called for in her father's? And with regard to compensation: Can inherited wealth compensate for a life contracted within the full measure of its possible growth? Can inherited wealth make amends for the loss of youth's bright promise? Can it light up a lonely old age, and purchase for declining life the tender ministries, the loving care, then so needful? Thoughts like these come to find lodgment in the girl's heart as she realizes at last that she has taken upon herself a perpetual burden of care, such as can only be cheerfully, happily endured in the exercise of wifely and motherly devotion. And is it strange that she has to lament the early decay of her best powers, and is conscious of an incongruity in all her life relations that speedily engenders the saddest feelings of loneliness and desolation? But some one here asks, and very justly too, Are there not other evils at the root of this matter which ought to be considered? Is it nothing that the mother be unsupported beneath the weight of her daily cares? And how is it unworthy the most cultivated young lady, this tender, graceful recognition of a parent's need? In answer might be put the counter questions: Is it often that any sacrifice
<pb n="262 The Woman's Advocate."/>
is really demanded? If the constant personal aid of a son is neither</p>
                        <p>expected nor desired by the father, why should the mother require the continued assistance of a daughter ? If out-door labor is bought and paid for, why not purchase in-door help also? Many women, however, who are quite able to obtain such help refuse to do so because the presence of a stranger in their well-ordered, methodical households is disagreeable or they shrink from the effort necessary to the thorough instruction of a raw untrained foreigner. Others again are not allowed to exercise their own judgment touching these domestic necessities and have not the command of sufficient money to enable them to purchase such timely aid as would ensure to themselves continued health and vigor. Yet is not here represented a large majority of the cases where a daughter's services are claimed quite as a matter of right and justice? Perhaps a more frequent demand is that which would require the young lady to remain at home simply to be the companion of her mother. Two ladies meet in society. Says Mrs. B---- to Mrs. A---- "How can you let your daughter be away so much, teaching? There is positively no need of it, you know; and she would be such delightful company for you at home." Answers Mrs. A----, "Oh, well, Carrie wanted to teach, so I lot her. But I do miss her at home and I shall have her return before long." Caroline A---- belongs to the large class of our educated girls who have hitherto so generally found in teaching an easy, agreeable means of independence. She enjoys this work above her quiet, rather dull home life, because it affords her a wider range of observation, gives her influence, gains her respect, and opens to her an ample field of useful endeavor. Nevertheless, cherishing sincere affection for her parents and acknowledging the obligations by which she is bound to them, she regards their wishes to the letter and returns home. She may be less happy, more restless, conscious of an unsatisfied want in her life; but she is in the path of duty, she "honors her father and her mother," she is doing right. "O, my dear," says her kind mother, "I do not wish you to take any care. You need only dust the parlor, water the plants, and see that the table is in order when we have company." If the daughter possesses an active mind and has been engaged in earnest, useful labor abroad, surely she must fail to obtain from these daily tasks, and too often from any of the surroundings of home, that excitement
<pb n="263 A Plea for Daughters."/>
absolutely essential to her continued health and happiness. If indeed she aspires to more than ordinary culture in music, the arts, literature, then her situation is desirable. But such aspirations imply peculiar gifts, and scarcely touch the multitude; while the wants of society, the enlargement of woman's sphere, require only the clear head, the resolute will, the pure and lofty ambition, every young lady ought to possess. Abroad, again, the daughter has doubtless gathered around her a circle of friends endeared by the ties of mutual labor and community of interest; at home, many of her early associates are absent or removed from her by the inevitable changes of time, or fallen behind her in the march of intelligence; while nowhere is it more difficult than here to break over old bounds and select in society the exact level of personal adaption. I question whether any healthy young girl can remain at home a companion to even the tenderest of mothers, when that mother is well and not in particular need of a daughter's ministrations, without serious detriment to her own mental and physical well-being. What but the idle, inefficient life thus rendered imperative is the cause of the vast amount of ill health showing itself in depression of spirits, nervousness, neuralgia, now so common among our young women that a really robust girl is as great a rarity as was a delicate one in the days of our grandmothers. Not long since two ladies were conversing in the street, when the elder of the two, a very respectable matron, was heard to exclaim, "You have a pleasant home, child; why in the world aren't you contented in it? You ought to be!" The younger lady's face, earnest, spirited, full of character, was shaded with doubt and annoyance. Whatever her answer may have been, her bearing and expression fully justified the conclusion that she ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be contented at home, that a nobler, even if a more laborious, life awaited her abroad, and her own instinct was urging her to break away from idleness and the unnatural bonds which held her that she might seek the sphere for which she was well adapted and in which therefore she was surely needed. In short, why should any young woman, strong and healthy, between the ages of twenty and thirty years, remain at home? I limit the age because these years seem peculiarly the period of preparation for efficient labor in later life; and if a woman has controlled her time thus long she may reasonably be supposed to have acquired the firmness of purpose and
<pb n="264 The Woman's Advocate"/>
maturity of thought that will enable her to judge how she is in duty bound afterwards to employ herself. What law of nature requires that the young lady be provided for at home while the young man is away cheerfully, bravely providing for himself? When the Red-breasts reared a family in the old apple tree, and the children birds were fledged, did papa and mamma Robin peck young Cock Robin out of the nest, but suffer Miss Robin to plume her feathers on the mossy bough over above the Redbreast homestead, and receive dainty bits of insect and choice morsels of worm after she was able to fly and provide for herself? Truly any human being, whether Male or female, if possessed of the ordinary powers that distinguish man from the lower orders of life is without excuse if such powers are suffered to rust through idleness or are employed in any way save to the accomplishment of the greatest good in the broadest possible field! And is this at all incompatible with the rendering of any just claim a parent may hold upon his child? Who would question the duty of either son or daughter to guide with tenderest care the faltering steps of age down the hill of life? To recognize with grateful attentions the need of the parent who is sick, overtaken by poverty or crushed beneath some deep affliction? Who would not honor the strong man or, the loving woman that puts resolutely aside the hope of personal gain in order to be quite devoted to the father or mother in actual want of such assistance! But is it not true that the forgetfulness, perhaps sometimes the selfishness, of parents in comparative ease and comfort, is doing much to delay the long looked-for morn of woman's complete enfranchisement? Already the promise is dawning. The eastern sky brightens. There is a glory upon the hill-tops ; but that the sun shine forth in perfect, unsullied radiance, let the strong winds of justice and generous consideration waft afar certain mist clouds, which now slumber heavily upon the horizon.</p>

                        <head>PATIENT GRIZZLE.</head>
                        <p>FEW stories show more plainly how the mixed domain of morals and literature has been managed by the tyrant man than the story of patient <hi rend="italic">Griselda,</hi> borrowed by our old poet from the Italians, doubtlessly borrowed by them, too, for the story with all its revolting masculinity of cruelty must be world-old. Healthy, manly old Chaucer takes especial delight in it. The story, as I recollect it, not having my <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Pilgrims</hi> at hand, is briefly this: A certain nobleman, out of jealous suspicion of the real devotedness and self-sacrificing nature of his wife's love, or else out of the very naughtiness of his male heart, tries her patient fidelity by stealing from her her two children, stealing them in their first infancy, and persuading her that they are dead; then crowning the trial by repudiating her and, adding insult to injury, ordering her to be present at his second marriage to do honor to his new bride. Of course the revengeful poet rewards her with a pleasant surprise, her grown-up son and daughter being presented to her, and the lordly husband taking his poor ill-used old wife to his arms as the new bride, with whom he amiably means to be very happy ever after.</p>
                        <p>My thought goes just now in this direction as I hear of a lady similarly situated. Her amiable husband after a dozen years of marriage without complaint against her, walks off with a new wife, and kidnaps his children in quite the old lordly fashion. To be sure he does not ask the first wife to be present at his second marriage--that is not the custom in Fifth Avenue--but be asks her affectionately by letter to bestow her blessing upon the bigamy; and the lady has her opportunity of studying Chaucer to some purpose and playing Patient Grizzle to the life. May I say I am somewhat pleased that her inclinations tend in rather an opposite
<pb n="267 Patient Grizzle."/>
direction. I would like to express my satisfaction pretty strongly, before following out the strange reflections which the case in point suggests.</p>
                        <p>What did the old poets mean by this ideal? An ideal certainly: for, thank Heaven, there are no such women. And no woman could have imagined or written such a character. Something like to it indeed, occurs in George Sand's <hi rend="italic">Leone-Leoni;</hi> but there the sufferer is plainly meaned to exemplify the folly of infatuated love. But Chaucer's husband is a magnificent fellow in all but the husbandly relations; and the poet certainly means the wife as an example for all time. There is nothing like to it in womanly literature. George Eliot has in her <hi rend="italic">Romola</hi> some hard words against impatient wifehood, and well worth a man's or a woman's reading. Tito, however, is not a kidnapping father, and the reproof of the runaway Romola comes out of the mouth of Savonarola. Chaucer, I say, deliberately sets up his Griselda as a model. And what a model! A model of slavishness, if ever there was one! A model of servile submission, of cowardly surrender to evil for herself, not resisting it even for others, letting the tyrant take his own way, turning the cheek for a second and a third blow, encouraging oppression by a low mean acquiescence in it, and confounding good and evil by giving to the evil-doer the love and faithfulness which were all she could have given in most grateful recompense to even a devoted and self-sacrificing husband. So slaves make tyrants. Thank God! I say it earnestly, our women in these days are not of so slavish a mould. Nor can Christianity be now invoked to sanctify such wrong as this.</p>
                        <p>But--that invocation of Christianity a little disturbs the conclusion. When Christ was preached as the great exemplar, if submission to all manner of rulers, the cheek turned to the smiter, the patient, unresisting bearing of evil--hoping only to educate evil into good through long forbearance and absolute submission to it,--if this was to be inculcated as the highest manly virtue, it seems not very surprising that a poet should be logical enough--and not so very curiously or absurdly imaginative--to suppose that <hi rend="italic">the womanly should not be very different from the manly,</hi> certainly that the difference should not consist in the display of a more active, not to say brutal force. The man Christ necessitates the Christ-like
<pb n="267 The Woman's Advocate."/>
woman; and as male theologians had found the male Christ, the more femininely-natured poet naturally followed-with the female.</p>
                        <p>I am not about to argue against our Great Exemplar, nor am I going to expose a sneaking fondness for Griselda. It may be that I think John  Brown as great at Harper's Ferry as when be took that little black child in his arms, as Christ himself might have done, on his way to Calvary. It may be that, in my unregenerated condition thinking force is not always evil, I may esteem the hero as highly as the saint, and find none more saintly than poor fighting Joan of Arc in all the Calendar of the Canonized. Be it so, or not, that is not my present argument. What I would call attention to now is that, whether I like it or not, <hi rend="italic">the Griselda is the type of the Christian woman,</hi> and that (not to speak too seriously, nor too lightly either) on the good common ground of the equality of the sexes--what is good for the gander holds just equally good for the goose.</p>

                           <hi rend="italic">Women's Suffrage; the Reform against Nature. By Horace Bushnell.</hi>  184 <hi rend="italic">pp. New York: Charles Scribner &#x0026; Co.</hi>
                        </bibl>
                        <p>HAVING introduced himself to the reader in two short prefaces, more playful than grammatical, Dr. Bushnell enters upon his task with a statement that "power naturally runs to oppression, and man is gravitating towards some practice of wrong against women, all because the wrong is in him, and having the power must be somehow issued in the deed, even though he disavows it and protests he would not have it." Does Dr. Bushnell mean that "he protests" he would not have the <hi rend="italic">power,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">wrong?</hi> whichever it may be, as he only protests, but continues to have it,--the wrong, or the power, or both,--"it results that the lot of woman comes to be a lot of abridgment and suppression much more commonly than we have been observing ourselves." This he calls "<hi rend="italic">gravitating towards</hi> some practice of wrong."</p>
                        <p>That women's lot of suppression may not continue, their kind patron inquires, after bestowing upon them some little praise:-"So richly
<pb n="269 A Review."/>
gifted, have we still no further use to make of them, than to put an extinguisher on them?" He lifts the extinguisher a little and proposes to "use them" as deaconesses, and medical nurses, and silent, indoor lawyers, and as professors, even of mathematics, adding:--"If we undertake to legislate for them we must bow them gallantly forward into all best conditions and positions appropriate to their sex."</p>
                        <p>Having thus "prepared the question of suffrage," he says:--"Many persons who mistook their ground in opposing the abolition of slavery, are naturally shy of being caught again and are half ready to leap into the gulf of what they call the emancipation of woman before they can distinctly see the bottom of it." As it is safer for these Curtius' to see the bottom of the gulf before being swallowed up by it, he informs them that, "in the distinction between the reforms that go against Nature and the reforms that go with Nature, lies the question of the fearfully momentous question of woman's suffrage," and that in the abyss of this "question of be question," the American sun is likely to set; which seems to show that it must be very, very deep, and perhaps goes quite through to the Celestial Empire.</p>
                        <p>His next remark about the abyss is:--"The proposed reform is only a fair extension, or logically right version, of the American doctrine of rights; or, as it is sometimes put, of equal rights, natural rights, rights of equality;" and he acknowledges that "the advocates of women's suffrage have as good right to hold them in faith, and draw them into their particular applications, as many others have to hold them in faith and yet eschew the applications."</p>
                        <p>He asserts that "these rights were built up from below," (below what ?) "out of mere nature, " (why <hi rend="italic">mere</hi> nature ?) into a complete civil order, binding on each citizen, because general citizenship so orders and decrees," and pathetically adds:--"Even the really great mind of Locke took in somewhat of the infection without being aware of the sophistry and dangerous falsity covered up under these pretentious guises." He accuses "our fathers of the American revolution of being taken by these catch-words of liberty;" which accusation will probably so awaken every American conscience, that all the citizens of the United States will immediately rush to tear down the Stars and Stripes and repudiate a citizenship based upon "sophistry and dangerous falsity."</p>
                        <pb n="270 The Woman's Advocate"/>
                        <p>But even of they should continue to believe in men's equal rights to citizenship they need not accord suffrage to women, because Dr. Bushnell thinks, "women may not be equal to men; they may be superior or inferior but are probably unlike, and had therefore best stand back from an claim of right in the public administration of laws."  Yet he has just said that "the proposed reform is only a fair extension, or logically right version of the American doctrine of rights." He now states that "we do not say a yard is equal to a pound, because the two measures have no common quality," Therefore a pound is to impound a yard, and men are always to govern women without their consent. To which statement does he intend to adhere; to his second, that "natural rights do not exist,"--or to his first, that if they do exist "they should logically be extended to women,"--or to his third, that women, being yards, and not pounds, have no rights?</p>
                        <p>He now tells us: "The right to vote is not grounded in nature because no man has yet discovered it twisted in among our functions and rational categories," and continues: "Some will imagine that the payment of taxes involves a right of representation; but who has ever imagined, till quite recently, that such a right must accrue on the payment of taxes; and it is not to this day discovered, that women paying taxes have, by consequence, a tight of representation." No one can read the journals without knowing that this discovery has been made by women, and for  women, and is considered an equal right for both men and women, by just persons.</p>
                        <p>He argues thus: "If the great law of consent constitute a legitimate government, there has never been one; because no fifth part of our people, in fact, ever consented to government. Minors, women, invalids, absentees, voters of the opposing party,--take these away, and how much of consent is left?" The inference is that women must not ask to vote, because there has never been a legitimate government, because they never have voted. They are classed with minors, (children,) with invalids, (lunatics and idiots,) with absentees, (absent from their own choice,) and with voters of the opposite party, who yet are voters. Is this a just classification? and is there not a long stretch between babies on one side and voters on the other?</p>
                        <pb n="271 A Review."/>
                        <p>The result he obtains from these arguments is, that "if women can only make it appear that they themselves will be put into a more favorable condition of life and character, by thus opening the political arena to them we shall even deem the controversy, if there be a controversy, to effectually ended."</p>
                        <p>Having thus leaped into the abyss from which he so graphically recoils a previous chapter, he endeavors to uphold himself from falling through to the Celestial Empire by quotations from Scripture.</p>
                        <p>As "Scripture authority" is often quoted against the rights of women, they have a right to ask in what that authority consists. Why should a few men, who lived some eighteen hundred years ago, and were full the prejudices of their age and country, be referred to as authority, direct or indirect, on a great practical question of the present day? Living in an age when the world has attained greater liberty than in that of Paul, having carefully and candidly studied the subject of political rights, with access to the theories and experience of all nations and ages, is not John Stuart Mill a better authority upon this subject? Mr. Mill believes that it Is a great wrong to hold women in subjection; Paul believes that a state of subjection is according to their nature. What have they themselves to say upon the matter? Mrs. Mill writes: "A whole half of the human race is even now passing through life in a state of forced subordination and a large number of women, both in America and England, have asked for a right to vote; thus we see that women themselves know the subjection to be forced which Paul considers natural.</p>
                        <p>Having quoted Paul's harsh dictates to women, Dr. Bushnell kindly consoles them thus: "For one, I have a considerable satisfaction in having women; just such, I mean, as can be and love to be women. I want them exactly not to vote, not to govern, but to do the disinterested part of the world's life, and then we are sure that there is something great in the world." Does the right of suffrage prevent men from being disinterested? If so, why does not Dr. Bushnell relinquish it? Perhaps because this abnegation, being voluntary, on his part, would not ensure subjection, which he considers the high road to exaltation.</p>
                        <p>As an Irish father points to a bit of suspended bacon while starving his children on small potatoes, thus does Dr. Bushnell point to heaven,
<pb n="272 The Woman's Advocate."/>
with an air of easy congratulation, and announce to women that, "the complementary natures are on hand there," (by this familiar phrase making us feel quite at home in that hitherto unknown region,) "and women break into eminence there, and are put into the tier of power and honor," because they were kept in subjection in this world. We do not see the argument, but the women who do and who are ambitious, and who prefer two birds in the bush to one in the hand, must rejoice in their present "lot of abridgement and suppression;" while those who do not desire, either in this world or the next to be "set in the tier of power," but simply to receive equal rights with others, will turn away from Dr. Bushnell's "glittering generality" of bacon and ask for legal rights instead of legal suppression.</p>
                        <p>There is a queer, <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> religious sentiment, stirred into this book which can only be detected by a certain oiliness that prevents it from mixing with the subject matter. For instance, we come upon this exclamation: "Oh! if there was nothing in this world but these workers in will, and war, and wrong, called men, it would be a most unblest and wretchedly dry concern. Nothing can ever lift the picture till a subject nature appears, milder, truer, and closer to the type of God's own dear submissions in the cross of his Son ; allowing us to bless our sight in the beholding of so many women by graces and benignities of self-forgetting love." Piety by proxy often goes by fine names; but is it humane to turn women out into the darkness to shiver in the blasts of a bitter superstition? And again :--"But there is an aspect of privilege, in this matter of subordination, which instead of inferring the inferiority of women, gives them, when morally considered, the truest and sublimest conditions of ascendency." This is very mean reasoning for men to indulge in with regard to women and slaves; reasoning which they would not accept for themselves. If a woman chooses to adopt it for herself, let her do so, and sell her birthright,--for what?--for something so intangible that it can only be perceptible to the initiated. But why should any one wish her thus to believe that suffrage is a question of mysticism, and not of common sense? Why twist physical force on one side into a morbid spirit of self-abnegation on the other?</p>
                        <p>That women maybe induced to cease their "clamorings for legal rights, and be satisfied with those doled out to them by a government in
<pb n="273 A Review."/>
which they are not represented, Dr. Bushnell proposes to bribe them with very hard and influential work; particularly with the care of common schools. Does he not fear that labor so important, requiring intelligent observation and a nice sense of justice, may develop character and claims for right in many who are now living in a state of abject frivolity? Let him leave them their coral and bells, if he wishes them to remain among babes and idiots.</p>
                        <p>He says: "If Jenny Lind had been able to get the place of Port Warden at Gottenburg, I do not see that her political success would have done much for her." Dr. Bushnell knows very well that a right to vote does not prevent him from singing, year in and year out, if he pleases, without fear of being made President; and why should it force Jenny Lind to abdicate her right of song and have office thrust upon her?</p>
                        <p>He says that women are represented by their husbands and yet, that "one of their misfortunes is their subjection, so often, when married, to an overbearing tyrant will they have no counter-force to resist." Does this tyrant will adequately represent them? and by whom are unmarried women represented? By some hocus-pocus, he arranges that they shall be represented by men in general, yet avows that, "full three-quarters of these men, who get stuck in their bachelor life, can never in their lives muster courage for an advance, just because the shrine has too much divinity in it for their mortal approach." Must not these divinities consider their worshipers as rather distant, ghostly, uncomprehending representatives? Presently he turns the mirror, to show that it is the glory of women to idolize men. All this idolizing and idealizing may exist on both sides, among enthusiastic people, but it does not prove that either represent the other.</p>
                        <p>Now comes another bit of exhortatory sentiment:--"Alas! that so many women, some of them really gifted women, do not conceive at all what it is to be elected to the dreadful lot of violence and tyrant cruelty endured." They do conceive, but too well, that this "election" means a wretched fate, which men may force upon them individually, but should never confirm by law, or public opinion, which is partly the result of law. If the law gives power to the "tyrant" in addition to his own strength, to whom can women appeal for protection? To the law, which he, among others, has made for her, simply because he is stronger than she is? The
<pb n="274 The Woman's Advocate"/>
subjection of women Is, in fact, a military despotism. Dr. Bushnell says they are ruled by the look of force. If so, it is, of course, only because they fear the exercise of it.</p>
                        <p>He believes that nomination to office will necessarily follow suffrage, and that women have not the personal dignity and air of command requisite for office. Many women have both the habit and air of command, while many men are elected to office who have neither; so this argument has little weight. The fear that women will rush into office is superfluous. As a general thing they will not wish for it; and except by some chance, such as has been known to occur with regard to men, they will not be elected unless they are particularly well qualified, men having the prestige.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bushnell gives a vivid description of the evil results to be expected from the meeting of men and women at the ballot box; but as he was once shocked even by the rumor of their joining in University studies, and afterwards became convinced that the system was beneficial to both, let us hope that experience may again cause him "the loss of a considerable cargo of wise opinions." Undoubtedly, some difficulties will arise in determining the best methods for women to vote; but perhaps no more than in any emancipation. Shall half the human race be kept always in subjection, for fear of some temporary perplexities, when we have proved that slaves can be freed without any consequences ensuing as evil as their slavery?</p>
                        <p>Another uncomfortable fear expressed, is, that when women become legalized persons, they will all wish to be Presidents and Governors; or that,--even if they are contented to vote for their representatives, --they will cause family disputes by voting differently from their husbands. If government be instituted to prevent family quarrels, it should prohibit tough beefsteaks, and elaborate upholstery, and dressmakers' bills, which are much more likely to excite angry contention, than the exercise of judgment as a citizen. Some foolish, headstrong men may insist upon their wives voting as they vote, but these same men would insist still more upon some other unreasonable thing, if their wives were legally in their power. But Dr. Bushnell wishes all insistance to be upon one side with no resistance upon the other. Does he candidly believe it an advantage to men thus to legalize self-will? and to women, to be deluded
<pb n="275 A Review."/>
victims, or hypocritical flatterers? There are many husband and wives who could differ all their lives in political, as well as in religious views, without one word of contention. Their affection is deepened by their mutual respect, and they do not believe in the "absurd but touching idolatry," with servile self-sacrifice on one side, and the pompous condescension with domineering exaction on the other, which seem to constitute Dr. Bushnell's ideal of marriage.</p>
                        <p>His ideal condition of the human race is that one-half should always represent the other; but as such unrestricted power "naturally runs to oppression," will he not permit the two halves to alternate in representing and being represented, from century to century? No, he insists that the same half must always be in subjection because it is not so large and brawny as the other, and because it always has submitted, and loves to submit, and Paul says it must submit, and submission is its glory; and because it is clamorous, and is not a sounding trumpet, and is not Sinai, nor thunder, nor a dahlia, and because it can easily disguise itself, and there are wicked men and women in the world, and because husbands want an "anchor-element" at home, and because of the Bushnell veto; "I object." For these reasons, women must remain in bondage so long Time shall endure.</p>
                        <p>A man who believes in ambition for power over others, in personal influence, whether right or wrong, in debasement of one person before another, in legalized selfishness, in assertion instead of reason, in preaching down sad, conscientious appeals for just rights, should not write about Freedom. He has yet to learn that human nature is the same in all human beings, whether their fists be little or large.</p>
                        <p>Yet Dr. Bushnell will withdraw his veto and accord political existence to women if they can prove "that they themselves will thus be put into a more favorable condition of life and character." This has been done in an able essay by Mrs. John Stuart Mill; and every woman of good sense can assure him that a life-long and hopeless subjection cannot be a condition as favorable to life and character as that of equal freedom and equal rights; therefore he is bound by his promise to cease advocating the classification of women among "idiots and lunatics."</p>
                        <p>Dr. Bushnell says that he "partly waited for the forthcoming book promised by Mr. Mill." He has probably since read it and regretted that
<pb n="276 The Woman's Advocate."/>
he had not wholly waited for a book which renders his own unnecessary.</p>

                        <head>TULLIVER'S PHILOSOPHY.</head>
                        <p>"DID you ever bear the like on't?" said Mr. Tulliver as Maggie retired,--"it's a pity but what she'd been a lad. She'd ha' been a match for the lawyers--<hi rend="italic">she</hi> would! It's a wonderful thing," here he lowered his voice,--"as I picked her mother because she wasn't o'er cute, being a good-looking woman too, and come of a rare family for managing. But I picked from her sisters o' purpose 'cause she was a bit weak like, for I wasn't going to be told the rights of things by my own fireside. But you see when a man's got brains himself there's no knowing where they'll run to; an' a pleasant sort o' a soft woman may go on breeding you stupid lads and cute wenches, 'till it's like as if the world was turned topsy-turvy. It's an uncommon puzzling thing."--<hi rend="italic">George Eliot's Mill on the Floss.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Was there ever more philosophy crowded into one sentence than that excellent and pithy writer has here put into the mouth of Mr. Tulliver? Possibly the Todds and Bushnells, not to mention scores of others, who
<pb n="278 The Woman's Advocate."/>
feel that the present excitement among women, and to them "onpleasantness," is unaccountable--who can't possibly comprehend why the women will not be "content within their sphere"--why they can't all be "housekeepers"--might be enlightened if they would but study the subject a little from Mr. Tulliver's stand-point. They might find that "the sin of the fathers" had visited the daughters. How many great and wise men do you and I know, Mr. Editor, who have married a woman for her pretty face, or for her "managing," who was "weak-like," thinking that there was no use for brains but on one side of the house, and found when too late, like poor Tulliver, that the girls were cute and the boys, the opposite.</p>
                        <p>And will a wise, thinking man continue to assert that, when, through a law of nature and of God, a child is born into the world, inheriting his own mental powers, his genius, taste for fine arts, his mathematical force, his mechanical precision, his musical taste, his logical brain,--that that child, because It is born of the female sex, shall bury all these God-given talents in a napkin? Nothing seems more clearly apparent than that nature is continually seeking an equilibrium; and it seems to me nothing is more sure to turn the world "topsy-turvy" than for the wise men who have "brains" themselves to cry out, and that continually, against the possession of the <hi rend="italic">article</hi> in a woman who is to be a life-long companion. "Deliver us from a 'blue-stocking,'" was the cry some forty years since : "we want women to soften our cares; to play with us and amuse us, not to <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> with us and <hi rend="italic">think</hi> with <hi rend="italic">us</hi>--to make home cheerful for <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> to cook for us, etc.</p>
                        <p>When a learned Judge in Ohio, twenty years ago, received a petition with the name of every respectable woman in the town appended, beseeching him not to license certain liquor dealers in their neighborhood, he read a few words of it and threw down the paper with contempt, saying: "he perceived it was a petition from women; he would advise them to keep in their legitimate sphere; attend to the bouquets in the parlor, and broil the beef-steaks in the kitchen, and he would attend to the license laws."--And <hi rend="italic">he did,</hi> and many a mother's son went through the fearful door which he opened, and down the dark steps into perdition.</p>
                        <pb n="279 Thrown Upon the World."/>
                        <p>Do men expect to be wise and strong to assert themselves; to live out their highest ideals, and to entail none of their energy upon their daughters? Are women to be asked to be industrious, earnest, educated; to fill out the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> measure of their ability, according to man's requirements, and never to think or act independently <hi rend="italic">except</hi> when he <hi rend="italic">wills?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The arguments against "Suffrage for Women," of the present time, seem to us who desire that right, to be simply puerile. A woman who as to earn her own bread, pay her own taxes; reads the paper and thinks for herself, will fail to see why voting is any more out of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sphere, than her brother's,--especially if she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> inherited her father's brains, and he has <hi rend="italic">not.</hi>

PART FOURTH.</head>
                        <p>WHEN George De L'Estrange parted from Marian Eveleth, on the day memorable in both of their lives, it was with emotions powerful as strange to his nature. As the removal of the surface earth reveals, ofttimes the rarer ore concealed beneath, so the sweeping away of the grosser elements of his nature, by the purer influences by which he had lately been surrounded was revealing depths of thought and aspirations of which he hitherto had been wholly unconscious.</p>
                        <p>Wondrous indeed was the transformation going on within his mind. The gay, careless reporter, the flattered, <hi rend="italic">feted</hi> representative of the press, who had turned carelessly often and often from the presence of wit and beauty, the thousand bewildering allurements of the world of wealth and fashion, was beginning to realize that there was something In life more worthy of gaining than the hollow applause which hitherto had satisfied his nature, and had learned to prize the hardly-obtained approbation which came from the lips or looked at times from the dark-brown eyes of an obscure daughter of toil. To what all this novel development of feeling would lead--whether he could hope, in the end, to awaken in Marian Eveleth warmer sentiments than calm regard--he did not pause to inquire. He was only conscious of an intense desire
<pb n="280 The Woman's Advocate."/>
to win esteem where none had been entertained, and to remove the unfavorable impression which the knowledge of past excesses had left upon a mind noble and unhesitating in pronouncing judgment upon frailty or weakness. To show Marian Eveleth that he was something more than the light trifler he had been considered--by nobler deeds and higher life to extort as it were her friendship--was now the one purpose of his mind, to carry into effect which he was ready to turn his back upon all that hitherto had seemed fairest or most attractive for the moment in life.</p>
                        <p>For this evening--the last in America--De L'Estrange had an invitation to a grand up-town reception, which he was in no mood to accept. Better feelings stirred some of the old chords of affection, and, dispatching his business at the office of <hi rend="italic">The Universe,</hi> he sallied out in the gloom of the evening to visit an aged relative, an aunt who had been kind to him in his well-nigh uncared-for, motherless boyhood. To reach her residence De L'Estrange had to penetrate the mazy labyrinth of streets honeycombing the east side of the metropolis, and familiar as he was with every by-lane and thoroughfare, the way had never seemed more gloomy or tedious, in his frame of mind. Good Miss Dermot, one of the much ridiculed yet noble sisterhood of spinsters, lived alone in her liliputian cottage, hers by freehold right, the legacy of a long-departed relative. Strongly attached to it, and to the neighborhood in which she had resided from a child, she had resisted all importunities upon the part of her nephew and others to sell or rent her cottage and remove to some more healthful and safer locality, preferring to end her days where so many quiet years of her life had been passed. Arriving at her residence, De L'Estrange spent a pleasant evening with his sober, common-sense relative, deriving more than ordinary pleasure from her quaint remarks, replete with homely wisdom. When he rose to take his leave, after his contemplated journey had been fully discussed, his aunt accompanied him to the door, and, laying her hand affectionately upon his shoulder, said:</p>
                        <p>"Georgie! you are getting famous now and, maybe, the words of your old aunt may fall on your ears lightly; but she has not known and watched you from a boy to fail now to read your nature, and she can
<pb n="281 Thrown Upon the World."/>
see, by every word and look, that some influence, powerful for good is at work in your mind. O, my boy, as you love the true, as you revere the memory of your mother, my own dear, dead sister, I conjure you never to banish that influence which, if you treasure it, will shield you from all of ill! From whence it comes I do not know, nor will I seek your confidence. Enough it is there, and that so long as it abides with you, you are safe from the numberless temptations of the great world which you roam so much!"</p>
                        <p>Powerfully affected by the touching earnestness of her appeal, De L'Estrange uttered a few reassuring words bent to kiss the quivering lips that vouchsafed such affectionate warning, and again strode out into the murky night.</p>
                        <p>"She lives at the 'Home,'" he murmured softly, as he walked briskly along the well-nigh deserted thoroughfare, "and I am 'lorn lover' enough to go a block or two out of my way, as Shakespeare says,
<q direct="unspecified">"'To moon beneath her window.'</q>
although-"-as the ludicrousness of the idea appeared to him--"slight chance there would be, among three-score, of knowing her apartment." </p>
                        <p>Acting upon the sudden impulse, he turned into the narrow street which led direct to the "Home," and leisurely walking, was indulging in a pleasing revery, when his quick ear caught a cry as of distress, seemingly some two or more squares in advance of him. Too familiar was De L'Estrange with such sounds to doubt that a fellow creature was in some peril. Without waiting for a repetition of the cry, he bounded forward, guided in the direction by the sound, his ear strained to catch again what to his excited fancy, seemed a tone strangely familiar. Gaining the spot from whence the scream had seemingly proceeded, he paused a moment, when the sound of quick retreating footsteps up the adjacent alley caught his ear, mingled with suppressed curses, as of men compelling unwilling action, or committing some deed of violence. To bound through the narrow passage-way was but the work of a moment for De L'Estrange. From the time when a street-boy he had lost no opportunity of practicing at boxing, to later years, when he had familiarized himself with the best sword and pistol practices of half the galleries of Europe, the "manly art," properly restrained, had been a passion with De L'Estrange; and a dozen situations of peril, through which
<pb n="282 The Woman's Advocate."/>
he had passed unscathed, had attested to the value of those early lessons of self-defence. As, with blood already beginning to course more hurriedly, De L'Estrange pressed close upon the party, which the reader has already surmised as the assailers of Marian Eveleth and her companion, the thick gloom slightly lifted, enabling him to see the two girls in the grasp of four ruffians, by whom they were being borne rapidly in the direction of the river. One glance at the tall, slender figure of the nearer girl, whose cloak had been torn from her person in her unavailing struggles to escape, afforded recognition; and one leap, the first intimation of pursuit to the ruffians, planted De L'Estrange by their side. Better had it been for those revengeful, luckless compositors that type had never been touched by them than thus to have drawn down upon their heads the full measure of wrath and punishment from the hand of George De L'Estrange. Once, twice, thrice, the swift blow descended. No attempt was made at resistance. It was all the work of a moment. The wretches stood as paralyzed, going down one by one, as beeves, to the pavement. But as the third measured his length, the remaining villain sufficiently recovered from his astonishment to take suddenly to his heels, leaving without thought his comrades, in the wild desire to escape such summary punishment. The girls were saved. Excitement had kept both from sinking while in the clutches of the ruffians, but when relieved of the bandages which had been placed over their mouths to prevent their giving alarm, and realizing that they were indeed safe, the highly wrought tension suddenly relaxed, and sweet Lizzie Fay, with a moan, slipped insensible to the pavement, while Marian leaned against the rude wall almost overcome by exertion, and the thought of the fearful danger through which she had passed.</p>
                        <p>De L'Estrange knelt by the insensible girl, lifted her head gently to his knee, and aided by Marian, who had quickly regained her wonted composure, and the little knot of persons attracted to the spot by the sound of the disturbance, soon had the satisfaction of seeing her sufficiently recover to be able to rise, and seek Marian's side, as though that of her natural protector. The policeman first on the spot had summoned his fellows, a squad of whom arrived in season to convey the now rapidly recovering assailants to the nearest station, against whom an appearance was promised the following morning, and De L'Estrange
<pb n="283 Thrown Upon the World."/>
volunteered to escort the girls to their home, they having assured him that they could easily walk the little distance remaining.</p>
                        <p>But little was said in that homeward walk. There are times, when the heart is too full for words, and as De L'Estrange, his handsome face flushing with the exercise he had undergone, walked between the two friends,--one of whom at least clung closely to his arm,--a forced listener to the thanks which their overflowing hearts could not repress, he blessed the Providence which had led him to the spot, the while inwardly rebuking himself for the selfish thought that in the events of the evening lay another chance to win the favorable regard of Marian Eveleth.</p>
                        <p>"I will not see you again, I suppose, previous to my departure," he said as he lifted his hat in adieu to them at the door of the "Home." "A part of my morning must be devoted to disposing of that petty police case so neither of you need give it further thought, and I must be on board the <hi rend="italic">Baltic</hi> at midday. But I shall hope often to hear from you through our mutual friend, good Mr. Jobson, and, in turn, when yon read my <hi rend="italic">Universe</hi> Letters you can recall our last meeting and my pugilistic prowess."</p>
                        <p>Thus gaily concluding, he stepped lightly to the street, lost in a moment in the gloom but the picture he made standing in the lighted doorway, the wind tossing the long, black hair from the fresh, ruddy cheeks and the questioning look of his yet darker eyes,--was one indellibly daguerreotyped upon Marian's memory, to be pleasurably recalled in many an after-time revery.</p>

                           <p>THE recent atrocious conduct of the medical students of Philadelphia, at the clinical lectures of the Pennsylvania Hospital of that city, with the details of which our readers are familiar, has met with justly-deserved censure from almost the entire newspaper press of the country. So disgraceful, indeed, was the outrage perpetrated, that even the most conservative journals have been moved to express their abhorrence of the cowardly act. In this city, no paper has lifted its voice save in condemnation. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> has stigmatized the action in its strongest language, and even the <hi rend="italic">News</hi> cried, Shame.</p>
                           <p>That Philadelphia medical students were ever famed for refinement or true manly sentiment, those who knew the city in the days when its colleges were largely filled with the worst type of Southerners, who gave their peculiar tone to those institutions and carried their ribaldry, indecency, and even violence beyond their halls, to annoy peaceable citizens, will not pretend to say; but until their disgraceful treatment, on November 6th, of the students of the Women's Medical College of that city, who had complied with every formality and had an equal right to the benefit of the course of lectures, we had no idea that they were capable, in this more enlightened day, of downright brutality.</p>
                           <p>That a narrow professional jealousy was at the bottom of the Pennsylvania Hospital outrage is clearly evident. More, perhaps, than any calling to which the liberal tendency of the age has invited woman, the profession of medicine, through those who have embraced it, desiring selfishly to retain it as a monopoly for a sex, has resisted her approach. This feeling of intolerance and illiberality, upon the part of medical practitioners, exhibited not only when a dogma is questioned, but in the sick room, in every walk of life, towards those who come into competition with them, while it accounts for the slow progress which has been made by medicine in attaining the position of an exact science, furnishes the

best possible argument for women physicians, <hi rend="italic">not only for the benefit of a Profession, but of Society.</hi> We are glad to know that since the disgraceful occurrence of November 6th, the pressure of public opinion has been so strong that the disgraced young men, at a subsequent lecture, were compelled to an outward show of decency,--the students of the Women's Medical College with commendable spirit persevering in their laudable intention to attend the "lectures" and reap the full benefits of thorough Medical education. That, there or elsewhere, they will surely receive. Nothing is more certain than that hereafter both in this country and in Europe, there will be an increasing number of skilled, qualified women physicians. She has conquered her place in the medical fraternity, and no door of science can be so barred as to long exclude her. In the irresistible march of progress, the inevitable must be submitted to. The puny efforts of a few students to throw an obstacle in the way, are of as little avail as were the monarch's command to the tide that approached his feet.</p>
                           <p>But be the conduct of those boorish young men in the future what it may, it will be long before the disgrace, which they have brought upon an honored Institution and a high calling which they have chosen, will be suffered to be forgotten in the minds of all well-disposed members of Society. The chivalrous treatment of women by American gentlemen has frequently won the admiration of foreigners. Hereafter, Philadelphia medical students cannot be held to belong to that class; for by their conduct they have forfeited all claim to the title of American gentlemen. Of the darker stain thrown upon some of the Medical Colleges of Philadelphia by the alleged unscrupulous practice of their faculties in <hi rend="italic">selling</hi> diplomas and other venal acts, grave reports of which reach us through the press, we forbear at present to speak; but we call upon Philadelphians who hold as dear the good name of the city of Rush and Parrish--whose legacy from the Past is so illustrious--to see to it that her once honored institutions become not a hissing and a reproach for their corruption, and that the olden name it bears for sobriety, liberality and public spirit be still maintained.</p>

                           <head>WENDELL PHILLIPS ON THE "WOMAN QUESTION."</head>
                           <p>IT was our privilege, a few evenings since, to form one of the large audience which gathered at Steinway Hall, in this city, to listen to WENDELL PHILLIPS in his new lecture, "The Question of Tomorrow."</p>
                           <p>After well-nigh thirty years of tried, apostolic service in the lecturing field, during which period countless new favorites, with the newer generation have risen to enjoy their little reign of popularity with the fickle American public, WENDELL PHILLIPS stands confessedly the first of lecturers. The once most obnoxious of Reformers, the man regarded as the very embodiment of the idea to stifle which, in days past, men deemed no indignity or outrage too condign a punishment, lives to find his life-work justified, and to be followed by multitudes, who hang upon his utterances--that indescribable blending of logic, appeal or pitiless sarcasm--as upon the words of no living orator. There is poetic justice in the triumph. The man who, through sublime devotion to a principle, held as naught the good or ill opinion of men, finds, even in his day, in the praise bestowed, the earthly reward of heroism, and lives--the more fitted for new work--an illustrious example to the Martyrs of the Future who must catch up the sacredly-transmitted Word and Torch which are yet to lift to a loftier plane the world.</p>
                           <p>In his new lecture Mr. PHILLIPS, in treating the "Question," presented the three cardinal reforms,--TEMPERANCE, LABOR, WOMAN. Around these three central questions, with consummate art, the speaker grouped the proper subordinate issues, presenting each as a distinct whole, with the brilliant, shifting kaleidescope of coloring which learning, research, fancy, all suggested, to impress or illuminate the particular theme. As those melifluous sentences dropped from the lip, and the speaker passed from point to point of his address, it was highly interesting to note the reception of those advanced ideas by the cultured, critical assemblage, constituting one of our finest metropolitan audiences. Seated, chance-directed, by the side of one whose woman name is almost as familiar to the public ear as that of the peerless orator, we compared notes, mutually agreeing that no portion of the eloquent address drew

forth more hearty or seemingly spontaneous applause than the touchingly moving plea for the Rights--Legal, Social and Political--of Woman. In itself the applause bestowed upon a lyceum speaker is of little moment, but it is significant of the advance of a cause until recently odious with the masses, when a fashionable assemblage, from the lips of a speaker banned himself well-nigh a generation from favor, listen rapturously to sentiments hitherto scoffed at in public or by the home-altar. But the world moves. Of earnest, pledged adherents to the cause of Woman Suffrage, the roll of illustrious names already far exceeds the anticipations of its most sanguine advocates; and the impression deepens, with all thoughtful minds, that the hour which sees the extension of the ballot to the Mothers, Wives and Daughters of the land cannot long be deferred.</p>
                           <p>With WENDELL PHILLIPS, as with Abolitionists as a body, Woman's Rights," in all its significance, is no new <hi rend="italic">tenet of faith.</hi> Imbibed simultaneously with his Anti-Slavery convictions, Mr. PHILLIPS has been constant, in season and out of season, in avowing his belief in the necessity of the recognition of the full Legal and Political Equality of Woman, and the cause, so rapidly absorbing the best brain of the Nation, may justly count him as a pioneer worker and one of its chiefest ornaments.</p>

                                    <salute>MY DEAR MRS. STOWE:</salute>
                                    <p>Ever since I rode from Hartford to Waterbury, last August, reading, in the cars, your article in reference to Lord and Lady Byron, I have felt a desire to write to you and express my sense of the propriety of penning such a statement, and the emotions with which, as a woman and a Christian minister, I read it.</p>
                                    <p>I felt assured that you would never have given it to the public without evidence, sufficient to your own mind, of its truthfulness, and of course I was pained to find that Byron was even more wicked than the world had before believed. But Lady Byron was vindicated, and there was pleasure in that thought. The argument that some of the press have used in condemnation of your course, is no argument, viz., That Byron's works will thereby gain increased circulation, for the antidote would go with the poison, and then neither you nor I have any objection to the spread of all that was good in his writings. The world must learn to sift--to accept the wheat and throw the chaff away.</p>
                                    <p>With my religious convictions I am willing that truth and error should have a fair field, for truth must win the victory. All that is genuine poetry--real in operation--will live and will bless his readers, whether he was good or not, and, thank Heaven! the angel that Lady Byron believed was in her unfaithful husband, had power enough to conquer the devil in him, I fully believe, when he crossed the river of death to that land where the temptations of the flesh are no more, and the grace and truth that come to earth by Christ has nothing to hinder its full triumph.</p>
                                    <p>I thank you then, as a woman, for thus defending the saintly but much abused Lady Byron. I thank you, as a minister, for so much in your article which shows your faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil, and I thank you, in both capacities, for telling "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," as I believe you have done.</p>
                                    <p>I believe in retributive justice, although I am a Universalist, and we are often falsely accused of believing and preaching that God winks at sin and does not punish sinners. And your article is a proof of the retributions of history--if I may so speak--and shows that "there is nothing hid that shall not be revealed," and "though hand join in hand the wicked shall not go unpunished."</p>
                                    <p>There are others whom the world has deified because of brilliant genius and mighty intellect of whom the truth ought to be told, that young men, especially, may take warning and be assured that neither Websterian powers, nor Byron genius are an excuse for vice or crime, and that licentiousness, like murder, "will out." We have bowed down to intellect long enough. It is time that goodness alone should be esteemed greatness. You have done much by your writings to hasten that day, and with all my heart I thank you and pray God to bless you evermore. </p>

SIR:--</salute>
                                    <p>I see in the June number of THE ADVOCATE which you so kindly presented me an extract of a lecture by Wendell Phillips, in which he says: So with the question of sex. As long as it can, as long as the question is undecided, the Church will hold its old position. But when the enfranchisement of women shall have been accomplished by secular hands, the Church will step forward and say, 'We always told you so; there is neither male nor female in Christ Jesus.'" I answer there is one church, the Methodist, which has always acknowledged that portion of her strength, her praying and <hi rend="italic">exhorting</hi> women, and in its early days women preached. The mother of the Wesleys herself preached to her husband's parish in his absence, and stoutly maintained her right to her own conscience by refusing to say amen to her husband's prayer for the king whom she did not consider the rightful sovereign. The Women of Methodism of these days, too, are struggling up to the pulpit, and they get there too, for one has already obtained license to preach. Can't you keep on your grand secular way, Mr. Phillips, and let the churches alone? We have ministers among us who are fighting for the Woman Question as you fought for the poor slave years ago almost single-handed, and have you no sympathy with them? <hi rend="italic">Church</hi> women, too, are aroused and coming along with the secular hosts, but <hi rend="italic">they</hi> come praying and believing that Jehovah marshals the moral hosts for any great revolution.</p>

                        <p>A YOUNG girl, Miss Nelly Mackay Hutchinson, made an excellent report of the recent Hartford Convention for the <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Tribune.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Miss Vinnie Ream is now in Rome, industriously engaged upon the statue of Abraham Lincoln. During her stay in Paris, she modelled busts of. Mrs. Fremont and Gustave Dor&#x00E9;. The latter took much interest in her, offering her room in his studio, and extending to her many courtesies and kind attentions.</p>
                        <p>Miss Edmonia Lewis, the colored sculptor, has departed for Rome to renew her studies. A farewell reception was tendered her in Boston, when a large number of her friends assembled to testify their respect and regard for the artist. In the course of the evening, Miss Lewis was publicly presented with a purse of money and an ivory mallet.</p>
                        <p>An industrial school for girls is to be established at Middletown, Conn., where a farm of forty-six acres, with a good house upon it, has been given for the purpose. The work of building two family houses has already begun. Nearly $70,000 has been raised for the fund, and more is promised. The State will pay the board (at $3 a week) of such girls as are sentenced by the judges of probate; but the school will be managed by a private corporation.</p>
                        <p>A Woman Suffrage journal of much promise, the prospectus of which is not yet issued, is to be established in Boston entitled the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Journal.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> which will have upon its editorial staff William Lloyd Garrison, Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Stone, Mary A. Livermore and T. W. Higginson, it is understood will be the organ of the New National Woman's Suffrage Association. Of course, with such a brilliant array of names a first position in literary rank is assured.</p>
                        <p>"The number of women studying medicine at the University of Munich," Bays the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> increases steadily in geometric progression. Four years ago there was but one, the next Year there were two, the next year four, last year there were eight, and there are now sixteen. "We are assured (it is true by a partisan of the movement) that none of the inconveniences which it was feared might arise from women being allowed to share the school with men have at present been experienced, the classes are as large as ever, and the Dean reports that the innovation has undoubtedly improved the discipline of the school."</p>

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Tribune</hi> which has won an enviable reputation among our metropolitan journals for its correspondence, is indebted largely to women pens for the peculiar vivacity and sparkle which characterizes that department. Last Summer Miss Field lent its columns more than ordinary interest by her "Adirondack Letters" and "Seaside Loiterings," and now the brilliant pen of Mrs. L. G. Calhoun is bringing the wonders of the Pacific slope to our gaze with a freshness that no Greeley or Richardson hitherto has excelled, if equalled. Yet though woman excels as a correspondent in the first of journals, its editor argues learnedly against her exercise of the ballot.</p>
                        <p>Julia Ward Howe is descended from an old soldier of Cromwell, who left his country because it became too hot to hold him. He married a daughter of Roger Williams, and became father of Richard Ward, Governor of the State, and the grandfather of Samuel Ward, a member the Continental Congress. The work that she daily does may seem almost incredible to ordinary mortals. She will superintend her domestic affairs, take a two-mile walk, a two-hours' dose of German Metaphysics, and receive half a dozen callers--and all before noon; and then will write poetry all the afternoon, and entertain all the evening a dozen "philanthropists" or prosy philosophers, who revolve round her very much as mice revolve round a cheese--just to get a nibble, now and then, at one of her strong bits of genius. She is rich; lives in good style in Boylston Place; is an affectionate wife, a devoted mother, and a Woman of the largest heart and broadest sympathies. She reads half a dozen languages; is familiar with Hegel, Compte, Goethe, Dante, Swedenborg, and all the great masters of song, faith and metaphysics.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. CHARLOTTE LOZIER of this city, the eminent physician and Dean of the Women's Medical College of New York, is entitled to public gratitude for upholding the dignity of the profession and administering a just rebuke to a wealthy Southerner, one Andrew Moran, who, with his victim, a relative, approached her to induce her to engage in malpractice. Although the infamous proposition was accompanied by the proffer of a large sum of money, Mrs. LOZIER unhesitatingly refused to accede to the villainous request, earnestly counselling the unfortunate girl against resorting to such a criminal and dangerous remedy, and lodging complaint against the seducer which, we trust, will result in his trial and punishment to the utmost extent of the law. This act upon the part of Mrs. LOZIER, although in keeping with her high character, is one of great delicacy, involving moral courage of no common order, but which,

as a duty to society, will be unflinchingly performed. Is it such ornaments as these to the profession those boorish young men at Philadelphia would exclude from medical practice?</p>

                           <p>Is there a nook or cranny in literature left uninvaded by the Woman Question?" Learned disquisition, stately history, florid romance, tender verse, all bow to the popular desire, and show alike the deep hold the question has taken on the public mind.</p>
                           <p>One of the latest contributions, of this form of literature, is the unique, fascinating poem, "The Woman who Dared, " from the pen of Epes Sargent, the well known poet, essayist and novelist. This thoughtfully considered story in verse, which has received the close attention of American critics and awakened the deep interest of the public, is one of those indescribable creations of genius of which no brief review can give an adequate idea. The life-history of Linda, the heroine of the pages, a type of the self-reliant, fearless, yet pure-minded American girl, is so charmingly narrated that the attention of even the most conservative reader will be retained and the interest remain concentrated upon the fortunes of the lovely heroine, leading her through a series of acts in which her <hi rend="italic">individualism</hi> is strikingly manifested, until the height of world-regarded glaring impropriety is reached by her unsolicited avowal of love to Charles Lothian, the object of her affection.</p>
                           <p>For those who read poetry merely for that sensuous delight which rests in highly-wrought figure or fanciful expression, this poem of Mr. Sargent's may fail to carry that pleasure which the Swinbourne school of verse ministers to; but the reader who, with the ornaments of rhyme, the sweet nothings that gratify for the moment, desires the more substantial food of healthful, vigorous, practical thought, will find in "The Woman who Dared " as rare a pleasure as any recently issued volume offers. The marriage relation, the intercourse between the sexes, all the vexed problems of the hour, have received Mr. Sargent's sympathetic, attention, and if it may not be said that he has presented a satisfactory solution for them all, he has at least furnished the public with food for close, earnest consideration. </p>
                           <p>The volume is neatly issued by the well-known publishers, Messrs. Roberts Brothers, and we trust will command an extensive sale.</p>

Whenever we glance over any of these richly colored, artistically designed publications we recall the days of childhood, and the few, plain-covered juvenile-books with which, in our country home, we were acquainted; and we wonder whether, after all, the younkers of the present derive any fuller enjoyment from the bewildering feast which the restless enterprise and Croesus-like purse of modern publishers places before them, than we elders from the few well-thumbed story books which rare good fortune threw in our path.</p>
                           <p>The present series are an admirable acting upon the modern theory of <hi rend="italic">placing the best</hi> before that keen critic, the juvenile reader. Each book in the <hi rend="italic">Uncle Sam Series</hi> is the best that pen, brush and handicraft in all detail can make it. <hi rend="italic">Rip Van Winkle's Nap</hi> is told in most charming verse by Edmund Clarence Steadman, and illustrated by S. Eytinge, Jr.; the <hi rend="italic">Story of Columbus</hi> is happily versified by J. S. Trowbridge, the sketching by Alfred Fredericks; <hi rend="italic">Putnam the Brave</hi> is fitly sung by R. H. Stoddard, the coloring by Fredericks, and the closing and most touching ballad of the series, the <hi rend="italic">Ballad of Abraham Lincoln,</hi> is tenderly unfolded by Bayard Taylor, the illustrations by S. Eytinge, Jr.</p>
                           <p>The enterprising publishers, Fields, Osgood &#x0026; Co., add to the weight of public obligation by the issue of this rare and beautiful series, which good Santa Claus should bestow upon the curly-headed inmates of every household in the land.</p>

BABY AND THE TWELVE ACRE LOT.</head>
                           <p>Two years have passed and a third Spring has come with its beauty as new and fresh as life is to every new being who enters upon it. Among the number of those who drop in upon us at every beat of the steady pulse of time, was a redfaced, wee baby who came nearly four month ago into the Reband household, to the satisfaction of all and the intense delight of the grandmother who rejoiced over a son and heir to inherit the brightened family prospects. The young parents look at the small thing in love and wonder, as most parents do at the first child, the father afraid even to touch it; and persisting in his fixed impression that it must be as brittle as it was soft. But all that feeling had long since passed away; for the plump, round baby, who held up his head, looking about the room so bravely and smiling in everybody's face, was a thing to be laid hold of in warm approval.</p>
                           <p>The family fortunes were steadily looking up. The pasture was well stocked with cows and the yard with poultry; and field after field. had been turned into rich and friable truck gardens. Two men and a boy were employed now to help in the fields, and a half-grown girl waited on baby, ran errands, and washed 
dishes. The sensible market woman had not wrought on with her usual unceasing<pb n="2 The Woman's Advocate"/>
toil in house and field before the birth of her child. She was too prudent thus to borrow from the energy due to her own future and to that of her unborn babe; yet through all the Summer and Fall, she and her pink sunbonnet were always at their post in the market, and her busy fingers had learned to ply the market knitting needles unceasingly while she waited for customers.</p>
                           <p>At home she kept the same alert oversight and its accompanying stimulants; but so without empressment were her suggestions, that they were often adopted under the fixed impression that they originated with the person chosen to put them into execution. Mrs. Reband, the elder, had ceased to feel mortified at the thought that her son's wife was a market woman, and had already grown even proud of her as an unusually successful and respected business woman.</p>
                           <p>Her own eyes bad beheld the unassuming dignity with which Susan maintained the respectability of her position; conducting all her negotiations in a straightforward and womanly way, which won a corresponding respect from others. Rich Mr. Verplank, their first and staunchest customer, had even driven out to see them; to admire their thrifty modes of farming, and to praise the plucky and sensible daughter-in-law to the old lady; and Mr. Verplank, in her eyes, was law and gospel high enough to satisfy any remaining scruples. His opinion was heavy enough to outweigh that of a dozen chatty, lightweighted neighbors.</p>
                           <p>John, like a magnanimous man as he was, had tried his hand also at marketing; but nature had never fitted him for the calling, and to him it was an annoying, perpetual cross,-though a cross which he took up and bore on bravely when the need came. To Susan it was much more like a crown; if there were some hard points in it which pressed at times sharply upon her brow, yet she was always compensated by the sparkle of the real jewels. For John to face a customer, asking the highest current price, was a trial; but to stand his price steadily when a poor woman begged to have just a penny or two thrown off, was next to impossible. It was harder to contend and chaffer with her than it would have been to receive a dozen pricks with a knife-point; and when be came off victorious, that was worst of all!  A sense of degradation clung to him which it seemed impossible to shake off. He rarely left the market without a feeling akin to that of Pontius Pilate when he washed his hands to testify his innocence to the people. He felt his weakness and admired his wife's strength. The easy .aptness with which she was able to meet every emergency without the least stress of self-compulsion, was his continual admiration; for he was a genuine and unquestioning lover. His Susan could touch pitch and yet not be defiled.  He thought of her as of a white lily he had seen anchored in a pond whose<pb n="3 The Market Woman."/>
muddy waters, stirred by the winds, washed over it perpetually without sullying its whiteness.</p>
                           <p>But it was useless to attempt to imitate her. And vain was it to reason on the subject or to try to slough off a sentiment so ingrained with all the tissues of his being. This endless dealing in trifling values must be chronically distasteful! To work hard and to live on coarse fire was quite possible and enjoyable, though he was really an ease-loving man by temperament; but he could overbear his own indolence, though he could not stand upright under the friction of that continual, "It is nought, it is nought, saith the buyer;" and the legitimate consequence was, that too often, when his customer was gone, he boasted. Yet for all this John was not the favorite with the buyers. They preferred the evenhanded independence of the genuine huckster, and would often pass the stall and go on farther if John were in waiting; while Susan's restful self-confidence as a dealer was magnetic, and her customers fell under the influence of it without resistance.</p>
                           <p>Neither John nor his mother could fail to discover that the profits fell away steadily whenever he acted as salesman, and that they always came up again as soon as Susan became saleswoman. Under these circumstances, when she proposed a return to the market as the Spring advanced, and she had regained her strength, while John still earnestly objected, with a chivalry worthy of one of the early knights, and an unselfishness akin to that of the first martyrs, his mother seconded Susan, declaring that Julie and she jointly could take care of the baby better than not, and that one bowl of pap daily at his acre would be greatly in favor of the little fellow's strength and digestion. So the experiment was tried, and as Johnnie the second continued to thrive, in confirmation of his grandmother's opinion, the market woman still pursued her calling.</p>
                           <p>At the close of this season they were all looking forward eagerly to the day when the last of the mortgage would be finally paid off. Two years and a half of almost uninterrupted profits had nearly realized this ardent wish of all their hearts. Everything which they had sold--raised on their own grounds and very largely the product of their own labor--had been almost net gain. On the other hand their purchases had been few--little more in fact than seeds for planting, and even these were frequently raised by themselves--a very inconsiderable amount of patent fertilizers, and some gardening implements. Clothing had been an unimportant item and largely home-spun and home-made.</p>
                           <p>Susan was a practical business woman of the pre-eminently safe type. She acted from a keen insight into the nature of all the factors which were to make up the sum total of results, and was never unpleasantly disappointed in her calculations; <pb n="4 The Woman's Advocate."/> the product was invariably larger than she ever ventured to suggest in words to others, or even in her own private estimate, though she always had a tacit understanding with herself that she hoped for a little more than she ever ventured to expect. These hopes were so almost unfailingly realized that there was always coming in a steady surplus fund over and above the family claim of rightful profits. This came as a free gift from Providence in reward for their modest faith, and was accepted by all with especial gratitude. Moreover our heroine was in no sense a speculative money maker. She allowed nothing for possible advance in values, while she always made an estimate of possible depreciations; acting invariably upon the rule not to venture anything unless it would eventuate in certain gain even at the very worst which could reasonably be anticipated.  Of course, If this gave little room for great brilliancy of operations, there was no credible chance of a disastrous issue. In addition to this, she kept steadily and closely to her own calling, never stepping outside in quest of opportunities for great gains, and never suffering herself to be beguiled by sudden riches. She felt herself to be a master in her own line--in any other there was room for doubt.</p>
                           <p>Insight and calculation were applied to the smallest details. In Summer their cows were largely fed from the succulent milk-giving refuse products of the garden, every leaf and weed being utilized either for them or the pigs, while grass, straw, and cornstalks were carefully cured for Winter use. In the Fall they bought calves, chiefly to be sold in the Spring for beef or young cows. Under their management some profit generally accrued from the sale over and above all cost of keep; while their grounds were thus steadily enriched, gratis, as it were, with almost no outlay for expensive fertilizers, which usually so largely reduce the net results. Every fowl was at least made to pay its own way, and its growth from chick to hen was clear profit. Thus it lived an independent bird as it went along, and when its end came, always presented itself as a plump legacy to its patrons; and the best hens even accumulated large surplus wealth. With so rigid a system of animal and vegetable economy as premises, the conclusion became a mathematical certainty. While not even a rooster was allowed to live who wouldn't pay his way by early crowing, thus saving the expense of an alarm clock, and no vegetable was suffered to cumber the ground if it couldn't draw up from hidden sources nutriment for man or beast, the whole farm was certain to be a well ordered working establishment, and sure to pay.</p>
                           <p>"A single hundred more, Susy, and all that is squared off," said John, as they counted over the last day's earnings. "How can we ever thank you?"</p>
                           <p>"Haven't we done it, John? Don't thank me! we work together."</p>
                           <pb n="5 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>"Yes, we do. I know that, but I know also that mother and I had been going steadily down for ten years; and that we have been going steadily up for less than three, and this is the result!"</p>
                           <p>"It is true, John, I am practical and a good manager. We won't lessen my virtues; but wait till I can learn a magnanimity such as you practice every day, and then you may praise me." Susan spoke in real humility; the tears gathering thickly in her eyes.</p>
                           <p>"Well, well, child," said the husband in a husky voice, we are both as God made us, and in the main trying to do the best we know how. But the day we pay that off we should keep, like the old Jews, as a perpetual holiday forever. We ought to make a grand feast with sugar, and tea, and coffee, and goodies  g generally. What do you say?"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, I am quite willing; but do you know I am thinking of something, John. The twelve acre lot is in the market--our old lot--for sale."</p>
                           <p>"So I heard to-day. Davis told me himself. He asks a hundred and twenty dollars an acre, after all the wood he has cut off, too, and we sold it to him for seventy-five. If we only could get it; but isn't the difference too much?"</p>
                           <p>"The times are changing, perhaps," she answered absently, and evidently carrying on a train of mental arithmetic.</p>
                           <p>John waited patiently a few moments, and then his own thoughts went off also in an eager reverie. "It is a part of the old homestead, and it almost broke my heart to sell it, for father's sake. If only we could have it all together again!" He looked into his wife's absorbed face, got up, walked the floor two or three times, and still waited in respectful impatience till Susan's eye cleared and she turned to seek him.</p>
                           <p>"Well, Susy, what is it? I would go on with the skim milk and potatoes if necessary for ten years longer, and work an extra hour every day to have the old farm whole again--if you don't mind. This may be the last chance, too, for Wilkins, I hear, stands ready to take it; but Davis promised us the first refusal if he ever wished to sell. Have they run the price up too high between them?"</p>
                           <p>"It may be they have; but I think, John, if we buy the lot at that price it will pay for itself, with our present way of doing things at least in six years."</p>
                           <p>"Ha! will it? can you make that clear. Then we have it, of course."</p>
                           <p>"I think so, and that we may also honestly begin to taste a little of our own butter and exchange it for groceries now and then. I want you to try for yourself, Johnniekin, whether my butter is really good or not. You have supposed so long enough on trust, I think."</p>
                           <pb n="6 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"We will keep our holiday, then, after all," said John, laughing and kissing his wife's hand, which was soft enough and fair enough to suit him in spite of all its toil. "But there will come pay days; and there must be five hundred dollars down, Susan. Those are the express terms, and I think Davis will not vary from them."</p>
                           <p>"Mr. Simpson has bought our red cow and calf, John, to-day, and paid a hundred and five dollars for them. I kept that as a tid-bit to the last. There is the money."</p>
                           <p>"Good, so the mortgage is squared off, if we choose to have it so. Now for the five hundred down, fairy godmother. Where will that come from?"</p>
                           <p>"Mr. Verplank has promised to lend it to us, taking only our joint note as security. I told him that the land was for sale, and that we were out of debt otherwise, but should have nothing over till we made it, and he never hesitated but said he would lend it and welcome; for he was not afraid to trust us. I knew how you felt about that twelve acre lot, and that the arrangement would suit you."</p>
                           <p>John stood without speaking, and swallowing hard to clear something from his throat. "Don't tell mother, Sue," be said at length, quietly, "till we have really bought the land. Can't you come at once?"</p>
                           <p>Susan retied her bonnet and they went out together, walking, across the field to the neighbor's house. The purchase of the coveted twelve acres was soon effected, an agreement to that effect was drawn up and signed, and something paid down to doubly bind the bargain; and husband and wife walked home again. Then John mounted his horse and rode away with the money in hand to pay off that old dreadful mortgage; and Susan quietly busied herself with cookery, greatly to the mother's astonishment, who began to suspect that something good was about to happen.</p>
                           <p>When her son came home and they told her all, the old lady first sat down and cried, and then rose up laughing and took her seat at the table, which was spread with the feast of rejoicing.</p>
                           <p>But the new luxury of the undivided homestead was not yet paid for.</p>

                           <p>"Well, it beats all how old Mrs. Reband can do it! So nice and particular as she used to be, always the daintiest one amongst us all, and so proud like. She used to think it was too hard for John to work in the sun, and now it seems they are all at it like so many grubs."</p>
                           <p>"Everything's changed with the old lady since she was a grandmother, I can tell you. She's like an old hen with her late summer's brood. It's business enough for her to keep 'em covered up with her old wings in the cold spells; and just moulting, it's likely. She's a real biddy."</p>
                           <p>"Seems wonderful, don't it?"</p>
                           <p>"She's just another woman ever since them children came, and don't care for much else."</p>
                           <p>"But making the girl into a boy beats all, and the only girl too, and they getting so rich. I don't understand it!"</p>
                           <p>"Mary was picking up potatoes and things all last Saturday, side by side with little John, and as far as I saw, neither of 'em stopped even to play the whole day long. They both go to weeding, or picking things, or something every night as soon as they get home from school; that's what they do, Mrs. Butts. Their mother never lets the grass grow under any of their feet, morning or night."</p>
                           <p>"Do tell! it's really past belief!"</p>
                           <p>"So it is almost. They're teaching that girl to hammer nails, and saw, and chop, and whittle, and make boxes, and everything; as if they meant to bring her up for a carpenter; and the boy washes dishes and pares the vegetables. Even the baby has a garden of his own, and a splendid little set of tools to work with, and he's a digging and digging from morning till night."</p>

                           <p>"They call him baby. His name is Henry; but be must be near five. Mary's ten and the boy eleven or twelve. They lost one, you know, with scarlet fever and whooping cough coming both together. He was next to Mary, and John's wife can't do too much if any of 'em are sick-that I say for her; but they never are sick, and when they are she doctors 'em all herself, for everything."</p>
                           <p>"You don't mean she doctored the one that died!" cried poor old Mrs. Butts, holding up her hands in purple horror.</p>
                           <p>"Oh no! not that one-not after it got the fever; but they all had the whooping cough together when the baby wasn't more than three months old, and a dreadful time they had of it. Up and down she was, night after night, and they all got about over it but that one; but he was a right smart little fellow, and he got out of doors one day in a dreadful March wind in April. He was pretty much sick before, so his mother rocked him to sleep and put him in bed and the baby<pb n="8 The Woman's Advocate."/>
was asleep too. So She went to tend to her butter-she's a master butter hand, everybody says that--and the old lady was busy and the other children at school. Pretty soon the little fellow coughed himself awake, he said, so what did he do but get up and paddled out barefooted and nothing on his head, in the wind, and go to play by himself as still as a mouse.</p>
                           <p>"By-and-bye she went to look if the children were all right and covered up, and little Charley wasn't there. She run out quick into the yard, and there she saw him sitting down on a plank washing little bright stones in a bit of a mud puddle close by. It had been raining, you know. She pat him straight into a tub of warm water and right into bed, and he begun to get over it again; but when the scarlet fever come it was too much for him and carried him off sudden. She couldn't help it. You needn't think that she ain't a good mother and all that-she's well enough for her own if she is nothing of a neighbor."</p>
                           <p>"But Susan Bradshaw says she can scold, and she bosses every one of 'em, John and all, as if she believed the Bible said, 'The woman is the head of the man.'"</p>
                           <p>"Well, she is mighty curious in her ways; but up and down she was that time night and day. Most women would have died twice over, with all she did for 'em, for the fever took hold of every one, more or less, and she wouldn't ask a neighbor in to help, like other folks; but kept on all to themselves. And when Charley died she laid him out herself and dressed him all nice in his little white frock, and there he was all as nice before any one knew it. She let 'em. all come in, but she didn't seem to want any help, or any body to sit up and watch."</p>
                           <p>"It looks as though she had something to hide, don't it, to keep on so unneighborly like."</p>
                           <p>"So it does, but I don't think it's that; but she don't want folks spying about, that's certain."</p>
                           <p>"Did she take his death hard?"</p>
                           <p>"Nobody knows. I'm her nearest neighbor and I never heard her speak of him except when I spoke first, and then she just answered quiet like; but she was pale as pale for a good many months after, and she followed round the children all that year with sunbonnets, and she kept them in shoes and stockings the whole Summer except just in August a while, and they generally go barefoot all the warm weather. You see I can look right into their garden patch from my upper window, and see all that's going on. So when I get all my work done and it's lonesome like, sometimes I go up and sit there.</p>
                           <p>"'It's as good as a play to see the whole family turn out to put up the garden sauce for the market next morning. John a-digging, and she a-cutting things,<pb n="9 The Market Woman."/>
and both children pulling and picking, and maybe the old lady looking out at times and coming to tie up bundles, and even the baby with his little pail picking currants or berries or something. But don't you go and tell that, Mrs. Butts. I never tell any of the neighbors round here that I see 'em; for I don't think she would like it and she's a sharp tongue in her head for cutting in a soft place if you have one, for all she speaks so nicely and quiet like most times. So don't you speak about that upper window while you stay visiting here in town. If you do you are no friend of mine; but I've always trusted you since we were girls together."</p>
                           <p>"So you may still, Sally, for I won't tell. But you think she'll bring her girl up for the market?"</p>
                           <p>"Can't tell."</p>
                           <p>"Jane Bradshaw says she joined the church before she was married, and John too, at the same time."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, and she teaches the children Sundays like a parson, and she always keeps 'em in school, Winter and Summer, and the whole family go to meeting rain or shine, as regular as the minister himself. They sit in one of the best pews and pay for it too, and everybody says they are getting rich hand over hand. Everybody knows they are close-fisted for all that."</p>
                           <p>"What kind of clothes do they wear mostly at meeting?"</p>
                           <p>"Nothing to speak of; just comfortable and that's all. And as for eating, oh my! They say she hires her children not to taste nice things for six months together, and won't eat them herself to set 'em an example, and then she gets 'em new books instead. But nobody knows for certain unless it's the hired men, and she puts them at a separate table with good plain farmers' fare and enough of it; but if there's any nice sauce or such she puts on a little bit herself, and don't trust it to them. She waits on 'em herself mostly; and she goes herself and gets green hands, generally right out of Castle Garden, and she helps to train 'em to work."</p>
                           <p>"I've seen her many a time showing one just how to hold a new fangled plow between the rows, going round and round herself, and then making the man go on holding it, she following on beside him. John, he'd try first, maybe, and give it up in despair it appeared to me; and when she come from market then she would do it all over and the man had to learn, if he was ever so green. I generally keep an eye over every new man that comes, it's so curious. And most of 'em like her and won't say nothing against her if they know it. Old John Stokes says she's tougher than a boiled owl, and it's my belief she's just made of steel springs. She goes on as if she was just wound up fresh every morning and<pb n="10 The Woman's Advocate."/>
had to run till night without stopping. John, he's got to be a worker, I tell you, but he's nothing to her!"</p>
                           <p>"She's just made for it, must be!" mused the visitor. "I never heard anything so curious. I'd like to go and see her so as to tell the folks when I get home. Couldn't we go over to tea, neighborly like. I used to know the old lady, you know, but we never were much friends after all."</p>
                           <p>"I don't know. I haven't been there to tea in six years. Nobody goes, only just to call and chat with old Mrs. Reband, and she comes in and sits awhile but never stops. The children are always wanting her she says, and they are all so busy. They must take care of their business, she says. I kept on going to tea there, two or three times, once in a year or two, and then I stopped going."</p>
                           <p>"Do tell! didn't they treat you civil?"</p>
                           <p>"Oh, yes! civil enough, and got the nicest supper you ever see, and the old lady sat and talked and talked; but she went on working and working and only put on her clean dress just before supper. She treats everybody just so and never returns the visit, and now nobody goes there to take tea. She's as civil spoken as can be, you know, and once in awhile they invite a few neighbors in the Winter, thinking that will make up, I suppose."</p>
                           <p>"Well, I'd like to go over and try it for once, if you didn't mind. I can't be here in the Winter, you know, and likely shouldn't get invited if I was."</p>
                           <p>"I'll declare I should like it, Mrs. Butts; but I'm most afraid to venture."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, do now! we'll stand by each other, and Jane Bradshaw would go with us and welcome. I'll run over and get her this minute, if you'll go too. Yes, you will, of course, and I'm going to try it."</p>
                           <p>Away went the little woman. She was a visitor from out West who had formerly lived in the vicinity and had no idea of returning home without seeing the marvel of the neighborhood at her own fireside. "Wouldn't miss it for anything," was her mental comment, "somebody's got to go with me, for I can't try it alone."</p>

                        <p>A PULPIT orator recently sought to inform women what they might do. They could attend to domestic duties, engage in the employments usually conceded to be feminine, teach, and practice the healing art to some extent; but entering every department of labor was not to be thought of.  Indeed, he did not think a woman would look very charmingly carrying a hod of bricks to the top of a three-story building.</p>
                        <p>A number of men assume to be competent to instruct women as to what they should do and should not do. Horace Greeley sits in his sanctum and says to woman, You ought to labor so and so. Of course he has a right to his opinion, but women no longer answer, " Unargued I obey." Rev. Horace Bushnell calls a woman's right to choose her occupation "A Reform against Nature." I suppose it is according to nature for man to do as he pleases, and for woman to do as man bids her!</p>
                        <p>Woman, poor, weak, inefficient creature that she is, does not know what she can do, but all-wise man looking down from his pedestal of superiority can tell her. He knows her capabilities better than she does herself. Claiming the whole universe himself, for there is not a province of woman, excepting the duties of motherhood, which some man has not invaded, he restricts woman to what he thinks is proper.</p>
                        <p>Would men ever cease laughing if Phebe A. Hanaford should gravely assert in the pulpit "that man could engage in certain occupations with propriety, but in her opinion he would not look very dignified washing dishes or embroidering a baby's sack? Would not men open their eyes if E. Cady Stanton should object to men engaging in politics, and say that she preferred that they should be men such as Milton portrayed in Adam? There is a great deal of truth in the homely old saying, "what is sauce for the goose," etc.<pb n="14 The Woman's Advocate."/>
If women should be restricted, why not men also? If men have the whole range of professions and occupations to choose from, why not women the same? I have seen men wash dishes, cook, mix bread, sweep, wash, iron, sew, rock the cradle, and dress babies; and though looking sharp for evidences of demoralization, I failed to see them. I do not believe those men lost any of their virtue or manhood, because they performed "women's work" from choice or necessity. If a man is not demoralized by doing "women's work," why should a woman be demoralized by doing "men's work," even to plowing and carrying a hod?</p>
                        <p>She is not. Facts are irresistible. I have seen women spade, hoe, rake and pitch hay, saw and split wood, drive nails, and plane, and their morals were not corrupted. Some of them were not strong enough pbysically for such labors, but they were conscientious helpmeets, or had no "natural protectors," or else those "indispensibles" were lazy and had to be supported. The fact is, neither men nor women are fully educated until they know enough of culinary arts to keep from starving; enough of sewing to draw a rent together or fasten a button; enough of agriculture to dig for potatoes, and not mistake flower bulbs for onions; and enough of zoology to select the proper animals for milking, in case of exigencies. No woman is properly prepared for life until she is capable of existing without having a man to wait upon her, and no man is properly prepared for life until he can exist without a woman to wait upon him. Digest that, you men who prate of' domestic duties as woman's only sphere.</p>
                        <p>Is man the keeper of a woman's virtue and morality, that he should decide where she should go and what she should do? Shall she defer her judgment to his? Where is the evidence that men are more wise, more moral, more virtuous, and nearer perfect than women? Who do the greater amount of drinking, swearing, thieving and murdering, men or women? Women are bad enough, but wherein are men so much better that they should dictate to women?</p>
                        <p>In every phase of the woman question, this shallow objection arises: Women are better than men because their sphere is more limited, because they are not beset with the temptations which assail men, hence we would keep them thus. Give them the privileges of men, even in labor alone, and they will become as low as men, and if men have not<pb n="15 Carrying Hods."/>
something to look up to, they will fall yet lower. There is sophistry somewhere when men pretend to "look up" to women, to reverence them, and yet command them as though they were children or idiots.</p>
                        <p>Shut up a child in an isolated tower, and keep from her all knowledge of evil, and when she reaches womanhood, men can look up to her as an innocent woman but not as a virtuous one-</p>

                        <p>is a sad, sad acknowledgment for men, and a poor compliment to women, when a man intimates that the sexes cannot become fellow workers without moral degradation attending. Is there so much latent wickedness and sensuality in woman, that giving her the right to labor as she chooses, will plunge her into vile excesses?</p>
                        <p>A similar objection was raised against the cause that the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> so nobly advocated, the emancipation of the Negroes. There were many people in the North who really wished good to the Negroes, but trembled for fear that giving them personal liberty, and the right to the fruits of their labors, to say nothing of suffrage, would result in a horrible degradation, <hi rend="italic">amalgamation</hi>. Have seven years of experience verified the fear? Have Caucasians rushed into alliance with Africans? Do the teething portion of our population give evidence that the Anglo-Saxon race is becoming obliterated?</p>
                        <p>Wherever men and women labor as equals, subject to the same regulations, and enjoy the same privileges, moral degradation will not follow. The success of the mixed school system is sufficient to prove that. The false restrictions imposed upon woman are degrading. Remove the fair, deceitful mask of society where man is master and woman is slave, and we see a hideous skeleton. Nothing can be worse than the cruel, debasing extremities to which women are driven by injustice, the legalized wrongs they are compelled to endure, and the abnormal tendencies to vice perpetuated from generation to generation through woman's degraded condition.</p>
                        <pb n="16 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Moreover, because women claim the right of choosing their occupations, even to carry hods, does not prove they will seek an Injurious, promiscuous mingling of the sexes in departments of labor. Strange, if more knowledge and liberty are to destroy woman's discretion and sense of propriety. Virtuous men and women shrink from the companionship of the vile, and that law of nature will not be reversed.</p>
                        <p>Further, the practical acknowledgment of women as human beings not as creatures to be cajoled, supported, defrauded, and commanded, will tend to create a manhood and womanhood that can look upon each other without committing "adultery in the heart."</p>

                        <p>Some men seem to have a chronic fear that women will make one grand rush and leave every domestic department vacant. Do men leave masculine employments and rush into feminine ones? Neither will women leave feminine employments for masculine ones, save where they are overcrowded or underpaid. Women have to eat and wear clothes a a well as men, and they will see that the cooking and sewing are done, and that, too, without commanding men to do or not to do them.</p>
                        <p>Neither do women seek to monopolize any profession or occupation. What we want is that every individual, male or female, should have free access to every department of labor, and be remunerated according to the quantity and quality of labor performed.</p>
                        <p>Then, if a man thinks he is fulfilling his destiny by donning an apron and washing dishes for a living, in the name of justice let him do so, without sneers or complaints, and pay him the same you would a woman.</p>
                        <p>And if a woman thinks her mission is to carry a hod of bricks to the top of a three-story building, let her do it in peace, and pay her what you would a man for the same amount of labor, without troubling yourself as to whether or not she looks as graceful as she would making shirts at ten cents a piece.

                        <head>PART FIFTH.</head>
                        <p>It was Anniversary week of the year 186- in New York. The growing interest in reformatory questions, more than compensating for the decline in the old-time religious anniversaries, has brought more than the usual influx of strangers to the metropolis, imparting to it that <hi rend="italic">bizarre</hi> appearance established as a feature of the well-known season.</p>
                        <p>In the year that has elapsed since the parting of Marian and De L'Estrange many changes have taken place directly effecting the fortunes of our heroine. The Universe which, in an hour of dire necessity, had employed, with excellent results, girl compositors, who saved its issues and its honor when both were at the mercy of an arrogant organization, listened, after the danger was passed, to the unworthy counsels of its Board of Directors, who, heeding the clamors of a disaffected constituency, gave orders that there should be a general dismissal of the women compositors employed on <title>The Universe</title>. Nor was this all. Not only with a characteristic want of spirit did they listen to this ignominious proposal and restore the "strikers," but the depth of baseness was reached by the manner in which the discharge of their women employes was effected. After accepting their services when else complete disgrace, if not destruction, would have befallen them; after owing to their faithful, conscientious service months of satisfactory publication, their peremptory discharge was accompanied, as a cloak to the baseness of the action, by slanderous statements, editorially and otherwise given to the public, to the effect that their employment of women compositors had proven a failure, and that it was owing to woman's unfitness to master the trade of type-setting, and not from any other reason that the change was made. All the indignation of Marian's nature was aroused by this act of injustice. Although herself tendered by the proprietors another and, in many respects, a preferable situation, to the one which she filled, she unhesitatingly refused to make any terms with the traducers of her sister workers, and at once sought<pb n="18 The Woman's Advocate."/>
the sanctum of the editor-in-chief, in whose ear she poured an eloquent account of the grievous wrong done herself and her companions.</p>
                        <p>"For myself I care not," she said, "but the poor girls for whom I plead, what have they done to be treated thus unjustly? When to accept a situation in your office was to make themselves the objects of animadversion and dislike, the butt and target of a powerful association when to walk the streets, in the daily journeying to and fro, was to run the gauntlet of a bitter, relentless persecution, these girls came at your invitation, toiling faithfully at untried task and saving from scorn the reputation of your journal when it went grovellng at the feet of an organization that had no regard or mercy for you. And what is their reward for all this! After saving you from dishonor; after familiarizing themselves with their new duties and rendering, as I know, essential satisfaction, you turn them, as it were, upon the street, taking away from them even their good name, and restoring to favor the very men who conspired against you and who have visited upon us such indignity. Ah, Mr. Danton, I fear you have done an ill work, one for which there can be no full atonement."</p>
                        <p>Charmed by the frank audacity of her manner, the editor remained silent during the delivery of Marian's impassioned address, and when half breathless she concluded, he replied, a look of mingled care and compassion creeping into his grave, thought-lined face as he spoke:</p>
                        <p>"My dear young lady, you little know how powerless we journalists frequently are even to act out what our own judgment dictates to us as wise or fitting to do. The outer world may call my articles brilliant and envy me my position, but did it know that, with every metropolitan journal, behind the seeming throne there lurked unseen, in some one, of its protean shapes, a power far more potent, guiding and determining all, and that he who sat in the editorial chair, with all his insignia of authority, was oft but the poor puppet to execute its behest,-it would a little abate in its admiration of his position. To undo what has been done I am powerless, were it all as you have stated. But I am touched, deeply touched by your representations. Now that my attention is called to the matter, it shall be investigated, and if it be all as you say, which I doubt not, depend upon it, my dear young lady, there shall be<pb n="19 Thrown Upon the World."/>
no more slanders upon you in <title>
                              <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>
                           </title> while Robert Danton has part or voice in its management."</p>
                        <p>And so Marian turned her back upon her first place of employment in New York. But she was not destined to be idle. Learning of her freedom from engagement, the proprietor of a flourishing weekly journal, radical in character, to whom she was known by reputation, sought her out, and eagerly proposed to her to assume the charge of his composing room, offering to invest her with full power to employ compositors from her own sex, and to introduce such regulations as she desired in the management of the office. This was what Marian had long ardently desired. Hers was an eminently practical mind, and in her long apprenticeship to type at the office of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> she had had excellent opportunities to familiarize herself with every department of the business, and to form, mentally, plans for the improvement of printing offices, and for the amelioration of the condition of toiling compositors, which she resolved, should she ever have control of a composing room, she would endeavor to put in practice. This offer of Mr. Lyman's, coming at this juncture, seemed to her a providential opening of the way, and it was at once thankfully accepted. From among the girls discharged from <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> and yet seeking employment, she selected those in whom she had the greatest confidence, including, of course, in the half-dozen chosen, her valued friend, Lizzie Fay, who had been almost inconsolable during the few intervening days at the thought of being separated from her companion. Selecting thus and disciplining her forces, she entered with confidence upon her new duties, in the discharge of which she succeeded beyond her most sanguine expectations, eliciting the warmest approbation of her employer, good Mr. Lyman, and, by the novelty of a forewoman, attracting to the office scores of newspaper men and skeptical masculine compositors, who among themselves ridiculed the idea of a woman's ability, unaided, to get out a first-class metropolitan journal. Among those who more frequently, but not as a skeptic, dropped into the pleasant, airy composing room, to note progress and chat with the presiding genius of the establishment, was her old friend of <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, Mr. Jobson. Grown more gouty and testy than ever to others, the hobbling proof-reader had ever a kindly word and smile for Marian, in whose ability even to edit a lexicon or an ency-<pb n="20 The Woman's Advocate."/>
clopedia he had the most unbounded confidence. Scarcely a week elapsed but what his well-known, halting tread could be heard approaching teh work-room, and whenever he came, adroitly brought at some time into the conversation, there would be some item or bit of fresh intelligence to communicate concerning "our boy over the water."</p>
                        <p>And may it be asked by the reader, interested in the slender thread of romance running through these pages, how all this time the interest, so auspiciously commenced, continued between the absent De L'Estrange and our heroine? There was no direct intercourse, and neither was aware that for the other there were entertained sentiments beyond those of esteem or kindly remembrance. But the passion which had taken such sudden possession of De L'Estrange no excitement of travel or continued absence had power to lessen; and amid the Capitals of the Continent, the brilliant, festive scenes in which, over and over, he mingled in his "on the wing'" wanderings, his memory ran back to a faraway composing room, and the image of a slender girl bending over the "case," or flitting from place to place in the discharge of her varied duties, was a picture more dearly treasured than any the fairest scene or the smile of the courtliest dame could afford. And Marian--how was it with our busy, active Marian? Not to herself would she confess her growing interest in the light-hearted correspondent, with whose movements, through garrulous Mr. Jobson, she was kept so conversant; but in her room, when the day was done, she would take his latest letter to <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi>, --always so bright, investing the <hi rend="italic">tritest</hi> theme with interest,--and, poring over it, muse upon the higher tone of his correspondence and marvel if indeed their acquaintance, so slight, so all like a dream to her now, was the cause of the change ? His tour, which at first was supposed would be confined to Europe, had broadened out with the exigencies of correspondence, and a large portion of the East, hurriedly visited, was also embraced in the year of almost continuous wanderings. His letters, descriptive often of scenes and places imperfectly known to the American public, by their piquancy had arrested the attention of a prominent publishing house, who had made a flattering proposition to bring them out in a volume, to which arrangement De L'Estrange had assented, and the latest intelligence which had reached Marian was that, his mission abroad about accomplished, to look after home interests,<pb n="21 Thrown Upon the World."/>
he was expected. to sail for New York by the next steamer from Havre.</p>
                        <p>So time wore away, and Anniversary week, looked forward to by Marian and her companion with interest, as the occasion when they would hear "silvern speech," by some of the rarest minds in America, arrived. The friends inaugurated their round of evening pleasures by their attendance at the magnificent "O'Connell" lecture by Wendell Phillips, delivered at the Academy of Music. Going early to procure good seats, they enjoyed seeing the gathering of the fashionable  assemblage, the culture and wealth of New York paying spontaneous tribute to eloquent lips and to a theme endeared to the public. To Marian the appearance and manner of the great apostle of freedom was familiar, but to Lizzie, in person, he was all unknown, and, in the intensity of interest born of familiarity with his impassioned oratory, she almost breathlessly awaited the appearance of the speaker. It was a brilliant assemblage upon which the girls gazed. Tier upon tier, from the parquette to the galleries was a sea of faces, and the flood of light from the thousand burners fell upon one of the fairest audiences ever congregated to listen to a discourse in the Empire City. Suddenly there was a lull in the buzz that ran round among the thousands; then a burst of hearty applause succeeded, as a tall, well-known figure walked across the stage and took his seat amid the few gentlemen gathered upon the platform. Scarcely time had Lizzie to whisper to her companion, "How like his photograph he looks," when the hurried introduction was made, and a yet heartier burst of applause greeted the speaker who had advanced to the front of the stage and stood waiting for quiet to be restored ere he opened his lips. Perhaps in the wide range of Lyceum themes treated by Wendell Phillips there is no lecture which so well displays his varied charm of oratory as the portrayal of Ireland's wrongs in the "O'Connell" lecture, and to those who have bowed beneath its spell, I need not attempt to describe its effect upon an audience. That night in the brilliantly lighted Academy there were butterflies of fashion, worldly-minded men and women, cold, critical scholars and <sic corr="savants">savans</sic>, rude, illiterate Celts, attracted by the announcement of a lecture upon their "Great Countryman;" but upon all the effect was not unlike. Entranced by the wondrous fascination of the speaker's words, the great audience sat all unmindful of the lapse<pb n="22 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of time, until the closing sentence was pronounced, when, as waking from a spell, it rose and bore in its engulphing tide our friends out into the air of the clear May night.</p>

                        <head>SEVERAL ABSURDITIES CONSIDERED.</head>

                        <p>No class of persons has ever needed to "possess their souls with -patience," more than that of Reformers in general, and Woman Suffrageites in particular. When we bear knowing school-boys declaiming against the Woman Question, we feel a sort of pitying contempt for their wise ignorance; but when people of maturer years and supposed good sense present such ridiculous reasons why women should not receive the ballot, it takes a good deal of control to prevent, at least, a look of disgust from shadowing our countenance.</p>
                        <p>Not long ago we heard a young man, who certainly did not lack for height of body, if he did for breadth of mind, remark, that lie "didn't believe in women getting out of their sphere; their places were at home,<pb n="23 Several Absurdities Considered."/>
and besides they were not well enough educated to vote." Out of their sphere, if they should deposit a slip of paper in a ballot-box a few times a year? To be sure, what would become of the buttons and stockings, not to mention the babies and bread, if our countrywomen should undertake such onerous duties. Nearly as much time would be consumed as in their yearly selection of new hats and bonnets. We really wonder how it is that the merchants, students and mechanics, manage to leave their spheres long enough to vote. Do they find everything at "sixes and sevens," when they return?</p>
                        <p>Have not sufficient education to vote! Who, we would ask, compose, to-day, the greater part of our vast army of educators? Who, indeed, but intelligent and educated ladies. Such an assertion, then, is an insult to our sex; and any one who would seriously make such a remark, exhibits an inferior mental capacity which should forever debar him from the rights of citizenship. One "newspaper" man objects because, if women vote, they will also have to hold office. He says, "How ridiculous it would seem, for instance, to have it announced that court would be adjourned, so that the judge could attend to her baby." Poor fellow! If he had been through college, and is an editor, we think he still lacks a little good common sense, or he never would have penned so absurd an objection. We have known of men, who for less consideration than the emoluments of office, have left their families to care for themselves as best they might; but no one but a simpleton would for a moment suppose that any sensible woman would stifle the mother love in her heart, and neglect her children, to accept of any office in the gift of the people. If our Mrs. Livermores or Miss Dickinsons who have no "little folks" to hinder them, choose in course of time to accept the suffrage of the nation, well and good. That they will never disgrace their constituency by drunken carousals and unblushing bribery, we are absolutely certain.</p>
                        <p>"These Women's Rights women want to unsex themselves, they wish to be men," vehemently asserts some woman objector. Not a bit of it, my dear lady, so smoothe your ruffled plumes. We never did fancy masculine women, and when you get into one of your loud, denunciatory tirades against Woman Suffrage, we feel thankful that we are not obliged to listen to the "Caudle lectures," so frequently administered to your poor husband. "They want to wear the pants," said a student in his<pb n="24 The Woman's Advocate."/>
essay; but he felt rather subdued, we fancy, when a fellow student replied, "I don't believe any woman wishes to wear Mr. E----'s unmentionables." "I should like to see those women obliged to stand up all of the way in a long journey on the cars," said a woman with inconsiderate vengeance. Cruel, wasn't she? Now we should be very sorry to see a man with his "Hercules frame, and Jupiter voice," obliged to perform such an act of penance for his various misdeeds. We should not even have the heart to see our friend, Dr. Bushnell, undergoing such an ordeal, and think that, unlike so many of our opposing sisters, we should quietly remove our band-box, and offer "The Thunderer"a seat by our side.</p>
                        <p>"I have all the rights I want," simpers a wasp-waisted damsel. Certainly, my dear, and so you have. It is about as much as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can do to <hi rend="italic">breathe</hi>; of course you cannot attend to the "weightier matters of the law," but that is no reason why women of sense, with both breadth of chest and intellect, should be deprived of their rights. [We advise all young men of the opposition, to seek the society of the "wasp-waisted," and they will seldom be troubled by feminine strong-mindedness.]</p>
                        <p>"I pay heavy taxes, but I have no representation," said a wealthy and talented young lady. "Why don't she got somebody to represent her, then?" remarked a young man with a laugh, meaning, of course, "Why does she not secure that highly-prized article, a husband."</p>
                        <p>What profound philosophy! What an unrivalled panacea for all of her present disabilities--proxy representation. We wonder why the good women do not ask their husbands to unite with the churches in their places. It would be as reasonable and just, though we fear often not so agreeable to the feelings of their "representatives."</p>
                        <p>The "opposition" must urge less ridiculous reasons against our glorious reform, if they do not wish to find themselves, presently, covered with shame and confusion. The beautiful banner of Universal Freedom and Suffrage is gaily waving beneath the blue dome of Heaven, but the flaunting eschutcheons of the enemy have been so terribly shattered by the shot and shell from our ranks, that we now see only a few unsightly tatters dolefully flapping in the breeze. Their leading standard bearers have fallen ingloriously, but as an act of humanity let us give them a Christian burial. In one wide grave, let us humanely place the remains<pb n="25 The American Woman Suffrage Association."/>
of our Fultons, Todds, Hatfields and Bushnells, with other "smaller fry," and let them sleep on peacefully.</p>

                        <head>THE CLEVELAND WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.</head>
                        <p>THE most important Convention in the interest of Woman Suffrage, thus far held in the country, was that which, agreeably to a widely-signed Call, convened at Cleveland, Ohio, on the 24th and 25th of November, 1869. Grand in purpose, sanctioned by a magnificent array of representative names, guided in deliberations by some of the finest of liberal minds, men and women, the Cleveland Convention, which, in the language of A. BRONSON ALCOTT, was to be "the initiation of one of the grandest of human organizations," was, in all its stages, a success highly gratifying to the tireless minds that called it forth and watched with solicitude the proceedings, and to every friend of Woman Suffrage throughout the Nation.</p>
                        <p>In all twenty-one States were represented. Delegates were present from almost every part of the Union, making the Convention truly representative in character, while in weight of names, and in harmony of action, the movement could scarcely have been more worthily presented to the public. Among the delegates were LUCY STONE, JULIA WARD HOWE, MARY A. LIVERMORE, T. W. HIGGINSON, ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL, CAROLINE M. SEVERANCE, A. BRONSON ALCOTT, MARY F DAVIS, HENRY B. BLACKWELL, and many others whose names and presence lent luster and dignity to the Convention. Letters were read from GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS, FRANCES D. GAGE, WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON and other well-known advocates of the cause.</p>
                        <p>After the reading, by LUCY STONE, of the original circular letter which constituted the basis of the call for the Convention, a temporary organization was effected by the selection of Judge JAMES B. BRADWELL of Illinois as Chairman, and MARY F. DAVIS of New Jersey as Secretary.</p>
                        <p>A permanent organization was effected as follows:

                        <p>In taking the chair Mr. HIGGINSON made a neat and appropriate address, expressing his thanks for the compliment in selecting him as presiding officer of the Convention, and declaring his cordial sympathy in the movement for woman suffrage. "The object," he remarked, "is not one of compulsion but freedom--to lay before woman this great responsibility, and to say to her, choose if you please; vote or not. All that we have to do is to break down the barrier that now excludes her."</p>
                        <p>During the first day interesting addresses were delivered by LUCY STONE, JULIA WARD HOWE, MRS.. TRACY CUTLER, REV. PHEBE A. HANAFORD, MRS. C. M. SEVERANCE, MARY A. LIVERMORE, F. B. SANBORN, and other delegates. The afternoon session was quite numerously attended, and in the evening, the fine hall in which the Convention held its sittings, was densely packed with a cultured, appreciative audience. From Mrs. HANAFORD'S fine poem, given at the conclusion of her address, we select the following stanzas:</p>

                        <p>At the morning session of the second day, the Constitution for the new Association was presented, which, after a discussion of a pleasant character, was adopted in a form not materially different from the original draft. It read as follows:</p>
                        <p>CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION.</p>
                        <p>PREAMBLE: The undersigned friends of Woman Suffrage, assembled in delegate convention in Cleveland, Ohio, November 24th and 25th, 1869, in response to a call widely signed and after a public notice duly given, believing that a truly representative national organization is needed for the orderly and efficient prosecution of the woman suffrage movement in America, which shall embody the deliberate action of the State and local organizations and shall carry with it their united weight, do hereby form the American Woman Suffrage Association.</p>

                           <head>LETTER FROM GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.</head>
                           <p>The position of women now is undoubtedly higher in America than it has ever been anywhere; and in all civilized States, the theory that women are properly a subject sex is sharply questioned. But wherever the improvement of their condition is most marked, the more general and imperative is their demand for political equality. Nor should this surprise us; for compliment and courtesy to women, the most rapturous flattery and the loudest professions of tender regard for feminine delicacy, are found to be compatible with unjust and contemptuous laws concerning them. Liberty is the child of justice, and if the voters of the United States believe that governments justly exist by the consent of the governed, let them say whether half the adult population of the country whose interest in the commonwealth is us vital as that of the other half; who are as intelligent, as moral, as orderly; who own property; who pay taxes; who in every way contribute to the general welfare, shall continue to be disfranchised with criminals, idiots and the insane; or whether every opportunity which men themselves enjoy shall not be opened by them to the equally free choice of women.</p>
                           <p>I send the heartiest God-speed to your labors and your words. The cause is but part of the general emancipation of society from the fetters of ancient injustice and impolicy. And success is sure; for America, in blood and fire upon a hundred fields, as in the firm heart and hope of her best children, is consecrated to Liberty.</p>
                           <p>Very truly yours,</p>
                           <p>GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS</p>

                           <p>Looking back from the standpoint of American opinion to-day to that time, and comparing the "then". and the "now," can you not feel that the victory is almost won?</p>

                           <p>The suffrage is the turning point of women's cause; it alone will insure to them an equal hearing and fair play. With it, they cannot long be denied any just right, or excluded from any fair advantage; without it, their interests and failings will always be a secondary consideration, and it will be thought of little consequence how much their sphere is circumscribed, or how many modes of using their faculties are denied to them.</p>

                           <p>At the closing session, on the evening of the second day, the audience was larger than on any previous occasion. All parts of the hall, to the aisles and stairways, were crowded with eager, attentive listeners. The work of the Convention had been completed, and the evening was devoted to speaking. Among those who spoke were JULIA WARD HOWE, LUCY STONE, HENRY B. BLACKWELL, CELIA BURLEIGH, CAROLINE M. SEVERANCE7, and Rev. ROWLAND CONNOR. All the addresses were of a rare order of merit, and were listened to with a wrapt attention showing the deep hold which the question has taken upon the public mind. The persuasive, earnest words or LUCY STONE, the finished language and beautiful sentiments of Mrs. BURLEIGH, the close, penetrating logic of HENRY B. BLACKWELL, the brilliant, scholarly utterances Of JULIA WARD H0WE, the eloquent presentation of the question by Mrs. SEVERANCE, the powerful aid of Mrs. LIVERMORE, all contributed to create an impression rarely produced upon an assemblage, and were a fitting termination to the important labors of the convention.</p>
                           <p>Thus Successfully inaugurated, the AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION, commanding the respect of the country, enters upon the organized work which soon or late must result in the establishment of principles so powerfully appealing to the wise, the good, and the liberty-loving of the land.</p>
                           <p>IF men start with the idea that woman is an inferior being, incapable of wide interests, and created for their pleasure alone; if they enact laws and establish customs to sustain these views; if, for the most part, they shut her into harems, consider her so dangerous that she may not walk the streets without a veil--they will write history in accordance with such views, and, whatever may be the facts, they will be interpreted to suit them. -- <hi rend="italics">Caroline H.

                           <head>THE CLEVELAND CONVENTION.</head>
                           <p>ELSEWHERE will be found a highly interesting abridged report of the recent Cleveland Convention, preserving all the essential labors of that very successful deliberative assemblage.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps, in our history, no Convention charged with a similarly high mission, ever succeeded in rendering a more satisfactory discharge of duty than the Cleveland Convention, which has given to the country its great need, viz., an efficient, dignified, and truly representative NATIONAL W0MAN SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION.</p>
                           <p>To those familiar with the detail of the movement, the task of creating an organization which would embody the sentiment and command the respect of the friends of woman suffrage, we need not say, was one fraught with great difficulty. But the conductors of the Cleveland Convention, comprising some of the noblest and most influential men and women in the land, profoundly impressed with the necessity for such action, were not to be diverted from the work by the difficulties attending upon its prosecution. Tirelessly they wrought. Individuals everywhere were appealed to. The aid of the press was invoked. Perhaps not without misgivings assembled those men and women in council in the "Lake City," but the result more than justified the most sanguine expectation. With delegated representation from three-fifths of the States; with increasing audiences from session to session; with harmony of counsel, and a more than ordinary concentration of interest from the outer world, the Convention was fortunate to a rare degree in all of its deliberations. In the addresses pronounced, in the letters received, and in the organization effected, nothing was left to be desired; and the tone of the press throughout the country, in commenting upon the Convention, was in happy contrast to that of former occasions,--all showing the increased respect won for the movement.</p>
                           <pb n="34 The  Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>Since the adjournment of the Cleveland Convention, the inauguration of the systematized campaign, cheering progress has been made of an auxiliary character. State after State wheels into line. New Jersey has held an enthusiastic Convention in response to the New Organization; Pennsylvania wakens from its deep, night-like apathy; the New England States are all aglow with interest; while, like a sharp thunder-clap from the clear sky, the far-off Territory of Wyoming sends to the sisterhood of States the message that, while they halt and hesitate, she has declared the <hi rend="italic">full enfranchisement of woman</hi>. With the year 1869, closing so hopefully, what may we not expect from the organized campaign of the year whose dawn is rosy with the victories already won?</p>

                           <head>HAIL, WYOMING!</head>
                           <p>GOOD news comes to us from the West. An infant Territory, lying on the outskirts of civilization, almost beneath the shadows of the Rocky Mountain and within hearing of the far Pacific surge, by one leap of legislation has placed itself in advance of the proudest State of the American Republic, and written in fair characters the principles of EQUAL RIGHTS upon the fresh, young page of its history.</p>
                           <p>All unexpected as was such legislation, this pioneer action of Wyoming Territory loses none of its significance by the many causes assigned to account for such extraordinary action on the part of conservative law makers. It may be--though we are in no mood now to discuss the motives which led to the act--that the members of the Wyoming Legislature were governed purely by selfish considerations in framing and passing such a law, but its far-reaching consequences will be none the less speedy or irrevocable. When the South Carolinians fired upon Sumpter it was with very different expectations of results; and if Democratic assemblymen, for local effect or party purposes, have played with the machinery of law, they will find that a prairie fire has been ignited by the act, whose scorching flames will never be subdued until, searing the conscience and statute book alike, they have swept over every State and Territory under the flag of the Republic.</p>
                           <p>For the benefit of Eastern Solons, this Bill, entitled by its importance to be regarded as the "New Declaration," we present in full. It has<pb n="35 Editorial Department."/>
received the signature of Gov. Campbell, and is now the Law of the territory:</p>

                              <hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Council and Rouse of Representatives of Wyoming Territory:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>SECTION I. That every Woman of the age of twenty-one years, residing in this Territory, may at every election to be holden under the laws thereof, cast her vote. And her rights to the elective franchise and to hold office shall be the same under the election laws of the Territory as those of electors.</p>

                           <head>WOMEN AS COMPOSITORS.</head>
                           <docDate>NO. I. January, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>IT is our purpose, in a future number, to speak at some length concerning the occupation of typesetting, as offering more than ordinary inducements to women who desire a pleasant, healthful and remunerative employment.</p>
                           <p>This intention of ours, which has remained as a deferred duty for months with us, has been stimulated into activity by the following paragraph, relative to the employment of women as compositors abroad, which we find floating, without paternity, upon the sea of exchanges:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Nine years ago it was resolved to try the experiment of female handiwork In printing. The Queen took an interest in the matter, and an office was opened in London under the management of Miss Emily Faithfull. The office is open at the present moment. I saw it only to-day. But there is no advance. Miss Faithfull fortunately has left, and things are a little better than they were; but only twenty-five girls are employed, and, after nine years, that is slow work for a new idea. The "trade" is dead against it--as much here as it appears to be in America. I confess to being completely against it myself, but on grounds that would apply to several other female occupations. At Paris, Madrid, Florence, and even St. Petersburg, the scheme has been condemned by the trade journals; but partly for reasons which, it is but fair to say, do not apply to the particular case."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>That the above discouraging statements, however applicable to England or the Continent, do not at all represent the condition of things in this country, we rejoice to say. In this city alone it is estimated that there are over three hundred women compositors, the proportion as<pb n="36 The Woman's Advocate."/>
compared with men printers already being one-tenth. That among this relatively large number there are a fair proportion of skilled, thoroughly reliable compositors, their employment in some of our first-class establishments, such as the Harpers', is sufficient evidence. Especially in the composing rooms of weekly journals they are quite numerous. In rare instances, but sufficient to establish the ability, women compositors have assumed the charge of composing rooms, discharging satisfactorily all the duties of foremen. THE ADVOCATE since its establishment has been under the charge of a young lady, Miss EMILY PEERS, who also, for over a twelve-month, has made up a weekly paper, the well-known <hi rend="italic">AntiSlavery Standard</hi>, issued from the same office. In the composition of <hi rend="italic">The Standard</hi> and THE ADVOCATE women are chiefly employed, among them several who have learned the business in the office. We do not know that any other paper or magazine in the city is similarly made up, but the fact that one excellently printed paper is entirely under the charge of a woman is proof that others of the sex could be similarly educated.</p>
                           <p>One other point in the paragraph which we have quoted should not be passed without notice. It is the allusion to the opposition of the "Trades." In this city there is a "Woman's Typographical Union," in a flourishing condition, numbering upwards of fifty members. Its efficient president last year, Miss AUGUSTA LEWIS, received the invaluable counsel and assistance of the "Men's Typographical Union" in forming their Association, which was indebted to the Men's Union for many courtesies. By its present able Executive, Miss KATE CUSACK, the writer is assured that those friendly relations are maintained without any abatement or lessening of interest. Joined thus hand in hand, the Men and Women Compositors of New York are setting an example of disinterested friendliness for the Trades Unions of the civilized world to imitate.</p>
                           <p>Will not the love of fair play, which is eminently a characteristic of the English nation, induce our trans-Atlantic brethren to give proper credit to the larger spirit of tolerance which animates the handicraft of Foust and Guttenberg in America?</p>

                           <docDate>NO. I. January, 1870. VOL.III.</docDate>
                           <p>THE News of this city in a recent issue, in an editorial upon "The Sphere of Woman," criticises our allusion to that journal in the last issue of THE ADVOCATE.</p>
                           <p>While we acknowledge that the article which first arrested our attention, relative to the Philadelphia outrage, was written with fairness and with more than average ability; while we cheerfully bear testimony to the improved tone of the organ of Benjamin Wood, candor compels us to state that its olden character for conservatism--to use no harsher term--fully justified us in employing the phraseology to which exception has been taken by our contemporary.</p>
                           <p>That this is the case we deeply regret. Of all our cheaper metropolitan dailies, founded to meet the wants of the masses, the <hi rend="italic">News</hi> has established the deepest hold upon public favor. It Is more ubiquitous, more all-penetrating, than the keenest-nosed reporter. Go where you may, in the day's decline, over this crowded isle; saunter through the most fashionable thoroughfare, or penetrate the most noisome, pestilent-breeding quarter, and, though other voices may be dumb, you will assuredly be greeted by some straggler from the legion of news-vending tatterdemalions, lustily crying the "<hi rend="italic">News</hi>." What its actual circulation is we have no means of knowing; but we never think of its immense editions going daily into the hands of tens of thousands-the great army of toil-but what the reflection is forced upon us that here one of the grandest opportunities to be an Educator of the Public <hi rend="italic">is lost</hi>. With its present hold on the masses, the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic"> News</hi> might so elevate it in tone that the thousands depending almost entirely upon it for mental aliment might have good wholesome food set before them by which they would be incalculably benefited, and yet the receipts of the journal, probably, in nowise be diminished.</p>
                           <p>Think of it, Benjamin Wood! The world knows you as a man whose means largely have been acquired by and through credulity of the public, will you not show that same <hi rend="italic">world</hi> that of the wealth in your hands you will prove a "good steward?"</p>

                           <p>A very successful Convention, under the auspices of the New Jersey Woman Suffrage Association, was held at Newark on the 8th and 9th ult. Among the speakers were LUCY STONE, LUCRETIA MOTT, MARY F. DAVIS, Rev. PHEBE A. HANAFORD, CASSIUS M. CLAY and Mrs. C. M. SEVERANCE. The presence and words of the honored LUCRETIA MOTT lent additional interest to the Convention; and Hon. CASSIUS M. CLAY was welcomed to the platform with rapturous applause. The interest manifested in the Convention by the city and press of Newark was remarkable. Four sessions were held, the last of which, especially, was large and spirited. Among the excellent resolutions adopted was one ratifying the action of the Executive Committee of the State Association in sending delegates to Cleveland, and declaring the New Jersey Society auxiliary to the American Woman Suffrage Association.</p>
                           <p>The State Society of New Jersey is now in excellent working condition. LUCY STONE--a host in herself--is its President; and embraced in the organization are such tried, efficient coadjutors as ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL, PORTIA GAGE, ANDREW J. and MARY F. DAVIS, II. B. BLACKWELL, ROWLAND JOHNSON, Dr. JAMES BROTHERTON, and others. New Jersey, with some justness, has been designated, the Eastern Egypt of our Union, but, surely, with such an array of gallant natures, battling for Truth and Justice, its darkness must give way to the sunlight yet to burst upon the land.</p>

                           <p>Very sorrowfully would the announcement of its extinction fall upon many hearts were not the consolation afforded of a speedy resurrection, with a career more brilliant and useful for the Future than attended even upon its Past. Instead of <hi rend="italic">The Agitator</hi>, the new paper is to be christened the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Journal</hi>; and instead of Chicago the base of operations is transferred to Boston. The Queen City of the West loses; but the intellectual metropolis of New England receives. New England capital is to grease the wheels; New England brains largely to furnish the material and bestow character; but Mrs. LIVERMORE, and all that is best and most indestructible of the West, is to remain. For the new journal Mrs. LIVERMORE is announced as managing editor; and JULIA WARD HOWE, LUCY STONE, WM. LLOYD GARRISON, and T. W. HIGGINSON complete one of the most brilliant editorial corps ever comprised in the management of a journal.</p>

                           <p>IT has been no part of our purpose, as our readers will bear witness, to make a display of the friendly notices THE ADVOCATE, from time to time, has commanded from the press; or by unworthy means to <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to elicit a more favorable response from the public than its merits would justify. Hence while, within the year of our existence, we have rarely broken through this rule, which so few publications have sought to observe; carefully filed away, as valued testimonials, are very many unsought expression of sympathy and commendation upon our course, conveyed by letter or by type, couched in language that has gone straight to the heart and nerved our being for fresh exertion. One of the latest of these gratifying evidences that our labors have not been unappreciated, is from the pen of Mrs. LIVERMORE in one of the latest issues of <hi rend="italic">The Agitator</hi>, which as the opinion of one of the most illustrious of American women, whose career we have followed with admiration, we cannot resist the inclination to lay before our readers:</p>

                              <q direct="unspecified">"The New York WOMAN'S ADVOCATE  is a monthly, and one of the very best of the periodicals devoted to the cause of woman. Antoinette Brown Blackwell began a very interesting serial story in the November number, and those who now subscribe for the year 1870, receive the November and December numbers of THE ADVOCATE free, which contain the two issues of her story. We always read THE ADVOCATE thoroughly, for it is conducted with rare good taste and ability. Its price is $1.50 per annum, and our local societies in the West, who hold monthly meetings, will always find in it a paper of unusual ability and freshness, to read at the meeting. Had not each local society better subscribe for at least one number?"</q>

                           <head>SPIRIT MYSTERIES EXPLAINED. <hi rend="italic">The Inner Life</hi>. By Andrew Jackson Davis. 424 pp. Boston: Wm. White &#x0026; Co. </head>
                           <docDate>NO. I. January, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>Among the books longer upon our shelf, to which, again and again, we have been irresistibly attracted, not, perhaps, because yielding assent to many of the views of the gifted writer, but charmed by his breadth of thought and the great Principles comprehensively treated,--is the above work by the well-known author and Spiritual teacher, Andrew Jackson Davis.</p>
                           <p>The volume is divided into fourteen heads or parts, among the more suggestive of which may be mentioned: "A Survey of Human Needs," "Definition of Philosophy and Spiritualism," "The External Argument," "The Classification of Causes," "A Voice to the Insane," and "Phenomena of the Spiritual Spheres." Under the bead of "A Survey of Human Needs," page 11, the writer says:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">The object of this chapter is to show that the world, especially in this century, heeds a 'Philosophy' <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> than the schools can furnish, and a 'Spiritualism' more <hi rend="italic">demonstrative</hi> than the churches possess-needs these, in order to <hi rend="italic">destroy the hatreds</hi> of the churches; to cast this creed and that religion into the world's treasury of experience; to enrich our minds with a unitary understanding of all natural and spiritual things; and finally, to render all things, which pertain to our physical and mental being, universal and harmonious."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>To the general reader, perhaps the most interesting portion of the volume will be found that embraced under the head, "The External Argument," in which<pb n="41 Literary."/>
the writer ably argues the "Possibility, the Probability, and the Certainty of Spiritual Intercourse." Profoundly impressed himself with the verity of Spiritual Intercourse, the writer earnestly seeks to disseminate the "glad tidlngs;" and, perhaps, not in volume beside are there passages of closer logic, rarer beauty, or intenser interest. History from ancient to modern times is ranged over; the Scriptures are appealed to; nothing that might illuminate the subject, or settle doubt, seemingly, is left untouched. Yet with all this command of knowledge, this marvelous display of scientific and historic attainment, there is a frankness, an almost child-like simplicity and candor, which wins irresistibly upon the reader. Whether he accepts or rejects the theory, he cannot but accord sincerity to its advancer. One of the most important illustrations of this, in view of the rapid growth of spiritualism as a religious belief, occurs on page 372, wherein the writer says:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"It is no plan of mine to establish a new form of sectarianism. A desire so low and so unworthy a Man has never for a single moment occupied my brain. Sectarianism has been the curse of the Christian world. The good, and truth, and beauty of the doctrines of <hi rend="italic">Jesus</hi> have been deformed and placed in unnatural juxtapositions by the sectarian schemes of certain famous men. If I know anything, I know this. Consequently, should I become fired with sectarianism, and set myself to the work of constructing a new Party--merely a new form of an existing Evil--then manifestly I would be sinning against the Holy Ghost: transgressing against the Sovereign Law of Right within me, upon which alone are established the <hi rend="italic">equilibrium</hi> of character and that interior <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> which every one is organized to possess."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>"A Voice to the Insane," is a valuable paper, well worth the perusal. Our feverish American character is dissected, and the causes which lead to insanity are unfolded, while the finger-guides of caution and prudence are erected. "Benefits of Experience, and Phenomena of the Spiritual Spheres," are each excellent; and scattered all throughout the volume are thoughts upon Life and Duty which cannot be too seriously pondered by mortals. Truly, the volume is one whose circulation should be wide.</p>

                           <docDate>NO. I. January, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>The same excellence of matter, which is a characteristic of all the works of that sterling house, yet better known to many as that of Fowler &#x0026; Wells, is to be found in the carefully prepared volume by its now sole representative, S. R. Wells.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Wells, to the knowledge acquired by a life-long study, with rare opportunities, of the human organization, unites great feeling and delicacy; and, under his hand, the "much-abused theme" becomes aglow with interest; while a vast<pb n="42 The Woman's Advocate."/>
amount of 'information is imparted, and valuable hints given for the guidance of sensible men and women in taking "unto themselves companions for life."</p>
                           <p>The writer's ideal of wedlock, as well as of the motives governing him in the preparation of the volume, will best be learned from the preface, a paragraph of which we quote:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"If the motive for marriage be high and holy; if the parties be of proper age, of sound body and mind; and if there be an irresistible affinity for each other, such as will not only truly unite their souls but hold them firmly together through all trials and to all time, then it is both their privilege and their duty to unite in the holy bonds of matrimony. Of such relations are born children- offspring of love and design rather than of lust and of chance-more favorably organized, harmonious, self-regulating, law-abiding, well-disposed."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>In addition to the vast fund of information comprised within its pages, interspersed all throughout the volume are gems, quotations from the poets, illustrating the particular theme, and adding piquancy and value to the work.</p>

                              <hi rend="italic">Herald of Health.</hi>--This truly valuable magazine promises, for 1870, even more than its usual excellence. Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith contributes a serial story, and the old corps of writers, who have lent its pages such sterling worth in past issues, are all announced for the New Volume. We trust it may win a yet increased circulation, commensurate with its just value. Subscription price, $2 .00 a year. Wood &#x0026; Holbrook, Publishers, New York.</p>

One of the oldest of American journals, this excellent periodical, by its veteran services of one-fourth of a century in the reformatory field, well merits the degree of popularity it enjoys. Subscription price, $3.00 a year. S. R. Wells, Publisher, New York.</p>

We wonder now how the reading public ever got along without <hi rend="italic">Packard's</hi>. Entirely without the element of fiction, it has yet engrafted itself upon public favor as have few of the old established monthlies. Always it is bright, racy, readable.

Upon the journals, the New Year dawns with, as the chief attraction of the <hi rend="italic">Weekly</hi>, the powerfully<pb n="43 Literary."/>
written romance, "Man and Wife," by Wilkie Collins; while for the <hi rend="italic">Bazar,</hi> "Debenham's Vow," by Mrs. Amelia B. Edwards, holds the place of favor. The <hi rend="italic">Monthly,</hi> with its serial, "A Brave Lady," one of Mrs. Craik's (Miss Muloch) best fictions; its illustrated articles, and its charming stories, is not less attractive than of old; and we can scarcely fancy a well-ordered country-house into which these three unrivalled publications do not regularly enter as welcome, indispensable guests. Fortunate above all other periodicals are the <hi rend="italic">Harpers'</hi> in possessing a monopoly of the pen of George William Curtis, whose graceful, varied productions, the "Easy Chair" of the one, or the able "Editorials" of the others, impart a value to the works possessed by no other periodicals.

"Joseph and his Friend," by Bayard Taylor, opening well, is the serial for the <hi rend="italic">Monthly,</hi> for 1870, while all the old features of this established favorite remain unchanged; and Every Saturday promises enlargement, change of form, and superior attractions for the New Volume. Subscription price of each, $1.00. Fields, Osgood &#x0026; Co., Publishers, Boston.</p>

                              <hi rend="italic">Lipincott's Magazine.</hi>--Among the newer, but not the less substantial looking, of our established monthlies is the ever welcome <hi rend="italic">Lippincott's,</hi> the sole representative of its class that the "Quaker City" possesses. The two serials which have been running through the year, "The Vicar of Bullhampton," by Anthony Trollope, and "Beyond the Breakers," by Robert Dale Owen, are both continued. The usual variety of tales, essays, scientific papers are promised for 1870. The assertion that there are six first-class American monthlies, has caused much discussion of late respecting the merits of our leading magazines, and as to which of the number should be so regarded, but, though a variety of opinion exists, we have met with no table which leaves out Lippincott's.

THE VISIT.</head>
                           <p>THE three women were soon on their way to pay the unusual afternoon visit -- the two elders each with knitting-work in pocket, neatly rolled up; the needles thrust into a knitting sheath at one end and into the ball of cotton yarn at the other; for this was summer knitting, and the whole was carefully wrapped in a white handkerchief to keep it from soiling even in the clean visiting dress pockets. The younger woman had her fine sewing, kept especially for holiday work, and all three were in slightly excited spirits.</p>
                           <p>Impromptu afternoon visiting is the beautiful social blossoming of all primitive neighborhood relations in a democratic community-the very sweetest and fairest flower of feminine good fellowship. . The early settlers and farmers' wives generally, in the even-handed old times, would have endured social starvation but for this wholesome custom; yet it does not altogether harmonize with the needs of a locality where there are either wide social distinctions or varied business occupations. Modern society never visits; it calls on its special circle of friends, and it makes and accepts formal invitations. If gentlemen were to visit a lawyer who was preparing himself for the next day's court, or a merchant busy with his invoices, or a doctor whose horse was at the door and a<pb n="46 The Woman's Advocate."/>
round of patients waiting restlessly for his coming, the most polite man of them all might graciously accept the situation for ten minutes more or less, then his thinking would inevitably include the word "bore" for another brief space; but at the end of that time, the most superlative good nature would excuse itself on the grounds of pressing engagements, and no offence taken. Even busy ladies, in these modern days, may have an "at home" evening which frees them from the interruption at inconvenient hours, but nothing of the sort was recognized in those earlier times of which I write. Everybody expected, at least once in the season, to spend an afternoon with everybody else within walking distance, and often far beyond that immediate neighborhood, for country women enjoy the one luxury of horses, and are bound to make them pay for their keep whenever it is not a busy farming time.</p>
                           <p>Even a minister, now-a-days, whose leisure is bargained for in advance and paid for at so much a year as a joint stock investment by the whole congregation, may excuse himself sometimes on <hi rend="italic">sermon days</hi>, especially if it is the end of the week; but this was Friday, and on Saturday market demands are at least three times as pressing as on an other day; but our three good women, of course, did not understand anything about that; yet as the Rebands had somehow become an exception on their visiting list, they all felt on the present occasion that they were rather taking a liberty in going uninvited.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband, the younger, received her neighbors courteously at the door, took them into the best room, seated them all in a row; and seeing at a glance that they had evidently come to stay, asked them to take off their bonnets. This they did with alacrity, even after she had expressed her regret at the absence of her mother-in-law for the afternoon. Then each visitor drew out her work, while Susan sat a moment asking after the health of themselves and their families severally, and remarking upon the state of the weather. All this was in strict accordance with custom. As she had on a well-faded working dress, which was also quite customary with country women who did their own work, even in the afternoon, provided there was no company, it was also in order now to rise and excuse herself for a little while, leaving them to entertain each other meantime. But now she ought to have gone either straight to the kitchen to effect a few first hasty arrangements for a nice tea, or else directly to her own room to dress; returning as quickly as possible to her guests and the afternoon visiting, until time to get the tea. Instead of this, Mrs. Reband went to the garden and to gathering vegetables as if for a wager.</p>
                           <p>What was she to do, poor woman? Her husband and his mother, as chance would have it, were both away; the older children were at school, and the men<pb n="47 The Market Woman."/>
at their own work in the fields. Gathering the produce for market, moreover was never a part of their tasks, and, altogether uninstructed in it, to start them now at anything requiring so much nicety as this, was quite out of the question. For twenty minutes she wrought on without a pause, then she put everything aside and actually did wash and dress according to programme, but in haste and with some vexation it must be confessed; for a more inconvenient time for visitors could not well have occurred even in that always busy household. Do you say, alas for her popularity! A great Publishing House in New York, whose business it is to receive the scribbling public and look into its proposals, found it politic to assign to its senior partner the special duty of entertaining the bores. Her senior partner was not at home.</p>
                           <p>In half an hour by the clock Mrs. Reband was back again in the parlor, never hinting that it had not taken her the whole half hour to dress. But the visitors were fully posted on this subject nevertheless. She had gone out from the back door and purposely kept out of sight of the parlor window. But good Mrs. Dinsmore had made an errand into the yard and peered round till she saw the faded calico dress and a well-known dark calico sunbonnet in the vegetable patch. The pink bonnet was always kept for market, like all the new dresses.</p>
                           <p>The good gossip returned to the parlor not at all offended, but in a high state of delight. "She is out there gathering her vegetables! I told you so."</p>
                           <p>"Speak low, the little fellow is out under the window, digging," whispered Mrs. Jane Bradshaw.</p>
                           <p>"Did you ever!" murmured Mrs. Butts. "I never heard the like in my life. Nobody will believe me when I get back to Ohio and tell them. Hospitality is a religious duty there."</p>
                           <p>You'll see she'll get us a nice tea, though" whispered Mrs. Jane. "If she's stingy she don't show it to visitors -- not in anything but her own time."</p>
                           <p>When Mrs. Reband took her seat in the parlor, she placed herself where she Could glance at the kitchen clock, for it was already late. The visitors had not come early; it had taken Mrs. Bradshaw too long to put on her best things after the visit was suggested to her; and now as there was a party of men in the field and the guests all to be duly fed, there was not much time to be lost. However, Mrs. Reband took up her knitting and sat apparently a lady of leisure-a rather grave and quiet, but altogether exemplary hostess, answering questions without leaving any one much the wiser therefor, and not asking any in return.</p>
                           <p>In exactly fifteen minutes she rose, slipped noiselessly out of the room, leaving the kitchen door still ajar, and began mixing biscuits, stirring cake, and a custard; filling the tea-kettle, and kindling the wood stove, which had gone out<pb n="48 The Woman's Advocate."/>
according to the Summer custom. All this was dispatched with a cleverness that either of the three women would have envied if they could have looked on; but she was out of eye-shot from the parlor, though neither party was out of hearing of ordinary conversation in the adjoining room. Little Henry dame in and was sent to wash face and hands and put himself into a clean apron ready to seethe ladies.</p>
                           <p>"What did they come for, mother?" asked the little fellow, returning in a presentable state to the kitchen, just as his mother was turning the cake, baking in the oven.</p>
                           <p>"They came to get a nice tea," answered the market woman in her simple, matter-of-fact tone which sounded distinctly in the ears of the three listening ladies.</p>
                           <p>"Are you going to give them that cake, and the nice custard, and the biscuits?" he asked, peeping into the oven.</p>
                           <p>"Yes, Henry."</p>
                           <p>"Why, mother?"</p>
                           <p>"Because it is a duty to be hospitable," she answered, as though she had taken a dive into the thoughts of her visitors.</p>
                           <p>"What does hospitable mean, mother?" persisted the boy.</p>
                           <p>"It means doing everything that is nice and comfortable for people who come to see you, no matter how inconvenient it may be for yourself."</p>
                           <p>She spoke in exactly her usual tones, and the child was satisfied; but the six eyebrows in the parlor were all lifted a little ominously, though a running conversation went on there meantime.</p>
                           <p>The kitchen table was now drawn out, covers laid, and it was hastily spread, chiefly with cold, substantial food. A pot of common tea was made in the common teapot, the best teapot was scalded and a generous drawing of best tea placed in it, but not yet wet. The children now returned from school; their mother met them at the side-door, explained that it was necessary they should go out at once and gather vegetables, giving her directions briefly and clearly, and then once more examining the state of her oven, she produced a snowy best table-cloth and her mother-in-law's china tea-set, and spread the parlor table with little Henry's help, who laid plates and knives and carried everything which he could.</p>
                           <p>"May I sit down, too?" he whispered.</p>
                           <p>"Yes, if you will be good."</p>
                           <p>"Can't John and Mary come too, mother?"</p>
                           <p>"No, they haven't time."</p>
                           <pb n="49 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>Sweet-meats, cottage cheese, and. honey; light bread, butter, a tempting jug of cream, and the newly cooked dainties were placed on the supper table; and when all was ready Mrs. Reband went out, closing the door behind her. She bad blown the horn to summon the men from the field, and she now added to their table a plate of the biscuits and the boiling tea-pot, and pouring them each a cup of tea, went into the porch where they were washing hands and explained to them that she had company, and they must help themselves. Then she disappeared into the inner room, bearing the fragrant best tea-pot into which she had but just poured the boiling water; and they all took seats at the table.</p>
                           <p>Everything was delightful of its kind, and every visitor's wants supplied with a lavish hand.  Little Henry had a biscuit and a slice of cold bread placed on his plate together, and he was asked what he would like to eat with them.</p>
                           <p>"I want honey, mother."</p>
                           <p>"The honey was supplied.</p>
                           <p>"Can't I have butter and honey both?" said the child, eyeing some of the ladies who were freely mingling those delicacies.</p>
                           <p>"No, dear. You may have either butter or honey; but not both at once." There was no remonstrance, and eating and chatting progressed under the stimulus of the strong and fragrant tea.</p>
                           <p>"Can I eat cake and custard together, mother?" asked Henry again after a pause.</p>
                           <p>"Do you want anything more, Baby? if you do, take this bread with the custard, and eat the cake afterwards."</p>
                           <p>"Can't I have cheese, too?"</p>
                           <p>"Not at the same time; two things together are enough for a little boy."</p>
                           <p>The mother answered with the utmost simplicity, while Baby at once acquiesced. It was the general family programme and a hobby of the market woman that only two things should be eaten together; and that a more extensive mingling of flavors led to a perverted taste, and disposed to indigestion. If Elie had any intention of giving her visitors a lesson, this did not appear in voice or manner; but they all noticed that her example accorded with her precept, and it must be admitted that it detracted somewhat from their enjoyment of the variety of viands.</p>
                           <p>In reality Mrs. Reband knew very well that these two neighbors were both gifted with a free use of speech and eye. She had a fair inkling Of the nature of their gossip with the Western visitor, which had resulted in bringing the trio together that afternoon; and in her heart she was not greatly desirous of a repetition of the same. Instead of checking her child, therefore, she had answered<pb n="50 The Woman's Advocate."/>
his question exactly as she Would have done in their absence, leaving the result to take care of itself.</p>
                           <p>At parting, there was a neighborly handshake, another regret at the absence of her mother and husband, and civil compliments given and returned. When invited by the ladles to visit them, she replied that her business necessarily occupied her in Summer. In Winter she might perhaps find time to be more neighborly. She walked with them to the gate with parting words, as she opened it for them, and stood holding it ajar till their final good evening.</p>
                           <p>"She didn't ask us to come again, though!" said Jane Bradshaw, tossing her head, "and when I do go, it will be after this!"</p>

                           <head>MOTHER AND CHILDREN.</head>
                           <p>MRS. REBAND returned to the kitchen where her children were just finishing their supper.  She had left them a fair share of good things, and they were eating and chatting comfortably by themselves. The shadow of a dark smile fell from her eyes, and the corners of her mouth were drawn a little closely as she walked along the path. This smile, which was not uncommon with her, was altogether peculiar to herself, and never intended for the eyes of another. It seemed to be the natural outlet for feelings which a reticent woman, who was averse to telling her left hand what her right band doeth, cannot or will not express in words even to the nearest and dearest. It suggested a process of self-consultation and conclusion which never framed itself into speech, and which may be best hinted at by the pungent phrase, "Deep as a well."</p>
                           <p>If her thoughts bad found words on this occasion, it is probable that they would have sounded like a refrain of Mrs. Bradshaw's. "I didn't ask them to come again, and when they do come it will be after this!" But her thoughts did pot find utterance in words, and perhaps it would be hardly fair to interpret them, from the context of her manner.</p>
                           <p>She came in to the children looking in their eyes precisely as calm, kindly, alert and energetic as usual, and no more so. "Now Mary and John don't hurry the supper; but when that is over there is a great deal to be done, and father and grandmother will not be here before dark. We'll put away the food and leave the dishes to be washed when we get everything done in the garden. Is the cake nice, Johnnie?" smiling at the little fellow's evident relish of the last morsel.</p>
                           <p>Three little voices chimed in at once, "First rate. So nice, mother! Isn't it <hi rend="italics">very</hi> nice!"  "Nice, mother. I wish we could have company every day!"</p>
                           <pb n="51 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>She endorsed all their little enthusiasms in a very motherly way, sunning each little heart with her sympathy. "Company every day, Baby! That would be like a Summer Christmas all the time, wouldn't it?" depositing the fragments meantime in the pantry, that nothing need be lost, according to Scripture economy.</p>
                           <p>When I am grown up, mother, I mean to go visiting to get such nice teas," said little Henry.</p>
                           <p>"Do you, Baby? Take care then that you don't get as fat as our old man, who comes to buy things at the market. When people go visiting often in a year and get such teas as that, if it don't make them sick, sometimes they grow till they can't see their own feet; and they have to keep a little black boy to tie their shoes."</p>
                           <p>"Do they, mother?" said the little fellow, ruefully, standing with both hands in his first pockets, and his feet wide apart as he listened with astonishment. " I shouldn't like that!"</p>
                           <p>"No, Henry," piped little womanly Mary, "I shouldn't either; and I'd rather run about and do things than be lifted into a carriage, like a big doll, and have to smoke a pipe, like old Mrs. Pugsley, so as to keep thin. That's what she smokes for; she told me so, mother, and she keeps cake all the time, and eats it every day. She always gives me some when I see her."</p>
                           <p>Nice things don't taste as well to us if we eat them every day," said the mother; marching into the garden like a mother hen followed by her three chicks. And as busy as chickens in a freshly dug garden they all were, picking and picking, but not for themselves; till baskets and boxes were well filled; and just as the last gold and purple had faded from their sky and gone on in search of the ever setting sun, the little brood rested from their labors and went into the house.</p>
                           <p>"If only it wasn't for musquitoes, mother, I should like working after sunset; but just look here, and here, and here," pointing to the stinging, red blotches."</p>
                           <p>"And here too, mother;" "and here too!" chimed one and another.</p>
                           <p>"Yes, the musquitoes are troublesome towards night. Now we'll shut them out with the musquito door and the window nets, and we'll light the lamp. There's a saucer of salt and water to rub the bites, and you may all play the rest of the evening or read, just as you like."</p>
                           <p>"Let's all play odd and even," cried little Henry bringing out his small red cup of white and colored beans.</p>
                           <p>"I'd rather read my new book," said John.</p>
                           <p>"Then sissie you play, won't you?" pleaded the little fellow, coaxingly.</p>
                           <pb n="52 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"Yes, but I want to help mother wipe the dishes first."</p>
                           <p>" No I'll wipe dishes when mother is ready," said John, looking up from the book which he had already seized upon; "you play with Baby."</p>
                           <p>"I don't want any more help, to-night," said the mother, decidedly. "You have all been good children and done enough."</p>
                           <p>The two willing little ones were soon perched on the bottom stair of the flight which comes down into the kitchen, the chamber door making a back to their seat, alternatively crying, "odd and even," in the little, ringing childish voices, musical even to the most indifferent ears. To the mother, the stream of endless prattle, with its eddies of laughter, was as pleasant as a brook splashing and babbling over the stones would be to a poet, listening from his green niche under the trees. This mother was a mother and not a poet, and she was washing dishes after a wearisome day instead of dreaming deliciously in the midst of an idle one; but she felt no hardship now in her work. There is a great store-house of compensations laid up somewhere, so that the most insignificant worker always finds himself unexpectedly rewarded, strengthened, ennobled in the midst of his faithful toll; and men have sung psalms in dungeons from out the fullness of their overflowing hearts.</p>
                           <p>Nature had given Mrs. Reband the temperament of a worker, and education had strengthened it. The weariness vanished as she listened to the chime of voices, and looked proudly towards Johnnie, flushed, smiling and oblivious of everything in the delight of his new story. She had put a small but brilliant lard lamp upon the table by his side, while she worked on herself in comparative shadow, lighting a tallow dip when she had occasion to go out of the room for anything.</p>
                           <p>The hired men were still lounging and smoking under the trees, the room was tidied up, and the mother seated herself, the children leaving everything else to gather round her, like a cluster of bees about their queen when she is ready to settle down. The father and grandmother soon returned; and now came the account of the small journey and the day's events. Then the children were dispatched to bed, speedily, followed by the elders. Everybody slept soundly in that household.</p>
                           <p>"Is it all right, John?" asked the wife, who had waited till they stood together in their own room. "Did you bring the papers?"</p>
                           <p>He replied by producing some exceedingly legal looking documents; handing them to his wife with a beaming face. One paper proved to be a deed of fifty-two acres of land assigned to John Reband and Susan Reband jointly, in consideration of the sum of six thousand, two hundred and forty dollars;-two thousand,<pb n="53 The Market Woman."/>
two hundred and forty dollars, had been paid, but the other four thousand were in the form of a bond and mortgage on the property itself.</p>
                           <p>This land adjoined their own original farm. It was not cheap, estimated by the current value of neighboring land; yet they both felt sure from all the signs of the times, that it would greatly rise in value within a few years. Besides they needed more land for grass and grain as they went along; the vegetable domain was perhaps large enough already. So at least they reasoned, and on that assumption had acted; being now the possessors of more than a hundred acres, but with the four thousand dollars of debt. They had, however, some lea-way of ready money -- a large amount of "rolling stock," health, and hope.</p>
                           <p>"You see we can't keep our heads out from under a mortgage after all!" said John, laughing, "It seems as natural to us as your pink market bonnet does."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, John. We put it on for an occasion in the same way."</p>
                           <p>"You take it coolly enough now, Susy; but this one is twice as heavy as that other mortgage we married under more than a dozen years ago."</p>
                           <p>"But this one doesn't rest exactly on our heads though; it is hanging on the chimney tops of the other house, and the shadow falls only on the Canada thistles which grow in our new East lots."</p>
                           <p>"Well, the very shadow of it will kill all the thistles. Not much doubt about that!" said the husband, rubbing his hands well satisfied.</p>
                           <p>"Yes, I should hope so! We shall make five hundred dollars an acre on that land yet, Johnniekin, to say nothing of the difference of value between Canada thistles and grass. The rise in value is coming with the New York settlements; and they are beginning to spread like the white mold on the inside of an old water pail. They don't make much show yet; but they will directly."</p>
                           <p>"Eh, Susan!" said John, a little surprised. "Then it is well perhaps that you think it won't do to take more land than the farm will carry as it goes along, in case of sickness or death, else we might become millionaires without thinking of it, according to your arithmetic, Susy."</p>
                           <p>"Enough is better than a feast, which might leave us bankrupt," was Mrs. Reband's reply. The rare, bright smile which now and then covered the whole of her face covered it over now and rested upon it like a delaying sunset. It belonged to the same family, but certainly not to the same species with that other half smile of hers which  oftener flitted around but never lighted up her countenance. One never caught that except by some side glance. It came by stealth and was hastily uprooted; but this grew till, for the time, it blotted out every line and incipient crowsfoot just beginning to deepen in her face, and gave her the holy beauty of perfect self-forgetfulness.</p>

                           <p>"We must soon begin to think of a good school, John, where we can send the children to be educated."</p>
                           <p>A lady once congratulated an English country woman upon a legacy which had recently fallen to her and her good man. "Yes," the worthy dame answered  contentedly, "It will help us to get a little better eatables and drinkables than we used before."  The man or woman who earns money by persistent effort, generally has a keen eye to its possible various uses. The market woman had struck the key-note to her own central idea, "We must educate the children!"</p>

                        <docAuthor>Frances D. Gage</docAuthor>
                        <docDate>NO. II. FEBRUARY, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <p>AMONG the many conventionalisms that now-a-days clog the wheels of that ponderous vehicle, society, making them go creaking over the hard thoro'fares of life, like unoiled market carts, setting our nerves ajar by discordant gratings and groanings, are the rules of etiquette regulating fashionable calling and visiting. Friends that really esteem each other and would be only too happy to spend an evening once a week together for mutual pleasure and social converse, are found marking time and remembering with distinct care, who made the last call, and counting the days till it shall be conventional to call again. Whose fault is this? Do you want your neighbor to be sure and wait till you have returned her last ere she comes in again? Do you care whether she comes in her every day dress (all ladies should be neat and trim at home as well as abroad) and brings her work, and sits with you sociably an hour or two, or do you exact that she shall come in her last basque and flounces, with her best bonnet, parasol, fan and gloves? If you do not exact this formality from her, why insist in imposing it upon her? Why not live out what you profess to admire? Her heart is perhaps as true as yours. Do not go dressed up next time, to wait in dim parlors, with closed blinds, till she leaves her work and goes through the same operation of "dressing up" before she can venture into your presence! She will<pb n="56 The Woman's Advocate."/>
perhaps be compelled to leave work that she is hurrying about, to undergo all this inconvenience because she really desires to see you, and consequently will not ask you to excuse her. How silly, how cumbersome is all this, and yet every day of my life I see or know of ladies who have been acquaintances for years going through with it all, when a little good sense and carrying out of the rule they each profess to strive to follow, doing unto others as they would that others should do unto them, would dispose of the whole difficulty.</p>
                        <p>The caller would call in her daily attire, (we hope all ladies dress neatly and tidily at home) and her friend received her in the same way, each continuing as far as possible the regular order of her work, or if not busy, each accepting the other with the freedom of true friendship.</p>
                        <p>In cities and thickly populated neighborhoods this calling becomes a real oppression, and many people, unable to keep up with its requirements, are dropped out of society and are scarce known as living, breathing members of the great body. To those who cannot relinquish the pleasure of the social circle, who find no friend they want to lose, and whose mode of life increases the number daily, it often becomes a serious affair, and consumes so much time as to leave them little for anything else. "I have so much company," is the exclamation of nearly every agreeable well to do wife and housekeeper in the country.</p>
                        <p>"I was just ready to set about house-cleaning or washing bed-clothes, or had everything prepared to can my fruit, when who should come but neighbor Smith and his wife and two girls. I was very glad to see them. Mrs. Smith is so agreeable and Mr. Smith is a perfect encyclopedia. But then, coming in at such a time, just spoiled the whole visit."</p>
                        <p>Now is there not some way to avoid all this, or most of it? Say each lady agrees upon a reception day, once a week or once in two weeks, as she can afford, and lets it be known that upon that day she will receive her friends, not to feast them with good dinners and exquisite teas, but to chat with them, to pour out upon them the thoughts and feelings she has been gathering up as she walked, with steady steps, through the intervening days of duty in the housewife's department, and receive from them their experiences during the same interval. </p>
                        <p>It is high time that our social relations should be based on something less animal than eating and drinking. Many a social evening would thus<pb n="57 How to Entertain our Friends."/>
be spent by congenial minds with both. pleasure and profit, enlivening and beautifying life, if persons could be released from the drudgery of cooking, table-setting, dressing, and the irksomeness of waiting on a large company.</p>
                        <p>"Oh! but," you exclaim, "it is not always convenient to receive company just such a day, or to go abroad just such a day."</p>
                        <p>It is not always convenient to have Sunday come, and yet, who would do without it, even if there was no duty or obligation attached to it. It is the central point of the week, the time when most well regulated families square up the household arrangements, put a new polish the spoons, let in new light, open the windows, clear out the old cupboards, dispose of all mold, dust and cobwebs, and wake Sabbath morning clean and new, with bread enough cooked, and all the wheels fresh oiled and cleaned, so that they will run smooth and quiet through all the day, and the body released from its toilings and moilings, gives strength to the upward soaring pinions of the truly religious spirit, those that seek God from the innermost of their being, as the source of light and strength, to enter in and dwell with Him and He with them.</p>
                        <p>So would it be with these, sometimes, for social intercourse. They would originate hope and energy, induce order and throw a kind of halo over the various arrangements of the week, make the heart beat lighter, call the mind away from the mere detail of business, and more than all make us think, compel us to arrange something to say, to make ourselves interesting to those that come, and those we go to meet. And the strife in a neighborhood would soon come to be, not who can get up the most luxuriant and expensive supper, but who makes all guests feel the most happy, and sends them away with the most new ideas to cogitate upon in the weeks to come. Dissimilar minds would be brought together, and perhaps to the astonishment of all parties, they would find there was not after all so wide a gulf between them, and that idle gossip had given poor pictures of both factions, quite unjust to the originals. In this social communion--these common receptions--by all means let the young and old visit together. It is a fact past dispute that young people do vitalize and keep warm and fresh the life currents of the old, while the old harmonize and cool down the over-heated emotions and impulses of the young.</p>
                        <pb n="58 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>The manners of all would be improved. The jolly man brought in contact with the sober, the nervous and excitable with the phlegmatic the man or woman who has the blues with their enthusiastic neighbors, who see sunbeams and rainbows all the year round, and are quite sure that, as the sun always shines, there is no need of being in a hurry to make hay.</p>
                        <p>But above all other advantages, would we place that arising from the association of men and women in common conversation. Now, visitings and callings are done mainly by the ladies, and men, particularly business men, grow into a positive dislike to doing either. Calling comes at unseasonable hours, and visiting is sunk to a fashionable middle of the night party with a supper at eleven. No wonder they hate it, particularly when they see in the prospective the like turmoil at home, and the same oppressive bills to foot.</p>
                        <p>Just set apart this one day in the week or month-bend all things to it-just a little, (for it will take but little bending), and men will come to love it as they do their clubs or their lodge. Aye, more, for no men are to be found in any considerable numbers who do not like the company of ladies, particularly if they have a wife at home, who has floated in their minds beyond the fear of any uprooting the evergreens of true respect and love for the sex.</p>
                        <p>Men would become more refined, delicate, gentle and amiable, for this constant communion; women more strong, noble and earnest to act their part well, in these private theatricals of neighborhood life, and the family reception evenings, or the "reunion" (as they are now called), would soon become to her one of the brightest days in the calendar.</p>
                        <p>Don't be afraid your neighbors will call you proud and stuck up because, like the President of the United States, or the school board, or the bank directors, you have your special days and hours for disposing of this one of the important duties of life.</p>
                        <p>Is not the whole detail of home duty as social to you and yours as the work of the President? Aye, they are more so; more full of deep and thrilling interest. They are the all of life to you, and must not be interfered with to their loss. Let your neighbor and friend know and that you think them so, and they will immediately respond to the same great fact, and live and act accordingly.</p>
                        <pb n="59 The King's Daughters."/>
                        <p>Men never infringe upon each other, at least, proper men never do. Business before pleasure is their motto.</p>
                        <p>Why should not women bring their duties and pleasures into the same orderly and harmonious arrangement? Who will try it?</p>

                        <docDate>NO. II. FEBRUARY, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <p>A FEW days ago, in conversation with a gentleman, the "Suffrage" question was alluded to. He -- a man to whom schools, society and travel have given intelligence and culture, --opposed woman's claim to the ballot upon the ground that the possession by man of superior physical force, renders power his special prerogative. In a moment there came to mind that declaration of the Prophet, "The King's daughters are all glorious Within."</p>
                        <p>Though at first sight this sentence may appear quite irrelevant, it seemed to me to hold within itself a sufficient reply to the arrogant claims above set forth. The idea of authority is at once suggested by the word King; and Kings' daughters are regarded as the inheritors and transmitters of authority. The ancient ideal of a Princess endowed her with dignity of presence, grace of manner and speech, condescending to the lowly, yet lofty to the high. It clothed her in costly robes and priceless jewels, giving unto her, in short, all outward glory. In these modern, more democratic days, the Daughters of the Crown may win less universal homage, but the mental image of a Princess remains the same picture of visible show. One mighty has said in apparent protest to this universal prostration before the external, "The King's daughters are all glorious within."</p>
                        <p>He spake not of the daughters of Judean princes; not of the noble maids of the House of Pharaoh; nor, looking down the ages, did he say to the inhabitants of modern nations, "Ye are the happy subjects of worthy rulers, your Princesses,--Daughters of the House of Bourbon, and of the House of Stuart,--are all glorious within."</p>
                        <p>History forbids the thought that this claim was made for nominal Princesses only; since its pages show that inward glory has been no gen-<pb n="60 The Woman's Advocate."/>
eral characteristic of the high-born. In a sentence, written not for a day, but for all time, the <hi rend="italic">present tense</hi> indicates a truth ever true; hence this inner glory is claimed for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the legitimate Princesses of all time. In the text, the Seer appears to look forward to a day when externals shall be less regarded, and inner power more widely recognized. The morning of that day is already here and its full light is nearing apace. There yet remain those who consider bulk and bustle as the emblems of power, and the sure winners of success; but, again, History is our witness, and testifies that mere animal force has been, and is, being gradually bowed out of place; and is already, to a very considerable extent, supplanted by mental force. War, where once the rule, is now the exception. Labor, that formerly required matured masculine strength, is now performed by machinery that can be guided by the hand of a child. As thus matter becomes daily more and more subordinated unto mind, in the same ratio daily increase the chances of those, who deficient in muscle, are yet equal mentally.</p>
                        <p>This is emphatically an hour <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">weak</hi>; it is the hour in which inner glory will outshine outer brilliance; an hour in which the accessories of power are coming to be less regarded than the essence of power. All men whose intellects have discovered the laws of the material world, and aided in subduing the elements, until they have become mind's willing servitors, have wrought unwittingly, perhaps, but none the less surely for this hour. All women, the inner strength and glory of whose lives have found expression in outward act, whether of benevolence, of art, or of literature, are the insurers of this present Good, and the true prophets of an approaching Better.</p>
                        <p>We, in our "golden opportunities" but inherit the fruits of their labor. While we, as daughters of this most kingly century, claim our heritage, and reach forth our hands for the Ballot, which is the scepter of a Republic's kings, let us see to it that we can bear the test of the Prophet's sentence, and prove the validity of our claim, and the legitimacy of our title, <hi rend="italic">citizens</hi>, by inner purity and glory,--i. e., by the possession of mental and moral strength. Let us banish from our discussions and from our appeals, all narrowness, bigotry, selfishness and jealousy;. and thus, --in our hearts and minds, making room for that all<pb n="61 Inquiry."/>
gloriousness, --meet not o'er proudly, but reverently, that hour which even now is at hand; when -</p>

                        <p>"JUST as the twig is bent, the tree is inclined." This is a self-evident fact, and the saying, though an old one, is incontrovertible, from the constant recurrence of examples which illustrate its reliability. It needs no stretch of the imagination, to picture the young tree, at first, a mere twig, which takes root and flourishes under the genial influence of sun and showers. But we know that, even with these concomitants of growth and verdure, if the training is neglected, its natural tendency will be to an unsightly and almost useless maturity. Consequently, everything depends on the training. Care must be taken, that its body grow not unshapely, or its limbs become crowded or unfruitful through a lack of judicious pruning. It is easily pictured, the tree which is uncared for, -- and the one which is cultivated and tended in its youth,-- and a vast difference is of course discernible.</p>
                        <p>Just so it is with the human family. "Train up a child in the way be should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it," says the wise man, but a very small per cent of our children are trained by this example. The general system of governing the youth of the nineteenth century, is not in accordance with Solomon's wise counsel. The way in which he should go, is evidently an extremely devious way. At one time it turns to the right, and at another its course is directly opposite. Somehow, the poor child becomes entangled in the maze and labyrinth of windings; one day he is forbidden by papa to do this or that, and the next day his fond mamma alters the mandate, and Johnnie can do as he pleases. He soon learns a little lesson in chicanery, and when forbidden anything by one parent, he knows that it can be obtained by appealing to the other. If this lesson ended with childhood, perhaps it would not be so disastrous in its effects, although the chief harm in a little child's nature lies in its simplicity, and lack of deceit or guile. But it follows him through life. It is the easiest thing in the world to learn, and the hardest to overcome and forget.</p>
                        <p>Said a young lady a few days since --"When I was a child, I always knew how to manage papa and mamma. If she refused me any coveted<pb n="63 Mother's Rights."/>
pleasure, I would instantly seek papa and the boon was granted and vice versa. Occasionally, papa would be obdurate and refuse me what I desired. Then, it was only necessary to appear very much heartbroken, put my hands to my eyes and pretend tears, all the while that I was peeping through my fingers, to watch the effect upon my flinty-hearted parent. I never failed by this strategem, to gain the <hi rend="italic">desiratum</hi> of my hopes, and,"-- pausing abruptly, and dropping her eyes evasively, -- "somehow or other, I have never forgotten it, and always find the little art successful," and she laughed lightly.</p>
                        <p>How can we bring good out of all this evil, and error in judgment? There will always be injudicious parents, and children not easily governed,-- such traits are hereditary. I can see but one way by which this false system (or, more properly speaking, lack of system) can be renovated, and a new mode instituted. Let the mother possess the right to control her own surroundings; let ante-natal influences be of the right description, and there can be no failure. A child, born under proper ante-natal surroundings, may be whatever the mother desires, and were she as wealthy as the Rothschilds, she can never bestow upon her child, in all his after life, so great or so varied gifts as those given before ever his eyes beheld the light.</p>
                        <p>Let men learn that, although created before women, their right to rule and tyrannize over them is yet to be proved. Let there be more equality between the sexes, and an ending to the system of brute force, which is rampant among the lower classes,-- yes, and it invades the higher class of society, as well as the inferior. We read, in our daily papers, an account of "a nameless crime," perpetrated on a young child by a human fiend, while the agonized mother stood near and watched the little innocent grow cold and rigid, and its delicate limbs stiffen in death, and was threatened with a worse fate if she dared complain, or make an outcry, against the diabolical <sic corr="outrage">cutrage</sic> and murder, because, forsooth, the fiend was her husband. Such things seem incredible in this age of enlightened and refined people, but although we would fain disbelieve them, and pass them by as mere sensational tales, yet our police reports prove them to be too true. Would such things be if the law were altered giving to the mother the chief control of her children? If there is any more right to rule on one side than on the other, whose right is it more<pb n="64 The Woman's Advocate."/>
properly than the mother's, she who bore the pain and agony, and suffered beyond man's comprehension, and who, every day of her life of care and anxiety, feels the solicitude and fear which only a mother <hi rend="italic">can</hi> know, for the welfare and safety of her child. Who but a mother can realize the feelings of her heart, when her boy goes forth into the great, busy world, -- he who is the light and pride of her life,-- the great joy of her existence. How she trembles as she realizes the pitfalls which are on every side of him, and her heart aches with terrible agony, as he leaves the shelter of the home roof, and bares his brave young breast to the cold world's pitiless storm. Oh, it is hard to know that with all the temptations that surround a young man, in the midst of the whirl and excitement of business, she is powerless to avert the dreaded evil. She must be quiet, and bear it all patiently, because she happens to be a woman, and "it is not woman's place to make laws,-- it is not her sphere." She must watch the open rum shops which stand sentinel on every corner, and know that it is difficult for her boy to pass temptation by unheeded, to go through the battle, and come out unscathed. He has no desire for the sparkling beverage; he knows, understands, and realizes perfectly the woe which the glittering poison brings in its wake; but temptation awaits him at every turn; he hesitates,-to waver, is to be lost,-- and he sinks into the drunkard's grave, while the heart-broken mother must sit quietly and see her only son fall into the pit of destruction which men have digged for him, and she cannot lift one finger to stay the ruin; no, though she would gladly give her life, if by so doing the terrible temptation could be annihilated.</p>
                        <p>Men -- and women -- of America, must this thing be? I ask it in the name of Justice, and in behalf of our common sisterhood. There is that within my heart which tells me that when woman is admitted to an equality with man,-- politically, socially, and legally,-- there will be an end to this shameful sacrifice of life, which has become the great means of ruin to our country,-- ay, and the destruction of human souls. Then, allowed the privilege of training her own offspring in "in the way they should go," there will be a nobler, more elevated and intelligent race of people, with higher aspirations and purer principles and aims. There will be better wives and mothers, more faithful and tender husbands,<pb n="65 Perplexed."/>
for the child is father to the man," and as the twig is bent the tree is inclined." Until then, we can wait.</p>

                        <docDate>NO. II. FEBRUARY, 1870. VOL. III. </docDate>
                        <docAuthor>C.L. James</docAuthor>
                        <p>In behalf of the "good cause," I feel moved to tell how I was converted from hostility to the "Woman Movement." All the arguments brought against that great reform are of an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> character. I will simply tell you my experience. And to begin with the beginning -- I was brought up in an English Academy for young men, and regarded with much prejudice the American system of educating both sexes together. Two years of quite dispassionate observation have, however, forced upon me the conviction that the American youth, brought up in accordance with the apparent design of nature, are in comparison with my own schoolfellows like angels; while we, compared to them, were savages. The cruelty, the rudeness, the threatening, the cursing, bullying spirit, of the English schoolboy, is something to which I find no parallel among his compeers in this country. But there are contrasts more important still. The peculiar vices of youth, -- intemperance, unchastity, gaming, etc., are here regarded with deserved severity; while in England they passed for honorable distinctions, or at worst for venial errors. Of the state of girls' schools in England I know nothing, but cannot believe that a system ruinous to one sex can benefit the other.</p>
                        <p>But my basis of observation was not confined to England and America. I have seen the system of isolation carried to its full<pb n="67 How I Became a Convert."/>
extent in Italy, with the result of making the women idle, superstitious, crafty, and impure, and the men dissipated, volatile, flexible, and cynical. Let it be granted that domesticity is the design of Providence -- and our opponents never let us forget that truth. Domesticity does not exist in Italy. In England it exists in form, but there is a skeleton in (almost) every one's closet.  Only in America do the form and spirit go together. Thus there is a perfect induction <hi rend="italic">secundum magis et minus</hi> to show that virtuous men and women are best made by educating both sexes in common.</p>
                        <p>My observations (all biased on the wrong side) have convinced me that woman cannot be excluded from any society of men, and that society escape barbarism. Frontier settlements, monasteries, churches governed by the male members exclusively, all suffer in their spirit by the exclusion, and are revived when it is done away.</p>
                        <p>Now it is notorious that a medical student needs unusual stamina to resist the demoralizing influences amongst which he moves. It is known that counting-houses have a tendency to become dens of thieves; barracks, nests of ruffians; the polls, a sink of iniquity; the legislatures, marts of corruption. Is it an arbitrary decree of God, or a foolish custom of man, that sets so deep a curse on so many useful professions? Surely the last hypothesis is the more reverent and rational. Woman represents the conscientiousness, the tenderness, the devotion, the spirituality of mankind. Let her into our circles, and she will impart those qualities to them. And, in our turn, we, who now monopolize so large a share of human business, will impart to her our systematic, dispassionate habits and consequent intellectual force.</p>
                        <p>For, if we suffer by isolation so does she. Isolation teaches her to make admiration her <hi rend="italic">summon bonum</hi>. Exclusion from all means of mental improvement and mental labor dooms her to mental inanition.. It makes her a fashionable play-thing, ignorant, prejudiced, languid, trifling.  And with characteristic justice we urge the results of her wrongs against the recognition of her claims!  While the only common ground for man and woman is the drawing-room, how can man and woman be helpmates to each other? So long as this unnatural, unreasonable separation continues, man outside the drawing-room must be a semi-savage, and<pb n="68 The Woman's Advocate."/>
woman outside of it a semi-fool. But let the two sexes go into all the walks of life together, and we shall have everywhere the spirituality of the one supported by the vigor of the other.</p>

                        <head>PART SIXTH.</head>
                        <p>To those interested in questions of a reformatory character, there are few places offering greater attractions than the Empire City during that period known as "Anniversary Week." The annual assembling together of the members of the various liberal Associations, is not only a season of glad reunion for widely separated friends, closely knit in sympathy by common devotion to a cause; but it is, also, by the interesting character of the proceedings, a period looked forward to by thousands scattered over the land, as the Pentecostal time when they might blend the beholding of the wonders of a great city with the feast of sitting at the feet of the men and women -- the apostles of this later day -- whose burning words and lives consecrated to the uplifting of humanity have enshrined them as living temples of worship in the heart.</p>
                        <p>To Marian and her friend it was a period of the keenest enjoyment. Inaugurating it by their attendance at the magnificent lecture already recorded; upon the following evening, after a day of toil at the "case," the two girls were among the first of those who gathered at Steinway Hall to attend the closing session of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The announcement of Wendell Phiilips and Frederick Douglass as speakers -- whom a distinguished Senator present, in his address, characterized as "the ablest man of the colored race on this Continent, and the most brilliant orator of the white race" -- drew together a large assemblage, filling the spacious hall to repletion. To many of the audience both the glare of fashion and the appearance of the speakers were familiar; but to our gentle Lizzie it was as though some fairy realm had suddenly opened before her, and the time intervening between the gathering of the audience and the commencement of the exercises was pleasantly occupied by Marian in pointing out to her friend the more<pb n="69 Thrown Upon the World."/>
noted of the members, with the appearance of the most of whom, from her longer identity with the Cause, she was familiar. But we cannot linger upon this portion of our narrative, pleasant as were the features of the occasion. The girls saw many a form and face of those who, in former years, had passed through the fiery ordeal of persecution and won for themselves names, a grateful, rebaptised Nation will long remember. They saw Abby Kelley Foster, the once Joan d'Arc of the Anti-Slavery enterprise, wearing the heroic look and air of command, which not even disease, which had racked her frame, or the invalid-life of years, had power to destroy; they saw Charles C. Burleigh, beautiful in his simplicity and in the unconsciousness of his great mental force; Frederick Douglass, burly in frame, a  very giant in intellect, the Moses of his people ; -- all these, and more they beheld, and not less of wrapt enjoyment was there in contemplating the features of the representative men and women assembled, than there was in the listening to the eloquent addresses which followed, -- Frederick Douglass blended humor and logic, or Wendell Phillips' masterly arraignment of the Nation for its perpetuated wrong of centuries.</p>
                        <p>But of that Anniversary time, the events which most burned themselves into the remembrance of the girls, were the sessions of the American Equal Rights Association, which they attended upon the following day, having, for that purpose, so arranged their work as to be able to devote the entire day to the Convention. It was a memorable occasion. Not now is the time, nor here the place, to write its history; -- but the day will surely come when, to the noble spirits who struggled vainly throughout those stormy sessions to prevent a departure from time-honored principle, the pen of the historian will do full justice, while the hostile attitude of some of the leading members to the unmistakable claims of Justice and Humanity will remain a source of amazement to posterity. Of the conflict which had been going on within the Organization since its earliest meetings, presided over by the honored Lucretia Mott, now unable to attend its sessions -- of the attempts by a few ambitious members to introduce a political element into the movement and grasp the reins of leadership, -- Marian and her friend better than the many knew.

the journal claimed as the special organ of the Cause had systematically opposed a great measure of Justice and Humanity, and often, in the quiet of their room, communing together concerning the progress of this or that Reform in the outer world, they had deplored the fact, and mourned that reproach should thus have been cast upon so fair a Cause.</p>
                        <p>Prepared thus, by a previous knowledge of the want of harmony among the members, for any warmth of tone or variety of counsel in the Convention, the two girls were less surprised than many of the delegates, especially those from a distance, by whom the real cause of the difficulty was to the last unperfectly understood, when it became manifest that even the opening session of the Convention could not pass without a laying bare of long-concealed dissentient judgment and suppressed criticism. Beyond the scope of this simple narrative were it to dwell upon the stormy scenes of that memorable occasion. Throughout it all -- from the first calm, temperate statement of Stephen S. Foster, revealing the causes of the dissatisfaction of a large portion of the members with the affairs of the Society and the feeling of the compromised position in which they were placed, to the subversion of all order and the angry war of words which followed -- our two friends, with cheeks a-flame that such charges should be necessary, sat and only prayed that the Spirit of Wisdom might yet return to that distracted Convention. Nor from their two hearts alone, the silent invocation to the Most High arose that May morning. Upon that platform, rent as it were by a moral convulsion, of men and women known to fame, not a few of the purest and, intellectually, greatest of the land were gathered. That the criticisms pronounced were just and eminently fitting to be made, many believed; but by all the necessity for their utterance was deplored. It was as though, upon an honored cause, a disgrace had fallen; and though in subsequent sessions outward quiet and apparent harmony were restored, and many excellent addresses were delivered, a dull weight rested upon the minds of all, which no glowing outbursts of oratory, or sally of wit, could wholly remove, and the May anniversary of the American Equal Rights Association passed into history leaving heavier hearts behind it than any previous meeting of the Organization.</p>
                        <p>With Marian the occasion was one destined to be linked with another event  equally momentous in her life-history. Sitting in the crowded hall,<pb n="71 Thrown Upon the World."/>
that afternoon succeeding the stormy morning session, her gaze chanced to be directed to the gallery of the edifice, almost equally thronged with attentive spectators. As her eye ran carelessly over the tier of faces, it was arrested by one group, a family party, apparently, of a middle-aged lady and a gentleman, accompanied by a beautiful, almost child-appearing girl, whose strong resemblance of features to her more elderly companions, unmistakably pointed to the close relationship of parents and daughter. But rarely beautiful as was the girl, with her magnificent dark eyes, richly crimsoned cheeks and hair dropping in natural ringlets over the alabaster whiteness of the <hi rend="italic">petite</hi> shoulders, -- it was not upon her that the gaze of Marian was longest directed. For beside her, every slight attention or look diverted from the platform marking the man of the world and the acceptable escort, there sat one her heart gave a bound as flashed, instantaneously, the form and face upon her remembrance -- for she had not dreamed of him as near -- George De L'Estrange. Just as of old he looked. A trifle thinner perhaps; slightly embrowned by Eastern suns; but the same light shone from his expressive eyes, the same winsome smile dwelt upon his face, that Marian had carried in memory ever since he stood in the doorway of the "Home" on the evening previous to his departure. Little given to idle fancies was our heroine, and not to herself even would she have admitted the possibility of a warmer feeling than that of friendship springing up in her heart for George De L'Estrange. Changed as he was in character, in aims, in channel of thought, and in walk of life, the gulf was yet wide betwixt them; and while in the quietude of her chamber she had poured out her heart in gratitude for the work of elevation wrought in a noble nature, she would yet have deemed that insuperable obstacles lay in the way of any closer relationship with the once gay, wild reporter. But now, as led by an irresistible fascination, her eye sought and resought the gallery where he sat beside that beauteous girl, turning often to her in the pauses of the proceedings to continue their animated conversation, a feeling unknown to her before -- one strangely allied to pain -- took possession of her heart. What if he were something more than a friend to the girl over whom he bent with almost a lover's fondness? It might well be, for there was a gloriousness of beauty in those features of which she had dreamed, but never before beheld in<pb n="72 The Woman's Advocate."/>
life. It was a face, too, whose beauty consisted not in the perfection of the merely physical. There was an irradiation from within -- the soul looking forth and transfiguring all -- which gave to the countenance its supreme loveliness. Never had Marian beheld in a mould, at first glance so infantile, such a sense of maturity and power. Had she passed her upon crowded Broadway she would have turned, involuntarily, to gaze again upon her; but to be thus brought before her, as the companion of one whose image had been treasured by her more tenderly than she knew, was to invest her with a two-fold interest.</p>
                        <p>Slowly the afternoon session wore away. Never once, during those hours, that Marian was aware, was the gaze of De L'Estrange by chance directed to herself. She was confident that he had not perceived her presence; and very dilligently she strove to avoid glancing in that direction and to concentrate her attention upon the proceedings, but it was a wearying effort, and thankful was she when the Convention was declared adjourned, and she could join the surging throng pressing eagerly along the aisles and down the broad flight of stairs, to escape the stifling heat of the room and gain the cooler street.</p>
                        <p>Just before reaching the pavement, separated in the crush, for the time being, from her companion, she leaned against a pillar in a little eddy of the crowd, hoping at once to be rejoined by her friend. As she stood there, deeming herself secure from recognition behind the heavy folds of her veil, her heart gave a sudden start at the approach of the party that had so absorbed her attention; and ere she could change her position to avoid the slight chance of recognition, a quick eye had noted her form, and a well-remembered voice pronounced her name, while her hand was clasped warmly and impulsively in that of her absent friend of years.</p>
                        <p>"Come hither Mina," he said addressing his companion, at the same time still retaining his clasp of Marian and actually dragging her from the throng towards a more quiet part of the vestibule, -- " here are two of the 'strong-minded' that must immediately be brought to know one another. Patience a little," he continued in the light mood of old; "As soon as I can free you from this press I will perform all the offices of the most adroit court functionary. There, I think that will do," as they reached a quiet nook, allowing the human wave to sweep on to the<pb n="73 Thrown Upon the World."/>
street; "I may venture now upon an introduction. Mina, this is Miss Eveleth, of whom you have heard me speak; Miss Eveleth, this is my cousin, Mina Graves, of Washington. One of you wields the scepter in the realm of type; the other has a penchant for dabbling in mud and plaster; both of you have peculiar views of the sphere of woman; are as aggressive, independent, and man-hating as may be; advance, shake hands, and be as sisters."</p>
                        <p>The careless, off-hand way in which this was purposely spoken, set the two girls at ease at once, and a pleasant interchange of words, in the few moments afforded for conversation, followed, when, with a pang of reproach, at even the momentary forgetfulness of her friend, Marian, begged her companions to excuse her, explaining the cause of her anxiety, they having first won from her the permission to call upon her at the office on the following day. Hastening in search of her companion, great was her relief to be rejoined by the gentle Lizzie at the threshold, she having been borne in advance of her friend to the street, but had returned to the vestibule to find Marian engaged in conversation and so had forborne to disturb her.</p>
                        <p>It was a beautiful evening, and the girls, lured by its loveliness, were in no haste to reach the "Home." Very pleasant were Marian's reveries as they strolled along the walks of Madison Square, or slowly loitered by the old-time mansions, with their spacious grounds, bordering on Second Avenue. All the events of the afternoon flashed before her. How strange it was that Mina Graves -- the child sculptor of whom she had heard so much; whose romantic history, works of art, and wondrous beauty, were the theme of every circle in Washington -- should be the cousin of De L'Estrange, and that she should thus have the opportunity of forming her acquaintance. In a few hours she would again behold her, and in the indulgence of the anticipation of the pleasure of another meeting, the Iong walk was almost unheedingly passed, and in the twilight shadows they crossed the threshold of the "Home."</p>

                        <docDate>NO. II. FEBRUARY, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <docAuthor>Mary F. Davis</docAuthor>
                        <p>[THE following excellent article by our esteemed friend, MARY F. DAVIS, whose able pen has lent such valuable aid to the complete round of Reform, we take from the <hi rend="italic">Banner of Light.</hi>-ED.]</p>
                        <p>THE demand for Woman Suffrage has, since the close of the late war, taken a new and more definite shape. That terrible event awakened many women to an understanding of the theory of self-government; and the energies that were called forth in the upholding of our free institutions necessarily find outlet now in this new field of battle -- the establishment of woman's freedom. This is one of the immediate causes of the revival, on so grand a scale, of the Woman's Rights agitation, and of the definite and imperative demand, on the part of the agitators, for Woman Suffrage.</p>
                        <p>The "logic of' events" has brought us to this point. The assertion in the immortal Declaration of Independence, that "Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed," has taken root among all classes in this Republic; and, as a consequence, only those men are disfranchised who are incompetent or unworthy to give their consent to be governed. Those under age, those bereft of intelligence, insane men, and those convicted of crime, are ad<pb n="76 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Judged to be incapable or undeserving of exercising the rights of citizenship. All other men may express their will by the use of the ballot. In this country, a man can be deprived of this right only by some alleged fault or folly of his own, and consequently to be disfranchised is a tremendous criticism or stigma of the public on the individual. Not only so, but the ballot is at once the symbol and guarantee of self-government, and the privilege of using this symbol is an endorsement by a great nation of the manhood and freedom of its sons.</p>
                        <p>Thus logically the question arises, By what rule are the daughters of the Republic deprived of this symbol and safeguard of self-government? Are they to be classed with the imbecile and insane? If not, what monstrous crime can be laid at their door which should deprive them of the recognition and rights that America grants to virtuous and intelligent freemen? Last evening I heard an eloquent black man lecture on "Charleston as it was and is." After twenty-three years of Northern life and work as a clergyman, he returned to the city of his birth and enslavement. There he met those whom he had remembered "in bonds, as bound with them," and found them restored to citizenship, and some of them were holding responsible and honorable public offices. "Then," said he, "I straitened up and felt myself a man. Here my head had been bent and my spirit depressed, for the right of suffrage was withheld from me, and <hi rend="italic">if you deny me the elective franchise you deny my manhood.</hi>" It is easy for him who is guaranteed in the exercise of all the rights of citizenship to speak lightly of the ballot, and to wonder that it should be regarded of such value by the disfranchised; but he into whose soul the iron has entered knows full well the worth and power of that tiny, voiceless emblem of self-government that "executes the freeman's will, as lightning does the will of God."</p>
                        <p>It is not, therefore, as an end but as a means that we ask the elective franchise for woman. It is at the threshold of her advancement. It is the first round of the ladder which she must climb by slow and toilsome steps in order to reach the "perfection and truthfulness of character" which "are the secret intentions of Nature." She needs to realize her dignity of soul by being placed on an equality with all who share the Divine Humanity, and to feel the pressure of the duties and responsibilities that lie in the track of freedom. She must learn the lesson known by the<pb n="77 The Question of Woman Suffrage."/>
patriots of the Revolution, but which needed to be again burned into the consciousness of men by the awful tragedy of fratricidal war that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." Woman needs the education that the ballot brings, and the incitements to intelligent exertion that by means of self-government are brought to bear upon the free. Like man, she is placed here with the endowment of Godlike faculties, but she needs, as he does, the weight of duty, the attrition of care and thought, the monitions of stern discipline, to give these faculties proper adjustment and activity. No agency should be withheld that would help her to live the largest, truest, noblest life of which it is capable, for she is so placed, in the economy of God, that upon her depends in great measure the weal or woe of individuals, nations and the world. As daughter, sister, wife, mother, she needs both the encouragement and protection which an understanding of the sublime principles of a free government, and a participation in its affairs, give to man. She is guardian of the family and the home. Let her not become less than this, but more. Let her clear intuitions be directed to the broader family and larger home which exists beyond her own fireside, and she will soon come to see that her pitying heart and tender hand are needed in the redemption of society and the rectification of government. The guardian of the home must become the guardian of the State, that larger home which needs to be adorned by the hand of woman with the beauty of holiness.</p>
                        <p>A loveless theology and a loveless government are both at variance with the principle of Good. In suns, and planets, and the drop of dew, the centripetal and centrifugal forces balance each other. In stars and blossoms, and the grain of sand, the principal of polarity is found. No where is there a rounded sphere without the positive and negative in equipoise; and never, through all the ages of coming time, will there be a rounded Republic, a righteous and happy nation, without wisdom and love, man and woman, at the centre and circumference of government. </p>

                           <p>SINCE the formation of the American Woman Suffrage Association at Cleveland, no auxiliary movement has been more gratifying to us than the organization of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association, which interesting event took place in Philadelphia on the 22nd ult.</p>
                           <p>Pennsylvania, with its grand historic record and general character for philanthropy, hitherto has been strangely apathetic on the question of Woman Suffrage. While, within the twelve-month past, extending throughout the New England and Western States, there have been a brilliant series of Conventions, agitating and illuminating the subject; no similar gatherings, <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, of the people, that we are aware during that period, have broken the dead, night-like apathy of Pennsylvania to the question of EQUAL RIGHTS for Woman. Even in Philadelphia -- the city of glorious memories, and the home of LUCRETIA MOTT and ANNA E. DICKINSON -- scarcely more of vitality and interest have been outwardly apparent. But the work of organization, if long delayed, has at last been done -- and done well. From the ranks of the Anti-Slavery workers -- the men and women upon whom for well nigh a third of a century past has rested the burden of that great enterprise -- has been developed the spirit and germ of a new movement, consecrated to Woman's Emancipation. Out of that splendid material, a Society has been formed, comprising among its members the names of not a few whom the Nation holds in grateful remembrance; and whose labors in the new field cannot but be fraught with consequences as blessed for humanity as were their self-sacrificing exertions in years past. It is indeed an organization of which Philadelphia may justly be proud, and we predict for it a field of usefulness second to that of no State organization in the land. For the successful inauguration of the movement, Pennsylvania is largely indebted to the very efficient Chairman of the Executive Committee, Mr. JOHN K. WILDMAN, of Philadelphia, than whom the Cause has no more devoted friend. We present herewith a list of the officers:</p>

                           <p>ONCE more we beg to remind the East that it must be astir if it would not be completely distanced by the West in the march of progress. Already, from the older States, the laurel of being first to proclaim Woman Suffrage to its citizens has been plucked by the infant Territory of Wyoming; and now, catching the contagion, Colorado, through its noble Governor, utters words which, by their lofty comprehensiveness and recognition of principle, might well shame the timid Executives and halting Legislatures of the States of the East. How cheering, how like a fresh draft of air from those Mountains, it is, to us who dwell in this reeking atmosphere of corruption, to catch such words, speaking the larger freedom of the West! In his recent Message -- itself a model for terseness -- Gov. Edward M. McCook thus favorably commends the question of Woman Suffrage to the Colorado Legislature:
<q direct="unspecified">"Before dismissing the subject of franchise, I desire to call your attention to one question connected with it, which you may deem of sufficient importance to demand -- some consideration at your hands, before the close of the session. Our higher civilization has recognized woman's equality with man in all respects save one, suffrage. It has been said that no great reform was ever made without passing through three stages -- ridicule, argument and adoption. It rests with You to say whether Colorado will accept this reform in its first stage, as our sister Territory of Wyoming has done, or in the last; whether she will be a leader in the movement or a follower; for the logic of a progressive civilization leads to the inevitable result of a universal suffrage."</q>

                           <p>A HIGHLY important and interesting Woman Suffrage Convention, continuing throughout three days, was held in Washington, commencing the 8th ult. The sessions throughout were characterized by great harmony and an unflagging interest in the proceedings, the audiences steadily increasing until the close of the Convention. Among the well-known friends of the Cause present, by the most of whom addresses were delivered, were ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, President of the National Woman Suffrage Association, SUSAN B. ANTHONY, ISABELLA B. HOOKER, PAULINA W. DAVIS, M. E. J. GAGE and SAMUEL J. MAY. In addition to a large attendance of the citizens of Washington, quite a number of Representatives and Senators, during the various sessions of the Convention by speech or presence manifested their interest in the Cause. In an especial manner Senators WILSON and POMEROY identified themselves with the movement, and warmly commended the question of Woman Suffrage to the favorable consideration of the National Legislature. The Hon. G. W. JULIAN, whose voice is ever lifted for Equal Rights, and whose absence, on account of ill health, from Washington, is so greatly to be regretted, we rejoice to say, it is expected will soon be able to resume his seat and active duties.</p>
                           <p>On the 22nd inst. the Joint Committees of the House and Senate for the District of Columbia were met by a Committee from the Woman Suffrage Convention, charged with the duty of presenting the claims of that body fur Woman Suffrage in the District of Columbia. The hearing was eloquently conducted by ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, ISABELLA B. HOOKER, SUSAN B. ANTHONY and other distinguished advocates of Woman Suffrage, and the demand for equal political rights was listened to by the members composing the Joint Committees with the most respectful attention. The effect of the very able presentation of the case was marked, several members declaring themselves convinced of the rightfulness of Woman's claim to the Ballot. Among the Conventions held within the year, that which recently concluded its labors at Washington may be regarded as one of the most eminently successful.</p>

                           <head>WOMAN IN THE MEDICAL COLLEGES OF EUROPE -- AN AMERICAN GIRL'S TRIUMPH</head>
                           <docDate>NO. II. FEBRUARY, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>TO a very interesting foreign correspondence in the N. Y. <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> of the 19th inst., we are indebted for much valuable information concerning the progress made in the admission of women into the Medical colleges of Europe, which on the whole does not appear to have been greater than in this country. According to the statements of the writer, who evidently has taken pains to acquaint himself with his subject, the opposition, thus far, in England has been successful. No women have yet been admitted to a medical university in lordly Albion; and scores of eager applicants have turned from the doors of English universities, to seek the opportunities denied them in the more liberal schools of the Continent -- those of Zurich, Berlin or Paris. In Scotland the opposition to woman's admission has only been defeated after a long and closely contested struggle. But neither in England nor in Scotland has the opposition taken such insulting, rowdyish form, as in the case of the Philadelphia outrages, which have inflicted such irreparable disgrace upon the American character. Woman has been rigorously excluded, but she has been turned away with civil words. The rejection invariably has been couched in courteous terms and, in some instances, the smart of refusal has been taken away or softened by the good wishes expressed by the Faculty for their better success elsewhere. "Defeat is always unwelcome," says the writer, "but it may be softened by civility."</p>
                           <p>But it is upon the Continent, and especially in Paris, that the greatest progress has been made. In the city whose only resource from the autocratic pleasure of an unsympathetic, relentless Ruler is the barricade and the open revolt to power; of all the great centers of wealth and civilization, the nearest approach to equality by both sexes in facilities for acquiring the knowledge of a noble profession has been exhibited. This is best illustrated by the writer's graphic description of the final examination in the <hi rend="italic">Ecole de Medicine</hi>, the famous Medical School of Paris, at which (the school being made up of students of both sexes) the highest honors were borne off by an American girl, who, although not mentioned by name, is well known to be MiSS MARY PUTNAM, daugh-<pb n="82 The Woman's Advocate"/>
ter of the eminent publisher G.P. PUTNAM, of this city. We crave no apology for thus presenting her name to our readers, for it is meet that they should know how much one girl, yet on the threshold of womanhood, has done to open the hitherto closed portals of science and to reflect luster on the American name abroad. Defeated in her quiet yet persistent efforts to obtain admission into the schools of medicine in this city; two years ago Miss PUTNAM visited Paris, and tried there, what had been denied her at home -- admission into the great Medical School of Paris. It was au audacious application. At that time not only had 130 woman been admitted as a student within its walls, but probably no one but our plucky American girl had ever even entertained the thought of making such a preposterous request. But the application was not only made, but so stoutly adhered to that the youthful enthusiast saw obstacle after obstacle melt from her pathway, and eventually she was installed as a student in the College.</p>
                           <p>Of her subsequent brilliant career -- how she lightly triumphed over every difficulty of strange surroundings, of alien tongue and prejudice of sex -- how she surpassed her companions, the choice alumni of the youth of scholastic Paris -- we need not say in words. Suffice it that at the close of the long and trying ordeal of the examination, made with a view to test every faculty and demonstrate the full extent of knowledge, the Dean of the Faculty, who had not attempted to conceal his satisfaction at the failure of all his efforts to confuse the American girl, rubbing his hands turned to his colleague, saying aloud, "Oh! <hi rend="italic">Tres bien! Tres bien!</hi>" In the same class with Miss PUTNAM was an English lady, who passed a highly creditable examination, receiving the mark, "<hi rend="italic">Bien satisfait,</hi>" a high certificate, but, in the language of the writer, "for the American was a <hi rend="italic">Tres satisfait,</hi>' the highest that is given, and the first time it has been gained this year."</p>
                           <p>After this magnificent demonstration, in the greatest University of the world, of Woman's ability to master science, we trust that our American colleges will yield to the demand of the age, and their portals be no longer closed to the aspiring, knowledge-seeking, true-souled women of the land.</p>

                              <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Journal</hi>, of which, in advance of publication, mention simultaneously from was made in our last, issued its initial number Boston and Chicago on the 8th ult., since which period its weekly visits to us have been made with welcome, clock-work regularity.</p>
                           <p>There are now in America at least three apparently well-established weekly journals specially devoted to the advocacy of Woman Suffrage: -- <hi rend="italic">The Revolution</hi> in this city, edited by Mrs. ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, with Miss SUSAN B. ANTHONY as Publisher; <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Advocate</hi> of Dayton, Ohio, edited by MIRIAM M. COLE and A. J.

LLOYD GARRISON, and T. W. HIGGINSON.</p>
                           <p>First of these in the field, <hi rend="italic">The Revolution</hi> justly may be regarded as the pioneer Woman Suffrage journal of the country; and now, in the third year of its existence, exhibits, on the part of its conductors, the same tireless energy as when it issued its initial number. Its influence upon the public -- far less, we believe, than if a more truly humanitarian policy had been pursued -is yet measurably great, and it numbers among its devoted adherents some of the truest and most influential friends of the Cause. By its cruel, unnecessary opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment and the just claims of a long enslaved people, <hi rend="italic">The Revolution</hi> has cast reproach upon the name of Equal Rights, alienated from its support a large portion of the people who otherwise would have become its natural constituency, and deprived itself of all opportunity to be regarded as the true organ of the movement.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Advocate</hi> (our second self by the odd coincidence of name) comes to us in a new form, enlarged in size, and otherwise improved. It is a fearless, out-spoken journal, and richly merits the measure of support which it appears to have received from Ohio and the West.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Journal</hi>, rendered a necessity by the unfortunate diversity of opinion to which we have alluded, has a high mission of usefulness before it, which we trust it may be enabled to fulfill. The logical sequence of the Cleveland Convention, upon it rests the burden<pb n="84 The Woman's Advocate"/>
of justifying the action of that body, and of presenting the Cause in its momentous bearings, higher aspirations, and true dignity to the American people. Thus far its progress has been most auspicious. It has won, at the beginning, the respect of the press, and appears rapidly to be working its way into the hearts and the homes of the people. In all that goes to redeem the movement from the injudicious counsel or action of the past -- in all that tends to the elevation and the truer relationship of the sexes of all the great human family -- we wish the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Journal</hi> abundant success. Respecting the literary merits of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> we have not deemed it necessary to speak, as its own brilliant editorial corps is assurance of excellence in every department. In its more than pecuniary success, scattered throughout the land, hundreds of warm hearts are interested as rarely in a journalistic enterprise. May every expectation be richly fulfilled. Laying down the pen, from this brief mention of kindred journals, may we not be permitted to indulge in the hope that, in the coming glory, already haloing the movement all sense of past difference may speedily be lost and that the Future, so full of hope, will see a united front of the friends of Woman Suffrage until the final triumph of the Cause is assured.</p>

                           <docAuthor>Charlotte Denman Lozier</docAuthor>
                           <p>OF women known and honored, whether in the medical profession or in any of the more public walks of life, few were justly held in higher regard than the late Dr. CHARLOTTE D. LOZIER, whose untimely death has been so mourned by the entire community. Not alone the medical profession, of which she was a distinguished ornament, but society at large, has sustained a loss not easily repaired. Although yet in the flower of early womanhood when her earth-work was completed, not having attained her twenty-sixth year, she had achieved a prominent position in the medical world, and by her high-toned and noble philanthropic labors had earned the right to be regarded as a leader in the conspicuous benevolent and reform associations of the age.</p>
                           <p>For one so young and seemingly so frail, the achievement, the extent and varied character of the work crowded into Mrs. LOZIER'S life, was<pb n="85 Editorial Department."/>
something wonderful. She was a graduate of the New York Medical College for Women in this city, bearing from that Institution, by the unanimous award of the Faculty, the highest honors of scholarship. At the time Mrs. LOZIER commenced her medical studies, some eight or ten years ago, women had far less opportunities for presenting medical studies than they now enjoy, imperfect as they yet may be. A lady (who subsequently became her mother-in-law) had just established the College, in the face of extreme prejudice, and all its substantial victories were yet to be won. A young enthusiast, with all the qualities which make of human kind, if need be, martyrs, MR. LOZIER entered upon her studies. Her days were spent in the class-room and hospital; her nights were devoted to the pursuit of anatomical and physiological investigations. In that memorable struggle of seven years ago to secure for women students of medicine the privilege of attending the <hi rend="italic">clinics</hi> of Bellevue Hospital, she not only assisted, but was the recognized leader. The opposition engendered by this determination of the women students to avail themselves, equally with men, of the privileges of Bellevue Hospital, at this time can scarcely be estimated at its true weight and deformity. Hundreds of male students in unanimous conclave had determined that no "women doctors" should ever be tolerated among them, or become initiated into what they meant should be as the mysteries of some <hi rend="italic">black art</hi>, confined to a sex alone. The recent outrages, to which the women medical students of Philadelphia were subjected, if we may trust the reports lying before us, were as nothing compared with the obloquy and abuse heaped upon the heads of the courageous lion-hearted women students who first attended the <hi rend="italic">clinics</hi> and walked the wards of Bellevue. But the perseverance of a few, -- animated by a purpose that would brook no human obstacle, -eventually triumphed. Nor was this the only struggle, in order to obtain a complete medical education, in which Mrs. LOZIER was compelled to engage. Other obstacles, scarcely less formidable, from time to time arose; and, while each struggle resulted in strengthening her character and enlarging the scope of her mental faculties, the continuous strain upon her system was at the too costly sacrifice -- as events proved -- of sapping the delicate powers of life itself.</p>
                           <pb n="86 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>Graduating thus with distinguished honor, with attainments so remarkable, it is not strange that she was called upon to fill the chair of a professor in the college in which she had been a student. Such was the confidence of the public in her scientific attainments and professional qualifications that she passed almost at once into a large practice -- one that left her but little relaxation from the lecture room and the discharge of her arduous college duties. The choice of the profession had been almost a religious conviction with her, and she neglected no opportunity to qualify herself for a conscientious discharge of its responsibilities. No study was too abstruse or forbidding; no problem at all bearing upon the profession without due consideration to be cast aside. But in all this there was more than the desire for mere intellectual gratification. In the best sense of the term she was a reformer, and the desire to promote the welfare of others was ever the controlling motive in her mind. With all our worthy benevolent and reformatory associations Mrs. LOZIER was prominently identified, her quiet but unswerving interest in them remaining unchanged to the last of her useful life.</p>
                           <p>From the conclusion of a beautiful tribute to Mrs. LOZIER in the <hi rend="italic">Home Journal</hi> of this city, from the pen, we presume, of Mr. GEORGE PERRY, we transfer the following:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Her mind, though preeminently of a practical cast, showed much aptitude for poetry and art. In the former she has left productions which are characterized by pure and elevated sentiment, an active imagination, earnest thought, and considerable proficiency in metrical expression. Her public addresses and lectures were eminently popular and successful, and those delivered as professor at the Medical College, were of marked excellence, promising a most brilliant future. Her productions generally were distinguished for clear and rapid thought, a logical method, natural and effective expression, a regard for the matter rather than the manner, embodying withal, that unstudied perfect adequateness of the word to the idea, which of itself constitutes one of the high graces of style.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Thus, everything conspired to mark out for her a proud career of usefulness, influence and honor. At the very dawn, as it were, of the strength and maturity of her character, she passed away. But life is not measured by years; and, although she went thus early, she did not go till she had accomplished deeds to ennoble a lifetime, and entitle her to the lasting remembrance of mankind. Brief as was her career, its high purpose and achievement suffice to rank her among the noble few whose very ashes blossom in the dust."</q>

                           <p>OF all the social organizations of the "modern Athens," to which the requirements of the New England of to-day have given birth, perhaps one of the most interesting to the visitor is the "Woman's Club."  Of this association, a full account of the scope and organization of which was published in the initial number of THE ADVOCATE, a writer to the N. Y. <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, whom we suspect to be Miss Nelly Mackay Hutchinson, thus pleasantly speaks:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"The building rented by the Woman's Club is now solely occupied by women. It is in Tremont place, a quiet, dingy, dull little no thoroughfare opening out of Beacon street. The house itself is as dingy and as quiet -- the very opposite of Delmonico's. It is the picture of practical cosiness and common sense, substantially solid as Faneuil Hall and Franklin Monument. The carpets are faded, but the women who tread them radiate wit and wisdom. The tables are old, but they bear the newest fruits of philosophy. The sofas and chairs are worn, but the grandest men and women of New England have rested upon them. Pretty landscapes hang around, and Emerson's earnest face looks down from the wall. In one of the parlors you find a committee meeting -- a group of thoughtful women -- many of them distinguished in literature. All are attired in dark stuff dresses, with the whitest and neatest of collars and cuffs. Mrs. Sewall's dainty head and fine face are visible in one corner. Opposite sits Edna Cheney -she of the noble figure and genial philosophy. One little literary woman knits quietly by the fire, and the earnest, soulful talk goes on in total oblivion of diamonds, point lace, satin, and the like. Once a month the Club has a Tea,-- to which are invited notable men, as well as women. They have poems and speeches, and a childlike, piquant jolity reigns. Mrs. Howe makes out women like a happy school girl, and throws her sparkling bon-mots right and left. Emerson jokes with quaint boyishness, and the dignified Sewall bubbles over with humor. The ladies wear what they please -- which is generally a walking dress of some dark material. They have charades and tableaux also. At a recent tea, Mrs. Cheney appeared as Pere Hyacinthe, a character for which her round fair face and large figure strikingly fitted her.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Afternoon readings and lectures are given before the club at short intervals. Emerson and Dr. Channing are soon to lecture there. As an organization in which obtains the finest culture, the truest womanliness, the highest spirituality, the Boston Woman's Club takes precedence of any similar one in the country."</q>

                           <p>We rejoice that the Woman Suffrage Association of New York, copying the example of kindred State organizations, which elsewhere have been attended with such excellent results, have commenced the publication of a series of Tracts designed for the information of the people upon the question of Woman Suffrage.</p>
                           <p>An excellent commencement in this missionary labor has been made in the initial Tract before us, edited by M. E. Joslyn Gage, the efficient President of the State Association. Mrs. Gage, in ranging over the varied field in which inventive talent has been displayed, has exhibited rare judgment in all her selections, as well as literary skill in condensation and arrangement of narrative. Turning over the pages of this interesting record of woman's creative skill, the reader meets with such well-known names as Barbara Uttman, Isabella Cunio, Betsy Metcalf, and others scarcely less known to fame; while a knowledge of the deeds of other woman inventors, scarcely known to the world, inspires him with added respect for the mental capacity of the sex. We trust that this interesting little work will be followed by others similarly instructive, and that their mission will be to purify and divest the mind of its prejudice concerning the equality and the full investiture of woman with all the sacred rights of humanity.</p>
                           <p>As an illustration of Mrs. Gage's industry and the value of her compilation, we present the following account of the true inventor of the Cotton Gin, one of the greatest mechanical triumphs of modern time:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"It may, perhaps, be unknown to many persons, that the invention of the cotton-gin, one of the greatest mechanical triumphs of modern times, is due to a woman. Although the work on the model was done by the hands of Eli Whitney, yet Mrs. Greene originated the idea, and knowing Whitney to be a practical mechanic, she suggested his doing the work. This was during the winter 1792-3, when he was a guest at her house, near Savannah.</q>

                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">Mrs. Greene whose maiden name was Catharine Littlefield, was the widow of Gen. Greene, of Revolutionary memory. After the return of peace Gen. Greene moved with his family from Rhode Island to Mulberry Grove, on the Savannah river, where he soon died, leaving his estate much embarrassed and five children for his wife to educate. Shortly after this, Eli Whitney went South to teach in a private family. When he reached Georgia he found his place supplied, and thereupon decided to apply himself to the study of law, making Mrs. Greene's house his home.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"The great difficulty of separating cotton from the seed was at that time a staple subject of complaint among cotton-planters. To separate a pound of the black seed variety, to which the lint does not adhere even so closely as to the green, was a negro's task for a day. So slow was the process that it became the regular practice for all the family of a cotton-planter to engage every night in the laborious work; and the task was looked upon as so great that it was the ordinary topic of conversation among those who cultivated cotton, and a fortune was prophesied for the lucky inventor of a machine capable of doing the work.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"It was after a conversation of this character, which had been held by some guests in her house, that Mrs. Greene proposed to Whitney the making of such a machine, and upon her idea he commenced.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">The work was done in her house, and under her immediate supervision. The wooden teeth first tried did not do the work well, and Whitney, despairing, was about to throw the work aside, when Mrs. Greene, whose confidence in ultimate success never wavered, proposed the substitution of wire. Whitney thereupon replaced the wooden by wire teeth, and within ten days from the first conception of Mrs. Greene's idea a small model was completed.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"This primitive little model was of such perfect construction that it has ever since stood as the model of all cotton-gins, and the inventive genius of universal male Yankeedom has not yet been able to suggest any practical improvement in the machine. Mrs. Greene, through her second husband, Mr. Miller, became the partner of Whitney in the manufacture of gins.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"By means of this invention an extraordinary impetus was given to the culture of cotton. Instead of a pound a day, as was formerly cleaned by hand, three hundred pounds were cleaned by the gin, and in a much better manner than hand-work could do. The importance of the invention can hardly be overestimated. Every cotton-mill throughout the world that whirrs its machinery in drawing out threads, or whose shuttles fly back and forth in the manufacture of cloth, is indebted to Mrs. Greene for its activity. Every sewing-machine used in shop or private house plies its treadle more rapidly on account of Mrs. Greene's genius. The cry, 'Cotton is king,' could never have arisen had not the gin, with its myriad man-power, first come into existence."</q>

                           <head>ESSAY, Recommending the Union of  Great Britain and her Colonies and the United States, and the final Union of the World. By Frances Vincent. Published at Wilmington, Delaware.</head>
                           <docDate>NO. II. FEBRUARY, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>The above thoughtfully considered paper, which has attracted a measure of public attention, recommends the union of the entire Anglo-Saxon race into one Nation,-- a great Anglo-Saxon Confederacy, with a Constitution similar to that of the United States,-- to the end not only that there should be improved political and commercial relations between all parts of the absorbed Republic, but that its manners, customs and laws might spread over the face of the whole earth, until all mankind should form one people, speaking one common tongue. </p>
                           <p>Mr. Vincent has taken great pains to elaborate his plan for a United Government, and the advantages presented are sufficiently weighty and numerous to challenge the attention of the wise and thoughtful both in Great Britain and in the United States. The whole Essay bears the evidence of careful, painstaking investigation into the system of governments, as well as the liveliest concern for the true interests of humanity. Impracticable as the scheme may be regarded by the many, it is in conformity with the tendency of the age to bring all nations into closer communication and fraternal intercourse; and to all advance thinkers we recommend Mr. Vincent's aspiration and closely considered argument for the brotherhood of the human family.</p>

                        <p>(Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1869, by ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.]</p>

                           <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                           <p>THE wind had been whistling through every cranny of the house all night long, making every shutter and casement shiver and chatter like a man with the ague. Yet all this had not frozen the sloppy earth, which looked in the hazy moonlight like one great cheerless, unending bog; mud and water in about equal proportions.</p>
                           <p>"It must have rained in the night," said the market woman, as she stood looking from her window upon the dreary scene, while there was but little promise, yet, even of the earliest dawn. "Don't try to get up, John, till breakfast is ready. I'll rub away the rheumatism in your back with flannels and liniment, and your cold will be the better for another nap under this extra comfort. Michael will be proud to take the milking business all into his own hands."</p>
                           <p>"Unless he is knocked up too, Susy. That ditching was a foolish thing to stand by in the way we did, with everything just at the point of freezing all the afternoon. You were right about it, as you always are; but I was bent upon finishing a disagreeable task, and here are the results."</p>
                           <p>"0h, Mike will be well enough! never fear for him; and now, dear, try to sleep for two hours." The wife gave a last consoling kiss and a last comforting tuck to the bed-clothes, and went out shutting the door softly; carrying her<pb n="94 The Woman's Advocate."/>
shoes in her hand that she might not disturb grandmother and the children. "Michael," she called under the window, "Mr. Reband is sick this morning and you must carry over the milk. There will be no time to lose."</p>
                           <p>"Coming, ma'am," replied the Irishman, stumbling on to the floor hastily. This was followed by a prolonged "Ugh! the foot of me! Is the evil one pullin' at all me toes, thin? And what iver am I to do with the boots?"</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband not waited for this soliloquy. With her two milk pails in hand she was already in the yard, and now seated on her three-legged stool was listening to that indescribable, jerky, muffled sound of the falling milk. To her it was familiar, home-like music, and not at all unacceptable. She had overborne her husband's judgment, and determined on keeping milch cows in Winter, sending the milk to a neighbor who carried it to town with his own in his milk cart; and thus for the whole Winter they were all obliged to be earlier astir than usual.</p>
                           <p>It is rather hard, I know, John," the wife had said in her lowest and kindiest tones, freighted with a little inward compunction; 11 but the milk business is always profitable, and we are in debt <hi rend="italic">four thousand dollars</hi>." So the matter was settled, and it is only justice to say that she never shirked her part of the daily burden, or faltered in her outward approval of her own arrangement.</p>
                           <p>Poor Michael held his boot in one hand and nursed his swollen foot with the other, perched uneasily upon the side of his bed in the chilly gloom about him; and then in desperation he thrust in his toes but only to draw them out again with a smothered howl.</p>
                           <p>"Blame it! that's a touch beyant me, howsomever. I'd like to do the best for the woman who always does the best for herself, but I jist won't put me corns and chilblains into that boot!"</p>
                           <p>He sat a moment meditatively, turning right and left uneasily as if in search of something to help him out of his dilemma. "B1ast that ditch! And I 'no time to lose, 'eh; but I can't go out barefoot, of a certain." Then he bobbed his 
grizzled head into every corner of the room, and plunged under the bed in vain search after an old pair of shoes; and ended by groping his way into the entry and finding the lantern, which he lighted. At last he found the shoes and limped into the yard, sitting down to his milking without a word of complaint, like a staunch old hero as he was.</p>
                           <p>Molking was done, the creatures were all feeding comfortably, and two great tin pails stood brimming over with the frothy white fluid ready for transit.</p>
                           <p>"Now, Michael, you will carry the milk yourself this morning, and I'll have the hot coffee ready by the time you return."</p>
                           <pb n="95 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>"Yes'm," said Michael. Yet he didn't stir, and his wrinkled face was twitching with tokens of speechless, desperation.</p>
                           <p>"What is it, Michael?"</p>
                           <p>It's <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ma'am!" said the Irishman; suddenly pulling off shoe and stocking and thrusting his swollen foot -- knobby all over with angry, red blotches on a somewhat dark and mottled ground -- out into the full light of the lantern which was standing upon the stable floor.</p>
                           <p>"I see! too much ditch work, Michael," said Mrs. Reband gravely; turning hastily off into the shadow to hide her sense of the comic side of the occasion. 
"It won't do to wear even that shoe just yet. Mr. Reband's old slippers are in the entry closet. Put those on, and then build the fire and pat the tea-kettle over the stove, and if Mrs. Reband is not up by that time do you pour the potatoes into the oven to bake. They are all ready in a basin on the table; and then, Michael, wash your feet nicely in warm water, and when I come back I will give you a salve that will help them at once."</p>
                           <p>"Yes'm," said Michael, turning humbly towards the house; while the market woman, who had already put the padded yoke over her shoulders and hooked up a pail on either side, marched off with a long steady step and disappeared along the road.</p>
                           <p>It is not at all disagreeable to carry even heavy pails, balanced as these are and supported from the shoulders," she thought, as the spirit of calmness fell about her in the grey morning. "I shouldn't mind bringing the milk half the
time if John would consent; but the worst of proposing any plan like this is
that he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> bear the burden h1inself; partly because I am a woman, and more because he was born generous-hearted, the dear fellow ! He saves me more than I would save myself; always making me feel that I am crowding on a little too hard. Am I, I wonder? At any rate, this walk to-day is fresh and altogether charming in spite of the mud, and I shall insist on taking it sometimes. Who cares for the looks?"</p>
                           <p>Her thoughts wandered off now into the past. She was in a grand old wood
under the stars, looking through the black, leafless boughs and along the trunks of great trees, which stood up all about her like immense forest giants. Her pails were not filled with innocent milk, but with mischievous maple sap, which sparkled in the slanting moonlight; each mimic sea of sweetness shimmering in waves of silver at every motion imparted to it as she walked. There were youths and maidens scattered here and there in groups; some, like herself, gathering the forest nectar into pails, going from tree to free and emptying every bucket, one after the other, with songs and laughter; stooping in picturesque at-<pb n="96 The Woman's Advocate."/>
titudes over the little white wooden casks, lifting them, and pouring out the
contents in a mingled haze of glorified moonlight and shadow. Others were at a large open fire, above which, suspended from a great iron crane, hung a huge cauldron of bubbling syrup; and near by was a smaller fire and a smaller kettle of daintier syrup over which two merry damsels presided with anything but witchlike gravity, but brandishing wooden ladles about the ears of every intruder. The leaping flames shot their long arrows of light far out into the deeper shades nestled under the lea of every forest monarch; but only making the unreached darkness still more palpable. John was there at her side trying to take the padded yoke from her shoulders and saying something which made her heart dance faster and with more vagaries than the arrows of light dancing and about at random among the dazed shadows.</p>
                           <p>Then there sounded a wild musical whistle which summoned them all to the "sugaring off." The whole company sat about the fires, each holding a new, clean, broad shingle for a plate; half covered with a cake of packed and frozen snow, which bad lingered obligingly on the north side of a great boulder waiting for the special benefit of this very entertainment; and over this snow-cake the generous presiding damsels poured the warm sugar, which, hardening on the chilly drift, was pulled off by willing fingers and eaten with a relish which passes out of life forever with one's "teens." How jovial and good everybody was that evening, exchanging sugar drops with looks that had mottoes in them -- as city youths exchange bonbons done up, labelled, in pink and blue tissue paper.</p>
                           <p>John was brightest and wittiest of them all; With a subdued enjoyment overflowing from him which crowded Susy's heart to fullness; now with smiles, and again with tears which seemed more beautiful, even to herself, than the gayest laughter. He was one of the daring three who climbed the highest maple and bound bundles of straw, moss, and dried grass about the topmost branches for a beacon. She could see him against the sky reaching across a chasm of shade; and, rubbing his lucifer upon the resentful bough, the whole was wrapped instantly in a mantle of flame. The others did the same, and the three jets of light spirted high up across the almost black depths of space, suddenly putting out the stars overhead. It was very beautiful, yet the girl's heart beat painfully till John had slid down again and stood beside her with one hasty clasp of hands while all eyes were turned upwards. An answering beacon started up from one and another tree-top in the distance; and simultaneously there went forth an echoed shout which bounded to and fro like a ball, sweeping the whole neighborhood in its circuit.</p>
                           <pb n="97 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>This sugar making frolic, -- remote from her now both in time and space, -- was yet an era in both their lives; for their love was as young then as the moon who had not yet rounded her first quarter and who hung her silver crescent over them in the East with a blessing for them balanced on either horn of her shining yoke.</p>
                           <p>"I have a right to carry the balances half of the time," laughed Susan to herself as she thought it all over and came back again to her two buckets of milk hanging suspended from her shoulders, "I didn't give up my brimming pails of fun then, and I'm not going to abandon my milk-pails now! I say who cares much for the looks of it? or for the waspish laughter of shallow-pated idlers? Every honest bit of work is as respectable for me as it is for John! Of course, I would rather be a great lawyer who gets his thousand dollar fee as morning tid-bit, or a merchant prince who does business grandly -- all at wholesale; and I should even prefer to write a clever book which would fill my apron full of gold at a stroke, than to be a country maid with her milk-pails trudging through a slush like this, all for two greasy little dollars a morning. Daniel Webster says 'there is plenty of room up above; but it is awfully crowded down below;' and I and I can't get up there! Grandmother taught me never to cry for the moon; so I shall only take care that I don't have to cry for spilt milk. It is just as profitable to turn one's eyes down on an occasion. Mother, the children, and all of us might be shivering now in a leaky old shanty, without milk enough even for the family to drink, John hustled off drearily every morning to do a day's work as a hireling, and all of us eating the hand-to-mouth bread of poverty and dependence. But I can be as good a milkmaid and market woman as any of them; so I am bound to enjoy everything as it comes and make the best of it. Here we are now at neighbor Hopkins'; so let them stare at me or laugh as they choose, or make witty jokes when my back is turned. I'm as good as the Queen of England, and very likely shall enjoy my breakfast this morning twice as well with a better digestion and a conscience just as quiet as hers."</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband laid her hand upon the little gate, throwing it wide open and edging her full milk-pails through with care; but an annoyed expression spread over her face and her thoughts tumbled off into more troubled waters as she toiled along the path to the back door, her wet and bespattered dress flapping drearily as she walked.</p>
                           <p>These miserable shackles that I can't see my way clear to really shake off! I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> like to get rid of these detestable, drabbling petticoats! They are above my ankles, and yet they are getting as bedraggled as a fine lady's, who trails hers over the sloppy pavement. There would be little hardship to me in a<pb n="98 The Woman's Advocate."/>
man's work if I only could be allowed to wear a sensible dress. Women must be required to make bricks without straw if they attempt to do anything, that's certain."</p>
                           <p>This brave woman went on her way home again, cheerfully, however, in spite of her disabilities; patiently slipping into dry clothes on reaching the brown cottage (all this occurred six or eight years before the first rise of the Bloomer costume) and when the family met at breakfast that morning there was no hint of hardship in the wholesome vigor of her appetite or her spirits. The husband was able to be at table, greatly improved in health by the liniment and his two hours' nap, and Michael's corns and chilblains had been soothed into a state which was altogether comfortable and promising. Their darkest hour was blossoming into a rosy dawn; but such a dawn, memorable long after for its spirited changes!</p>
                           <p>For twenty-four hours the Imps of Winter and the North Wind had been held in check by the sprites of the South Wind and the sunshine. All day yesterday the former stole round under cover of the trees, barns and houses to overlay the waters with an armor of plate which should bear up the load of pearl blossoms that dying old January was waiting to hand down to them as his last will and testament; but the South Wind stirred the waters, shivering the plate armor into malicious needles; and the sunshine gobbled up the remnants whenever they fell under his steady broadside. Neither gained much in the contest, and when the Sun disappeared, he signalled the Moon to hang out her flag of truce, which she did for an hour or two; but a rain-storm coming unexpectedly upon the scene, all the winds of heaven, girding themselves afresh, went into a pell mell strife together in the darkness. Hence the clatter of casements and the broken boughs scattered everywhere, which had been hurled about all night as bludgeons.</p>
                           <p>This morning, at the first blush of dawn, the allies of the Sun fled to his protection, retreating at first with a grand display of banners; but hastily throwing up a heavy breastwork of clouds, they sank behind their fortifications. The triumphant imps of Winter shot their ice-tipped sharpened arrows over the world without let or hindrance, -- their rushing streamers of victory floating out from the North Pole to the Equator. In a few hours the plate armor of the waters would be thick enough to bear up a regiment of mounted cavalry.</p>
                           <p>"I think you may omit the marketing to-day, Susan, with a clear conscience," said the convalescent, feeling rather glad, it must be confessed, that he at least was exempt from duty. "It is freezing now rapidly and you will have the forlornest kind of stiff mud to pull through."</p>
                           <p>"I know it, dear, but it's <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>. People starve on the warmed up Sunday<pb n="99 The Market Woman."/>
crumbs on washing days, and they always get up a fresh appetite by Tuesday morning, so if mother and Baby will keep you in a toasting state till your cold is broken up; I guess I'll try it."</p>
                           <p>"Oh, if that's all, I'll make myself into a live mummy and lie still; with Baby for a self-moving rattlebox to amuse me."</p>
                           <p>"And if John finds himself getting a little stiff in the back again, I can take the broom-stick and give him a good dose of movement cure," said the rosy old mother, looking more fresh and bonny than she did a dozen years ago. "Never mind us, Susan, we'll take care of ourselves!"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, of course, Mother you are always the mainspring of everything, and keep all the wheels in order."</p>
                           <p>"Only some of the wheels won't go, you see, even with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of the primest mainsprings to set them in motion," said Mr. Reband, placidly folding his arms and standing up post-like in the most restful attitude he could assume.</p>
                           <p>"What a luxury to be a gentleman of leisure!" retorted the wife.</p>
                           <p>"At any rate, I've got a nice basketfull of school dinner all ready for the children; and of course, Susan, they can ride with you to the corner,". said the thoughtful grandmother, heartily intent upon the comfort of her little ones. "it may save two more hard colds, and some shoe-leather."</p>
                           <p>"Yes; and If it's very muddy, motherkin, I'll drive on and leave them at the school-house. Mike has managed to hobble about and get everything that is necessary into the wagon, I see, so I can start at once. Put on your things, children, and dress warmly. Remember your comforters, for it's chilly now, and will be just like Greenland when you come home at night. Baby, do you keep a good fire for pa and grandma, and don't let the cat lie under the stove."</p>
                           <p>"Who but a woman would have thought of that! Now is there anything else, Susan?" laughed the invalid, wrapping himself round and round in a blanket with great parade and deliberation, to the immense delight of the children, who found it difficult to come at anything but the tip of "father's nose" to kiss good-bye upon.</p>
                           <p>So in spite of Winter and disagreeables it seemed a merry party which set out that morning in the market cart, and a -merry party also that were left behind.</p>
                           <p>The market that day was as chilly as a rising north wind could make it, and though the stove in Mrs. Reband's division did duty heroically, yet its warmth was felt only six or eight feet around; but into this gloomy circle the market 
people crowded like doves on the sunny side of a barn, keeping up the comfort of sociability in a way that cannot be done except on a cold morning. It is<pb n="100 The Woman's Advocate."/>
stimulating in Winter to break through the ice and take a morning bath; the wholesome glow which follows is worth all that it costs; so the social stimulus, which reacts upon a crowd who have been taking a zero air-bath, for an hour or two in common enterprise, is quite worth experiencing. All the ice of conventionalism is thawed away, and men and women stand face to face in the heartiest good fellowship; little rivalries and bickerings thrown off like the other wrappings for which there is no farther occasion at present.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Hawks russet face glowed like a purple sunset as she said good morning to Mrs. Reband, and dashed into a spirited description of how she got fast in an unusual quagmire, breaking one of the traces of her rather weak-at-all-points old establishment to her great dismay, with only a small boy to help her in her trouble; and uncommunicative Mrs. Reband went into the details of her husband's and Michael's ailments, to a dozen attentive wide-mouthed listeners, in a way that was entirely surprising to herself in the first cool moment of reflection. Everybody had a word of adventure or condolence or congratulation, till the stream of talk rose up and bubbled over like a fountain; <sic corr="splashing">plashing</sic> here and there, musical and cheery on every side, and they all parted with a new and more humane interest in each other for that one morning's generous sociability.</p>
                           <p>At a late hour customers began to come in force, and to buy without chaffering and with all despatch. People must eat more in cold weather than in warm to keep up the circulation, which is one comfort to the waiting market-folk; and the sellers, with the thermometer on a falling scale, are as expeditious and liberal-handed as the buyers; and so nature holds her balances with an even hand, measuring out justice to all. She has a great fund of real impartial motherhood.</p>
                           <p>"Eh, Mrs. Reband, I had some doubts about finding you here this morning," puffed the lumber merchant through his thick muffler, while his breath went floating upwards and wreathing his bead like a veritable halo. "It is already so slippery that I have some fears of broken bones and a picture of spilled vegetables and notions scattered over the sidewalk. I hope your horse has good corks on his shoes."</p>
                           <p>"Yes he has; my husband takes good care of that, thank you. He's one of
the merciful men to his horses."</p>
                           <p>"Your husband is even more sensible than you are, and that is saying a great deal! I've found that but lately."</p>
                           <p>"I always knew he was," she replied, laughing.</p>
                           <p>"Did you? I didn't know him till the other day, but we had an hours' talk 
then and I like him."</p>
                           <pb n="101 The Market Woman."/>
                           <p>"So do I, Mr. Verplank."</p>
                           <p>"Well, that's natural. ha! ha! ha! Now fill up my basket and I'll be off in a hurry. Put in a little of everything you have!"</p>
                           <p>So they came, one, and another, and all effervescing with good nature; putting out a delicate tracery of moral frost-work, crisp and spangly as the beautiful lace embroidery on a window pane on such a morning as this. Swedenborg  is right. Nature has her correspondences everywhere. Flowers and birds come to us together in good-fellowship into a wilderness of Summer greenness; but the glittering sheen of Winter has a more than tropical vegetation of beauty all its own, and all as light-giving as the wintry whiteness of snow. They dream at the Tropics; but men must <hi rend="italic">do or die</hi> nearer the Poles, and life grows brisk and wholesome.</p>
                           <p>As the market woman anticipated, this was a lucky Tuesday, and her pocket rattled a roundelay of satisfaction all the way home. By the time she had fairly started on her return it was Greenland extended sure enough; but in her quilted stuff hood, huge mittens, and warm wraps generally, she was as comfortable as an Esquimaux in his furs. At any rate happiness is in the mind, and not in externals good or bad. "Iceland, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the best country that the sun ever shone upon" to the Icelander who thinks that it is. But the thermometer must be at least ten degrees below zero to produce that most perfect reaction of absolute contentment. Perhaps at this time it wanted yet a few degrees of the required temperature, for the market woman thought as she jogged, bumped, and jolted over the frozen roads, now and then breaking through and plunging into the unknown depths; Now <hi rend="italic">if</hi> only John is better, and Michael's chilblains are not going to prove too troublesome, it will be a very satisfactory day after all." But I am sorry to add that Mrs. Reband was not thinking of the pain in the Irishman's toes, but of the inconvenience of it.</p>

                        <p>THE laws which relate to woman are based, for the most part, on a very old and a very Oriental estimate of her nature, her powers, and her divinely ordained position. We shall see this, if we follow the course of legal enactments or religious prohibitions from the beginning.

                        <docDate>NO. III. March, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <p>PROGRESSION depends upon true education. There are periods, when
humanity seems to be making but little advancement, but all the while it is becoming gradually educated up to a certain point from which it makes rapid and startling progress.</p>
                        <p>Every reformation, theological or political, every revolution, social or national, which to the world seemingly sprang full-grown, like Minerva, into existence, was a long time forming. And its generators and participators were for a long period eradicating old prejudices, and educating themselves up to a higher and better order of things.</p>
                        <p>All along through the dark centuries of the past, has woman murmured against her unnatural position, and from generation to generation has the murmur grown louder, and slowly but surely has she removed one degrading restriction after another ,developed and educated herself up to the point of demanding the rights of a human being.</p>
                        <p>Education, true education, is the legitimate cause of the woman movement, as it is of every reform. All that is needed to make the movement a success is to educate the masses until they are able to comprehend the truth of its principles and the justice of its demands. Every person possesses an education, extensive or limited, true or false. Upon the quantity and quality of individual education depends the progression and elevation of humanity. True education ever carries humanity onward and upward, false education ever retards and debases. True education is not so much a cramming down of facts, a committing of formulas, as a thorough understanding and developing of our three-fold nature, an attaining to purity of life and thought, to liberality of opinion, and a forming of individual character. Let every man and woman attain to this and we would see the dawning of the millenium. God himself indicated the only method of acquiring a true education and of going on toward mortal perfection, when he created man and woman. Man is incomplete without woman; woman, without man. Seclude men and women from each other, and they become dwarfed, deformed in soul, and brutish. The crime, corruption, and insanity found in convents and monasteries, particularly when those institutions included a large proportion of the population, afford a melancholy proof of this assertion. Man needs the presence of woman to arouse all that is best, purest, and noblest within him; and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>.</p>
                        <p>God and nature points to co-education as the true method, and it is wilful blindness not to accept the indication. Those families, where the<pb n="103 Co-Operation."/>
children are of both sexes, generally send forth better men and women, than those where there is only one sex. The students of mixed schools are more orderly and studious than those of schools restricted to one sex. The colleges which refuse to admit women do as great injury and injustice to their own students as to the feminine applicants.</p>
                        <p>Each sex restrains and refines the other. Together, the nature of each acquires depth and breadth impossible to be reached when separated. In mixed schools, the rough, disorderly, vulgar habits so prevalent in "male colleges," are almost unknown, and the excessive frivolity found in "female seminaries," almost disappears.</p>
                        <p>For the regeneration of the world, it is necessary that men and women should have faith in each other, and that each should be worthy of the other's trust. This faith and worthiness are acquired best by associating, teaching, and training the sexes together, as co-students in-school, co-workers in life, brothers and sisters in God's great family.</p>
                        <p>The practice of separating boys and girls during the rapidly growing, developing and changing period of their lives is detrimental to the extreme. Each sex feels the want of the other, each has an innocent craving for the other's presence, which being ungratified, is sinfully perverted; each places a wrong estimate upon the other, each grows up with false ideas of the other, each learns error instead of truth, vulgarity instead of purity, art and concealment instead of frankness, deception toward the other instead of honesty.</p>
                        <p>Only by being educated with woman, or by associating with her, untrammeled by debasing artificialities, can man learn and understand the wants of the feminine nature. The reason why many men oppose the woman movement is that they have not been thus educated; they know nothing of woman.</p>
                        <p>Woman knows not the wants and capacities of her own soul until she has associated with true manhood; and the reason why so many women are indifferent upon the subject of woman's emancipation is that they are unawakened, ignorant of themselves, and falsely educated.</p>
                        <p>The purest, divinest portion of man's nature lies torpid until aroused by pure, strong-souled womanhood; the divinest element in woman's soul is awakened only by pure, true manhood. Shall this spark of divinity remain unnoticed, undeveloped until maturity, and risk missing it through having the soul defiled by passion instead of exalted by love for humanity? Rather let it be recognized and cherished by co-education and co-labor, each sex taught and trained to look upon the other as brothers or as sisters.</p>
                        <p>Co-education is needed in other departments beside purely educational institutes. The recent disturbance at the clinical lectures in <pb n="104 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Philadelphia fully demonstrates that. That disturbance clearly shows to what low depths of degradation men will descend when unrestrained by the habitual presence of women. Their corrupt imaginations saw sensuality where there was none. To the vile all things are vile.</p>
                        <p>A firmly established system of co-education would have prevented many from becoming so foul, and compelled the others to be civil. For illustration, a class of men attend their first lecture in the dissecting room, the majority are honorable, high-principled men, but unsettled and liable to corrupting influences. With feelings of wonder they learn of the marvelous mechanicism of the human body, and are sublimely touched by the divine impress left upon every part; but an obscene though witty remark of a corrupt class-mate, - alas, sometimes of the gentleman (?) lecturer, -- banishes these feelings and makes a debasing impression on their minds. And this being repeated day after day soon pollutes the whole class.</p>
                        <p>A class of women might be defiled in the same manner but bring the two together, and the corrupt of each sex would be compelled to leave their foul thoughts unuttered, and thus the class would escape their corrupting influence.</p>
                        <p>In every department, law, medicine, theology, etc., co-education and co-operation would be of decided advantage to humanity. We are not only pleading and working for the elevation of womanhood but also for the elevation of manhood. They progress together, they depend on each other. It is time that men and women should not be arrayed against each other, that their interests and aims should not be separated, that neither should be limited in the exercise of the God-given power to learn and to labor. God speaks most impressively to man through woman, to woman through man; not through a debasing perversion of that which makes them men and women; but through the higher, subtler, more spiritual, diviner sexual faculties and instincts.</p>

                        <p>THE highest culture has been claimed for women: it has been shown, that, for two centuries, the ideal of such a culture has existed, but has however been depressed by an erroneous public opinion. There has, however, been a steady growth in the right direction, which entitles us to ask for a "revised and corrected" public opinion.

                        <p>THE Expediency philosophy is an old one and has many adherents. To the proposal for reform, to emancipate the Slave, to enfranchise Woman, to elevate the Laborer, it is continually interposing some obstacle. It says, Will your plan work? Is it the best thing for the country? In a word is it Expedient? And the true reformer answers, I will meet you on your own plane, if you choose, though I cannot but think it a low one, but I want you to come up higher and ask, Is your proposition just? Is it in harmony with the Eternal truth? If so, I accept it, "though the heavens fall."</p>
                        <p>Now these two ways of greeting new ideas, when they knock at our doors, are illustrative of two widely differing philosophies. The one is uneasy and anxious as to results, wants facts, and will be content with nothing less. Hence it accepts the Past with all its errors, rather than assume the Present with its duties. Its ideal, if indeed it may be said to have one, is that which has been. The other leaves the consequences to God, and says that course is wrong and this right; I most refrain from the one and do the other regardless of the effect. It recognizes no argument for an institution or form in the fact of its existence. Willing to leave the Past to take care of itself it presses forward to those duties which are before it.</p>
                        <p>Now to every one early in life come these two systems offering to guide the conduct. Which shall be accepted ? Certainly in the region of morals there can be but one answer. The one hair-line of Justice, so beautifully pictured by Wendell Phillips, is the only one known in that realm either for men or nations. Indeed, any compromise of the absolute right may be said to be the beginning of immorality. "It may indeed be difficult," says Herbert Spencer, "for those who have but little faith in the invisible, to follow out a principle unflinchingly, in spite of a very threatening evil -- to give up their own power of judging what seems best from the belief that that only <hi rend="italic">is</hi> best which is abstractedly right -- to say, although appearances are against it, yet will I obey the law. Nevertheless this is the true attitude to assume, the conduct which it has been the object of all moral teaching to inculcate; the only conduct which can eventually answer." Nor are facts wanting for those who must have them to prove that any departure from this rule is pernicious in its results. The history of our own country from its foundation to this moment, shows how all the compromises with slavery, always made in the name of expediency, have been its curse. Witness, the entire South for years unsafe to the tread of men with Northern ideas. Wit-<pb n="107 Justice versus Expediency."/>
ness, the Boston Court House in chains. Witness Kansas. Witness the Rebellion itself, -- all the logical sequence of sacrificing the conscience of the Nation to what seemed the interests of commerce and the Union. So with our great men. The Statesman of Marshfield fell when he gave up principle in the blind hope of reaching the presidency, and the minister who would send his own mother into slavery if thereby he could weld the States more strongly together, had to smother the conscience God had given him before he could propose so inhuman a deed. What then in the light of this teaching must we say? Just this: That governments cannot endure in peace if founded on injustice. That the man who gives up character gives up all. In the face of this sublime truth, how small seems the prating against new causes, simply because they are innovations. Garrison and his associates for their fidelity to this exact justice were denounced as infidels and madmen; but impartial history is already proclaiming them the prophets of their era. The church, then as now the custodian of traditions, trod under foot the golden rule and substituted for it the rule of Slavery, commanding men to gag their lips and close their hearts against the appeals of a suffering humanity. Any opposition to this command was declared infidelity to God. Then, as now, they were called infidels who dissented from existing systems and customs, but the real infidels in all time are those who distrust the consequence of doing right. Truth, says Emerson, is the summit of being. Justice, its application to affairs. How few there are who have faith in this Truth as applicable to every-day life. Does some one propose Emancipation, or Universal Suffrage, or Labor Reform? Vain dreamer, impracticable theorizer, is the taunt with which he is met. Why not let well enough alone? Why make such a perpetual agitation? We always have got along well without it, why change now? To all such objections there can be but one answer. In the light of Progress new Truth is continually breaking forth, and man's first duty is to apply it to human affairs. So he be worthy, spite of timid cries of expediency on the one hand or infidelity on the other, this duty will be done. And, the true glory of such publications as THE ADVOCATE is that in answer to the divine summons in the soul of man, they rear their standards for Justice. Not for what the world calls the expedient thing, but what conscience says is the right thing. When people have accepted this new gospel, but not until then, it will be time to sing "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will to men."</p>

                        <docDate>NO. III. March, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <head>FIRST PAPER</head>
                        <p>THERE are certain things in the history of mankind which act as gauges of civilization; certain fundamental features which serve as threads, as it were, with which to weave the great web of historic development. Of such as these is the position of Woman. Her condition in society is an index to its progress; and this index is preserved by society in its laws. Corresponding with the measured advance of Man from an age of brute force and barbarism to a state of refinement and civilization, that chapter of the law which pertains to Woman is one continuous record of a struggling progress on her part, from out of a life of legal darkness to one of jural light; from a state of legal nonentity, under an earlier order of things, to one of legal recognition as an individual in a newer era. The legal status of Woman, therefore, especially at this time, becomes an interesting and important study; and its free and candid discussion can certainly be productive of no harm.</p>
                        <p>At the outset we naturally inquire as to the origin of the disabilities to which Woman has been, and is subject, under our laws. Their source may be found in the early paternal power. Ancient law took no cognizance of <hi rend="italic">individuals</hi>, but contemplated <hi rend="italic">families</hi> only. Within the precincts of the primitive family, the father reigned supreme. No law interfered with his prerogative of absolute power. It was, as Homer makes Ulysses say in describing the Cyclops, a state in which "every one gives judgment to his children and wives." The legal existence of woman, as a daughter, was entirely absorbed in that of the father. He could kill, sell, and punish her; and she could legally do or have nothing separate from him. He could, of course, then, dispose or her in marriage to whom, and in the manner he saw fit. If he bargained her to any particular person, he might say, as did Egeus of his daughter Hermia -- </p>

of her husband and sister to her own children. Whether we regard her as wife or daughter, then,' her legal existence was <hi rend="italic">merged</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">patrae potestas</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Man, it may be observed, occupies a like position under this power of the father. It has been one of the great works of civilization to develop both Man and Woman from out of this aggregate condition of servitude towards a position of complete individual liberty. In this progressive development, Man has ever been centuries in advance of his more luckless sister. This fact is to a great extent owing to the all prominent position which war held in earlier ages. Were time and space to permit, the earlier laws which penetrated within the family dominion in favor of the individual Man, could be traced to this source for their origin. In the feudal system, which was one of the bridges between the ancient and modern world, we see plainly interwoven this same feature. This reason, while it has thus operated in favor of Man, would have a tendency to retard the progress of Woman; and it has not even yet ceased to be used as an argument against her. This, too, has made the broad line of demarcation between the public and private rights of Woman. And hence the rights which appertain to her private station come first to be discussed and recognized.</p>
                        <p>We notice at once something similar in the positions of the wife under the ancient power and under our common law ; but we see much less similarity in the two cases in the status of single women. For the reasons of this distinction we must look to the Roman, Canon and Civil Law. With the wonderful advancement of the Roman Jurisprudence, Woman had attained, during the later days of the Empire, a position of great freedom. The jurisconsults had evidently considered the equality of the sexes as a part of their code, and the iron barriers of the earlier <hi rend="italic">patrae potestas</hi> had been greatly broken down in favor of both. But with the downfall of the Empire, the more refined rules of the Roman law came in contact with the ruder customs of the conquering hordes. Among the latter, in somewhat a decayed form, was the ancient stringent guardianship of Woman. Actuated, doubtless, by a good intent, the Church adopted this custom in its code of laws; and thus, in the Canon law and in the Civil law, were built up side by side two systems of rules which belonged to entirely different ages to the deep injury of civilization. As a result, we have the difference in our Common law as to the rules fixing the status of married and single women. Those governing the latter followed the Civil law, while those concerning the former were derived from the Canon law. Woman, under the Common law, may live, therefore, in two distinct periods of her legal development from the power in the ancient family. If she remain single, she occupies the
<pb n="110 The Woman's Advocate."/>
advanced stage and may enjoy the utmost legal freedom as an individual, so far as concerns contracts, and the like. If she marry, she enters upon a period much more closely connected with the rigid power which belongs to an age of barbarism. Significant of the nearness of this connection in the latter case is the fact, that the same terms are employed to express her condition in both instances. "Children," says Archaic law, "are <hi rend="italic">under the power</hi> of the husband." And any one familiar with the law will recall many expressions illustrating this truth. To the same effect are the laws governing the husband and wife. The legal existence of the wife is, for most purposes, <hi rend="italic">merged</hi> in that of the husband; and from this merger spring those stern and semi-barbarous rules, which, looked at abstractly, we can hardly help admiring for their logical consistency. Thus, on the one hand, all contracts previously made between the parties are dissolved by the marriage; all property which the wife may have possessed as a single woman passes under the control of the husband; the domicil of the wife cannot, any more than her existence, be separate from that of the husband; being <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, they of course cannot contract with one another, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> being that one, she of necessity can make no contracts at all. For a like reason they can make no gifts to one another, as she can have nothing to give, and he would be merely giving to himself; and no third person can give to her, as it would be giving to the husband only. Her time, like herself, belongs to him, and consequently all her earnings go to fill his purse. From this same unity sprung the rule that the husband and wife cannot testify for or against each other, it being a maxim of the Common law, that no one can testify in his own behalf. Any children of the marriage could but follow this absorbing centralism, and their custody and service, therefore, belong to the husband. And should there be any dispute in the domestic forum, his will is law, and, according to some writers, personal chastisement may be inflicted for its enforcement; while her disobedience is considered a species of treason. On the other hand, if the husband is entitled to the benefits previously accrued to the wife, he also subjects himself to any of her liabilities, whether of contract or tort. As the wife's domicil must follow that or the husband, he is obliged to provide her with a home. He being the only one able to contract and to receive the family income, he is bound to provide for the proper support and maintenance of the wife. Not being entitled to the earnings of her children, the wife is not liable for their support, this duty resting on the husband. And as she is obliged to yield her obedience and trust to him, he in his turn is to afford her protection</p>
                        <pb n="111 The Legal Status of Woman."/>
                        <p>Although under this system the condition of the wife was a continuation of her position under the ancient power, and was so closely connected with it as to receive the same name, yet it was with many modifications of some of the harsher features, as could but be the case with an improved state of society. This improvement, it will be observed, had taken place in two ways: First, some -restrictions had been placed on the husband's power, and in the same degree had the individuality of the wife been recognized. Thus, his power no longer extended to life and death; and his right of personal chastisement "was confined within <hi rend="italic">reasonable</hi> bounds. So, too, his right to much of her property was reduced to, at most, but a life interest; and she was even allowed to make certain contracts for necessaries -- the law justifying the consistency of this by presuming the husband to be the real contractor, and the wife to be only an agent, whether this was true in fact or not. And second, the law endeavored to compensate the wife for the refusal to recognize her rights as an individual, by imposing on the husband certain duties, some of which have been mentioned; and in this way of balancing the system, its perfection was thought to be nearly attained. "For her disabilities," says Putnam, J., (in Gregory v. Paul, 15 Mass. 31), "the wife is <hi rend="italic">liberally recompensed</hi> by the obligations which the marriage imposes upon the husband;" "and even these disabilities," says Blackstone, in closing his chapter on husband and wife, "are for the most part intended for her protection and benefit, <hi rend="italic">so great a favorite is the female sex of the laws of England</hi>."</p>
                        <p>The earnestness with which the rules of the Common law relating to married women have been upheld, as being founded in justice and reason, tenders this a remarkable illustration of how men will reason themselves into sincerely believing that error is truth. And therefore it is, that many of whom we would have reason to expect different things, have used their influence to prevent any further reform in the legal status of woman. But reform was just as sure to take place as right is in the end to triumph over wrong, and some advance has been made, therefore, in spite of opposition. To notice something of this progress will be the purpose of the next paper.</p>

                        <p>THE rapidly increasing favor with which the idea of "Right of Suffrage for Women" is received, is calling out all the objections that can be thought of from those who oppose the measure.</p>
                        <p>Some of these <hi rend="italic">objections</hi> -- we will not call them arguments -- are so frivolous and unreasoning that one could hardly consent to spend the time to answer them, or notice them did they not proceed in the main from the same high source from which in olden time came the "Blue Laws" of Connecticut, the hanging, drowning and burnings of witches and Quakers, (i.e.) from the Reverends and Political leaders.</p>
                        <p>They gravely assert, that "Adam was created first, then Eve," -- Therefore, women should not vote. (Was not the baboon created before Adam?)</p>
                        <p>That man is stronger, larger of bone and muscle, -- Therefore, women should not vote. (Are not oxoe stronger and heavier than men?)</p>
                        <p>Man has more brain, more courage, more persistance -- Therefore, women should not vote. (Has not an elephant more brains, a lion more courage, a beaver more persistence than men?)</p>
                        <p>A woman never wrote Milton's "Paradise Lost," or Shakespeare's plays, or Invented a steam-engine. How many men have done the same? Should they vote?</p>
                        <p>Then comes the profound thought, Woman was made for man, to complement him, round out his manhood, make his life more complete, keep his house, nurse his children, cook his steaks, sew on his buttons, and darn his hose, -- Therefore, she ought not to vote.</p>
                        <p>That God in his infinite wisdom and power has placed insurmounta-

ble barriers between the sexes, fixed the sphere of women irrevocably; and if she steps beyond the insurmountable she will unsex herself, become mannish, and lose the love and courtesy of man, for whom she was especially created, -- Therefore, she must not vote.</p>
                        <p>That men must go to war and fight and kill each other -- women cannot go -- Therefore, women must not vote. (Did Horace Greeley, Rev. Bushnell or John Todd ever fight or kill anybody?) </p>
                        <p>It would be an expense to the nation to register the women of the country, and add to the burden of the national debt, -- Therefore, women should not vote. (Do they not help pay the taxes?)</p>
                        <p>It would only double the vote and complicate the national machinery, and be of no use, for man and wife would vote alike,-Therefore, women should not vote. (Do not father and son often vote alike?)</p>
                        <p>It would create contention in families, -- Therefore, women should not vote. (Are men so tyrannical that they will not permit free thoughts?)</p>
                        <p>Woman must live, and move, and have her being in her husband, -- Therefore she cannot vote. (Do not women often live, and move, and have their being without a husband?)</p>
                        <p>The man and wife are one, -- Therefore woman should not vote. (Are they not often distinctly two?)</p>
                        <p>But we have done with these objections; all of which we have seen set forth in reputable journals within the years of 1868-9, as reasons why the right of suffrage should not be granted to women.</p>
                        <p>What bearing does any one of them, or all united, have upon the subject? Every woman is an individual human soul. No man's eating satisfies her hunger, nor his drinking her thirst. His education gives her no understanding; his thinking does not develop her strength of mind; nor can his activities exercise her muscular power. If he commits a crime, she is not punished unless she aids or abets it; she is to all intents and purposes an individual.</p>
                        <p>Sojourner Truth once said -- "If I am to be punished according to the deeds done in the body, I have a right to think for myself what deeds I ought do." This individuality does not take from the marriage relation
<pb n="115 Suffrage for Women."/>
one iota of its sacredness; nor from the woman one jot or tittle of her womanliness, sweetness or purity.</p>
                        <p>These troubled voters may pile up their authorities and opinions until they reach from my door stone to the milky way -- I will have none of them, if they conflict with my own conscientious convictions of my right and my duty as an individual connected with other individuals about me. They, the objectors, are of the same class, perhaps, that made the "Bulwarks of Slavery," until the people, men and women, cried out in a majority, "Away with it." When it became popular they were staunchly on the side of Freedom.</p>
                        <p>Let us not waste time by staying to pelt them even with the stones of ridicule or contempt. Throw broadcast the idea of individualism among the masses, who can never be corrupted. Teach them that <hi rend="italic">the right</hi> for one should be <hi rend="italic">the right</hi> for all.</p>
                        <p>When an American citizen demands his right of suffrage for the first time, he is not questioned whether he be a husband or father, a tradesman or mechanic, a clergyman or a rope-dancer, but, "are you a legalized voter?" And the right of suffrage for woman has no more to do with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, as a wife and mother, housekeeper or school-teacher, than with <hi rend="italic">man</hi> in his several vocations in life.</p>
                        <p>If the Ballot is the foundation of liberty and right for one sex, it must be equally so for the other, until that day shall come when no man shall be found on earth to oppress or defraud his fellow man, for so sure as his sense of justice fail in the one case, it would fail in the other if individual interest should prompt the action.</p>
                        <p>That men and women can live distinct individual lives has been proven in a million of instances. That it is best so to live, has perhaps never been demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>If men and women are better and happier, and the good of society demands they should live together, to bear each other's burdens and share with each other the vicissitudes in life, there should be no superiority or inferiority, their use should be equal in value, and no law regulating their social relations should give to one party power and dominion over the other. As some men are larger, stronger, or more intelligent and useful than some women, so are some women stronger, larger, more intelligent and useful than some men. No criterion will

hold good  for all, and only an equal law can reach all cases and harmonize all peoples.</p>

                        <p>IT was yet early morning in the metropolis. For the fashionable dweller the day would not begin for hours, but the toiling population was abroad, and the streets of the lower part of the city were beginning to be lined with the working classes, young and old, alike eagerly hastening to the scene of their employment. It was a fair morning -- for May comes with something of its balmy loveliness even to the pent denizens of the city -- and, doubtless, among the thousands, hurrying, perchance, to the stifling atmosphere of some dingy work-room, and to an ill-paid and uncongenial task, there were many in whom the wild wish arose to fly from it all -- the labor that shut them from the blessed sunlight - anywhere, so it was beyond the city limits.</p>
                        <p>But not blither of heart was the feathered songster caroling its liveliest strain from a bough of one of the grand old trees yet lingering, on sufferance, in the scanty area of the City Park, than was our Marian, as, accompanied by her friend, she tripped her way that morning across the square to gain the work-room. Perfect health, the glow of youth, the satisfaction arising from a life of honest endeavor, all were hers. She loved her labor. Hers was a nature that could brook neither mental nor bodily inactivity, and, after many a day of arduous toil, the lines of the poet to her found fitting application --</p>
                        <p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <hi rend="aligncenter">Something attempted, something done,<lb/>Had earned a night's repose."</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In her choice of a situation Marian had been eminently fortunate. Her place was admirably calculated to develop every faculty, and wonderfully had she improved since the day when an unformed country girl, she sought the great city in search of employment. The large responsibility which had been thrown upon her; the necessity of acquainting herself with branches of study, with which she had been unac-
<pb n="117 Thrown Upon the World."/>
quainted; the habits of self-reliance which she had insensibly formed, had all tended to the full development of her nature and the unfolding of faculties which otherwise might have remained dormant. The paper under her charge was a weekly journal, not of the inordinate proportions of some of the great "blanket" sheets of the day, yet of respectable dimensions, carefully edited, and largely commanding the respect of the nation; and Marian had abundant time to discharge all the duties of forewoman, and yet carry into effect many schemes which an intimate acquaintance with the business had caused her to entertain respecting printing-offices, and the amelioration of the condition of women compositors. In this work, so eminently appealing to her practical nature, Marian was ably assisted by the editor, Mr. Lyman, who rejoiced at a <sic>at a</sic> change in his office, so in consonance with his own views and who spared no pains to promote any project receiving the sanction of his judgment. Very different, indeed, was the composing room, that neat, tastefully decorated apartment with its airy outlook, from <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> office, the great, bustling hive of labor in which she had learned her calling. The love of order and neatness was a striking characteristic of Marian's nature, and, above all, the ceaseless whirl and confusion -- so inevitably connected with a great daily journal -- was distasteful to her. Determining that, as much as possible, these annoyances should be banished from the new office, Marian caused a few rules, simple, yet sufficiently comprehensive, to be printed and conspicuously hung among the few prints that adorned the neatly papered walls, in plain sight of the little force, of both sexes who daily toiled beneath her eye. As each compositor was carefully selected, either through previous knowledge or by that keen, intuitive sense of character possessed by Marian, but little difficulty was experienced in causing these regulations for the government of work and conduct to be scrupulously observed. Indeed, although Marian could be firm when occasion required, and those who accepted employment under her knew that every salutory restriction must be respected, her demeanor was yet so uniformly kind, and her exactions were so conscientiously just, having the best welfare of all at heart, that there was scarcely ever a rebellions thought in opposition to her decrees, and to receive the praise of "Miss Eveleth" was usually regarded as the highest possible compliment that could be bestowed. True, her position 
<pb n="118 The Woman's Advocate."/>
was not wholly without its unpleasantness of feature. The novelty of her station, and the paragraphs concerning her which, form time to time found their way into the press both of town and country, had the effect of attracting a class of curious idlers to the work-room whom it was not always easy to shake off as expeditiously as could be wished; but as time passed, and the uniform guardedness of the demeanor practiced towards such intruders became generally known, these annoyances almost wholly ceased. But beyond all this -- drowning the sense of the slight discomforts of her position -- for Marian, in her employment, there was a pleasure, the idea of which we may not succeed in conveying in its keen sense of enjoyment to the reader. The constituency of the journal upon which her labor and care was expended, although not large in the sense of modern swollen newspaper circulations, was a highly cultured one, and its articles and editorial utterances were frequently of a rare order of merit. Certain writers engaged upon it were especially endeared to Marian, and it was a pleasure for her to take the productions of those gifted minds, as the "copy" was handed to her by the editor, and enjoy the first hurried reading of the carefully considered thoughts of those with whom she was in spiritual relationship. For such honored men and women it was a pleasure for Marian even to put the glowing words into type; to see the eloquent passages take shape beneath her skillful fingers, and watch the order and symmetry with which the metal compressed the diffusive and, I regret to say, often less legible manuscript. The productions of one or two contributors, especially, -- a man known to the furthest portion of the habitable globe for his lips of eloquence, and a woman whose name as a philanthropist and as one of the sweetest of writers, lies deep in the hearts of thousands,-- Marian could scarcely bear to confide to other hands, and she always rejoiced, half as a mother fondling her offspring, when opportunity afforded, for her own execution of the work. Distrustful in the extreme of her own power to conceive and execute, Marian rarely assayed composition herself, but now and then, as a relief for overcharged thought, she had penciled some essay or fragment of verse, which, subsequently, had been submitted to some editorial judgment, and more than one gem of thought or poesy, floating without parentage on the sea of journalism, might have been traced to one whose name would never be known in the literary world.</p>
                        <pb n="119 Thrown Upon the World."/>
                        <p>Are we lingering too long over the humble, every-day-life of our heroine? Not to fulfil any of the requirements of modern sensational romance have these pages been penned. Our purpose simply has been to sketch the self-supporting life, the pioneer career of an American girl, one who, unaided, hewed her way to a useful, honorable position; and without a slight lifting of the veil, a bringing of face to face in every-day thought and life, we would despair of imbuing the mind of the reader with a tithe of the respect there should be entertained not for some shadowy creation of fiction, but for the central character of these pages - Marian Eveleth.</p>
                        <p>Upon this day of which we have spoken, there was an unwonted flatter in the breast of the usually calm, self-sustained Marian. Without seeming rude, she could not have denied the pressing request of both De L'Estrange and his companion for permission to call upon her at the office; and yet even at the moment there was a nervous sinking of the heart, a half dread of the consequences of the interview. She was so fastidious, this Mina Graves, so rarely beautiful and accomplished, so accustomed to adulation and the society of the cultured and the fashionable, what would she think of her in her workday garb, amid such surroundings? Would not her artistic nature receive a shock, and where she would fain stand well, would she not be regarded as an ordinary working-girl, and the highly wrought representations which must have been to her, accounting for the unexpected interest of De L'Estrange, be attributed to levity or the blinded perceptions of a lover? But by a resolute effort she banished such distracting thoughts. "It is a weakness," she murmured, "I thought I was above the indulgence of such morbid fancies. My friends, or those who would be such, must take me as I am. No one whose good opinion is really worth possessing will think less of me because I prefer honest labor and independence to eating the bread of charity."</p>
                        <p>But little place in her mind would there have been for such forebodings, could Marian have foreseen the actual agreeability and freedom from restraint of the interview. Within an hour from the period of her indulgence in such reffections, while the freshness of the morning yet remained, and the gentle south-wind lent an inviting coolness to the flower-scented and tastefully decorated room, she was welcoming, with
<pb n="120 The Woman's Advocate."/>
far more of a self-possessed air than she had deemed possible, her visitors, and in the little recess opening from the work-room, set apart by Marian for such occasions, she was chatting away with them as unreservedly as though they had been the friends of years. That she thus passively resigned herself to the current of unrestrained sociability, while it was foreign to her nature, was yet a natural consequence of the position of the moment. Towards De L'Estrange a change had been steadily going on in her mind, caused by her increased confidence in the natural nobility of his character, disposing her to waive much of the icy formality of the past; and cold indeed would have been her heart, and insensible to the winning charms of a richly gifted nature, could she long have withstood the kindly advances of his cousin. It had been said, in circles known to Marian only by fame, that no heart had ever successfully resisted the spell of fascination exerted, at pleasure, by the child-sculptor. Statesmen holding the destinies of the nation, as it were, in the hollow of their hand, had bowed before it, and left the weightiest affairs of State to pay her their homage; scholars, philosophers, editors of journals whose utterances were potent, had united in the need of praise and vied with each other in rendering her service; wealth, commissions, official honors, hearts innumerable, had been thrown her feet; upon the gay, fastidious circles of Washington, from obscurity she had flashed as a meteor, dazzling all eyes by her beauty, her genius, her purity of character, -- for not less uncorrupted by the world, and its flatteries was the heart of the most convent-secluded novice than that of this rarely endowed girl, who had tasted all that adulation, society and fame could offer, -- Mina Graves.</p>
                        <p>"I have come to spend the day with you, if you will be so good as to keep me," she winningly, half-pleadingly remarked to Marian in a lull of the conversation. "My cousin has told me of half-a-score of appointments he must keep, so we <sic>we</sic> will e'en just remind him of the old proverb of 'three and the crowd,' and you and I will divide the sovereignty of this office for a day between us. Indeed you must, keep me," she added, even more pleadingly. "You do not know how weary I am of the crowd of the inanity of the great outer world. I came to New York for rest. In this great wilderness of life I can lose myself, I can refresh my faith, and I come to you, a stranger, for just the companionship I need.
<pb n="121 The Fair Standard-Bearer."/>
You are strong. Your life is all different from mine. I know you are good and noble and compassionate; you can be to me all that I need; you must be my friend!"</p>
                        <p>There was no resisting the subtle flattery of this address, and so it was settled. A few minutes more of pleasant conversation ensued, when De L'Estrange rising, gaily said that after the hint given he could not be expected longer to remain, and, with an assurance of calling, at an early hour in the evening for his cousin, took his departure.</p>

                        <p>THE labors of the day are over, and she sits alone by the open fireside, busily knitting, and her eyes look into the glowing flames as it she were reading the very heart of the future: Of what does this woman think as she waits up alone, while all her loved ones are drawing quiet sighs of restful sleep around her? This plain woman, with her hair put back in a net, her home dress of warm plaid flannel, and apron of checkered calico. One would suppose her chief care would be the sock she is knitting for her husband, so untiringly her fingers travel round the ceaseless loops that stretch the ribbed work longer at every round; but though she has an inbred care for this, a love and interest in all the house and its manifold labors, though she toils all day cheerily, and never regrets the choice she made long years ago, when Love came and sat upon her heart like a brooding dove, and life's highest good seemed living and loving in the holy marriage state, -- yet added years and multiplied experiences have brought new lights to sit in this woman's soul, and as she sits here tonight, while the Winter blows his blasts of defiance without, thoughts of the past and hopes for the future are busy within her brain! No one who sees this housewife in the busy daytime, going from task to task as if her whole heart and soul depended upon it, would suspect what thoughts and capabilities lie dormant within her. For the most part she is happy and contented. Her husband believes in her, her children carry all their troubles to her, and her word is the law that settles all difficulties with them; hers is the hand that soothes and caresses daily; hers the voice that
<pb n="123 The Farmer's Wife."/>
speaks to them of the "All Father" and the "Promised Land." In reverent tones, and with confident faith, she points out to them the "beauty of holiness," until the sight Of their little, earnest faces, lifted in childish trust, never doubting a word that mother says, breaks down her own soul in conscious humility, and she looks with distrust and doubt upon her own life.</p>
                        <p>"Why cannot I rise to the <hi rend="italic">Ideal</hi> that is in my soul?" she asks with bitter tears. I ought to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the woman my innocent children <hi rend="italic">believe me</hi>." God knows there are heights and depths in this woman's soul that are not known to any, save her Father in Heaven! Sometimes a whole flood of waves come over her, and for some seeming trifle she breaks down into a storm of tears that seem to wash away all the old landmarks. Long shuddering sighs come from her very heart, as "<hi rend="italic">everything</hi>" comes upon her weary mind at once! In these moments the burden of the world rests on one pair of shoulders. Dear God! after all, the best of us are but babes, we cannot <hi rend="italic">carry</hi> all the troubles that come upon us. But sometimes we can wash them away with our tears! For, after a night of such weeping, as no man can understand nor comfort, this woman rises in the morning brighter than ever; rises to her toils and little cares cheerfully, smiling as if she had "rained her sky clear again," in very truth. She goes to church and joins in the earnest voice of praise, that hymns its way upon the still country air; but the timid soul never gives itself vent in any other way in public. The burden of ages is upon her, and the words of the old Apostle are drilled into her very soul: "It is a shame for a woman to speak;" and though she is conscious of a power -- if she only dared use it -- that could soar as a lark to the very gates of Heaven, in earnest prayer that might melt the hearts of all by tender, magnetic speech, yet she sits still, a very coward, while possessing many of the attributes of courage and power. Behold what <hi rend="italic">custom</hi> and law can do! Who can say what this human soul might have done had there been no difference in the education, in the training of the minds of brothers and sisters all over the land? This woman <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> as much of politics, of law, and of the great movements of the age, as her husband, her father, or any of her brothers; but you would never guess it from her words save some chance might reveal it, -- she is a woman! Looking with earnest, questioning eye into the future, she sees hope for her little children. There shall come a day when the longing of her soul for better things shall be realized by them! And patiently this.quiet woman lives on <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, and by <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> sees the dawning of the day of Equity! I have shown you the soul of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> quiet farmer's wife, or rather a glimpse of it, for who can photograph the whole world as it revolves in every living soul? You can only see part of it at a time. All over the land, in unsuspected places, in many a

home there dwell such waiting spirits, such earnest souls, that bide their time and <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in the minds of their little ones, sowing seed for the future, which shall ripen in God's good time.</p>

                           <p>By the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the National Constitution, guaranteeing suffrage to colored men upon equal terms with whites,-- the official promulgation of which is daily expected, -- a moral warfare unparalleled, for its character and scope of purpose, in the history of Republics, closes, grasping the full results of its hardly-achieved victory. The "irrepressible conflict" going on in the Nation ever since its existence, shaking the very foundations of government and causing the costliest sacrifice of blood and treasure, ends in the legal abolishment of Caste, as applied to one-half of a race, and in the full recognition of MANHOOD SUFFRAGE, 
irrespective of Color or Nationality. It was a brave struggle, challenging the admiration of the world, but the battle has only been half fought. There is a Caste class yet in the Land, deprived of political and legal rights, to be enfranchised, -- it is the WOMEN of the Land. <hi rend="italic">Manhood Suffrage</hi> has been secured, but <hi rend="italic">Womanhood Suffrage</hi> -- not less important -- is yet to be achieved.</p>
                           <p>That the present is a favorable moment to urge upon Congress an Amendment abolishing all political distinctions on account of sex, we think is evident to all friends of Impartial Suffrage. Hitherto,the bar in the way of such legislation, whether justly or unjustly, has been the Negro. Standing with his hand outstretched for the Ballot -- the hand that grasped the musket on so many battle-fields -- he has precluded even the consideration of any similar measure. Senators and Representatives, favorable on principle to an Amendment abolishing all political distinctions on account of sex, have resisted its introduction in Congress, desiring first a final disposition of Manhood Suffrage. That this has been the powerful obstacle to its more carefal consideration, we need no  assurances, that might be multiplied, from the lips of many of its leading Members. </p>
                           <pb n="126 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>But now all this is altered. The distracting question of Negro Suffrage has passed, irrevocably, from politics; and there is a clear field in the Forty-first Congress for this now leading question of the age, which should be promptly occupied by the friends of Woman Suffrage. The ear of legislators, without any other interest sustaining injury, can now be gained. No decent pretext longer exists for the delay of Congress to act promptly upon an Amendment conferring suffrage upon Woman, such as covered by the admirable bill introduced by the Hon. G. W. Julian in the House last winter. Petitions since have rolled in upon both branches of the National Legislature, from the East and the West, showing the interest in such legislation. From one district in Ohio, it is said, over 1,700 signatures to a petition for the Sixteenth Amendment, were procured within a fortnight. At the recent hearing of the Committee appointed by the Washington Woman Suffrage Convention, before the Joint Committee of the House and Senate for the District of Columbia, a most favorable impression was produced upon the Members, and many assurances were given of co-operation, by both Senators and Representatives, when the subject should be brought before them.</p>
                           <p>All the signs of the time are auspicious. Utah follows Wyoming in conferring suffrage upon Woman. The West and East alike are ablaze with Conventions. Outpost after outpost of opinion has been carried. The doors o falmost every State Legislature are besieged by the friends of Woman Suffrage. Public opinion is fully ripe for the grant legislation of Congress, perfecting our democratic theory of government and abolishing all political distinctions on account of sex. Let Congress act. Let Mr. Julian, of whose improved health we rejoice to learn, revive his Bill; and let an urgent demand, by the friends of Woman Suffrage, from all parts of the Land, be made for its speedy passage and incorporation into the Federal Constitution.</p>

                           <p>THE griefs of some of our neighbors always excite our compassion more deeply than those of others, and we confess to the liveliest sympathy in whatever may be the special plaint of the <hi rend="italic">N. Y. Tribune</hi>, as poured forth to its widely spread and, in the main, intelligent constitu-

ency. Especially in its efforts to grapple with the so-called "Woman Question," to shed a gleam of <hi rend="italic">philosophic light</hi> on that vexed problem, it has always excited our profoundest commiseration. So clearly annointed, apparently, has been its editorial vision to see that the cry of Woman for the ballot would be fraught with every imaginable evil to humanity - and so curiously and illogically constant, in season and out of season, have been its efforts to avert the diaster from the Nation, that we have not been able, at all times, to repress the wish that better arguments were not at command to prop a cause which its venerable, kindly-hearted editor-in-chief evidently has so near at heart.</p>
                           <p>One of the latest of these evidences of a settled purpose to find only cause of lamentation in the swift march of progress, is to be found in its leading article of February 12th, under the caption of "The Lost Woman." Hitherto, its regrets over ruthlessly shattered idols had been frequent and unmistakable, but scarcely in such moving language presented to the public. When, by a majestic sweep, the wave of reform touched our furthest verge of Territory, and Wyoming proudly wrote "SUFFRAGE FOR WOMAN" upon its escutcheon, challenging the admiration of the Nation, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> recognized, as it were, the <hi rend="italic">"handwriting on the wall,"</hi> and, bowing to the inevitable, has since mourned the degeneracy of the race, as one "refusing to be comforted." How it bewails the "Lost Woman" of some mythical, bygone age, the extraction of one paragraph only must serve to show: </p>
                           <p>

                                 <hi rend="10 pt">"When the iconoclastic hands of the reformer were first laid upon the Domestic Woman, our judgment consented, but our heart ached forebodingly. We saw her dragged from the fireside and placed upon the rostrum without a word. The necessities of the age required it. But we kept like all other men, hidden out of sight, the old ideal, 'Lovely Woman,' the 'ministering angel.' The vision has so many names, but we all know it; as beautiful as it is pure; as tender as strong; as full of grace in body as in soul. With this ideal we have followed at high-pressure rate the real woman, tugging after her out of breath to the lecture-room, the convention, the clinic, desperately trying to reconcile the two. They should be one, we were resolved. The New Woman should be developed to the extreme limit of her wish, and yet we and the world would not lose the sweet, gracious Presence of home."</hi>

                           <p>Are we insulting the comprehension of our readers to offer aught of comment on the above? Is it necessary to ask if the representative women of the day - those who lend to literature, art, the hall of science,
<pb n="128 The Woman's Advocate."/>
or the platform lustre - are a whit less worthy of the respect of the public than those of any previous period? Is womanly grace, culture, sweetness and domesticity fled when the van of the great army of progress is led by such rare spirits as LUCRETIA MOTT, L. MARIA CHILD, LUCY STONE, JULIA WARD HOWE, and a host of others, whose names are typical of all that is noblest in reform, as well as of what is most unblameable in private life? Indeed, was there ever on historic page so illustrious a roll of pre-eminently gifted women as this Nineteenth Century is giving the world? for, as never before, Woman is becoming conscious of full sense of her responsibilities, and the knowledge is enlarging and rounding to a symmetrical completeness, hitherto undreamed of, of her entire nature. Instead of the sun setting upon the virtue and the glory of the sex, it is the growing effulgence of the Orient, betokening the New Era and the larger usefulness of Woman. The Woman of the Past, a creature of circumstances, of fettered faculties, the legal slave and submissive vassal to the whim of Man, is indeed <hi rend="italic">"Lost;"</hi> but in its stead rises the new Ideal, a Woman, made as Man, in God's image, With equal faculties, equal rights and responsibilities, and <hi rend="italic">equally accountable</hi> for the rightful exercise of all those faculties to her Creator.</p>
                           <p>Truly, far behind other liberal journals of the day the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> has lagged on the "Woman Question." It has borne an honored name, and led the "forlorn hope" of many a worthy cause in the past. Is its character for liberality and fair-mindedness, earned by its persistent devotion to principle through so many years, to be tarnished by its tenacious opposition to one of the noblest and most sorely needed reforms of the age? With or without the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the cause will go on, but for its own sake those who have stood by it in the past, and who wish it well now, would be glad to see a reformation in its treatment of a question which, at least, has well earned the right to its respect.</p>

                           <p>NOT one of the least hopeful signs or the future, for our country, is the growing thoughtfulness and measure of intelligence among women, especially those just entering upon the theater of active life. True, fashion has yet its devotees, and society in its maelstrom absorbs too much of the bloom and fairness of womanhood. Fifth Avenues glitter, 
<pb n="129 Editorial Department."/>
and opera-houses flash back diamonds as of old; but the observing mind cannot but realize that a marked change is taking place even in the strongholds of wealth and fashion, and that society is becoming revolutionized in thought as never before.</p>
                           <p>One cause of this emancipation of woman from the bonds of public opinion, and the assertion of individuality and the right to judge of what constitutes proper sphere and action, lies in the essential difference between a monarchical and a republican form of government. Whoever has traveled abroad cannot but have contrasted the dwarfed sphere and benighted minds of the women of Continental Europe with the general intelligence and the larger freedom accorded to the sex in our more favored country. The late war, and the important part played therein by woman, has stimulated this spirit of inquiry and investigation; and, as never before, American women are considering their duties to society and their individual responsibilities, as rational, soul-gifted creatures, to the laws of their being, and to their Creator. The conventions all over the land, the speeches and resolutions, the petitions thickly strewn as the leaves of autumn, but imperfectly denote this general awakening of interest. Such manifestations are only as the froth thrown up to the surface; below is the deep under-current of thought, only at times apparent to the superficial eye.</p>
                           <p>Of this spirit of inquiry on the part of the better type of women, those for whom life means something more than mere passive or animal existence, those who fill editorial chairs, beyond many, have excellent means of knowing. Perhaps there is scarcely a conductor of a reputable journal whose testimony might not be relied upon for evidences of this drifting of thought into new and, hitherto deemed, improper channels. Letters accumulating in drawers and pigeon holes, communications breathing earnest, long-smothered thought, -- the awakened hope, or despairing wail, of the writer, -- is the experience of every editor. Not always is the conviction clear. Among the thousands of young women of America who to-day are studying this problem, of the capacities, the alms, the rightful sphere of their sex, there are all shades of thought and creed. Many are groping in the vale, doubting whether they may safely follow their new guides, conscious only of the blind sense, the want of something better, more satisfying; others are on the shining

mountain top, with the clear conviction of the needs of their sex, and animated by the heroic desire to do battle in their behalf until Justice is wrung from the Nation. Of the latter class, the young, enthusiastic Messengers of the Word, and pages of THE ADVOCATE, since its establishment, have had their fair proportion of bold, outspoken utterances; but the sadder burden of the former, those who yet grope in mental darkness, -- seeing the barrenness but not the higher meanings of life, -- what pen or tongue may portray!</p>
                           <p>But, happily for humanity, the class whose convictions are clear upon the underlying principles of reform, is rapidly augmenting and destined soon to be the controlling influence. Already, of representative women, whether in science, literature or art, the number is but few who are not identified, actively or by expressions of sympathy, with the so-termed "Woman Movement." In literature especially, one can scarcely recall a name known and honored by the world, the possessor of which has not stood upon Woman Suffrage platforms or given adherence to their doctrines. No blush of shame now, as twenty years ago, need crimson the cheek of a maiden whose convictions of duty lead her to make a public acknowledgment, by word and deed, of her faith; for, instead of a despised few, the army of reform which she joins numbers under its banner the wise, the good, the highly cultured of the land. Fortified thus by the counsels of those grown gray in the service of humanity, paying to them the debt of gratitude by loyalty to the cause they have tenderly cherished, witnessing the barriers of Prejudice and Law crumble, and the realm of Fashion itself totter to its fall, the true "Girl of the Period" is blessed beyond any of her race and kind in living in a period that is to witness such important events and in having it in her power so largely to contribute to the good of humanity.</p>

                           <p>A VERY interesting Woman Suffrage Convention, for the purpose of organizing an Essex County Woman Suffrage Association, was held in Newark, N. J., on the 16th ult. Among the well known friends of the Cause present, by the most of whom addresses were delivered, were LUCY STONE, Mrs. MARY F. DAVIS, Mrs. CHARLOTTE WILBOUR, HENRY B. 
<pb n="131 Editorial Department."/>
BLACKWELL, and, Mrs. CELIA BURLEIGH. Mr. JOHN WHITEHEAD , a well-known citizen of Morristown, presided with ability.</p>
                           <p>In his address, upon taking the chair, Mr. WHITEHEAD expressed himself as deeply interested in the movement, stating that women had no equality whatever, legally, politically, or financially, with men, and abjured the girls present, who were "looking into the show-cases of existence," to take hold of the movement and to interest themselves in the great questions of life.</p>
                           <p>LUCY STONE gave an exceedingly interesting sketch of her recent experiences in Western Conventions. She observed, smilingly, that "the sun rose this morning just as well as if the women of Utah hadn't voted." She spoke of seeing two girls managing a steam engine, which monster didn't know whether its master was a girl or not. She said that in Ohio, recently, 1,700 names had been signed to a XVIth Amendment petition within a fortnight.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. CELIA BURLEIGH followed, speaking upon "Woman's Right to be a Woman." "To be a woman," she thought, "is to be all that the unfettered feminine nature can accomplish under favoring conditions, with the largest culture, and without compulsion or hindering repulsion."</p>
                           <p>The addresses throughout were of an exceedingly interesting character, and the close attention paid by the large audience to the proceedings, manifested the interest awakened in the Cause in a hitherto indifferent community.</p>
                           <p>By a special resolution the Association was declared to be, "for purposes of protection, affiliation and efficiency," auxiliary to the State and American Associations. Resolutions commending to the consideration of Congress Mr. Julian's proposition for a XVIth Amendment, demanding suffrage for woman, because, she, being refined, intelligent and moral, would change the manner and ways of the public, and asking for equal wages, were also adopted.</p>
                           <p>Very fortunate was the Association in securing, with a long list of assistant officers, for its President, Mrs. MARY F. DAVIS Of Orange, whose name is a guarantee of future efficiency, and a more than local sphere of usefulness for the Organization.</p>

                           <docDate>NO. III. March, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>As journalists striving to deserve the reputation of fair-minded we have never ignored the fact that, in our land, there was a large proportion of women whose judgment, or prejudice, arrayed them in opposition to the demand of the hour, -- from the so-called "strong-minded" of the sex, -- the BALLOT. So far from this being the case we have sought - as our pages will bear witness -- to be strictly just to all shades of opinion; and, from time to time, views as adverse to that objective point -- Woman Suffrage, have been presented in THE ADVOCATE, as the general tenor of articles in its favor. Of course, our own conviction, -- as that, we believe, of the greater portion of intelligent women who have given the question a calm, dispassionate consideration, -- is clear. There were slaves contented in their chains; and it is not strange that there are women satisfied with their present condition. Not always those most degraded, physically or morally, are most conscious of their degradation. But if there be a fetter, whether upon the limb or upon the exercise of thought and action, it is not the less <hi rend="italic">oppression</hi>, even if the spirit chafe not under the restraint. But as in slavery of the body there were spirits pining for freedom and daring all to accomplish it; so in this mental and legal slavery of women there are natures chaffing as no man may know under the century-imposed restrictions of Custom and Law, willing to be martyrs to opinion - to go as one crucified - so they might lift the cruel burden resting so long upon their sex. Rare Spirits! The world may deride them as noisy agitators, but their words and shining example fall as the good seed, to return, in awakened thought and souls girded to action, a hundred-fold.</p>
                           <p>One of the latest of these objections to Woman Suffrage, coming from that saddest of quarters, woman herself, is put forth by a Mrs. Slocum, who, in the absence of her husband, is temporarily invested with the charge of the St. Charles (Mo.) <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>. As Mrs. Slocum's card has been tenderly received by the conservative press of the country, finding its way even, with much similar matter, into the columns of the N.Y. <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, we will quote the lady's exact words, forbearing aught of

                           <p>FROM time to time we have had occasion to note the difference of treatment which the question of Woman Suffrage has received from the press of this city. The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, with liberal antecedents, and a constituency the natural supporters of the cause, as we have repeatedly stated, has been the relentless, ofttimes petty, opponent of even the nobler phases of the movement; while certain other journals have lent a support, or shown an appreciation of the scope and power of the reform, as unexpected as gratifying. Especially the <hi rend="italic">News</hi>, a widely-circulated, and hitherto conservative-toned journal, has pursued a course upon this question which has done much to elevate it in the esteem of the liberal portion of the public. We have noted its recent editorials very closely, and we see no reason to doubt the sincerity of its professions. Truly, it is a revolution in journalism when the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">News</hi> must read a lesson in morals and in courtesy to the pretentious mouth-pieces of opinion of the metropolis! In contradistinction to the shuffling, illogical course of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, mark the manly, more truly democratic sentiments of the <hi rend="italic">News</hi>, as embodied in the following paragraph from its weekly issue of the 20th ult.:</p>

                                 <hi rend="10 pt">"In spite of ridicule the Woman Suffrage Movement is making substantial progress in the West. It has been decreed by the Democratic Legislature of Wyoming and the Mormon Legislature of Utah, and now a bill has
passed the highest branch of the Republican Senate of Minnesota, giving the whole question to the decision of the people at the ballot-box. Several projects are before the Missouri and Kansas Legislatures, with fair prospects of success. The time has gone by when this matter can be treated with a jest. It has resolved itself into a serious fact, and when women are actually voting in the West, the posaible consequences of the innovation to our institutions become a legitimate subject for newspaper discussion. The time will probably arrive before long when we will have to meet this question in the East. Then it will be pertinent to in-

quire why it is that the march of the Woman Suffrage Movement has met with so little real opposition. The anti-slavery movement fought against organized odds for years, but this new crusade, which will exert a still more potent influence in revolutionizing parties and politics is literally 'walking over the course.'"</hi>

                           <head>THE BIBLE AND WOMAN SUFFRAGE. By John Hooker. Pamphlet. 18 pp. Published by the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. No. 1.</head>
                           <docDate>NO. III. March, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>The great activity in the Woman Suffrage movement is well illustrated, not only in the increasing number of journals specially devoted to the question, but in the tracts and publications put forth by the various State Associations. In our last, we noticed the excellent little work by Mrs. M. E. Joslyn Gage, entitled "Woman as Inventor," published by the New York State Woman Suffrage Association; and before us lies an equally valuable publication, the initial tract issued by the Woman Suffrage Association of Connecticut, now one of the best organized and most efficient of the New England State Associations.</p>
                           <p>Realizing that, of the arguments most relied upon by the opponents of Woman Suffrage, the Bible precepts are, perhaps, held up as the most convincing and unanswerable, Mr. Hooker has assayed to remove this stumbling-block from the Christian mind, and for the satisfactory manner in which he has performed his task he merits the gratitude of all true believers in Christianity and well-

wishers of humanity. At the commencement of this thoughtful, tersely written essay, Mr. Hooker says:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">I believe that it admits of demonstration, that the passages Scripture relied upon by the opponents of Woman Suffrage, conceding all that they claim as to their meaning, and as to the permanency and universality of their application, have nothing to do with the question, and must be ruled out of the discussion for irrelevancy. I make the attempt to show this not merely in the interest of Woman Suffrage, but of the Bible as well. The enemy of all good could not do a greater service to the cause of evil than by leading Christian men blindly to interpose the Bible as a barrier against every great social reform, so that when the reform triumphs, it shall seem to the unreflecting mass of men to be, not merely the defeat of the opposers of the reform, but the overthrow of the Bible also. This book is too precious, and a recognition of its authority to important to the world, for its friends and the friends of truth to expose it so unnecessarily to discredit. The Bible can be put to a better use, it cannot be put to a worse, than to be thrown into the street to help form a barricade against every attempt to overthrow old dynasties of wrong."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Further on, in carefully considering and disposing of the various objections based upon certain Scriptural passage familiar to our readers, Mr. Hooker thus speaks of the Apostle, in connection with his oft quoted utterances in condemnation of woman:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Still, it is not so certain that Paul would have been shocked at this claim of equality for women. How does Dr. Bushnell know that he would? He had heard of the Queen of Sheba, and there is no reason to think he was shocked at every mention of her name. And the magnificent Cleopatra had then just finished her reign, and he had heard of other women on thrones. He was very free to speak his mind, and wrote many epistles. If the tenure of political power by these women shocked him, it is a little strange that he has not somewhere put his emotions on record."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>At the conclusion of his admirable essay, covering the entire ground of Biblical objections to Woman Suffrage, and well worthy, by its weight of reasoning, of general circulation, Mr. Hooker says:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"So far from Scriptural authority being against the enfranchisement of women, the whole tenor of Christ's teachings, which we must all accept as the highest authority, and which to the writer are the teachings of a Divine Master, present a great law of liberty and personal responsibility, which can find its full application only in the perfect equality of man and woman, in the home and in the State. When it receives this application society will have taken the great-

est step ever taken since Christ came, toward a perfect Christian civilization, and the reign of Christ, which his followers have worked for and waited for so long, will be nearer at hand. It is the perfect conviction that this movement is one of true progress towards that promised and blessed reign, that gives the writer his deepest interest in it, and makes him certain of its success."</q>

                           <p>PATTY GRAY'S JOURNEY TO THE COTTON ISLANDS, by Mrs. Caroline H, Dall, Lee &#x0026; Shepard, publishers, Boston, the initial volume of which it was our pleasure to notice, some months since, has now reached the third of the series, conducting Patty to Mount Vernon, from whence, in subsequent volumes, she will proceed on her novel journey to the Islands of the South. This fascinating and highly instructive series of histories for the young, preserves all the freshness and charm of narrative which rendered the initial volume so justly popular; and the thousands of boys and girls who, with rare delight, followed the "Little Traveller" from her New England home to Baltimore, will welcome as eagerly these pleasing continuations of the incident-strewn journey, with even a whetted appetite for what is to follow in the stranger fields of exploration. For imparting knowledge, in its most pleasing form, to the young, Mrs. Dall possesses a rare gift; and those who know her only as a foremost writer upon graver subjects can have little conception of the ease with which her versatile pen turns from the consideration of the vexed problems of the age to stamp her as one of the most charming of story writers. The three parts are neatly issued in a pretty little case, and though especially designed for the holiday season, will prove as acceptable a gift to an intelligent, book-loving child, now as at that happier season. Parents desiring to spread before their children, books inculcating the truest morality and humanity, should not omit to procure for them all the volumes comprising this charming series, reflecting so creditably alike upon the genius of the author and the good taste of the Publishers.</p>

                           <p>"I AM looking for some of those little round tomatoes for preserving; but I don't see any in the market," said a lady, carrying a small fancy basket on her arm, to a friend walking at her side, as they threaded their way from stand to stand along the crowded market place. "I shall have to order some. I wish I could find Mrs. Reband! She is not here this morning."</p>
                           <p>Why, there she is!" replied the other. "Don't you see! She is speaking to some one out yonder. I caught sight of her this moment."</p>
                           <p>"I don't see her!" looking intently, and taking up the line of progress in the direction indicated. "Where is she?"</p>
                           <p>"Yonder! just outside of the crowd, talking to the gentleman with the white hat."</p>
                           <p>"That? The tall lady, in the light shawl and straw hat with the blue trimming! Is that she? I was looking for her pink sunbonnet."</p>
                           <p>Both ladies smiled as they made their way up to the veritable market woman in her unusual dress.</p>
                           <p>"What a difference it makes to get a new coat! It is like changing a field
rabbit into a parlor pussy cat," laughed the younger lady as they came near. "She is a nice market woman; but I don't think I can shake hands with her in
<pb n="142 The Woman's Advocate."/>
that dress. I am not very democratic, you know, and I'll fall back till your business is settled."</p>
                           <p>"Oh, I like her!" answered the other. "I don't see why she may not be the peer of a queen!" She went forward with alacrity, offering her hand, which was met by another as trimly gloved and as firm and open in its grasp as her own.</p>
                           <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Reband. I have been looking for you."</p>
                           <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Smith. This is a very fine day."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, very fine. The shower last night washed yesterday's dust out of the air, and the sky this morning is as clear as crystal. I had almost given up finding you, Mrs. Reband. Have you any of those small, round tomatoes to-day, such as I saw on your stand last week."</p>
                           <p>"No, not to-day," replied the market woman; smiling a little as if a slight sense of humor had struggled into the changing expression of her face. "When I have anything to sell I come here in my market dress. To-day I have come as a purchaser, and am in search of something that I am commissioned to get for a neighbor."</p>
                           <p>"Ah, yes!" said Mrs. Smith, her own eye twinkling also. "Then will it be out of order for me to speak to you at all about business to-day?"</p>
                           <p>"Oh, no! Certainly not; I am like John Gilpin even on holiday:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"'So down he came; for loss of time,<lb/>
Although it grieved him sore,<lb/>
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew<lb/>
Would trouble him much more."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And Mrs. Reband dropped into her usual attentive, untalkative business manner - in readiness for the expected order, which was given without delay.</p>
                           <p>"I'll have the tomatoes here in good condition to-morrow morning, Mrs. Smith. I shall be here at the stand to-morrow all day." The market woman bowed and passed on; and Mrs. Smith was rejoined by her waiting companion, who had remained within hearing of the conversation.</p>
                           <p>"I declare, Mary," she began, with great glee, "this is better than a play! The simile of wild rabbit and parlor pussy cat won't answer; it is more like changing a yellow bird into a real singing canary, isn't it? She must be the first market woman who is able to drive her bargains with a silver hammer of poor, dear Cowper's! I think I am beginning to get republicanized after all, and you can count on me as a rather hopeful pupil."</p>

                           <p>It is now more than thirty years since our first introduction to the market woman, on that morning when Nature herself had condescended to honor her as a bride, with a regal pageant of matchless winter splendor. Whether her hair
<pb n="143 The Market Woman."/>
now is grey or is only fair and light it would be impossible for me to say. I only know that it harmonizes with the genuine, creamy, Quaker-colored, middle-aged complexion, which at once impresses you, whether her face looks out from under the pink sunbonnet or the white straw -- a complexion that I always associate with the high seat on the woman's side of the Friend's meeting house rather than with either the endless confusion of the market place, or with the sunshine of a market garden, tinting everything it touches with hues deeply dyed. yet the fact remains; our market woman is now past fifty, and for thirty years she has been at her post all the morning, deducting the exceptions like that of to-day; and her afternoons are familiar with sunshine and practical toil; yet her complexion is like that of an unworldly, peaceful Quaker saint. Voice and carriage, too, are in harmony; but just as the look, tone, and manner of worldly shrewdness will sometimes peep out at you from under the broad brim of a successful Quaker merchant, -- not out of keeping with his whole peaceful bearing, but as it were the very spice and flavor of it, -- so there is a raciness of practical wisdom in all the ways and doings of our successful market woman.</p>
                           <p>Saturdays she is all day in the bustling market, often till near midnight, but then she balances that account by sitting through two sessions nearly every Sunday in the dim religious light of exceeding orthodoxy and its surroundings; and if she seen after church again in the garden sunshine, now walking meditatively, and now stooping to examine plant or seed, yet this only brings up the average in her days of mingled light and shade. If their lamps at the Reband
homestead are early out on a Sunday evening, while Monday mornings the family are astir betimes, yet the people expect as much punctuality in market hours as in their Monday morning papers. Whatever the emergency; -- and the second day of the week is in part sacred also to the wash-tub, in this household as in others; -- nobody here works on Sunday. Have they not clearly the right then to balance accounts by both the late and the early sleep on "first days?"</p>
                           <p>Many changes have come and gone in the family since our first acquaintance. The aged mother-in-law ripe in years and in grandmotherly kindness, has slept her last sleep in the midst of her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, who supported her failing footsteps tenderly to the last. The young husband is fast becoming one of the elders, known and honored in the land; one son, the father of a small but rather numerous family, is living in the repaired old farm house on the "East lots;" and it no longer has even the rim of a mortgage hanging from its chimney-tops. It was withdrawn about the time that its shadow had exterminated the last Canada thistle. This son, true to the practical creed which his mother has taught him, and loyally proud to follow in the
<pb n="144 The Woman's Advocate."/>
honored footsteps of this ancestors, may be seen often in the morning driving his own milk cart into town; selling, even in these degenerate days, milk warranted to be milk, and not extended. The young people were all educated at a famous Western University, where men and woman alike may receive the advantages to be derived from any course of study which they choose to pursue; but the two older children married early, and the daughter, now a widow, is once more an inmate of her early home, -- her little boy playing odd and even with his baby sister on the same kitchen stair, under the chamber door, where we left his mother playing nearly twenty years ago. The youngest son, studious and ambitious, has recently graduated from College, and is now studying law, with every prospect of a marked and eminent future before him - at least as seen from the standpoint of his mother's most earnest hopes.</p>
                           <p>Yet the market woman herself is not greatly changed. Something more of self-confidence, the general consciousness of a widened experience it may be, has come with the deepened furrows which however are not yet prominent. Her form is ampler and seems even a littler taller than in the early days.</p>
                           <p>Life is never stagnant in the market place. One who has ears to hear, may hear many things anywhere to general profit. In the market, men and women of all classes are coming and going continually, and a quick, shrewd person can easily manage to pick up and fit into some general system of experience a good deal of miscellaneous knowledge of men, manners, and current events. Certain it is that the market has shown itself to be on the whole an improving school to Mrs. Susan Reband, whose early educational advantages had necessarily been somewhat limited. She is a thoroughly sensible, self-respecting American woman; with many peers, but "no superiors and no inferiors among her countrywomen."</p>
                           <p>If we look at her now in the Saturday afternoon lull of that "next day," as she sits on a box by her stall, waiting for the evening customers, we shall find that she has also, in addition to the babble of market lore and experience, other sources of improvement to draw from. Half-a-dozen Now York and city daily papers, some of them of many days back, are lying in her lap. She reads one and another with an evident purpose, as if pursuing some topic systematically, looking up and talking now and then to a neighbor or a customer; but giving in speech no clue to the topic of her thoughts.</p>
                           <p>Peeping over her shoulder, as discreet people may in the ideal world, superior to conventionalities, with no breach of etiquette; we shall find that many of the papers lately have been saying a good deal about Oregon. Now that California is disposed of, 0regon is predetermined by Government and private
<pb n="145 The Market Woman."/>
enterprise to follow next in the order of Pacific settlement; and it is wisely decided to lose no unnecessary time in effecting this result. Sanguine men have ingeniously advertised in glowing colors; spicy letters and brilliant leading articles appearing simultaneously in various periodicals, seizing at once upon the public attention.</p>
                           <p>In a word, Mrs. Reband, like many others on this adventurous continent, is carefully reading up Oregon; or rather, on this particular afternoon she is rapidly reviewing a reading already accomplished. The Rebands and some of their neighbors are thinking of the far West as a future home. Their land is now too valuable to be used much longer for merely market purposes, and therefore they are seriously contemplating change of base. "A rolling stone gathers no moss;" but in the period of the glaciers even the staunchest granite boulders traveled many hundreds of miles to general profit; and even a farmer, who seems to be as firmly rooted in the old homestead as his own old favorite trees, may willingly tear himself up root and branch if circumstances become sufficiently imperative.</p>
                           <p>Just as the daylight faded out and the lamps were beginnning to be lighted in the market place, the market woman folded away her papers with an emphatic gesture. Not a word escaped her lips; but a certain decided manner would have indicated to on who had been closely observing her, that she had at length reached some fixed purpose.</p>
                           <p>"Well, I will go out and see for myself! So much I am determined upon," was the thought with which she tied up and put away her paper bundle.</p>
                           <p>Then she pushed aside the whole subject, sending it into some back corner of her mind, and brought all her powers to bear upon the turbulent stream of incoming, possible customers. She was a genuine, native-born huckster again from head to foot; dignified but wary, and watchful for the least incident which might possibly be coined into profitable traffic -- the whole visible woman breathing an atmosphere of the present moment, with her entire being moulded to the orthodox market pattern as completely as a mollusk is fashioned to his familiar shell; or as a hermit crab, whether he has thrust his body into a snail shell or into a pyrula, patterns himself upon the model of the new house which he has adopted. Her perennial, unfading pink sunbonnet seemed to "light up" with the gas as if it too meant business and was a veritable copartner as it was a covering and insignia of its mistress. The apples on her stall flushed rosily under the eyes of a pretty girl who came to buy them; the yellow pumpkins outshone the blinking lamps in a steady glow of honest pride; and even
<pb n="146 The Woman's Advocate"/>
the cabbages mimicked half closed, great flowerbuds - an unspoken delusive promise of better things to come, lingering around them like an aroma.</p>

THE MARKET BY GASLIGHT.</head>
                           <p>A SATURDAY night market in a great <hi rend="italic">country-city</hi>, with its one brilliant center of trafficking interest is a sight worth beholding once at least; but hardly worth elbowing your way into more than once if you have marketing leisure at other hours, and are not a chronic lover of the street excitements of a crowd by gaslight.</p>
                           <p>The Market, like the broad street in front of it far and near, is brilliantly lighted and now in the early Autumn, long rows of well piled country wagons are filed along the outer edge, like a heavy fringe upon the principal garment. Smartly dressed people throng by on the sidewalk in a continuous flow, a divided stream with the two currents setting in opposite directions, -- each farmer's wagon the vicinage of a little outlying pool into which the stragglers eddy one by one, circling about there for a moment or two, and then drifting back again into the current. All the stores along the street are ablaze and gaily thronged with both lookers-on and purchasers. Young people, lovers possibly, and even family parties with children, are walking in the pretty little park opposite; while those who seek for still greater seclusion are strolling along under the great elms which interlace their branches over the whole street on the lower side of the green.</p>
                           <p>Within the Market, the butchers, the cheese dealers, and the fish-mongers are in the full tide of business. Their commodities, -- to people who find always more prose than poetry in that department of sensation pertaining to our much abused nasal organs, -- are also palpably in the full tide of subtle chemical exhalations; which, like all other molecular forces, are undoubtedly very powerful, though invisible.</p>
                           <p>In the vegetable department, outside the brick walls but still under the broad roof, in the midst of a Coleridge-famed aggregation of odors, there is some dim fragrance of the country yet remaining; attaching itself like an atmosphere to the coarsest produce, and asserting its ascendency even here. Our
<pb n="147 The Market Woman."/>
market woman and her confreres are stationed in this neighborhood; middle men negotiating between country and city.</p>
                           <p>The surging throng is dense enough to represent to an outsider the first Atlantic cable celebration in miniature, as seen from a comfortable perch inside a Broadway store. Once in the heart of the crowd, there is a little more method in its madness. It is the difference between the enthusiasm of boundless, but yet unrealized hope, and the sober, practical aims already utilized on the chart of experience. There are comparatively open outside niches to stop and catch breath in, and it is possible to make your way with a little engineering in almost any direction; but it may be best to wind your course outward through the market court, with its produce wagons and accompaniments, suggestive of an Arab encampment, and so home again through the adjoining side street.</p>
                           <p>But we are to linger awhile yet with the market woman and her interests. This morning she drove into town herself - a large boy sitting at her side in the front of the vehicle. We had a peep once at her first market establishment, still youthful in all of its one-horse proportions; but this one, grown up a good while since, is commodious enough to require a span of well-grown bays to pilot it and its daily overflowing contents.</p>
                           <p>After unpacking this morning, the large boy drove home again, and this evening the male Rebands, senior and junior, have both come with the vegetables which will be served up on many a better class citizen's table at to-morrow's Sunday dinner. Father and son each lend a willing hand in everything, doing all the heavy unpacking; but the traffic chiefly falls to the market woman herself. It is as naturally her vocation as checking trunks, a current supervision of baggage and of the interests of the party generally, fall legitimately into the business department of Susan Anthony, when she is engineering a company of gentlemen and ladies on some lecturing campaign.</p>
                           <p>But something more than marketing is evidently in the minds of the over-coated and stove-pipe hatted representatives of the Reband family this evening. It is shared also by several others -- all of them either in stove-pipes or masculine felts, who at every lull of business gather in little knots here and there, talking in low but earnest tones. As opportunity offers they seem to be circulating about Mrs. Reband; who holds steadily to her central post and absorbed business attitude; taking her also into consultation, and listening with intent, rude deference to her quiet low-toned suggestions.</p>
                           <p>At last the din and bustle are all over. The Arab encampment has not stolen silently away, but it has vanished with clatter and noise enough for any sober town on the eve of Sunday, yet without riot or tumult. The Reband
<pb n="148 The Woman's Advocate"/>
party, having extemporized a back seat in their market wagon and invited some of the consulting gentlemen to ride with them, are sitting three abreast in the wide vehicle, wending their way homewards; but still in animated and now uninterrupted conversation.</p>
                           <p>The husband, wife, and a friend occupy the back seat, while two other neighbors sit facing them, one on either side of the son, who is driver, and whose feet are horseward; but his face also is turned towards his mother's, while the staid horses are left to follow their own guidance. Mrs. Reband has spoken less than any other of the party, who in their eagerness of suggestion have found it almost as hard as a company of children do to speak one at a time. Now she has cut short the tide of pros and cons by a practical, downright proposal.</p>
                           <p>"What do you all say to trusting me to go out to Oregon and spend the Winter prospecting?"</p>
                           <p>"Ha! Good! That's to the point!"</p>
                           <p>"You! Just the thing!"</p>
                           <p>"Will you do it?"</p>
                           <p>The three neighbors spoke in a breath, doubtful and delighted.</p>
                           <p>"Why, mother!" said the son, with something both of regret and surprise. The husband said nothing.</p>
                           <p>"If everything is exactly as they represent, I can either take up land for us all before returning here, after sending back a description and getting your consent, or if there is any doubt about the wisdom of that, some one else can join me before we decide to buy. If there is any misrepresentation in their statements, of if settling Oregon seems undesirable on a nearer view of the country, still none of us will have sold our lands,, which are all the time rising in value under our hands; and we shall not be heavily out of pocket. The expenses will not be large when shared by us all."</p>
                           <p>"But can you go, Mrs. Reband? Are you <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> to go?"</p>
                           <p>"I can go because the Winter is not a busy time, and Mr. Reband, with Mary for housekeeper, can manage everything, None of you like to be away from your families for so long a time; but I should rather expect to be benefitted by the change, and to gain some advantages at any rate by the experience. You know yourselves whether you care to trust me in so important a matter."</p>
                           <p>"Just the thing!" pronounced one emphatically. "I agree to bear my part of the expense on the spot."</p>
                           <p>You are altogether the very best person amongst us all, Mrs. Reband, and if you are willing to do it, I am willing to have you, for one. Somebody must go first. We can't all pull up stakes on uncertainties, and perhaps run all our heads together into a trap."</p>
                           <pb n="149 The New Year's Gift of Justice."/>
                           <p>"That so! it'll cost quite some money; but we couldn't spend it in a better way if we think of going on at all; for I don't half trust to what the papers say. If you say go, I say go; and so we shall!"</p>
                           <p>Father and son both proudly and affectionately assented also; and the plan was definitely agreed on before the party separated.</p>
                           <p>The wedded pair drove silently on their way together after all the others had left them. When their son had been set down at his own house, where his wife and children awaited him, not a word was spoken till they halted at their own door. Then the husband bent forward, and, reaching under the deep pink sunbonnet of his thirty years' wife, he kissed her; knocking off his hat in the act, exactly as he had done at least a dozen times before since their wedding-day. He
laughed as he picked it up, in memory of this fact, when it was too late to remedy it.</p>
                           <p>"That was a master stroke of yours, Susy, as usual. But you will never know how much I shall miss you!"</p>
                           <p>"I can guess, Johnniekin. I shall miss you, also, and go all Winter groping about in that wilderness with no one to speak to. But John, I am proud tonight that you trust me so!"</p>

                        <p>The opening of Michigan University to women, is an act significant of the broad advance that progressive opinions have made within the last five years. Then, the question was agitated, and more fears than hopes were entertained of its success, judging by the tone of the various State papers at that time. Three years ago, when Theodore Tilton passed, on his lecturing tour through Ann Arbor, stopping there to feed the people with his eloquence, he did not satisfy himself by merely presenting his political theme; but tried, by earnest conversation with Professors of the University, and sensible hints regarding the duties of Legislators, to impress upon the Michigan conscience a conviction of the

gross injustice of a system which excluded from a State school one-half of the State's children. We recall the sneers of some of the Professors, the indifference of most. We remember the quibbling of the grave legislators; and even the open scorn which the suggestion met with, from not a few members of the House. We re-read a "paper" issued by the students of the University, publishing their profound opinion, that the title of G. H. W. (which letters, being interpreted, mean good house-wife) was the one for which their sisters should aspire; and assuring us that such title could not be conferred there.</p>
                        <p>In view of this Past are we not justified in rejoicing in the Present, which changes the Free School system of Michigan from a sounding boast to a legal fact, -- in looking with hope toward a near Future that shall advance it to a living reality?</p>
                        <p>To this grand decision of Justice we hear of but one, prominent dissenting voice; it is said that Professor Frieze, acting President, wished an exception made of the Medical Department; but no exception was made. A free entrance is given into this abode of Minerva, without reservation of even the penetralia of the temple, from the tread of woman's foot.</p>
                        <p>No one doubts the <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> of this act, yet a few quaking hearts there are that question its expediency. Let such remember that the event of every innovation whose spring is justice can safely be left with the One Just. In Johnson's "Rasselas," one aged philosopher eloquently insisted that the true way to be prosperous and happy was to live according to Nature, though his explanation of what "Life according to Nature" might be, was not clear enough to recommend itself as practicable to his would-be disciple, yet the wise seeker never doubted the happy results of a life so lived. We have good reason to think that we are beginning to live "according to Nature" when we begin to aim to accomplish the declared purposes of the Creator of Nature. Hitherto we have opposed that design, that gave woman for a helpmeet, since one can scarcely be a helpmeet in what one knows nothing of. In opening the Universities, and giving the ballot to women, will the world be acting in sympathy with that spirit: for when women are allowed to be helpmeets in the preparations for life, then, and <hi rend="italic">only</hi> can then, can they they hope to become fit help-meets in life itself.</p>
                        <pb n="151 Back Again."/>
                        <p>We accept this gift, not as the boom of Regents or Legislators, noble donors though they would be, but as the gift of the New Year, whose first month has ripened this fruit of Justice. Should each one of January's eleven successors ripen as golden an apple, the fruitage of December would be the Ballot.</p>
                        <p>To the daughters of New York, the girls of Michigan send greeting, hoping that what Ann Arbor has become to us, Ithaca will soon become to them; viz., an inspiration and a fulfillment. A fulfillment of one aim, an inspirer of many higher ones.</p>

                        <head>THE LEGAL STATUS OF WOMAN.</head>
                        <docDate>NO. IV. April, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <head>SECOND PAPER.</head>
                        <p>FROM what has been laid down we are prepared to see, that the status of married women first occupied the attention of law reformers; and that changes have been chiefly confined to matters pertaining to their private rights. Unmarried women under the Common Law occupied a sufficiently advanced position to soon demand recognition in the public forum. Christian, one of the learned annotators of Blackstone's Commentaries, admitted that there appeared to be "no substantial reason why <hi rend="italic">single</hi> women should be denied the privilege of voting." But the status of the single woman was neutralized by that of the wife. The latter was so much lower, that on its more glaring imperfections was centered public notice, while the former remained fixed, and served as a sort of model by which to shape reform. Changes have heretofore been directed towards enabling the married woman to act as a <hi rend="italic">feme sole</hi>; and it is not until married and single women stand more nearly upon the some legal footing, that the reform commences in earnest in behalf of the individual woman as such, and includes in its measures public as well as private rights.</p>
                        <p>As we now contemplate the advance which has been made in the position of Woman before the law, we are struck with the, in-
<pb n="153 The Legal Status of Woman."/>
directness with which has been worked out the reform. At no time have changes been made upon any comprehensive, philosophic plan, but each has been the result of some present, pressing demand, and adopted as an isolated matter of expediency. As we look at these measures separately, the thread of progress seems at times to be lost, or again, while standing out distinctly, it appears to follow an uncertain and devious way; but looking at them as a whole, we see a steady development of the principle that must ultimately prevail. Such a course of development is, indeed, observable in all important things. It takes years of indirect endeavor in the line of present, shifting expediency, before the world settles down upon lasting principles.</p>
                        <p>A glance at some of the innovations upon the strict Common Law theory of "marital power," will serve to bring out more clearly these features of our subject.</p>
                        <p>The doctrine of <hi rend="italic">fines and recoveries</hi> was the foundation for one of the earliest established exceptions to the rule of the wife's disability, and it well illustrates how changes of this nature are first brought about. As before mentioned, the husband, by the Common Law, had an usufructuary interest only in the wife's real estate. The <hi rend="italic">fee</hi> remained in her. But, under the strict application of the maxim that "a married woman cannot contract," there was no way in which she could convey it. There was a practical inconvenience in this, and so the aid of this singular judicial contrivance was invoked to do what was forbidden. It consisted of one string of fictions from beginning to end, on the basis of which the title to the wife's land could be changed on the records of the court. These records were considered as proving, first, that the land did not belong to the wife; and second, that in so far as she had any action in the matter it was the action of a <hi rend="italic">feme sole</hi>. The idea seemed to be, to carry back, by means of fictions, the new circumstances to the old, unsuitable law, rather than to bring the law up to correspond with the new circumstances; and in this way jurists reasoned themselves around the truth that a change was demanded, or the fact that any change had been made. And indeed, this process does not present any very open acknowledgment of the rights of the wife. Its purpose was to free the title of land, and not to enable the wife to act. But, under the guise
<pb n="154 The Woman's Advocate."/>
of denial it brought about, in part a recognition of her claims and forms, in fact, "a very important exception to the general rule."</p>
                        <p>Another innovation sprang, as the courts say, "from the necessity of the case." In cases <hi rend="italic"> where the husband abjured or was banished the realm</hi>, the wife was allowed to act as a single woman. The theory of the law that she had a sufficient protector was too palpably false not to demand some practical modification. But this change was allowed to go no further than could be done and yet remain apparently consistent with the legal theory of unity -- for there was no thought of changing that. Lord Coke explained it in the logical way, that as the law no longer knew the husband, the wife was legally sole, and could therefore act accordingly; and, says Dervey, J. (in Ames <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Chew, 5 Meet. 321,) "her legal protector being civilly dead, she resumes her individual legal capacity to enter into contracts, to make acquisitions of property, and to sue and be sued." Lord Mansfield, ever so ready to catch the spirit of the times, thought the advance of society demanded the extension of this principle of innovation to every case where the wife lived separate and apart from her husband, and endeavored to establish such a doctrine in the law. But conservative jurists took the alarm, and the doctrine of Mansfield was overthrown, and the law, as it was expressed by a celebrated judge, "restored from the changes, which great men had incautiously introduced into it." The change was carefully confined to strict analogies, and though the husband might be imprisoned, or leave the State and remain abroad, without providing for the wife, yet if he continued a subject of its laws he was still her "legal protector," and she had no power to act for herself. It will be noticed, in all this, how carefully was avoided making any direct attack upon marital rights; and yet it was quite a cutting away of the outskirts of the boundaries which divided the status of married and single women.</p>
                        <p>Another of the early innovations upon the legal nonentity theory of the Common Law, was that peculiar one known as the <hi rend="italic">'Pin Money trust,"</hi> -- which was a certain yearly allowance to be used by the wife as her own, for the purpose of buying dress and personal ornaments. It bears on its face the stamp of an origin in opinions formed under the education of the old system; the
<pb n="155 The Legal Status of Woman."/>
husband would not wish to be troubled with matters so beneath the dignity of his station, but they were considered necessary to the appearance of his establishment. "It is," says the judge in the leading case upon the subject, "for the establishment whose <hi rend="italic">strength and support</hi> is the husband, but whose <hi rend="italic">ornament</hi> is the wife." This well illustrates the relative positions assigned to the husband and wife, and is an index to quite a commentary. The Pin Money trust was but a slight advance towards a recognition of the individual existence of the wife, and had no such end in view; her management of the allowance was confined to a very limited sphere, but in so far as it went, it treated the wife as a person capable of acting for herself.</p>
                        <p>A more radical change which may be noticed is the one known as the "<hi rend="italic">separate use trust</hi>," which has played so important a part in the history of the law. This was nothing more than a cumbersome way of giving the use and benefit of certain property to the wife, as an individual distinct from her husband. It was effected through the medium of the Court of Equity. This court practically acted as a sort of mediator between old and out-grown rules and a later civilization. By the former was maintained the oneness of the husband and wife; by the latter was faintly realized, that the making one of two persons a cipher for the sake of unity, was more logical than just. Equity, to harmonize the two views, built up a supplementary system of rules, based upon the doctrine of trusts, which, while it followed the law <hi rend="italic">in form</hi>, reflected public opinion <hi rend="italic">in substance</hi>. People could not see why a wife living entirely separate from her husband should not be allowed to own and act separately from him; and again, anxious parents and friends felt that there should be some way in which a wife could be secured in a support by means of a separate property, in case the husband, to whom the law made her look, should prove to be careless, reckless or profligate. The law allowed nothing of the kind; equity provided a way in which the law might be evaded and the desired result brought about. From this double system, built up of such different elements, sprang that curious medley of rules relating to married women which, in their complications and refinements, are bewildering even to the professional student. Without following out here the details of this system, we may col-
<pb n="156 The Woman's Advocate."/>
lect from the general result, that equity allowed the wife, in some cases, to own property as though she were single, and, in a great measure, to act with reference to it as if she were unmarried. "In equity, a <hi rend="italic">feme covert</hi> can be considered as a <hi rend="italic">feme sole</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It is not to be supposed that such changes as these could take place without opposition., There are always those who see or imagine greater risk in the adoption of new rules, than in the evils under the established law; and who would --</p>
                        <p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">"Rather bear those ills they have<lb/>
Than fly to others that they know not of."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Jurists were not wanting, therefore, to lament the tearing away of old landmarks in the status of married women; and courts now and then took a bold stand against the current of innovation. The early case in Connecticut of Dibble <hi rend="italic">v </hi>Hutton, 1 Day 221, is a notable instance of this in our own country. The Court in this case took the broad ground, that we ought not to adopt the principles which governed the English Court of Chancery, with reference to married women, but that we ought to return to the simpler rules of the Common Law. But the current of progress was altogether too strong to be checked by any such conservative barriers. Still, in this, as in every change, we see the force and influence of the old system. The antiquated customs yet remained the <hi rend="italic">rule</hi>, and the innovations were the <hi rend="italic">exceptional cases</hi>. It had clearly to be stated that property was intended for the separate use of the wife, or the husband took it as a matter of course; and the wife, in no case had any <hi rend="italic">general</hi> power to act, but only in special instances, with reference to her separate use-property. Indeed, while allowing the wife to act within certain limits, the allowance was tinctured with the idea that she should occupy a subordinate position. Thus, there was a tendency to look upon the separate property of the wife as a trust fund set apart and to be controlled by the court for her protection. The idea seemed to be, not to give personal liberty to the wife, but to follow the theory of protection under a change of protectors. It is this which gives force to the indignant protest of Mrs.Dall: "This very protection is insulting; for it treats the wife as if she must of necessity be either an inert instrument in the hands of her husband, or a dupe whose weakness he might readily abuse," ("College, Market and
<pb n="157 The Legal Status of Woman."/>
Court," 279). In the carrying out of this theory, the have been presented some curious features. For instance, at the same time it was required that the wife should obtain the husband's assent to a conveyance of her property, it was thought necessary to oblige her to go separate and apart from him and acknowledge the conveyance to be made of her own free will and without any influence on his part: these two rules being founded on the twin reasons, that, by the first, it is shown that the husband was near to protect the wife against others, and by the second, it is proved that the husband was away and others near to protect the wife against him. Truly a very neat and consistent system of protection! Much of this may be seen in other rules; on the one hand, the husband being looked upon as the one to whom should be intrusted the control of the wife, and, on the other hand, as being about the only person against whom she should be protected -- not a very flattering comment on the marital relations. This is something, however, which is to be expected. Excess in one way leads to excess in the opposite direction. Seeing the wife abused "under the power," the use of which was abuse, it was easy to first think of guarding against the abuse, rather than of abolishing the cause, and to frame rules with that end in view.</p>
                        <p>From out of this confusion resulting from the acting of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> powers over the married woman, finally dawns the simpler truth that she can best act for herself. Blindly as it has been done, we see in the past a constant incorporation of <hi rend="italic">individuality</hi> into the legal status of Woman. Every step, however guarded, and with whatever intent taken, so far as it recognized the wife as some one distinct from the husband as an individual, is seen to be a step in the right direction. And the general result plainly appears, that the status of Woman, more imperfect than that of Min, and, in which a wide gap existed between the positions of married and single women, has been undergoing a constant reparation, and the gap, in a meeasure, but somewhat crudely bridged over.</p>
                        <p>It is at this point, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, when married women are enabled to do, by different and contradictory rules, what should be allowed by one simple law, that the present period of legislation begins and, following the spirit of the innovations to the old law, forms a new code more directly advancing the status of Woman. It is a most important period, and is deserving of notice in a separate paper.</p>

                        <docAuthor>Samuel C. Blackwell</docAuthor>
                        <docDate>NO. IV. April, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <p>THERE is a prophecy that never fails. When a generation so perceives the need of a reform that its discussion is characteristic of the period, a new order is certain as the morrow. In 1870, at least throughout Christendom, the question is fairly mooted: "What is the natural scope of woman's life?" Its plain statement goes straight to its solution. Child and philosopher alike reply: "The natural scope of woman's life must be whatever her nature prompts and can achieve." Of the prompting, each individual woman must be sole judge; her capacity trial must decide. What this prophecy foretells, and history will record, is that individual women will attempt more and different attainments, and society will accord to them more and different facilities. For while to men <hi rend="italic">as men</hi>, society has never said concerning its vital interests, such as vocation, education and religion, "Thus far shalt thou go but no farther," to women <hi rend="italic">as women</hi> society has always uttered that stern decree. It was a harsh edict for the hundreds who in the past have met it and yielded. It is tyrannous for the thousands who now meet it and protest. It would be intolerable for the millions who would meet it in the future; therefore the prohibition must itself yield. For as the woman of this age wakes to the consciousness of power, an angel gentle as the dawn but strong as fate walks by her side -- the angel's name is Duty.</p>
                        <p>We may call him visionary or we may call him genius who perceives and shows a special need, striking a key note which the horizon echoes; yet the echo justifies his prophecy. This is not fancy but plain fact. It is not necessary to point to the experience of ancient days. Events of our familiar century, which our fathers told us as we ran beside them in the streets and fields; which we heard from our mothers as we sat by their knee; events which our own eyes have witnessed and our own hearts pondered, attest that sure satisfaction awaits each genuine want.</p>
                        <p>It was a felt need in the age of Louis and of George, which penned Burns' startling lyric "the man's the gowd for a' that," and which wrote and sang the Marseillaise. The time had come. Quick breeding thoughts clustered about topics previously speculative and these became strangely
<pb n="160 The Woman's Advocate."/>
practical. Those men of 1790 saw Thermopylae in Boston, in Paris, in London, on English farms, and among New England hills. Granted allegiance due to government and law; but what is that divinely sanctioned Government; what is that immutable and sacred Law? Surely not the "<hi rend="italic">L'Etat c'est moi</hi>" claimed by the elder Louis, and assumed by the younger; surely not hanging for the theft of sixpence inflicted by a woolly-headed judge. A need was recognized in France in 1793, and though overturn after overturn has failed thus far to crown the rightful sovereign, the end is not yet and meanwhile the Louis' can be repeated no more. The English echo reverberates, leaping from one "Reform Bill" to another. Victoria, contemplating English Common Schools and Irish Land Reform, stands far away from the footing of her grandfather, "Great George our King," with his arrogant "what, what, what," and his tradition-haunted empire. Victoria will pass as the Georges have passed, but England's Common Schools and Ireland's Land Reform once initiated, are these doomed to give place again to the cannibal system of Entail and Primogeniture, or will Intellect be crushed back to Charity schools again?</p>
                        <p>In 1770, Granville Sharpe thought and wrote against the slave trade. Two years later, Mansfield freed the fugitive Somerset holding his master's claim inconsistent with England's Common Law of freedom. Cowper sang of liberty --</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The English nursery wept for the "little slave that labors in the sun." In 1790 Clarkson fastened on the slave trade like destiny. In 1807 Wilberforce carried its abolition through Parliament. In 1834 England paid twenty million pounds, the price of blood, and let her slaves go free. We say "the thing that has been is the thing that shall be," but will England enslave the African again?</p>
                        <p>Romilly, descended from the Huguenots, felt the need of law that should challenge loyalty and deter from crime. In 1810, Lord Holland moved the repeal of death as penalty for stealing the value of five shillings privately in a shop substituting transportation for life. Every big wig spoke, or "the Constitution" and Lord-Holland's motion was quashed. But the key note had sounded. The heart in England's families and the church in England's church echoed "good will to men." Romilly, before
<pb n="161 Every Need Prophetic."/>
he died in 1818, had swept away the five shilling death penalty, with most of the kindred paltry "felonies," so called. Mackintosh and his successors have remodelled English criminal law in the fifty years that have elapsed since then. Henceforth there will never fail in the bar of Christendom thoughtful men proposing yet more perfect "law reform."</p>
                        <p>John Howard, sheriff in 1773, sought precedent for prison reform in Bedfordshire by visiting the jails of the other counties, and found instead abuses deep and universal, which his seventeen remaining years were spent in making known and in seeking mitigate and to reform. Still, in 1813, Elizabeth Fry found in Newgate three hundred women prisoners crowded together without classification, without bedding, in dirt and rags, with only the floor to rest upon. She spent thirty precious years of her maturity to introduce into the English prisons, employment and schools, and to bespeak the sympathy of family and church for the most destitute of England's poor. And now, though England's poverty and crime are still appalling, her charities are more nearly superhuman than the world has elsewhere witnessed hitherto; while so long as jails continue necessary evils, humane men and women will maintain the acknowledged duty of "prison reform."</p>
                        <p>In 1760, James Watt felt the need of something more than man's hand or slowly toiling horse to do the hard work and cunning handicraft of civilization, (be it ever remembered that at the basis of civilization as contrasted with barbarism, lies work, hard, systematic, perpetual work), the need of swifter agents than the stage or ship to speed the thoughts and carry the products of Christendom. He thought and tried. His thought and trial were as a prayer prompted by Heaven and by Heaven answered. Unbelieving critics spent their wit and exercised their art in depicting flying tea-kettles, bursting bubbles and hot water performing all the grotesque pranks conceivable of sputtering fluid and thin air. Yet in 1765 the sleepless piston learned to play. This was the natal year of Fulton, and the older and the younger apostle of the new power gave their lives to the application of the great idea. In 1836 the Sirius steamed across the Atlantic and dropped anchor in New York Bay. Thirty years have passed, and now half the human race is clad by looms driven by fuel from pre-Adamite forests, acting on water old as the planet, through metal formed in the laboratory of the most ancient

world. These far-fetched forces, summoned by man's need, traverse all the earth to gather materials for modern industry, and to distribute its products over the globe. After a hundred years, the want interpreted by Watts still fills the Earth with wonder at Nature's liberal response; but <hi rend="italic">Punch's</hi> predecessors, a century since, drawing bursting tea-kettles in derision of a monomaniac, where are they?</p>
                        <p>Jefferson, who, looking at the Virginia slave, trembled when he remembered that God is just, yet slept in peace one happy night in 1787, after the good day's work of engrafting freedom in the organic law of our Western territory. Two years later, Franklin, president of his abolition society, memorialized Congress to exert its utmost power to discourage the traffic in men. Washington at the same time was hoping against hope that some measure might be devised to abolish slavery by law. These men, with many less prominent than they, felt the vital need of consistency for freedom. Thirty years lulled that generation to its rest, but bred in countless younger hearts freedom's extinguishable life. In 1830 Garrison tolled the bell. The land echoed. Not the market place, not the court house, but the family and the true church heard and listened, and after other thirty years, when the great error rose up organized as the Great Apostasy, the little leaven of the Republic's earlier day had spread so far that the North laid down life for life, and the ark of freedom emerged from that last ordeal not only saved but we hope immortal. We say "history repeats itself," but will America enslave the African again?</p>
                        <p>Is there a brother of sisters stepping forth into the world, who does not see that he has facilities which they have not, yet of which they stand in as urgent want as he? Is there a father of daughters, who, thinking of the time when his hand shall have forgot its cunning, does not feel the need of a larger scope and a surer guarantee of independence for the dear children who will soon be women and perhaps alone? Is this, which the brother and the father feel, not felt by women? Is it not a real need?</p>
                        <p>Has the still small voice effectually plead for the despised commons, plucking Off the hereditary crown and hailing these as sovereigns; has it unseated the ermined despot and guarded the poor man's life, by a jury of his fellows? Has it called forth from the latent ingenuity of man

the mighty engines he required to supplement his strength? Has it rescued from the triple fangs of wealth and prejudice and power, the helpless slave? Be sure the same gentle potency holds in its gift a better lot; when arbitrary restrictions whether of statute or of prejudice shall be withdrawn; when nature, which is Providence, shall welcome women to every worthy industry, to all material success, and to their full stature in the thoughts and purposes of mental life: an order of intelligence and independence, enlarging Duty, transforming Society, ennobling Home, and fulfilling dream and prayer in a true Commonwealth. In every need dwells prophecy.</p>

                        <p>PEOPLE of education should be, and generally are, the most liberal in
their views, and the most helpful in advancing the welfare of the human race. One naturally expects intolerance and persecution from those whose minds are dwarfed and bent by gross ignorance; those who have never felt the blessed and enriching influence of that knowledge which has such a power to elevate and ennoble the heart. Especially do we look for broad charity and generous consideration from those who claim not merely the refinements of education, but the enlightenment of a pure Christianity. And, we do not seek it in vain, as the lives of hosts of noble men and women testify, who are aiding in all reforms which promise to benefit mankind. There are others who, though they do not endorse new and ultra views with readiness, still exhibit such kindly and liberal feelings; such evident willingness that success should attend everything which proves to be right, that we can but love and respect them, and pray that their eyes may be opened, that they "shall see and believe."</p>
                        <p>But when ministers of the Gospel, would-be doctors, and certain members of editorial staffs, throw off all sanctity and every appearance of gentlemen, and with reckless vituperation assail the noble women who are, to-day, battling bravely for what they sincerely believe neces-

sary to a more perfect elevation of their sex; we feel that education and religion wholly has failed to make these persons aught that is noble and
good, but rather that, with all their learning and titles, they are mere <hi rend="italic">Professional Quacks</hi>.</p>
                        <p>When the unwashed citizen, with his ponderous frame and brutal face gravely declares that, "he won't take any paper for which women write," or the leather-faced Vermonter says that, "he wouldn't live with his wife an hour, if she ever wanted to vote," or the young dandy asserts that, "the idea of letting women vote is really a little too ridiculous, for they haven't sufficient brains, sah!" -- we may smile and exclaim, "What a fearful blocking of the wheels of progress!" But when Doctors of Divinity insultingly talk and write of the advocates of Woman Suffrage as being "a low company;" abuse our noble leaders by calling them free-lovers and opposers of the divine institution of marriage, and call some of the most gentle and refined ladies in the land "strapping 'Amazons,' who go about haranguing for their rights, to the neglect of other duties;" we are sure that forbearance has ceased to be a virtue, and that these clerical charletans should receive at least a portion of the contempt and indignation which they so richly deserve.</p>
                        <p>As we have previously said, we all respect those who treat our views candidly, and give in kindness their serious objections to them; but when men pour forth their venomous and spiteful spleen upon our devoted heads, and by personal slander seek to destroy the influence of our beloved leaders; then it is that we can most heartily say, "You self-righteous hypocrites, you do always pervert the labors of those who do not choose to obey <hi rend="italic">your</hi> dictum. You are a disgrace to the progressive age in which you live, and the privileges which have been yours in this free country, won for you by the women as much as by the men of this goodly land. And inasmuch as you have basely slandered pure and noble women, we pronounce you also a disgrace to the mothers who bore you. You need not hope, however, to stop agitation and prevent the success which will as surely attend our efforts as there is a just and loving Father and Saviour above. Never! for as certainly as the principles of justice and freedom are as firm as the everlasting bills, so certainly shall we win the victory. We believe that the Right is on our side,
<pb n="165 Professional Quacks."/>
and with energy and courage we 'intend to fight it out on this line' if it takes all our life-time. We are splendidly officered and are getting well drilled, so that your traitorous shots are by no means demoralizing our ranks, but rather are inspiring our hearts with renewed vigor and determination. When you so forget all that is becoming to professedly Christian gentlemen, all that native manliness and even common decency requires, as to deliberately and publicly villify those whose lives and characters you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> to be above reproach; then it is that you place <hi rend="italic">yourselves</hi> for a certainty, on a par with the gross and brutal."</p>
                        <p>The medical students who have recently so basely insulted those brave women, who are striving to secure that knowledge which shall alone prevent their sex from longer being the victims of vile and unscrupulous men, who have so often filled the ranks of this profession, have received an almost unanimous scathing from the press. We hope these individuals, these "lewd fellows of the baser sort," will be marked and remembered, and that when they go forth from college walls, and expect to flourish the M. D., all respectable women will shun them as they would the plague, and show them by every act, that those who are guilty of such deeds, are <hi rend="italic">not the ones</hi> to be received and employed as family physicians.</p>
                        <p>Certain editors also, who have never lost an opportunity in endeavoring to heap ridicule and contumely upon the cause of Woman Suffrage, exhibit a littleness of soul which, as another says, "might hop away on a pair of flea's legs." If they cannot or will not agree with us, let them in all fairness so express themselves, but let them recollect that when they resort to slang and slander, they descend from the position of legitimate journalists, to that of editorial mountebanks. The advocates of our cause are willing to meet every objection fairly and squarely; they are and expect to be, kindly considerate toward all candid and sincere opposers; but at the same time they do not intend that those who have striven to overthrow their work in so shameful a manner shall go "unwhipped of justice."</p>
                        <p>Women of America! you can see in these base efforts, a strong evidence of the tyrannical spirit which has so long ruled by brute force; which still would insist that the laws of the Dark Ages should govern

the people of to-day, and which foams and tears in its fear of being exorcised. But the day is coming, and that right speedily, when the mighty voice of Universal Suffrage shall command it to "come forth and depart from hence;" and not till then shall we expect to see these <hi rend="italic">Professional Quacks</hi> "clothed and in their right mind."</p>

                        <p>ESQUIRE CATLIN, at the close of his Lyceum lecture, astounded the young ladies of Kittery, by the announcement that a diamond pin of the value of five hundred dollars would be presented to any lady answering correctly one hundred questions, put to her by a Committee of ten gentlemen, to be drawn from the audience by the donor upon the opening of the examination. A single failure was to subject the candidate to withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Horticultural Hall never presented such a cheery appearance as it did on that June evening of examination. The examination not being restricted to the Kittery Demoiselles, some thirty presented themselves from the neighboring metropolis. A hidden hope was in the feminine heart whilst the Committee were being chosen, a hope, as the sequel proved, poorly anchored. The Committee were, all but one, graduates of some college, the uneducated member was a plain country farmer. First chosen, he was first to propound a question. The lady who ascended the platform first, was the daughter of a city millionaire. Her train extended half the length of the stage. Her diamonds were resplendent. Surely she could not covet the pin, for she wore one whose middle stone was quite large, surrounded by smaller ones, like stars revolving around a central sun. The lady gracefully accepted the chair presented, and awaited questions.</p>
                        <p>"How many eggs will a well-to-do hen average during her natural life?" asked the farmer. A storm of laughter burst from the well packed audience; it was electrical, the Committee joining in chorus. The chair was vacated instanter, and so rapid was the flight that the edge of the train disappeared before the audience had checked their risibility.</p>
                        <p>The next aspirant was country born, but city bred. To the question where Ursa Major or the Great Bear was situated, she replied, in Africa. It was apparent that the heavens had not declared to her, "the glory of God." She sat very composedly awaiting the next question, when she was tapped on the shoulder
<pb n="167 The Diamond Pin."/>
by one of the Kittery's loveliest daughters, who answered two questions, but blundered on the third - Where was Arcturus? It was a mountain of Asia, she replied. One of Hogarth's satirical painting's hung upon the walls, and had been there for years. Miss Jenkins was asked, Who was Hogarth? She couldn't tell unless he was one of the Puritans who came over in the Mayflower -- an illustration of, "and seeing, ye see not." Her successor was asked to define Chronology -- no reply. It is the science of determining, what sort of dates? asked her interlocutor. Such as they sell at groceries? she queried. Suffice it to say there were sixty-five occupants of the chair, exhausting all the ladies presenting themselves, and but ten questions were correctly answered.</p>
                        <p>Esquire Catlin came forward and expressed regret that the pin should remain in his hands, and earnestly hoped that some one would yet appear to win and wear it, and suggested, as the meeting was interesting to the people, that a vote be taken that it be adjourned to the following Wednesday. At this point he was stayed in his proceeding by Mrs. Catlin's ascending the stage, leading by the hand a very brilliant but modest looking brunette, the teacher of a select school in Kittery. The Committee grouped around the Esquire were startled by his sudden ejaculation of, "The mischief." Very gracefully did Mrs. Catlin introduce the forlorn hope, who, when a chair was offered her, declined it, saying, "I shall take my exodus too soon to need it."</p>
                        <p>There was a smile on many faces when, the farmer again asked, How many eggs will a well-to-do hen lay during her natural life? Her modest answer was from her experience in feeding hens and gathering their eggs when a child on a plantation, (another ejaculation from the Esquire) she would say they never exceeded two hundred, oftener less. "Good," said the man of acres, "I hope you'll get the pin."</p>
                        <p>They had been unsuccessfully canvassing Kittery for funds for a cemetery, their old burying ground being unfit for farther occupancy. The brunette was called upon by a poetical member of the Committee to recite some poem to advance the cause. She selected, "The Old Burying Ground," from Whittier. It was received with much applause, and was instrumental in procuring funds for a new cemetery, with an iron fence instead of a "winding wall of mossy stone," frost-flung and broken, wherein no horse could drag his fetlock chain, no cow-bell tinkle slow, nor sheep like white ghosts come and go. This member of the Committee was engaged to a very wealthy and aristocratic lady, and although she was his inferior in talent and character, yet it was often remarked in Kittery, that she demeaned herself by the connection. This gentleman called upon the
<pb n="168 The Woman's Advocate."/>
brunette for some quotation. Quick as thought she gave one from Amy Wentworth:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">"Never maiden stoops to him<lb/>
Who lifts himself to her."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the Committee asked her to recite something else. She gave, "What the Birds Said." When she uttered these words:</p>
                        <p>
                           <q direct="unspecified"> -- "they sang, the freedman's song,<lb/>
The crash of broken locks" -- </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>there was another ejaculation from the Esquire, reminding many that he was not a partaker in "the country's sunset fair," nor its evening light.</p>
                        <p>"Ply her with hard questions, make her miss," whispered the Esquire. This, he was informed, would infringe his own rules; they were to ask only such questions as well educated, practical young ladies would be supposed to know.</p>
                        <p>The Principal of the Academy put scientific questions; she answered them all correctly. One of the Committee, somewhat noted for doing his own thinking, inquired, If she believed that in Adam's fall we sinned all? She believed, she said, "that in Adam's fall we sinned not at all." The dissimilar questions of the Committee had all been answered to their satisfaction, when a voice from the crowd inquired her age.</p>
                        <p>She smiled as she replied, "twenty-nine, and please remember, friends, what Byron said, that 'age is honorable when no attempt is made to modernize it.'"</p>
                        <p>Another voice called out, "where did you come from to Kittery?" Without answering, she turned an imploring look towards Mrs. Catlin. That lady rose, and, passing to the front of the stage, replied, "My friend, Dacotta Catlin, now shielded by our banner of Freedom and Right, once brought the market price of human flesh. By marriage, I claim her as kith and kin. She is an illegitimate child of my husband's uncle, and, after his death, was sold to pay his son's excesses in college. Her purchaser, -- God bless him! for though a slaveholder, he has a vital soul and heart, -- at my intercession gave her free papers, and was at the expense of her removal here; where she has, as you all well know, dwelt among you in all honor, teaching your children as none other has ever taught them, never shrinking when the pestilence was among us, but braving with
gentle ministration, where manly hearts dared not brave, tenements foul with disease and death. Miss Catlin's father felt that he lessened his sin by caring tenderly for her; by educating her himself, and his intention was to have secured her freedom. But the Lord of the harvest spares not the lax, and he was garnered in his pride of strength, with no time to lament his delay."</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Catlin bowed and withdrew, leaving the impression on the audience of 
a woman nobly planned," of a second Griffith, "an honest chronicler." It
<pb n="169 Thrown Upon the World."/>
was immediately voted that the Diamond Pin had been honorably won, and the community seemed well pleased that one who fulfilled life's duties so well should become its possessor. The Esquire's presentation was somewhat curt; fact and feeling manifestly revealing the perturbed state of his mind; his heart was playing old tunes, but to a new measure.</p>
                        <p>By marriage, Esquire Catlin had acquired beauty, goodness and knowledge. These "sisters three," dwelling under the same roof were insensibly moulding him anew. When Miss Catlin appeared in Kittery he urged upon the possessor of these virtues the policy of ignoring her, but he soon learned that politic measures were no lever to move her, and not to lessen himself estimation, he must loosen his hold of such morality and grasp the rule of right. No guerdon he could offer could induce her to cease righting the wronged. She had her hidden hope -- may her time of rejoicing come when both are anchored in well-doing -- </p>
                        <p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">"The joy that mixes man with heaven."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In closing, I would say that the meeting was of great importance to the inhabitants of Kittery, for, in revealing the paucity of the young ladies' attainments thus publically, it turned their attention from frivolity to a real pursuit of knowledge. Every available evening now is devoted to the study of some science, thus lifting the burden under which they have grovelled.</p>
                        <p>"They have never wanted the ballot," said the Esquire, "but they are coming up to the mark now."</p>
                        <p>"The hours that have perished, and been laid to their charge," replied Mrs. Catlin "are being redeemed."</p>

PART EIGHTH.</head>

                        <p>THROUGHOUT the hours of that sunny Spring day, following the departure of De L'Estrange, the two girls remained essentially alone. Occasionally,, to attend to some department of labor especially her province, or to give directions concerning some more particular work, Marian would beg her new-found friend to excuse her while she passed into the outer room from whence proceeded the busy click of type dropping, ceaselessly and methodically, into the "sticks" of the light-hearted and occasionally talkative compositors; but as quickly as possible she would discharge her task and hasten back to the little alcove where, with
<pb n="170 The Woman's Advocate."/>
beaming face, sat her companion eager to resume the interrupted thread of conversation.</p>
                        <p>Upon how many subjects did they discourse during that May day, so fair without, so sunny forever in the memory of Marian? Scarcely noted by either were the light-winged hours as they stole away. All their past lives, so dissimilar in surroundings, so alike in aspirations and heroic purpose - were unveiled to each other. Of her early girlhood, her arrival a stranger in the metropolis, and the subsequent incidents of her not uneventful life, our somewhat reserved Marian found herself speaking with a freedom and minuteness of detail which she would have deemed strange at an ordinary moment, but which in the unrestrained tide of revelation on the part of her bright, sunny-spirited companion seemed wholly proper and but a just equivalent of confidence. Strange indeed, almost like the unfolding of some fairy tale, seemed the brief life of that fair, young girl as poured into the ear of the sympathetic, eagerly listening Marian. But little had she known of Mina Graves beyond the knowledge afforded by the chance newspaper paragraphs which, from time to time, had caught her eye, powerfully exciting her interest in the "child sculptor." She knew that she was one of earth's royally gifted, that success after success had been achieved by her in her art, that even at that moment she stood charged with a commission by the government which rendered her at once the object of admiration and of envy by thousands; but how she had climbed those dizzy heights of prosperity and fame, what advantages she had enjoyed, or how much was due to her own unaided exertions, Marian hitherto had possessed no means of knowing.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, my dear friend," Mina impulsively uttered, in dwelling upon some of the incidents of her early life, "like yourself, I was country born, and of parents in very reduced circumstances. When I was a child, ten years of age, my father, then living in an Eastern village, accepted the situation of a clerk at an Indian agency upon our Western frontier; and six or more years of my life -- all the period intervening between careless childhood and our removal to Washington, some two years since -- were spent in living a life of almost unrestrained nature. Poor as we were, in that land of few wants and of easily obtained food, we felt none of the stings of ordinary poverty. There was but little for
<pb n="171 Thrown Upon the World."/>
me to do at that period; my parents were indulgent, and all the time not devoted to study under their supervision, was at my absolute disposal. Several times, in the course of those half dozen years, my poor, toil-worn father changed his abode - tossed by the adverse changes of administration, or lured by the hope of bettering his fortunes -- but we never, by any chance, approached the East; continually we hovered upon the frontier. Ah, my friend, I scarcely need say to you what a charm that nomadic life possessed for an imaginative, unformed girl! Untamed, almost, as the Sioux or Comanches, -- who roved the plains, and who were almost our only visitors, -- half my life was spent in the open air. I had but few books, and no society; but I was rarely happy even without the possession of either. I made friends of objects animate and inanimate; the streams, groves and whispering winds became my companions; on those free, broad prairies instinct with life, surrounded by those glorious charms of landscape, I was never lonely. Tenfold more solitary have I often felt in some city of the East -- perchance amid the glare of some ball-room, or fashionable reception -- than I ever felt in those early girlhood days, even when roaming alone, with no human being within miles of the haunt I had chosen. Ah, those days, how my very spirit longs, at times, for a return of their wrapt enjoyment! So time passed on. You have asked me how early I began to exercise my art. I cannot remember the period when the beautiful, whether portrayed upon canvas, carved in statue, or spread abroad in landscape, had not a charm, an indescribable fascination, for me; or when I did not strive, in some childish, untaught way, to reproduce what I so much admired in nature or in art. Still, until recently, I may say that my predilections were more for the brush than the ruder carver of the sculptor. Indeed, such a thing as distinction in the latter had never flashed across my mind, even in those imaginings of the <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> which come to us with the temptation of indulgement which we cannot resist. With the brush, working without a master, and with such few materials and accessories for study as I could command, I had achieved tolerable success, although conscious of the commonplace character of my work, and inly tormented with the sense or conviction -- call it, my dear Marian, what you may! -- that there was something for which I was more truly fitted, -- called by my maker to do, -- and of which my spirit went in cease-
<pb n="172 The Woman's Advocate."/>
less quest. As a portrait, or even as a landscape painter, -- for it was for the latter I displayed the greater aptitude, -- I know I never should have attained success more than respectable; but in an hour I dreamed not of the turning point in my life came, and henceforth I had no doubt as to my mission. Shortly after our removal to Washington, and while I was yet in possession of the clerkship in one of the Departments, which, fortunately, I had early been able to secure, I accompanied Mr. R---, the well-known member of the House, to the Capitol to see some of the works of Mr. Mills, the famous sculptor. It was my first visit to the studio of an artist, and my first more than hurried inspection of the Capitol; and I can recall, as vividly as though it were but yesterday, the mingled emotions of awe and half child-like expectation with which I trod those marble floors and wandered along those spacious aisles, so new to me then, but afterwards in all their wilderness of grandeur so familiar. At last -- after pausing sufficiently to admire some of the well-known and much criticised groups of statuary which adorn the Capitol, which to me, then, seemed all that was gloriously beautiful -- we arrived at the door of Mr. Mill's studio. The great master, who was in, received us affably, pointing out his more recent works; and all emotions of awe, which I may have experienced, were speedily lost in the almost intoxication of delight with which my eye drank in those rare conceptions of genius. I have read, my dear friend, of travelers bewildered by the unfolding of the charms of some princely pile, to the enjoyment of the rare beauties of which by the turning of a portal they were suddenly admitted. It was just such a fairy realm that opened before me, absorbing all my faculties, during the rare hour we lingered in Mr. Mill's studio. At last we left, but I carried away each feature, each artistic creation, in brain-haunted memory. Back in my room, I could not rest. The fever of the sculptor was upon me. Within four-and-twenty hours I had persuaded my staunch friend, Mr. R---, to convey to me privately the materials actually needed for a first rough cast, and all the following night, without once closing my eyes in slumber, I toiled at my first figure. I will not weary you, my dear Marian, with the details of my repeated failures to produce aught that was satisfying. Suffice it that when I finally ventured to show my work to Mr. R---, he was so pleased with it that he bore it away in triumph to Mr. Mills, who, I was afterwards
<pb n="173 Thrown Upon the World."/>
informed, could with difficulty be induced to believe that it was the work of the wholly uninstructed girl who so recently had visited his studio. A little later, I was invited to become his pupil, and many pleasant hours were subsequently spent in his studio, receiving from him the instruction to which I am so largely indebted for whatever I may have since achieved in art."</p>
                        <p>Mina ceased her long narration; to it all her companion had listened with the interest inspired by her sympathy with the heroic, the loftily aspiring, in human nature. For a few moments no words were spoken. Yet more Marian was desirous of hearing, but she forbore, by any question, to divert her friend from the revery into which she had fallen. At last, arousing herself, as by an effort, Mina again spoke, a trace of sadness in her tone, and a half sad expression upon her usually vivacious face:</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Marian! how often have I been spoken of as the 'favorite of fortune,' by those wholly ignorant of my life and its struggles! I know I am the object
of envy to many, but could they know all I have been compelled to undergo -- the annoyances, the misrepresentations, the baffled hopes or strivings -- they would realize the truth of the old saying that, 'every heart knoweth its own bitterness.' Mine, latterly, has been an exposed life. The commission with which I have been intrusted by Congress, which I prize as an expression of confidence, and as furnishing an opportunity for the exercise of my best powers, has caused mot a few of the coarser, more dissolute members, and others, to presume upon many annoying attentions and interruptions to my work, which I have been powerless completely to prevent; and in this way, my dear Marian, I have suffered more than any words of mine, could describe. Among those Senators and Representatives there are, I rejoice to say, men of culture and high honor, as well as of commanding talent. To some of these, for their almost fatherly interest, kindly advice, and judicious criticism of my work, I am unspeakably indebted. But, moving in that Washington life, there are others, high in station, recognized by the world as gentlemen, who have hung as ghouls around my studio; whom my inmost nature loathes as it loathes all that is base and grovelling, and whom I would shut out from my existence as I would all that envy, speaking by manifold tongue or press, has said of me for the last
<pb n="174 The Woman's Advocate."/>
two years. But I am going away from it all now. My back is turned upon the dear Washington studio. In another clime, surrounded by rarer treasures of art, I must bear my dreams, and attempt the realization of the ideal which is forever before me. I go not as other girls, careless and light of heart, with no purpose but to float gayly upon the broader theater of life. I have renounced the cravings for affection which my heart could so prize, -- the ties of hearth and home will never be mine. I dedicate my life to labor; if I can accomplish this one work as something within me says I shall, I shall be even content with whatever my after life may have in store for me."</p>
                        <p>Again there was a pause, this time broken by the return of De L'Estrange, and after a pleasant conversation of a few moments, the two cousins took their departure, with the promise to call for Marian at the "Home" in the evening to accompany them to an exhibition of choice paintings in an "up-town" gallery which were then attracting the attention of the genuine lovers of art.</p>

                           <p>THE AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION, organized in Cleveland, November 24th, 1869, will hold a Mass Convention for the advocacy of WOMAN SUFFRAGE, in this city, during Anniversary Week, in Steinway Hall, commencing May 110, at 10 A. M., and continuing, morning, afternoon and evening, May 11th and 12th.</p>
                           <p>It is yet but a few months since we chronicled the organization of this body of earnest men and women, so largely comprising the singleness of purpose and best thought of the Nation; but the progress which has been made in uniting in one solid phalanx the friends of Woman Suffrage, in the concentration of effort, and in winning increased respect for the movement, has been especially gratifying. With but few exceptions, East and West the various State Associations have declared themselves auxiliary to the organization formed at Cleveland; its ranks have received large accessions of the noblest of our representative names; it has held a series of conventions powerfully affecting public opinion; the green hills of Vermont for months have been rendered a battle-ground by tireless devotion, by agency of tongue and press, by all that the exercise of the loftiest talent, coupled with the highest aspiration for the good of humanity, might accomplish,-- the AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION is deeply implanted in the respect and confidence of the American people. As its creation was a national necessity, its brief existence has rebounded to the honor and prosperity of the cause; while its future, under the wise administration of the animating spirits who now shape its counsels and give tone and efficiency to its actions, cannot fail to be as potent for human good.</p>
                           <p>Most cordially do we welcome this Association to our city. New York during Anniversary Week will witness the gathering of many an

august and time-honored assemblage, but to none should it extend a more hearty or appreciative greeting than to this noble body of men and women who will seek it, not in the spirit of controversy, but with no motive but the good of the cause, asking for the speedy enfranchisement of Woman, in the name of the AMERICAN WOMAN SUPFRAGE ASSOCIATION.</p>

                           <p>ALL eyes are turned to Vermont. A Woman Suffrage campaign, the most earnest and practically important yet prosecuted in our country for women's enfranchisement, has been in progress there since last Autumn. In a few weeks the voters throughout the State are to vote directly upon the pending proposition to so amend the Constitution as to enfranchise women upon equal terms with men. Thanks to the American Woman Suffrage Association, -- whose tireless, capable representatives have traversed the State, leaving scarcely a hamlet in all that mountain land unvisited, -- its people will not vote wholly uninformed or misunderstandingly. Conventions, lectures, the distribution of tracts and other publications, have been the order of the day there for months; yet indefatigable as have been those exertions, and <sic>marvellous</sic> as the progress of the cause has been of late, we scarcely dare hope that victory will crown the efforts of the friends of Woman Suffrage in this first grand struggle for the <hi rend="italic">political equality of the sexes</hi>, in the Green Mountain State. The Lexington and Bunker Hill conflicts have been re-enacted, in the victories won upon our western frontier; but the sterner battles of the war, the modern Brandywine and Stillwater, are yet to be fought on the plains of the populous States of the East. Much more means the ballot for woman in an old State like Vermont than in a virgin Territory like Wyoming, chaplet crowned, holding out its young arm, welcoming alike to its political privileges, Man and Woman. But of the States east of the Mississippi, we know of no one within
whose limits reside a people more sterling, generous, open to conviction in all that partakes of the liberal, than green-hilled Vermont. In that State, where conservatism is the exception -- where want of education is almost the only taunt ever flung at a citizen -- we may, in this first assay, be defeated; but our demand, founded upon Justice and Equity, will in the end force itself upon the conviction of its sons and daughters, the latter of whom are already rapidly becoming alive to the importance of the issue presented. We have watched the progress of this campaign with interest; we shall await the result with so-

                           <p>THE Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia, now more than twenty years old, with a record honorable beyond that of most American universities, and numbering some of thee most skilled and successful practitioners of the day among its alumni, held its Eighteenth Annual Commencement on Saturday, the 12th ult. Musical Fund Hall of that city was filled with a sympathetic audience, composed of the liberal citizens of Philadelphia and vicinity. Fourteen young ladies graduated, coming from all parts of the Union. It is impossible to estimate the good flowing oat from such a time-honored seat of learning, carrying thus yearly its healing skill, its liberality of thought and breadth of mind, moulding and shaping opinion, into all parts of the land. ANN PRESTON, M. D., Professor of Physiology and Hygiene, a woman known to letters and identified with Pennsylvania medical history, delivered the valedictory address. Space forbids the presentation of Dr. PRESTON'S valuable remarks entire; an extract or two must indicate their choiceness of character. Referring to what medical science has already accomplished, or is yet to achieve in its progress, she says:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Medicine is surely destined to become a richer blessing to humanity than it has yet been. The advances already made are prophecies of greater ones to come. If some widely-destructive diseases, as scurvy and small-pox, are almost vanished from the civilized world; if epidemics are held in check, and the percentage of recoveries in ordinary diseases is greatly increased; if, with advanced knowledge of hygiene, the average duration of human life becomes greater from decade to decade; still there is a vast amount of preventable disease and death, for which no effective remedy, as yet, has been systematically adopted. But physiology is now giving light and life to practical medicine. Therapeutics, at last, is widening into a science, as it begins to be recognized that all surrounding influences, air, sun, light, food, sleep, clothing, exercise and mental stimuli are within its legitimate domain as truly as Iron, Opium Bitters and Bromides. Nor do its boundaries stop here. <hi rend="italic">Morals</hi> also belong to Therapeutics. Temperance,
<pb n="180 The Woman's Advocate."/>
Purity, Faith, Hope and Charity modify bodily processes; they ward off disease and prolong life, and the physician who does not realize this truth, and understand something of the reactions of the moral, intellectual and physical life, does not possess the key to the best success in practice -- is not yet initiated into the sacred mysteries of the divine art of healing."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Speaking of the nervous maladies that have so generally fastened themselves on enfeebled womanhood, especially in so-called fashionable society, she forcibly remarks:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"You know that quiet, interesting, imperative work -- work for hands and for mind -- is essential to their health; and as you sigh over their perverted, suffering, unsatisfied lives, yon cannot be content with the mockery of merely prescribing drugs, needful and beneficent as these may often be. Some morbid Michelets may speak of this feeble womanhood as the necessary result of advanced civilization, but it is very clear to us that it is not a high civilization, but the failure to reach it, to which this is due. The highest civilization will surely be in harmony with nature, with health, with the moral and Divine law. It will drive out follies as well as fevers; it will foster pure, quiet, simple tasks; and it will find its model of beauty in form and drapery; not in the vulgar devices by which fashionable mantua-making distorts and burlesques human proportions, but in the grace and freedom of artistic nature, and the corresponding fitness of clothing. The woman of a true civilization will regard as pitiful and barbarous the idea that uselessness is elegance, or that disease and languor are womanly, and she will surely escape the emptiness and dissatisfaction which oppress every human being -- the proudest queen of fashion as well as the lowliest daughter of poverty -- who does not cultivate and direct to ennobling uses the powers and faculties which are the glorious birthright of humanity."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Referring to the progress of medical education abroad, she thus speaks:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"The progress which our cause is making throughout the world is truly <sic>marvellous</sic>. In Free Switzerland, the Medical University of Zurich has for years admitted women to all its advantages; the great university of cosmopolitan Paris has now dispensed to them the fullest privileges and highest honors; the University of Edinburgh has opened its doors, creaking with the rime of ages, wide enough for their entrance; the University of Stockholm, in Sweden, we understand, is offering them facilities for medical education, and the Swedish <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, it is stated, is about to establish a complete Medical College, at Gothenburg, for women exclusively. In Austria, the candidates for the degree of Doctor

                           <p>IT is with pain that we observe in the columns that old established favorite and, in many respects, excellent journal, the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Evening Post</hi>,of Philadelphia, an editorial upon, "Woman's Rights," in which certain views are advanced as the serious convictions of the writer, more worthy of the Dark Ages than the enlightened spirit of the Nineteenth Century. For Mr. Peterson, in days past we have entertained more than an ordinary respect. Scholarly, imaginative, always graceful and sparkling in editorial utterance, liberal upon most subjects beyond brother journalists, it has been almost with amazement that we have perused his narrow, illogical argument against "Woman's Rights," as represented by its many conscientious, earnest advocates. Not with any hope of wooing Mr. Peterson from the error of his position by thus holding up the mirror before him, but to show our readers how great is yet the necessity for labor and conversion, when reputable journals like the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, penetrating into thousands of homes, can unquestioned enunciate such sentiments, we reproduce a portion of his article:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"Some say flippantly, if Nature has appointed woman's sphere, why need any one else interfere in the matter; Nature certainly will enforce her own laws. But they forget that the disgust felt and expressed by man when he sees woman abandoning her rightful sphere, is one of the most potent means used by Nature to enforce her laws. Nature has implanted in the breast of man a true perception of what is proper and becoming in a woman; and it is Nature's voice which utters itself in the language of sarcasm, contempt and censure. So far from holding that those who now call themselves the peculiar advocates of woman, are her friends, we believe them to be really her greatest enemies. And that in proportion as they succeed in their design of giving women the elective franchise, introducing them into jury boxes, etc., they will injure the character, standing and influence of the sex. How it shocks us, when we travel abroad, to see women engaged in sweeping the streets, acting as porters, digging canals, and doing the dirtiest work on the farms. That feeling in us, which is Nature's
<pb n="182 The Woman's Advocate."/>
voice, says all this is wrong. But if these new notions of equality be true, then all this is right -- women should claim no exemption on account of sex from the lowest and most laborious work. And if the old barriers be removed, and the old feeling of chivalry broken down, and woman be considered simply as a female man, -- worthy of no special favors as a woman, and subject to no corresponding limitations - this is what it must all end in. Entitled to nothing but what she can command by her own force, in the rude competition of politics and of business, she as the weaker vessel will be pushed more and more aside."</q>

                           <p>DURING the month which has just closed, upon our western verge of civilization, an event occurred which signalizes the rapid progress which has been made in reform, and strikingly marks the advent of the New Era for Woman. On March 7th, 1870, at Fort Laramie, Washington Territory, the first panel of women Grand Jurors our country has known was duly sworn. Strange as it may appear to the readers and believers of the philosophy Of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, not one of the number asked to be excused. Every one thus called to a novel duty, whatever may have been the sacrifice, unhesitatingly accepted the <hi rend="italic">responsibility</hi>. An able address was delivered by Chief-Justice DOWE, which, for its liberality and realization of the needs of the hour, is eminently worthy of the widest publicity. Mr DOWE thus spoke:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">
                                 <hi rend="italic">Ladies,and Gentlemen of the Grand Jury:</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">It is an innovation, and a great novelty, to see, as we do to-day, ladies summoned to serve as jurors. The extension of political rights and franchise to women is a subject that is agitating the whole country. I have never taken an active part in those discussions, but I have long seen that woman was a victim to the vices, crimes and immoralities of man, with no power to protect and defend herself from these evils. I have long felt that such powers should be conferred upon women and it has fallen to our lot here to act as pioneers in the movement and to test the question. The eyes of the whole world are today fixed upon this jury of Albany County. There is not the slightest impropriety in any lady occupying this position, and I wish to assure you that the fullest protection of the Court shall be accorded to you. It would be a most shameful scandal that in our temple of justice and in our Courts of law any
<pb n="183 Editorial Department."/>
thing should be permitted which the most sensitive lady might not hear with
propriety and witness. And here let me add, it will be a sorry day for any man who shall so far forget the courtesy due and paid by every American gentleman
to every American lady, as to even by word or act endeavor to deter you from the exercise of those rights with which the law has invested you. I will conclude with a remark that this is a question for you to decide for yourself. No man has any right to interfere. It seems to be eminently proper for women to sit upon Grand Juries, which will give them the best opportunities to aid in suppressing, the dens of infamy which curse the country. I shall be glad of your assistance in the accomplishment of this object. I do not make these remarks from distrust of any of the gentlemen. On the contrary, I am exceedingly pleased and gratified with the indications of intelligence, love of law and good order, and gentlemanly deportment, which I see manifested here. I will now listen to any reasons which any jurors may make for being excused.</q>

                           <p>OUR fine serial, "The Market Woman," from the pen of our esteemed contributor, Mrs. Antoinette B. Blackwell, which has been an attractive feature of THE ADVOCATE since November last, has received many warm commendations from the press and gratifying expressions of interest from our correspondents, attesting the thorough appreciation of the public. One of the latest of these communications, from a young lady herself a welcome contributor to our pages, so happily expresses the general tenor of interest conveyed, albeit gently critical, that we present it entire:</p>
                           <p>
                              <q direct="unspecified">"I sympathized at first with the brave little Market Woman, but, somehow, as the story grows, there grows in my mind, with all my interest, a feeling of disappointment. Why must she, as the necessity for exertion so measurably passes away, become so mercenary? It is only the old chase after the 'Almighty Dollar.' What a pleasant, even luxurious home she might have made of that old homestead, instead of it being <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> a place to toil and strive to accumulate riches. But Mrs. Reband goes on, feeding her family on dry Johnny Cake, no sugar, no butter, -- nothing but vegetables and that everlasting Johnny Cake, -- all through the story; until a couple of gossips -- despicable creatures at best - come in: and, presto, although it is an uninvited visit from people who are nothing to her, her table is loaded with delicacies that would have kept her own family in small doses, at least, of <hi rend="italic">palatable</hi> victuals for some time. I do not see why hospitality should be thus far stretched, to gratify the curiosity of such inveterate gossips. Why could she not in a firm, yet quiet and lady-like manner have excused herself from entertaining such unwarranted <hi rend="italic">visitors</hi>? The gossips might have raved, but their predetermined plan to pry into her home affairs would have failed. But these little points of criticism aside, -- which are really immaterial, -- Mrs. Blackwell is entitled to our thanks for giving us, in this age of sensational romance, a good, common sense story."</q>

Miss MARWEDEL, by her sterling qualities of head and heart, and the unconquerable enthusiasm manifested in her enterprise, brief as has been her sojourn in our midst, has already won hosts of warm friends; and her School, now on the eve of successful accomplishment, cannot fall of largely filling a need which the establishment of such institutions, promising so much in the way of improved physical health and better compensation for the skilled labor of women, can only supply.</p>

                           <p>IN another month, Mrs. Reband and her one medium-sized, well filled trunk were stowed away on shipboard, en-route for Oregon via Aspinwall, Panama, and San Francisco. There were other passengers, including several ladies.</p>
                           <p>The market woman moved in the midst of the others like any sensible, experienced lady of positive character, having business of her own which she was lawfully pursuing, and concerning which it was not necessary to bore her neighbors or to ask advice.</p>
                           <p>"Who is that quiet, rather oldish lady, and where is she going?" asked one young gentleman of another.</p>
                           <p>"Don't know; but I'll go up and do a little polite pumping. I'll rather play 
the filial, you know; and get her history. One needs some occupation on shipboard."</p>
                           <p>He walked leisurely up to Mrs. Reband's side with a few good day and fair weather preliminaries; which she, who had sat long enough looking idly off upon the water, accepted graciously.</p>
                           <p>"I suppose, madam, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are going out to join your husband or son."</p>
                           <p>"No, I am going to prospect for gold."</p>
                           <p>"Indeed! What, in California?"</p>
                           <p>"I am bound for Oregon. It may be gold is to be found there quite as abundantly as in any other part of the world."</p>
                           <pb n="188 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"Is it possible!" he exclaimed, looking a little mystified and uncertain. He was just on the point of adding: "How odd for a woman to start off gold hunting;" but he only said, "I didn't know that gold had ever been found there. It's almost a wilderness, isn't it?"</p>
                           <p>The puzzled look came once more into his face, and he glanced at his companion as if a suspicion of her sanity had crossed his mind; but her placid, assuring smile made him add hastily, "I'm going to the mining regions too, but in California."</p>
                           <p>"Well, success to you; but you know there are several ways of searching for gold."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, I know; but I hope I shall light upon a nugget half a foot through. Why shouldn't I?"</p>
                           <p>"I hope you may," said Mrs. Reband, warmly, "but if you do not it is of little use to be disappointed. A delicious fruit country where vegetables can be grown, at almost all seasons of the year will yield a handsome living to any persevering young man who is ready to try, and try again."</p>
                           <p>"I'm ready for that; but I take to gold more than to fruit raising. I should
not mind fasting outright for a year or two if I could thrive on it and make a
fortune."</p>
                           <p>"Making haste to be rich is a native California fever and very contagious, I understand. Possibly you are predisposed to it already, Mr. Ainslee."</p>
                           <p>"Possibly, madam; but you see there's the girl I left behind me, and I must earn her a handsome home."</p>
                           <p>"If you <hi rend="italic">earn</hi> it you will have it; but if you get her a plain home she can come on and help you earn the handsome one."</p>
                           <p>"Oh, my wife shan't work -- that I'm determined."</p>
                           <p>"It is very generous in you; but you must tell me about her. Is she an
invalid?"</p>
                           <p>"She? oh no! and once more the youth, just fresh from Cambridge,(undergraduate) opened his eyes in perplexity; but reading only
the bland motherly interest on a pleasant, elderly woman's face, he said, "she is only a school-girl, and the petted child of a rich father. So I am bound to be ready for her, you know." Then finding the motherly interest deepen under this burst of unexpected confidence, he fell back into a glowing description of his lady-love, quite to their mutual satisfaction; and the two parted friends. It was not until he had rejoined his companion that be began to be conscious that all the pumping
<pb n="189 The Market Woman."/>
had not been done by himself. Yet on the whole, it had been so amiably done, he was not disposed to resent it.</p>
                           <p>"My dear Mrs. Reband, you have not told me what it is that takes you out here alone with your family," said a lady as they stood together talking in friendly fellowship, one evening.</p>
                           <p>"I have always wanted to look at that Southern Cross as I see it now," was the reply. "It will be a life-long pleasant memory to me."</p>
                           <p>"So it will to me, I must say; that and I'll find husband and point it out to him."</p>
                           <p>There the matter dropped. To "sink the shop may be difficult enough for a masculine mind; but feminine diplomacy never attempts it. It may be really uppermost in all a woman says and does and yet nobody ever dreams of it. Mrs. Reband would have scorned to disown her calling as a market woman to her fellow voyagers, yet no one of them had the slightest suspicion of the character of her thirty years' steady occupation. She had simply laid aside her pink sunbonnet and everything which it represented, and at present she was only a genuine, interested, wholly unassuming traveler. Having no part to play she played none; but was merely true to herself, her instincts, and her experience. She had a great interest in the whole Pacific Coast, and here was the common ground upon which every one met her in ready converse. A common interest is "one touch of nature" which "makes the whole world kin." Quick to catch every incidental suggestion and to ask appropriate questions whenever there was the probability of an intelligent answer, she was regarded as an entirely harmless but rather entertaining and peculiar person. Thus with eyes, ears, and tongue under admirable command, friendly, and accepted by every one she met, the market woman journeyed on, till, leaving the waters of the Pacific Ocean, she entered the gaping, wide-mouthed Columbia river.</p>
                           <p>But no sooner had the Golden Gate been fairly left behind and a new set of passengers on board, all en route for Northern latitudes, than Mrs. Reband had realized at once that she was in the midst of possible future neighbors. She was a representative of those at home who had sent her on a special embassy, and something of the nature of her business as a traveler began to be very naturally understood amongst her fellow voyagers. She was no longer merely a lady traveler; but a business agent - an enterprising woman with a shrewd, practical head on her shoulders and an undisputed claim to look into everything which might concern her in the matter which she had in hand. Still self-controlled and quiet, yet whoever was practically posted as to the resources of the new country which she was going to visit, found her always a good and defer-

ential listener; and she occasionally entered into close business discussions with grey-headed settlers, and into estimates and calculations with the two or three traders and speculators who chanced to be on board.</p>
                           <p>"I tell you she's a buster;" said one old fellow, who had been talking to her for half an hour about cattle raising, beef, dairies, and dairy farms; and who felt it incumbent on him to express some downright approval of her astonishing good sense. "They talk about woman's rights now-a-days; -but she's usin' just the kind of rights I believe in. One does like to meet a woman once in a while who knows something 'bout real things."</p>
                           <p>"It's a fact!" said his companion. "I shouldn't wonder if she'd be a great
help to the country if she settles down -- mebbe give it jest such a lift as most nobody else could. The women is always so weak mostly for new country life. I hate to bring my wife out here terrible, 'cause she pities herself about it so dreadfully, you know; but I've been unlucky, and at present I don't see no better way through."</p>
                           <p>"Well, it's hard for both of ye; but think of a woman coming and leaving
her husband behind."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, that's pluck; and it's likely that she's the fittest one, on the whole."</p>
                           <p>She cries <hi rend="italic">him</hi> up tall, though, and says he couldn't well leave home; but I expect they all knew who was just the one to come."</p>
                           <p>No one found the woman's practical knowledge contemptible, or her insight into the nature of the problem which she had come to solve at all in fault. Just as every tree makes its own place, proving its fitness and its right to be, even when growing up in the most unexpected and almost impossible places, so this woman impressed every one with her eminent fitness for the unusual work which she had undertaken.</p>
                           <p>She was clad with a purpose, and wore her unshaken self-reliance with so entire a sense of the wisdom of her course, that no one else was tempted to call it in question. For the rest, her outward garments grew even more colorless and inconspicuous than before; and when the voyage ended, both she and the others well-nigh forgetting her sex they were ready to render her any feasible assistance, in her wish to explore the Territory with a possible view to plant a new colony of settlers in this wilderness, so rich in promise for the future, so literal and uncompromising in the present.</p>

                           <p>Mrs. Reband soon established herself in one of those many easily extemporised public houses peculiar to a new locality. The frame had been brought out on ship-board, set up in a day and afterwards duplicated by a second, a veritable Siamese twin to itself; both of which were now swarming with adventurous human life. This hotel was headquarters also for sundry government officials.</p>
                           <p>At her leisure, Mrs. Reband proceeded to make frequent excursions here and there in examination of the various facilities of the region which she had come so far to visit. Her company of gardeners and market men understood well enough that to pursue the old calling in a new Territory would be like putting old wine into new bottles; it would be much less easy to extemporise a great city which would buy their produce, than to furnish building materials, implements and other indispensable things for the convenience of new settlers destined to spread over a large area of country. They desired therefore water, both as motive power and as the medium of transit for their commodities when ready to be thrown upon the market. They proposed to establish saw-mills, factories, and grist mills; and while each family was to have its own separate establishment, and be measurably independent in its operations, yet there was to be a certain
amount of co-operation amongst them all. In a word, it was to be a colony of
neighbors, jointly bent upon developing the resources of a new country to their own and the general good; such at least was the ideal; was this then the region best adapted for its realization? How shall any one, except an eye-witness, describe those journeyings to and fro in the savage wilderness, those pedestrian and horseback pilgrimages into primeval forests, those jolting experiences in ox-carts, in one-horse stages, and in manifold nondescript conveyances; and those still more wondrous adventures in boats of heterogeneous sizes and uses. But haply all this would not be much, to our present purpose. A woman crowned with fifty years experience can journey to and fro throughout our most savage wilds like Una, with her hand always upon the lion's mane and no harm will ever come to her.</p>
                           <p>I have known one young woman, then not many years over twenty, who travelled thousands of miles on mule back, sometimes with and again without any of her own sex as escort. This girl journeyed alone up and down the whole length and breadth of California, coming into all the miners' settlements like a

vision of self-forgetfulness to preach to them temperance and godliness; while even the red-eyed among those whose thirst for whiskey was yet greater than their hunger for gold, would listen to her with bated breath as to a voice in the wilderness speaking to them of better things. A miner told me that all the men held her in reverence, speaking of her always in the grateful subdued tones of respect, though she possessed no other eloquence than the earnestness of a good purpose; and her name, unlike that of her brilliant successor, Anna Dickinson, -- who found a moving palace and a civilized iron road at her service, -- had never been known to fame, so that it was only the most desolate way-places which received her with exceeding gladness.</p>
                           <p>The mission of our market woman was wholly practical and material enough; yet with all its flavor of worldliness, it carried everywhere its own dignity and its divine right. The main fact exists, that there is a time and a place for everything; and prospecting with a view to settlement in a new country is quite within the province of any competent woman.</p>
                           <p>"I have travelled quite extensively," she wrote home to her friends; "but have not yet fixed upon any desirable location. I am perpetually balancing pros and cons; and find myself drifting more and more into indecision. The country abounds in many noble advantages to settlers, and my judgment may be at fault in not deciding at once as to the wisdom of a settlement here."</p>
                           <p>To her husband, she wrote: "Woman-like am I a little homesick, and does that weigh in the balance against an immediate favorable decision? I think not. I miss you all sadly; but there is something so novel in this new experience that I am perpetually interested and refreshed. I will at least wait till I receive the opinion of yourself and others based upon the statements already made to you."</p>
                           <p>"That woman's a curus person altogether," said her landlord confidentially to his crony. "She don't altogether jump at things quick-like, as some women do; but I tell you if she don't see through a millstone first thing, she just drills a hole right through and makes a kind of spy-glass of it. She's cornered me up short a dozen times; but she don't seem to know it herself, and she lets me off easy."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, I've noticed she's wonderful soft spoken and kinder defers to people; but that's what I think a woman should."</p>
                           <p>"So do I; but I tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I guess she's one that goes her own way after all. She's been here a good deal now, off and on, and I haven't seen the first fellow that could humbug her into believing anything unreasonable; and half a dozen of 'em has tried it!"</p>
                           <p>"Do tell! I haint much used to that kind of women. I must get into a talk
<pb n="193 The Market Woman."/>
with her some day. My wife never takes up an argument with me; and maybe it'll be something like studying a new kind of animal up here in the woods. I've got acquainted with a good many such in the last two years."</p>
                           <p>"I bet you! You'll find she's as sharp as steel, and as close as a nut; but I
guess mebbe you wouldn't select <hi rend="italic">her</hi> if you was going to pick out a second wife."</p>
                           <p>I rather guess I shouldn't nuther; but I can't help but hope she'll decide to settle in the country. We want enterprise!"</p>
                           <p>"That's so! We must help it on all we can. I'm doing my best makin' reasonable charges and all. What I like her best of all for is that she knows how to mind her own business. You don't find her nosing into other folks' affairs; and going on with preachments if you don't carry yourself just square. Sometimes I can't really tell whether she sees things or not." This art of "minding her own business" was a perpetual and uneasy puzzle to the worthy Publicin, yet Mrs. Reband was neither blind nor deaf.</p>
                           <p>In the intervals of her journeyings to and fro, and her frequent excursions into the interior, there were many days of leisure which would have hung wearily upon her hitherto always active hands, except that her thoughts found sufficient occupation, and her ears were always open to every thing which might possibly be heard to advantage.</p>
                           <p>But "what is one doomed to hear for the sake of a pair of ears," even in the most Christian community! It could hardly be better here in this fringe of twisted civilization and barbarism, upon the outer edge of the Pacific slope. She could not fail to be reminded that from the earliest budding of our Anglo-Saxon civilization there are tares everywhere springing in the midst of the wheat. As a nation we have always thought it expedient to keep with the red men a red record, unmindful that they are bound to hold it up to us one day in the broad sunlight of universal condemnation. The weak are doomed to be wronged and defrauded by the strong, and their interests sacrificed on the slightest pretext suggested by the pleasure or the convenience of the unscrupulous, until men learn that the laws of moral action and reaction are mathematically equal, like the physical laws.</p>
                           <p>Many a white settler outside the protection of humane public opinion is like a sheep, dumb in the hands of the official shearers. Through the fragile partition walls which separated her from general business and life of the house, the market woman became necessarily cognizant of much that was going on about her. One day she learned that a government official, who was bound either to remain at his post or to be represented there, was going higher North
<pb n="194 The Woman's Advocate."/>
to a two weeks' merry-making in another settlement. "Will he be wanted before his return?" she asked herself, "and, if so, what then?"</p>
                           <p>The answer was given her in due time. On the third day after his departure, a settler from some twenty miles away came in to transact business with the absent official, in behalf both of himself and his neighbors. He was in the greatest haste to have his affairs settled at once that he might return without delay to his family.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband, poring over the stale items of a hardly legible, smoke-saturated newspaper, heard a strange voice saying in a high, earnest key, "Can't ye give me some idee as to about when he may be expected back?"</p>
                           <p>The suppressed anxiety and disappointment in the questioner's voice would have enlisted the attention of a much busier person than herself. She listened intently.</p>
                           <p>"Can't tell! he may be here any hour or he may not come before to-morrow or  next day!" answered in an indifferent tone by an employee of the hotel.</p>
                           <p>"Is it certain he will be here as early as to-morrow? Shall I be sure to see him if I wait over to-morrow?"</p>
                           <p>"Not sure! Nothing is sure here. He might go astray on the way or get belated a day or two with such roads."</p>
                           <p>"Well, then, if I go home, can't you appoint a time - say next week or week after - when I can come agin and find him here?"</p>
                           <p>"Can't do it! He's liable to be called away any time, on important business. Better stay, while you are here, till he comes back."</p>
                           <p>The victim sighed, hummed, walked to and fro, and even said a few rough words to relieve his vexation.</p>
                           <p>"Sorry for you!" said the clerk, with an inward chuckle. It would be a good joke to tell in the time to come.</p>
                           <p>"Well, let me see the landlord. May-be he can help me?"</p>
                           <p>"You may see him, but he can't say any different from what I say."</p>
                           <p>"Poor Annie!" said the man to himself. "She'll cry her eyes out, and wish she was back in York State a hundred times. She was homesick enough afore I started, but I 'spose the Bentleys will cheer her up all they kin. Can't be help, any way. Cost a heap of money too. Pshaw! too bad! -- Thunder! who'd a thought it! All this trouble just to git our deeds and things! to bad!"</p>
                           <p>Too bad!" repeated Mrs. Reband, on the other side of the rickety boards,
and she was almost resolved to go in at once and tell him the truth.</p>
                           <p>But prudence was the market woman's ruling characteristic. Life, and interests dearer than life, she had intrusted to a civilization outside of the pale of
<pb n="195 The Market Woman."/>
law, and she must be equal to the emergency. Woman as she was, she must suffer everything and be silent - not from inhumanity, but because a woman capable of deciding to go alone in to such a region of darkness in quest of fortune, bearing with her the trusts of others, has first learned that the indispensable condition of success is thus closely to keep her own heart.</p>
                           <p>Day after day passed, and the poor man lingered here still. He was a stout
young man of thirty, like herself with some Dutch blood in his veins, though
American-born and reared, and her heart went out to him like a mother's. His rosy face seemed growing peaked and wan with the suspense, and as he sat near her at table, usually silent, but now and then speaking plaintively of his family, and the troublesome delay, with all his innocent hopes and regrets; it required all her strength of character to seem unconscious of the wrong, under such exceeding provocation.</p>
                           <p>She was silent, but at length she advised the man to hunt for work, telling the poor fellow that the time would hang less heavy on his hands if he had some thing to do. He might earn something to pay his way, and she would send him word the very first hour of the return of the office-holder for whom he waited. So he went to work with a somewhat lightened heart; for labor can buy food almost anywhere; and in due time, his business arranged, he left for home, still ignorant of the altogether unnecessary wrong which had been done him. How queerly people will look into each others faces one day when the curtains are all drawn aside!</p>
                           <p>So the winter passed, and though many another incident of fraud and outrage often sent her blood up to fever heat, word, and look, and manner, were all as quiet and even-toned as though she had been dwelling in a state of veritable hybernation.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband had the good sense to discriminate between the social deficiencies of the country at present, and its future moneyed prospects, and constantly consulting with the friends at home, very carefully on her representations did they all balance the question to settle or not to settle in this region of transient privations and permanent success to the enterprising.</p>
                           <p>But enterprise will thrive everywhere, and so they at last decided; believing
that the advantages were not sufficiently great to induce them to seek a residence here. So this Western episode in the history of our heroine proved to be only an episode. A vast and promising region of country bad been weighed in the balances of a market woman, and she had not found it all together wanting; but she discovered, as many wise men and women have before, that the ideal is often far more attractive than the reality. In her newspapers she had studied a

true picture of Oregon, but with the shadows thrown out. Besides the real sunshine there had an icy Northern tint.</p>
                           <p>In later years Mrs. Reband's eye always brightened, and a new elasticity came into her whole being, like a fresh wild breath, floating up from the wilderness of those sharp-leaved, evergreen experiences, whenever they were recalled to her memory.</p>

                           <head>CHAPTER XIV. CHANGES.</head>
                           <p>THE opening of the Spring market season found Mrs. Reband again in her accustomed place, little changed in any outward token by her journeyings. She and her neighbors had decided to continue for the present in their accustomed pursuits.</p>
                           <p>"I knew it would cost quite some money to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> them regions on the jumping off place, tother side," said one; "but to hear you tell over what you saw and how things were, makes me satisfied, for one, that I've got my money's worth. You go into it so in telling over things, Mrs. Reband, it kind a' makes a fellow's mouth water through, and most wish he had gone on there himself."</p>
                           <p>"If some of us had gone, though, it would have taken a good deal larger <hi rend="italic">pile</hi> I reckon;" said another. "There's smoking to do, and sometimes a little something warming needed after a hard jaunt. A woman manages to keep herself from getting chilled, with an extra shawl or so; and she buys them herself. I've been looking over the items and I've made up my mind it takes a woman to be economical, -- especially of other folks' money."</p>
                           <p>"Yes, theres no charge for extras!" said another, with a satisfied, still smile. "Nobody expected to be treated at our expense, it appears to me."</p>
                           <p>So with the universal vote of "satisfied," this incipient migration copartnership, like many other things before it, dissolved into thin air.</p>
                           <p>"I am, very glad you went, Susan, now that it is well over," said the husband privately; "just as one is always glad of a rather tough experience after
he has fairly done with it. 'All is well that ends well,' but if Australia or the Sahara Desert is to be investigated, hereafter, we must leave the young ones at home to look out for themselves; 'for whither thou goest, I will go.'"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, John," answered the wife. "The experience of one Winter apart is enough for either of us. It seems like getting home again at evening after an almost endless, tiresome day."</p>
                           <p>To fall back again into old quiet ways after a long interruption is always refreshing! The whole house seemed brighter and pleasanter than ever before, and every plant put out of doors grew green and vigorous in unwonted beauty. The daughter, singing again at her piano, as she used to in the old days, awoke perhaps sweeter chords in the maternal heart than had ever vibrated there before; and the prattle of children was enjoyed by the grandmother as it had hardly been in earlier days by the more care-burden mother. Are there rest periods in almost every life, when everything around moves on of itself harmoniously and the soul gathers up a latent strength for the future?</p>
                           <p>The months wore evenly on; but war clouds were brooding over the country, and the storm broke at length in awful wrath.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband's youngest son, like the child of many another mother, early enlisted as a volunteer in the defense of his country; and early was his young head laid low by the side of theirs in an ever honored grave. So the brightest
and best went out from half the households of the land, and many of them never came back again to us;. but I think there is a home somewhere under kindlier skies, where all these who willingly gave up father and mother and kindred may be gathered again -- a great household company of brothers, their robes made white and shining through the blood of self-sacrifice -- and that there they dwell together in the house of the Eternal Father.</p>
                           <p>But a chill had a settled in the mother's heart. When the boundary of life's successes has been fixed for one's self; and he knows that he shall never cross
over it in person, on this earth, how all his own withered possibilities seem sometimes to be gathered up and fastened trustfully to the destiny of another who shall stand as his representative. So Mrs. Reband had garnered up all her own highest unrealized ambitions and had laid these upon the altar of her future in that beloved youngest child. Now they were swept off with him into that great unknown; and while the mother's heart was bleeding for her boy, her hopes, her aims, and many of the proudest consolations of her toiling life lay all about her in ruins. There is no grief more unutterable than this -- no wonder it
seemed hard for her to be comforted! In one's own life, with its personal effort, one accepted failure, though it may grow deeply into the very heart, with exceeding anguish, is not yet irremediable. Prostrate hopes may rally again to a new purpose; and this time, warned by the past, with all the powers of one's being concentrated upon success, the end be more than realized. But to live after the very end and consummation of life has passed away -- ah, that is fearful!</p>
                           <p>"My daughter, I have a pain in your breast," said Madam De Stael. "My
<pb n="198 The Woman's Advocate."/>
son! my son! I have died in your death!" was the feeling of this mother who knew not how to be comforted.</p>
                           <p>But all the Heaven above us is one reservoir of dew to cool and moisten the fevered soul, and there is always balm in the storehouse of God's eternal love for his children. She came one day upon a little grandson who was weeping bitterly, curled up there alone by himself at the side of the house, the sleeve of his little checked apron wet with stifled tears.</p>
                           <p>"What is it, dear," she asked, sitting down by him in the sunshine and gathering the poor little face, so pitiful in its early grief, tenderly into her grandmotherly arms, while her own eyes rained afresh at the memory of another whom she had often folded thus to her mother's heart.</p>
                           <p>"See, grandmother my little cart is all broken! Uncle Henry gave it to me, and you know he never can give me another one," said the boy, sobbing afresh.</p>
                           <p>The grandmother sobbed too. She strained him to her breast till the child was pained and terrified. "You hurt me, grandmother," he said, gently; his eyes looking up to her pityingly, with his own grief absorbed in hers.</p>
                           <p>She noted it all, and felt her deepest sorrow changing into new love and new hope for this grandson; and when she rose up again it was with a feeling almost like that of a mother whom her child comforteth. There was a new glow in her midnight horizon -- a new star of promise arising for her in the East; and now she remembered again all the others who still clung to her love.</p>
                           <p>Again, she went daily to the market place, and when a customer came, served him promptly and willingly; but if no one was there to purchase, she sat poring over the morning papers to learn the last news from the seat of war; or the long, grey army sock grew rapidly under her busy fingers, though her grave, absorbed look often told you that her thoughts were far away. It was in this way that the whole nation read, and pondered, and toiled; few people meeting anywhere without exchanging thoughts upon the all absorbing topic. Yet everything went on as hitherto; and one attended to his farm, and another to his merchandise, throughout all the peaceful North. All the land was as sunny and the fields as deliciously green as ever; and if there were more tears and sadder faces, perhaps, also, smiles and irrepressible hopes oftener came uppermost. Our martyred President retailed unceasingly his fund of witty anecdotes, all through the war; making the people everywhere laugh with his humorous stories; but the undertone of pathos and tragedy were with him always. So he went up from the play-house to his last account, followed by the grateful reverence of every noble heart; for the people loved him and had rested in his integrity.</p>
                           <p>But now, while war yet raged, and Southern fields were crimson with the 
<pb n="199 The Market Woman."/>
blood of brothers, sickness came to the hearth-stone of the market woman, and death took from her a yet dearer treasure. The love and promise of a little child had been the silver lining to the black cloud of her first bereavement; but there could be no partaker of those innermost joys and sorrows, which the twain who were one had already shared together. A treasure house of sacred memories had belonged to them, and now to go in there alone, was the uttermost desolation.</p>
                           <p>If her best hopes had failed with her son, all her noblest moral instincts and her very conscience itself seemed now to have suffered loss. There are few men  or women who have learned habitually to practice highest disinterestedness; and when this great lesson has been learned till it seems easy as breathing, cold and weary seems the life that is left after the gentle exemplar has been taken from it. The form of everything abides; but everything is automatic. The best warmth in the sunshine has been taken away - all the freshness in the vital air has been consumed; yet some must bear even this.</p>
                           <p>When one has journeyed for over thirty years side by side with a help-mate whose arm was quick to save at every stumble, whose hand was ready to aid in every task, whose wisdom was able to counsel in every need; and whose love has been sun and shield in every emergency, he must either fall prostrate under the loss or gird himself anew to stand alone. It is a weakness to fall; it is the sudden snapping asunder of the bent bow; it is the fatal flaw which stands palpably revealed under the final test. It is a failure of character which is closely akin to moral guilt.</p>
                           <p>After the first shock was over and she realized that the husband of her youth had gone forward without her, and would not come back to her, the market woman returned to her vocation, and still held steadily on with all her accustomed pursuits. All the sweet memories of the past were still bleeding at every pore, and it was no time now to relinquish an occupation needed to fill her time and employ her thoughts. She had her recompense. Every measure of vegetables which she gave to a customer, unraveled a little thread of the great web of anguish which enveloped her. Every seed planted in her garden drew under with it an infinitesimal "wave length" of her sorrow. She found in gathering the fruits of the earth, that, to ripen is to absorb sunshine; which ripples out to you responsively at the gentlest touch. Everything returns to you as much as you give it but not the same in kind.</p>
                           <p>So she fought womanfully with life's sorrows as in earlier days she had fought with its privations, taking little thought for herself. Those years of her own and her country's trial wore slowly away. If the ordeal was severe, the gold was the
<pb n="200 The Woman's Advocate."/>
brighter when it came out again from the furnace. The cruel, uncivil war was ended, and in all the land there were no slaves. Time, pouring its oil and wine of healing into the hearts of all mourners, of which the whole country was full, remembered also the widowed market woman. Children and grandchildren yet remained to comfort her. Nature, who every year renews the youth and beauty of her great family of vegetable nurselings, has yet higher and holier gifts for all spring.</p>
                           <p>In the process of events, the office of the market woman was magnified in the eyes of many. Was she perpetually seeking a partnership; or was it only the partnerships that were perpetually seeking her? It is astonishing how many new enterprises yearn for the patronage of a rich widow! It must be the instinctive longing of the sucking child for its natural aliment -- the eager groping after the wanting feminine element in the out-of-doors, busy, masculine world.</p>
                           <p>"If a man leaves business," said a retired gentleman, "it is wonderful how in a few years reports of his almost fabulous riches spring up like evergreen cedars on a mountain clearing, and grow larger and larger every year. It is really uncomfortable. People build his air castles for him; and if anybody enjoys them, it certainly is not himself."</p>
                           <p>On the contrary, a woman out of business is no novelty; but a woman in business, making money solely on her own responsibility -- that is a circumstance worth noting. Her riches are the ever gathering snow-ball. It is setting up a new type in the general order of things; and possibly may involve results worth cultivating. Coal mines, oil-wells, patented rights, new inventions, fledgeling speculations, and joint stock concerns without number, fluttered to the feet of the market woman like young partridges, many of them still carrying their shells on their heads.</p>

                           <p>In the year 1869, a number of men and women were returning from a State gathering, which had drawn together people from every direction, through the influence of a common interest. At a little wayside depot, where change of cars was necessary, waited several women. One of them, wearing the "American costume" or short dress, was an Eclectic Medical Doctor, eager to battle with wrong in whatever form it happens to be manifest, and with all the zeal and intrepidity of Martin Luther. He that offendeth in one point is guilty of all, was
<pb n="201 The Market Woman."/>
a fundamental tenet of her creed; not one jot or tittle of it was to be overlooked or atoned for in her intent or purpose till all should be fulfilled. There also was our market woman, waiting with the rest. She wore a respectable black velvet bonnet, black cloak and dress, and inexpensive dark furs; and was, as it appeared, a stranger to all others.</p>
                           <p>"Woman can never be emancipated from custom or take her proper place in the world till she wears a healthful and convenient dress," said the Doctor.</p>
                           <p>"Can she never take her proper place in the world till she has done away with all evil?" asked a lady at the other side of the depot.</p>
                           <p>"True! she can't take it till then. But why not begin at once with a reform which we all see to be so plainly needed?"</p>
                           <p>"Because there are so many other plainly needed reforms, taking precedence even of this!"</p>
                           <p>"I don't see it!"</p>
                           <p>"The old Romans wore their graceful inconvenient togas and sandals, which suited them on the whole well enough; but the Anglo-Saxons, who had work to do, found for themselves a more fitting style of clothing. No Yankee would tolerate a dressing gown outside his study or his easy chair. So when woman finds her way into all the best fields of labor, she will discover also the best ways of doing her work, conveniences of dress included. Her style of wardrobe hitherto has not been <hi rend="italic">greatly</hi> unsuited to her general household vocations."</p>
                           <p>"Except the corsets! said the market woman, quietly.</p>
                           <p>"Except the corsets!" repeated the lady, smiling and bowing across to her. "That is an important exception; but corsets might be worn with a short dress, if women were still silly or uninstructed, and vain of a graceful figure. Tight lacing may accompany any style of dress -- even a dandy's stuffed waistcoat."</p>
                           <p>"That's so!" said the Doctor. "But you must keep to the point if you admit that women will sometime wear a more healthful style of dress, then why not begin at once? We ought to practice what we know, I think!"</p>
                           <p>"We ought to practice what we believe to be on the whole for all best and highest interests I think. A moral martyrdom may be worse than physical inconvenience! If one is crippled in influence or wounded in feeling every hour, because she adopts even the most sensible style of dress, perhaps she had better save her energies for more fundamental things to which dress is only the related outgrowth."</p>
                           <p>"Nothing is more fundamental than the care we take of the house we live" said the plucky little partisan, positively.</p>
                           <pb n="202 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"Nothing except the care we take of the real selves who live in these houses," answered the lady smiling.</p>
                           <p>Well! yes! I admit that of course, but a doctor has chosen as her especial vocation the care of the body. It is particularly fitting, isn't it, that she should wear a reform dress and so practice her own teachings?"</p>
                           <p>Her eyes turned to Mrs. Reband for an expression of opinion.</p>
                           <p>"I think that is consistent," replied the market woman. "She makes it her practical business, and is ready to carry it out in every point. I like that!"</p>
                           <p>"So do I. You may depend that nothing can be done till the reform dress is adopted. How can a woman work in a garden, in a draggling, long dress?"</p>
                           <p>"She must suffer some inconvenience from it, certainly!" said the market woman, with a peculiar but scarcely perceptible smile.</p>
                           <p>"She will never succeed as a gardener or a producer of any kind, never! She can't compete with man at all in that line, till her dress is equally convenient."</p>
                           <p>"Do you think so? I have worked in the garden more or less with tolerable success for a great many years; but I have never worn a short dress. The mothers always say that the clean dirt is healthy; and one needn't be afraid of the washtub."</p>
                           <p>But don't you know, then, if you have worked in a garden that a short dress would be an immense gain?"</p>
                           <p>Yes, I have no doubt it would."</p>
                           <p>"Then why not wear it?"</p>
                           <p>I think I would wear it, or try it, at least, if I was twenty-five years younger now than I am; but if I had worn such a dress twenty-five years ago it would certainly have proved a failure, or I should have been a failure, which every you please; because the world was not ready for the experiment then. Perhaps adapting one's self a little to circumstances is one pretty good test of practical wisdom."</p>
                           <p>"I should it a time-serving policy."</p>
                           <p>"Would you? Well, people differ. I should be afraid that style of dress would hardly answer in most communities, even now. One might feel compelled to wear it only in the garden, and in that case it would perhaps take too much time to so frequently change the dress throughout, I think."</p>
                           <p>"But why need you wish to wear it only in the garden?" persisted the practical little woman, heroically consistent to a fraction.</p>
                           <p>A train of cars came rushing up to the side of the depot at the instant.</p>
                           <p>"Excuse me! My car is here. I'll answer your question when we meet
<pb n="203 The Market Woman."/>
next, Doctor. Good morning!" and with a general, dignified bow to the other ladies, the market woman stepped into the car and was whirled on to her destination.</p>
                           <p>"Who is she? do you know?" was asked.</p>
                           <p>"I know about her," said a lady who had not spoken hitherto. "She is a widow, and she manages more than a hundred acres of land -- all of it worth at least a thousand dollars an acre, besides holding an enviable unknown quantity of greenbacks and government bonds; and they say she has earned the most of it herself, or at least largely through her own energy and management."</p>
                           <p>"Good!" said the Doctor. "She is the most remarkable woman amongst us. I thought so!"</p>
                           <p>"She is only a common market woman, though; and she has been selling her own vegetables for nearly forty years. My aunt lives in her neighborhood, and I have seen her often in the market, but she looked so different here I didn't know her till just as she went out."</p>
                           <p>"Tell us something about her!" was urged by several voices.</p>
                           <p>"I'll tell you a story - one my cousin told to me. It is not new, for I heard it first nearly twenty years ago; but it is one of the many that keep in circulation among her not too hero-worshiping towns-people; for I must warn you that she is not exceedingly popular at home."</p>
                           <p>"The best people seldom are!" said the Doctor, slipping in her protest edgewise; and calling up a general smile.</p>
                           <p>"A number of years ago, when her children were young, some one gave them each a pet lamb. The next year they had grown to be sheep and had to be sheared. They got them nicely washed, and had bought a new pair of sheep-shears. While Mrs. Reband was gone to the morning market, her husband got one of the sheep into the barn and began to snip. But he couldn't make the shears work, and the sheep wouldn't keep still, and altogether he had a wonderful time. He succeeded in getting the fleece off somehow at last; but in a generally forlorn and ragged state. He had managed to take one cut into the flesh of the sheep herself, and the sheep had managed to kick a piece of skin off the man's hand. so that they both left the field in a bleeding condition. Cousin Tom, coming from school at noon with the little Rebands, had heard of the expected sheep-shearing. When they came along the poor sheep was just turned out, a few odd tufts of wool sticking to her here and there, and a little red dribble had scattered a fine dash of crimson over one side; so, boy like, Tom stood by somewhere to see the fun, under cover I suppose; for it is understood that loiterers aren't generally wanted on these premises.</p>
                           <pb n="204 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                           <p>"Pretty soon Mrs. Reband came driving up in her market cart, and one of the children ran out crying 'Oh, mother! mother! father sheared my sheep, and it bit his hand.'</p>
                           <p>"'Bit him, did it?' she answered, laughing; as Mr. Reband himself appeared in the barn door. 'Then it has turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing, I suppose!'</p>
                           <p>"'Oh no, mother! It is my real lamb!'</p>
                           <p>"'Is it, dear! Well John!' she said, turning to her husband.</p>
                           <p>"'I've done my best, Susan; but that sheep of Baby's belongs to a kind that certain has got a cloven hoof,' holding up his bleeding hand.</p>
                           <p>"When the poor sheep herself came on to the scene, and the market woman's eye fell on it, they all looked so comically that cousin Tom said he had to run like a lamplighter to keep from explosion. So he lost the rest! But Tom learned that in the afternoon Mrs. Reband sheared the other two sheep herself, and the boy said <hi rend="italic">her</hi> fleeces came off 'tip-top.' The father's fleece they carded and spun themselves, and the mother braided the yarn and colored it in madder or blue dye, so that Tom said when it was knit it was clouded 'beautifully' and no other children wore stockings half as pretty as those made from the wool of Baby Reband's pet lamb.</p>
                           <p>"After that Mrs. Reband always sheared the sheep herself, as long as they kept sheep; and sometimes there were more than a dozen of them."</p>
                           <p>"Capital! I like that!" said the Doctor, sipping at her under lip in excessive delight.</p>
                           <p>"It is a good story, at least," said another.</p>
                           <p>"Her sheep-shearing is a fact, at any rate! She told my aunt that herself. Possibly cousin Tom may be responsible for a little coloring to embellish it with."</p>
                           <p>"What else can she do?"</p>
                           <p>"Anything, they say. If she was willing, like Barkis; and if she wasn't a little near, like him also, and would consent to invest her money in velvets and sables, her neighbors think that she could get an entrance into a Fifth Avenue palace almost any time. And they say she is rich enough, and clever enough, and enough of a lady when she chooses, to be a marked character and a leader even there. You have all seen her! She is much the same everywhere, I should judge. Change of dress may be a little puzzling at first; but she would have a personality of her own, whether in calico or in satin."</p>
                           <p>"Better and better! I knew she was a character!" cried the triumphant Doctor.</p>
                           <p>"She turns out to be another strictly American product," said the doctor's
<pb n="205 The Market Woman."/>
opponent on the dress question. "The Old World can produce fine women; but it could hardly manufacture exactly such a specimen, I think."</p>
                           <p>"Yes," said the story-teller laughing. "She is indigenous to the American Nineteenth Century; as adapted to it as Indian corn was to Indian agriculture in the time of the savages."</p>
                           <p>The rumbling up of another train on the instant broke up the conference.</p>

                           <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband is still as punctual as the town clock, at her daily post in the market. A little excursion now and then, sometimes to an agricultural fair,-- where her woman's eye scrutinizes new agricultural implements with the practical zest of one personally interested and often a purchaser, -- or to some locality or gathering of special interest, seems to be recreation enough. Her work is her meat and drink; necessary to the health of both body and soul.</p>
                           <p>With the instinct of self-protection, she is still keeping out intruders from her own personal domain; though they crowd about her on every side. Like many another, wedded to a life-long calling which has grown to be a second nature, she still pushes back the evil day which she knows is surely approaching, when she will feel bound to give it up. The old house where she went as a bride, to her is home still. No other can ever be like it. She has never lived upon the surface of things, and display, a besetting sin of the nation, is not one of her failings., Her nature is reticent and self-contained.</p>
                           <p>"We don't want strangers, with ways different from ours, overlooking us!" she once said to a friend. "I shan't sell to any one while we are still working the farm; but I think I have sold vegetables enough to know how to dispose of my land when the time comes. Then I shall make that a business!"</p>
                           <p>It is even rumored that the market woman is getting especially interested in Ruskin, Downing, and Mitchell; and that her eyes become particularly sharp-sighted and luminous whenever she passes a country villa, or a green little park, or any bit of ornamental grounds. Success to her, whether she still fights out the battle of life on the old line to the end, or having already conquered success to the utmost in that department, she again sets out, like General Grant, on a new tack! They both get pushed into the new position by new conditions outside of their original intent; but we may hope they will both prove grandly equal to all new emergencies.</p>
                           <p>Mrs. Reband's past is history; but I have no intention of playing Paul Pry to her future plans or visions, if she has any. We will await their development.</p>

                        <head>THIRD PAPER.</head>
                        <p>IN the legislation concerning Woman, which has so marked the legal history of our country, her status has been more directly and more rapidly advanced. The hesitating, negative way of considering the subject, so characteristic of former times, has given place to a firmer and more positive manner in its investigation and treatment. One of the reasons for this difference of procedure grows out of the entanglement of rules brought about by the old method of fiction and subterfuge, by which it was attempted to disguise the fact that any change was taking place. When, as time passes by, a change of this nature is seen in all its bearings, bound up as it is in a mass of complex and contradictory rules, there being no longer any question as to the fact of a complete alteration, it is natural for men to begin to conform to the situation thus forced upon them, and to attempt to reduce it to a more practical shape. And it will be seen that many of the legislative acts are of this nature. Another cause is found in the tide of agitation which has so swept over the country in the past few years. By this the question was made to become one no longer to be avoided or treated with ridicule, but one to be fairly and squarely met. So long as it had no candid hearing, its appearance was dark and forbidding, but no sooner was it subjected to earnest discussion, than it began to wear an entirely different aspect. The real position of woman had never been fully realized. It was needed only to let in the light of reason upon its long pent-up darkness, revealing the full weight of the legal chains with which Woman had so long been bound, in order to work a revolution in the public mind, which could but react upon the law. Her disabilities have therefore been removed with a rapidity startling to conservative minds. To them it either appears plain that "one of the greatest safeguards to a complete unity of sentiments, of hopes, of plans, and of labors, is utterly destroyed,"
<pb n="208 The Woman's Advocate."/>
or seems a matter of grave doubt "Whether the statute law has not, in its desire to protect the property of married women, carried the doctrine too far, and given to the wife too much individuality." The progress made by legislation, however, would seem not to have been "too far," but considerably short of far enough. It has been but a struggling onward in the old path, the struggle being favored by the circumstances accompanying a higher civilization.</p>
                        <p>It will be instructive, at this point, to notice some of the general features of the legislative changes, as illustrating the course of progress, preserving to some extent the dates of these changes, as showing how closely they followed public agitation of the subject. The general tenor of the legislation in the various States is not essentially different, except in the degree of advancement; and that of one State, therefore, may be safely taken as illustrative of the whole. Reference here will be had particularly to the legislation of Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>Innovations have always been made first on behalf of the wife living alone. Courts had found this feature of the question a difficult one to deal with: and the harshness with which the strict and logical application of the old rules grated on the feelings of the people is pointedly shown in the words of that great and equitable judge, Chief-Justice Parker. After commenting on the results to the wife if not allowed to act for herself while living separate and apart from her husband, he says: "If the Common Law allows all this, and there is no relief except by application to a court of Equity, the Common law is indeed most impotent, and where there is no court of Equity, as there is not with us for this purpose, the system is most iniquitous." We naturally expect to find, then, early in the legislative history, acts relative to this feature; and such acts form an important link in the chain of progress.</p>
                        <p>In three cases they provide that a married woman may act as if she were unmarried: first, when the husband absents himself from the State, leaving his wife -- which received attention as early as 1787, and was more fully considered in the revision of statutes in 1835; second, when a married woman comes into the State without her husband -- which was adopted in the revision of 1835, it being thought, "in such case to be an inconvenience to her, and a hardship to those who dealt with her," if she could not act for herself; and third, when the husband is confined in
<pb n="209 The Legal Status of Women."/>
prison -- which was brought out by the discussion in the committee to receive the Reviser's Report. In two of the above cases an application to the court and permission by it was required in order that the wife might thus act.</p>
                        <p>These provisions, as laid down by the legislature and carried out by the courts, gave individuality to the married woman when living alone; and they were but an inauguration of still wider changes.</p>
                        <p>The next legislation was directed towards enabling the wife to hold and manage property in her own right, without the intervention of third parties, and in so far to be distinct before the law from her husband; thus following out the wish to secure the wife in a support without total <sic>dependance</sic> on her husband. Of these provisions we may notice those --</p>
                        <p>First, as to the <hi rend="italic">holding of property</hi>. Acts of 1845, ch. 208, made it legal for a married woman to hold to her sole and separate use: 1st. Property which she owned at the time of her marriage, in accordance with the terms of any contract which the parties might then enter into, (and acts of 1858 included the husband's property as well as that of the wife); and 2d. Any property which might be given to her by any person, other than her husband. This, it will be seen, was a simplifying of the rules of a prior innovation, by making legal what was previously done under the equitable doctrine of trusts. There was a further extension of this principle of innovation, by acts of 1855, ch. 304, in favor of women <hi rend="italic">"hereafter married."</hi> By these acts: 1st. All property owned by her at the time of her marriage, and the profits thereof; and 2d. Any property which she might acquire, either by descent, devise, or bequest, or the gift of any person -- except the husband, or in any business, labor or services, carried on on her sole and separate account, was made her separate, individual property, free from the control of her husband. Acts of 1857, ch. 249, go still further, and-provide that all property which any married woman owns as her separate property, and any acquired in the ways before mentioned, shall belong to her free from her husband and his debts. By the revision of 1858 the word "grant" was added to the terms expressing the manner in which she could acquire separate property, "thus putting," as the commissioners say, "conveyances to her on the same ground as devises, bequests and gifts."</p>
                        <pb n="210 The Woman's Advocate."/>
                        <p>Second, as to her <hi rend="italic">management and disposition of property</hi>. The revision of 1835 permitted a married woman to convey property held in her own right by a joint deed with her husband -- thus incorporating into statute law an usage which had sprung up as an outgrowth from the old fine and recovery, and which Mr. Reed, the first lawyer of his time, resolved into <hi rend="italic">New England</hi> Common Law. Acts of 1842, ch.74, permitted a married woman to dispose of her property by will -- her husband giving his consent thereto in writing. The courts having construed this as not allowing her to will property to her husband, acts of 1850, ch. 200, did away with this restriction. Acts of 1845, ch. 208, gave her the same rights over her separate property as if she were unmarried -- adding the rather broad qualifying clause, that she should use it in no business, but only in the ways specified in the act, which were investments in certain leading securities. Acts of 1865, ch. 304, went further and removed the restriction as to business, but required her to obtain her husband's (or the court's) consent to certain most important transactions, as conveyances of real estate and corporation shares. Acts of 1862, ch. 198, regulate her business rights to a certain extent; and acts of 1863, ch. 165, take quite a step backward and prohibit her from entering into partnership with any person.</p>
                        <p>The object of all this legislation is, as is well stated by Hoar J., (in Stewart v. Jenkins, 6 All. 301) "to protect the property of married women by removing it from the control of their husbands; relieving it from liability for their husband's debts; enabling them to hold and manage it without the intervention of trustees and securing to them the proceeds of their own industry, skill and capacity for business."</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that this legislation allows married women to act only on the basis of a separate property, and confers no general power upon her to act as an individual. Her disabilities in this respect remain, and their removal comes latest among the innovations. There is a reluctance to yield, to this extent, to old-time customs and prejudices, though that yielding has begun. Thus, acts of 1869, ch. 409, allow a married woman to act as executrix, administratrix, guardian or trustee, as if she were sole, and the marriage of a single woman acting in those capacities will not extinguish her authority; and ch. 292 further provides that any married woman may contract for necessaries for herself and
<pb n="211 The Legal Status of Woman."/>
family and sue and be sued thereon as if she were sole. And some
States have gone further than this, as, for example, Maine, in which
State, by acts of 1866, partied women may make any contract not unlawful in its nature.</p>
                        <p>As these various changes bring married and single women more on a legal  status of equality, recognizing their private rights, the Woman receives an impetus which carries it forward into the domain of rights of a more public nature. For instance, acts of 1869, ch. 346 recognize the right of women to become members of any parish or religious society, and to have therein "all the rights and privileges of men." Public institutions are everywhere slowly opening their doors; and still further on is legislation tending towards the position where Wyoming led the way.</p>
                        <p>In all this we see the legal status of Woman being constantly pruned of the disabilities clinging to it from its connection with the ancient power; and opposers of change are tremblingly asking, Is not that enough? Can we give to Woman more without endangering the domestic relations? But most emphatic is the answer that the end is not yet. Everything shows the status of Woman to be in a shifting and imperfect state, and to require something further. As the law now stands no one position is fairly taken. We speak of the wife's being allowed freely to hold property, but there is much room for the application of the remark of the Supreme Court of Alabama in a recent case, that "the separate property which a married woman is allowed to hold cannot be said to be her separate property in its <hi rend="italic">broadest sense</hi>." So there is neither freedom n woman's acting for herself or in others acting for her. In the exceptional cases which are included in her legal sphere of separate action,
there is connected a <hi rend="italic">protective policy</hi> which keeps her in a perpetual state of <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> guardianship. When she wishes to act, she must either get permission of the court or of her husband in most important transactions. And even the courts are not able to agree as to what cases come within her sphere, much less can the parties themselves know. So simple a matter as an ordinary promissory note, raises questions as to her rights which need the greatest legal acumen to settle, and then the settlement never seems satisfactory. As the effects of isolated changes work themselves out through all the details of the law, its imperfections
<pb n="212 The Woman's Advocate."/>
become realized to a painful extent. Old and new rules are so commingled that there seems to be no sound reason for anything. The wife's rights, as compared with those of the husband, over children; to property on death or divorce; of inheritance and the like, are such as to constantly work hardship, and yet they remain so. Remedies by and against her are such that they oftentimes scarcely deserve the name. In short, her legal rights and duties are becoming so unsettled, as to make it almost impossible to tell where they begin or where they end.</p>
                        <p>The old order of things had at least the advantage of being thoroughly systematized. But legislation, in attempting to remedy the defects of that system, by acts resting on no particular principle, but occasional, fragmentary and partial, is bringing us to a condition of having no system at all. The difficulty of such acts is pointedly shown in the words of Davis, J., (in Brookings v. White, 49 Me. 485). He says: "A partial enfranchisement of the wife, while the common law relations between her and the husband remain unchanged, is an innovation that unsettles the past without settling the future. The status of the <hi rend="italic">feme covert</hi>, instead of being fixed by such legislation, becomes a difficult question for the judiciary. It imposes the task of adjusting new rights to old and still existing disabilities." Such is the necessary result of the course which has been and is being followed. We might apply the words which Emerson uses with reference to "Domestic Life": "Certainly, if we begin by reforming particulars of our present state, correcting a few evils and letting the rest stand, we shall soon give up in despair." Something broader and deeper is needed; some principle which shall bind this chaotic mass into one harmonious whole. What ought that principle be? Perhaps we may venture a few suggestions as to the answer in a concluding paper.</p>

                        <docDate>NO. V. May, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                        <p>THE question is sometimes asked: "Why is it that woman has ever been subject to man? What cause induced him to rule over her?"</p>
                        <p>The reason is probably this. In the early ages of the world, the mind
was comparatively dormant, and physical force bore sway. Men and women, in the savage state, roamed through woods and over mountains in companies, in quest of food. Sometimes these companies would be separated for years. Then, having lost the memory of others besides themselves, a casual meeting of strange parties would occasion fear in the bosoms of these wild people. Wrangling and strife followed, and the men being stronger and more combative than the women, they fell upon and destroyed each other, possessing themselves of the spoils. This aroused their cupidity, and war became an art, in which each tried to excel the other.</p>
                        <p>Then, becoming robbers, they built strongholds, from which they could see a weaker party from afar, and sallying out, slay him, and enrich themselves with his substance. This was the case in Europe in the Dark Ages; in the times of the Barons and their clans. It is still the state of things among the Tartar and Arab tribes. The will of the stronger is the only law; violence and crime the result.</p>
                        <p>Woman was an important item in the list of spoils. Being endowed by Nature with the ability to create and rear living beings, she had little leisure and less inclination for war. She, the giver of life, was utterly opposed to war, the destroyer of life, and she shrank from it with her whole being. When her father and husband were cut down by a hostile band, she had not the same power or motion to resist. She knew that her death would not necessarily follow. The conqueror, charmed by her beauty, promised not only her life, but that of her children, and maternal love prevailing, she yielded without opposition. It soon became a matter of course, that whenever a victory occurred, the conqueror should spare the women and children as a part of the plunder. Then they naturally awaited the result, away from the field of battle.</p>
                        <p>But women at length became very numerous, in comparison with their
conquerors, and it was necessary to contrive some means to keep them in subjection. They were forbidden, under pain of death, to touch any kind if weapon. Completely in the power of their masters, they were subject to a thousand restrictions and indignities. Some had their feet crippled; some were closely confined, or allowed to go out only with their faces covered; while they were compelled, not only to bear chil-
<pb n="214 The Woman's Advocate."/>
dren, but to perform all the manual labor, and execute the most menial services for their lords and husbands.</p>
                        <p>Soon they became a source of great power for their masters. They reared sons, and he sent them to subdue his enemies and increase his possessions. They reared daughters, and he sold them to the highest bidder or gave them as presents to those whom he wished to favor or conciliate.</p>
                        <p>And thus woman lived on and on through centuries of untold suffering, thrust back into the darkest corner to be found, every avenue by which the light might reach her carefully guarded, lest perchance she might presume to compare herself favorably with man, or see to learn a letter of the alphabet.</p>
                        <p>And yet, and in the midst of all this degradation and misery, man must have been conscious of her fine moral nature, her delicate tastes and high spiritual aspirations. Else why should he have embodied Justice and Wisdom and Liberty and all the excellencies and graces of Humanity in the female form? Why has he ever had a Vishnu, an Isis and a Madonna to whom to bow down in adoration and love?</p>
                        <p>Because the spiritual part of his being has recognized the divinity of hers, and thus rendered to it a touching and timely tribute. Because his <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> nature has ever acknowledged woman to be his equal; a sacred and beautiful part of the race.</p>
                        <p>Burns expresses this feeling, that like a thread of gold gleams in the dark and sombre woof of by-gone ages I, when he says: --</p>
                        <p>
                           <q direct="unspecified">
                              <hi rend="center">His prentice hand he tried on man,<lb/>
And then he made the lasses, O."</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, through all the dismal past, God has never left woman without a living witness of her own nobility and inherent power. Thus man has been compelled to do homage to the divinity of her nature, even while she has been degraded by his selfishness and sensuality.</p>

                           <docDate>NO. V. May, 1870. VOL. III.</docDate>
                           <p>THE present(May) number is the last that will be issued of THE WOMAN'S ADV0CATE. In lieu thereof its subscribers will receive for the unexpired time of their subscriptions THE STANDARD, a new Monthly, a successor of the long established, excellent weekly journal known as THE NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD.</p>
                           <p>In making the announcement of this important change, which will come as a surprise to many of the warm friends of THE ADVOCATE, we desire to say that in taking this step, as in our conduct of the magazine since its establishment, we have studied what we have conceived to be alike the best interests of the cause and the wishes of the devoted friends who all throughout, in unstinted measure, have lent THE ADVOCATE countenance and co-operation.</p>
                           <p>Very different now is the phase worn by the cause of Woman's enfranchisement from what it was when, well-nigh a year and a half ago, we issued the first number of THE ADVOCATE. Then the number who cared to identify themselves with Woman Suffrage, -- with the agitation of the question by journals or conventions, -- were comparatively few. When, almost unaided, animated by a desire to serve the cause, we deliberated the problem of a journal which should seek to give expression to the best thought of Man and Woman concerning a question we deemed vital and for which the hour of discussion had arrived, with one exception (<hi rend="italic">The Revolution</hi>, in this city) we were the pioneer<ref target="wa.wa3.5.n1">*</ref>journal. Conventions then were rare. In no State was there an organization. A few earnest spirits -- the early apostles of the cause -- rarely endowed and baptized to the work, were indefatigable in their exertions, but, as for long years, their most persuasive words were powerless to break the spell of indifference. But a marvellous change has occurred within that brief period. A revolution in public opinion has been witnessed which
<note id="wa.wa3.5.n1" anchored="yes">
                                 <hi rend="italic">The Woman's Advocate</hi> (Dayton, Ohio) was established about the same period.</note> 
                              <pb n="217 Editorial Department."/>
a century in an earlier period of the world's history might not have effected.
No longer is the ark of Woman's Liberty confided to a few. Her champions number thousands -- a Grand Army, comprising not only the Old Guard of veteran men and women, but countless new recruits, Representatives, Governors, Judges, women of letters and of fashion, the <hi rend="italic">elite</hi> of the land. The press of the country is open to the consideration of the once despised question; the halls of legislation, State and National, resound with its discussion. Nor is it an abstract, theoretical question merely. It has fairly entered into politics. Wyoming, infant Territory of the West, where woman is a voter, sends greeting to Vermont, bidding one of the oldest States of the East come up to her level, meting out justice to all her citizens, irrespective of sex. Between the surf of the Atlantic and the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains there is scarcely a State in which there is not an organization for the agitation of the question of woman's enfranchisement or some measure pending before its petition- besieged Legislature.</p>
                           <p>In all this we see abundant cause for congratulation. Our heart, in common with thousands, goes out in gratitude for the wondrous change which marks a New Era in our history -- an entire revolution in politics. For the time and means we have given, -- cheered at every step by the heart outpouring of the well-wishers of the cause, and the consciousness of the measure of good exerted, -- we have no regret.</p>
                           <p>In making a disposition of THE ADVOCATE, we have borne in mind only the good of the cause, and what we have deemed would be most in consonance with the wishes of our constituency. THE STANDARD which, as a weekly journal, under the administration of its well-known editor, AARON M. POWELL, and the ringing, outspoken utterances of WENDELL PHILLIPS, aided by a host of talented contributors, has been a power in the land, doing more, probably, to mould public opinion and affect legislation than any other journal, in its new form as a monthly will lose none of its intrinsic merit or national significance. Relieved by the abolishment of slavery and the subsequent legislation from its specific work of watching over the interests of the colored people, THE STANDARD as an independent magazine, will entertain the great questions of the Abolishment of Caste, Equality of Woman, Temperance, Labor, etc., lending generous countenance to each. With
<pb n="218 The Woman's Advocate."/>
its old array of talent pledged to the new enterprise, with new contributors secured, THE STANDARD cannot fail to take a high position among American magazines and be abundantly satisfying, both by quality and increased quantity of matter, to the subscribers of THE ADVOCATE.</p>
                           <p>Grateful beyond measure to known and unknown friends who have gone with us thus far in our undertaking - whose generous word and unswerving countenance has lightened oft our arduous labors, enabling us in the bonds of love to do what we have for a common cause, reluctantly, yet filled with the assurance that ours is to be no final separation, we say FAREWELL!</p>
