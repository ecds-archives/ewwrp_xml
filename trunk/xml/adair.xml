               <l n="1">Here's to Tahlequah with her wooded hills,</l>
               <l>Her sparkling springs and tinkling rills,</l>
               <l>Her rocky cliffs by ferns o'ergrown,</l>
               <l>And her shady nooks by lovers known:</l>
               <l>Her maidens fair and cultured dames,</l>
               <l>And gifted sons of illustrious names.</l>
               <l>He who drinks of the waters of these lipid [sic] springs;</l>
               <l>Though far he may wander fond memory brings</l>
               <l>Sweet thoughts of the village taat [sic] nestles serene,</l>
               <l>So tranquil and lovely like an enchanted scene;</l>
               <l>Visions of beauty he long will retain,</l>
               <l>And in dreams will he oft visit Tahlequah again.</l>
               <l>About her foothills of the Ozark rise,</l>
               <l>Like a gem surrounded by her setting she lies,</l>
               <l>Near by flows the Illinois-a srystal [sic] stream,</l>
               <l>Brightly the waters o'er its pebbly bed gleam.</l>
               <l>He who loves the beautiful, along its banks may find</l>
               <l>Many a picturesque spot to delight the mind.</l>
               <l>You should see Tahlequah in the month of May,</l>
               <l>When nature has dooned [sic] her brightest array,</l>
               <l>When incense, borne by the perfumed breeze,</l>
               <l>That blows through the snow-white locust trees,</l>
               <l>Around the quaint old capital square,</l>
               <l>Floats out upon the warm sweet air;</l>
               <l>When the emerald sward is bedecked wtih [sic] flowers</l>
               <l>And the birds sing in their leafy bowers,</l>
               <pb n="4"/>
               <l>And the voice of the school children on the street,</l>
               <l>Fall [sic] upon the ear like music sweet.</l>
               <l>Many a Tahlequah family its lineage traces</l>
               <l>Back to old England's proudest races,</l>
               <l>For many a noble, to hide his head,</l>
               <l>In Cromwell's time, to America fled,</l>
               <l>And by the Cherokees were made welcome</l>
               <l>To dwell with them in their forest home.</l>
               <l>And in the days when revolutionary strife</l>
               <l>Often endangered the royalists [sic] life,</l>
               <l>Over the mountains of Tennessee,</l>
               <l>The Tory came to dwell with the Cherokee:</l>
               <l>For during that period the Indians were loyal</l>
               <l>To the British crown and the family royal.</l>
               <l>The same that Cherokee history adorn,</l>
               <l>Were not assumed, but were  proudly borne,</l>
               <l>By descendants of these old English sires,</l>
               <l>Who safety sought at the Cherokee camp fires.</l>
               <l>The name Tahlequah to this town was given</l>
               <l>By the old Cherokees, when they were driven</l>
               <l>From their eastern homes, afar to the west,</l>
               <l>Till they reached this dear spot, "A haven of rest,"</l>
               <l>Poor, sorrowing exiles, of their homes bereft</l>
               <l>Grieving for the fire-sides which they had left.</l>
               <l>God who takes care of those whom the strong oppress,</l>
               <l>And pities them in their sore distress</l>
               <l>Brought it to pass, that the land of the given,</l>
               <l>By treaty as sacred and solemn as Heaven</l>
               <l>Was better than that of which they had been despoiled,</l>
               <l>Little the white brothers knew of this land</l>
               <l>Which they gave to the remnant of this proud band.</l>
               <l>Knew naught of the mineral wealth which hides</l>
               <l>Its bounteous stores in the mountain sides;</l>
               <l>Naught of the verdant fruitful plants,</l>
               <l>Nor the varied resources this country contains.</l>
               <l>Here the Cherokee rested, their long journey o'er,</l>
               <l>And this wildwood was given to be theirs evermore,</l>
               <l>Here they made the council-ground.</l>
               <l>And here their Kihegas oft were found</l>
               <l>In solemn assembly and council grave;</l>
               <l>When laws to govern the nation they gave,</l>
               <l>Here, Sequoyah, the Cadmus, his alpabet [sic] brought,</l>
               <l>Whcih [sic] with infinite patience and skill he wrought,</l>
               <l>Schools were established to teach the youth</l>
               <l>And churches, to spread Christainity's [sic] truth.</l>
               <l>Soon the wilderness was made to bloom</l>
               <l>As homes were bulit [sic] dispelled its gloom.</l>
               <l>And the town by the little woodland stream</l>
               <l>Threw its light afar, like a diamond's gleam.</l>
               <l>Such was the birth of this historic town,</l>
               <l>Which for her beauty is of wide renown,</l>
               <l>For her fountains that gush from the rough hillside,</l>
               <l>And her halls of learning, the Nation's pride.</l>
               <l>Like Athens of old, she is of learning the seat,</l>
               <l>So peaceful and quiet, a sylvan retreat.</l>
