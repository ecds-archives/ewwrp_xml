	<l>This day will our hearts ever cherish,</l>
	<l>Fond thoughts of the brave and the true,</l>
	<l>May their fame, and their glory ne'er perish,</l>
	<l>For memory shall bring them to view,</l>
	<l>Gather chaplets of lilies and roses,</l>
	<l>And laurels they won on the field,</l>
	<l>And place them where valor reposes</l>
	<l>Bright honon illumined their shield.</l>
