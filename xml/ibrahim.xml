<head>THE PREFACE.</head>
<p rend="italic">I Do not know what kind of praise the Antients thought they
gave to that Painter, who not able to end his work, finished
it accidently by throwing his pencill against his Picture; but
I know very well, that it should not have obliged me, and
that should have taken it rather for a Satyre, than an Elogium. The operations of the spirit are too important to be left
to the conduct of chance, and I had rather bee accused
for fayling out of knowledge, than for doing well without minding it. There is
nothing which temeritie doth not undertake, and which fortune doth not bring
to passe; but when a man relyes on those two guides, if he doth not erre, hee
may erre; and of this sort, even when the events are successfull no glory is
merited thereby. Every art hath its certain rules, which by infallible meanes
lead to the ends propofed; and provided that an Architect takes his measures right, he is assured of the beauty of his building. Beleeve not for all this,
Reader, that I will conclude from thence my work, is compleate, because I have
followed the rules which may render it so; I know that it is of this labour, as
of the Mathematicall Sciences, where the opperation may fail, but the art doth
never fail; nor doe I make this discourse but to shew you, that is I have lest
some faults in my Book, they are the effects of my weakeness, and not of my
negligence. Suffer mee then to discover unto you all the resorts of this
frame, and let you see, is not all that I have done, at leastwise all that I have
indevored to doe.

<p>one,and theseverallHisiories in the other,are not rather beauties, than clesSs-^
but it is alwaies necessdry, that the adress of him which imployes themstjould
hddthem in some fort to this principall a&amp;ion., to the end, that by this inge¬
nious concatenation, all the parts of themsould makg but one body, and that
nothing may be seen in them which is loofe and unprofitable. Thus the mi-
riage of my JuiWnhno and his Isabeila, being the obJe3 which ihavepropo-
sed unto my s els, I have imployed all my care so to doc, that all the parts of my
W9rk.may tend to that conclusion:^that there may be asirong connexion between
them 5 and that,except t1oe objlacle which fortune oppofeth to the desires of my
Herofjd// things may advance,or at lestwise indeavor to advance his mortage
which is the end of my labor.Now thofe great Geniuss'es of antiquity, from who
I borrow my light,knowing that well-ordering is one of the principall parts of
apiece,have given so excellent a one to their speakjng pi^ures,thjt it would bg
as much siupididitie,as pride,not to imitate them.1 hey have not done like thofe
Vainters,who present in one and the same cloth a Prince in the Cradle,upon the
Throne,&lt;d^ in the Tombe,perplexing, by this so little judicious a consusionjnm,
that considers their workssbut with an incomparable adres they begin their Hi~
Jiory in the middle,s0 to give some suspence to the Reader,even from thesirstd'
pening of the book.^ and to consine themselves mthin reasonable bounds they
have made the Hijiory (^as I likewise have done aster them J not to laji above a.
year, the reji being delivered bj narration. Thus all things being ingeniously
placed^ and of a juji greatness, no doubt but pleasure will redoundfrom thence
to him that beholds them, and glory to him that hath done them. But amongsi
all the rules which are to be observed in the compofition ofthese workes, that of
true resemblance is without queliion the mofi necessary 5 it is, as it were, the
sundament all jione of this building, and bttt upon which it cannot subsijl;
without it nothing can move, without it nothing can please : andisthischar-
mingdeceiver doth not beguile the mind in Romanzes, this l(ind of reading
disunsts, injiead of intertainingit : I have labored then never to eloigue my
selsfrom it, and to that purpofe I have observed the manners, cujiomes , Rdi-
gions and inclinations of people : And to give a more true resemblance to
things, I have made the soundations of my work.Hijloricall, my principall per-
sonages such as are marked out in the true History for illusirzous persons, and
the warres esse&amp;ive. This is the way doubtless, whereby one may arrive at his
end'-, for when as salshood and truth are consounded by adextrus hand, wit
hath much adoe to disintangle them, and is not easily carried to dejiroy that
which pleaseth it 5 cont rarity, when as invention doth not make use of this ar¬
tisice ^and thatsalshood is produced openly,this grofs untruth makes no impres-
(ionin the soul, nor gives any delight: As indeed how ssjould I bee touched
with the misfortunes of the ^een of Gundaya, and of the King of Astroba-
cia when as I know their very Kingdomes are not in the Vniversall Mapp, or,
to say better, in the being of things ? But this is not the only deseB which
may carry us from true resemblance, for we have at other times seen Roman-
zes whichset before ut mongers, in thinking to let us see Miracles j their Au¬
thors by adhering too much to wonders have made Grotesques, which have not
a little of the visions of a burning Seaver 5 and one might demand ofthese

clear (Idieted as it is,could never discover their retreat. Howbeit I pretend not
hereby to banisi) shipwrackj from Romanzes, I approve of them in the worker
of others, and make use of them in mine'^ I know likewise, that the Sea is the
Scene mofi proper to make greit changes in, and that some have named it the
Theater ofinconstancie 5 but as all excess is vicious,! have made use of it but
s}ioderately,fortoconservetrueresembling'.siowthe same destgn is thecause
also, that my Herof is not ofpressed with juch a prodigious quantity of acci"
dents   as arrive ttnto some others, for that according tomysense, the same is
sar from true resemblance,the lise of no man having ever beenso croft. It would
be better in my oppinion to separate the adventures , to form divers Histories
of them, and to make persons aBing, thereby to appear both sertile, and judi¬
cious together, and to be si:ill within this so necessary true resemblance. And
indeed they who have made one man alone deseat whole Armies,have forgotten
the Proverb iv/j/V/j/^///.), not one against two ^ and know not that antiqnitie
doth assure us, how Hercules would m that casi be too weak..  It is without all
doubt, that to represtnt a true heroicall courage, oneshould make it execute some
thing extraordinary, as it were by a transpert of the Herof 5 but he must not
continue in that fort, for so thofe incredible anions would degenerate into ri¬
diculous sables,and never move the mind. This sault is the cause also of com-
milting another -^ for they which doe nothing but heap adventure upon adven¬
ture, without ornament,and withcut stirringup pajsions by the artisices ofRhe-
toriquc, are irkesome, in thinking to be the more mtertayning. This dry nar¬
ration, and without art, hath more of an old Chronicle, than of a Romanze
which may very well be imbelistjed with thofe ornaments, stnce Hisiory, as sc-
vere andscrupulous as it is, doth not forbe ir imploying them.   Certain Au^

<p>For how can I tell, whether in thest events fortune hath not done as much as
he } whether his valor be not a brutish valor ? and whether he bath born the
misfortunes that arrived unto him, as a worthy mansijould doe ? it is not by
things without him^ it is net by the caprichioes of dcstinie, that I will jndge of
him 5 7t ii by the motions of his soul, and by that which hespeaketh. I honor
all them that write at this day 5 / know their persous, their workes, their me¬
rit s'-, but as canoniZsing is for none but the dead, they will not take it ill is I doe
not deisie them, since they are living. And in this occasion Ipropofe no other
ex ample,than the great and incomparable Urse, certainly it musi be acknow¬
ledged that he hath merited his reputation 3 that the love which all the earth
beares him isjust 5 and that so many disserent Nations, which have translatcd
his Bookinto their tongues, had reason to doe it ' as for me,lconsess openly,
that I am his adorer 5 these twentyyeares I have loved him 3 he is indeed ad¬
mirable over all'-) he it sertile in his inventions, and in inventious reasonable ;
every thing in him is mervailous, every thing in him is excellent 3 and that
which is more important, every thing in him is naturall,and truly resembling :
"But amongst many rare matters, that which I moft esteem of is, that he knowes
how to touch the passionsso delicately, that he may be called the Painter of the
soul'-) hee goes searching out in the bottom of hearts the moft secret thoughes^
and in the diversity of natures, which he represents , every one sindes his own
pourtrait,so that

Certainly there is nothingmore important in this kjnde of compofition,
thanstrongly to imprint the idea, or (to say better) the image of the Heroes
in the minde of the Reader, but in such fort, as is they were known to them'-^for
that it is which interesseth him in their adventures,d^ from thence his delight
commeth , now to make them be knorvn persectly, it is notjussicient to say how
many times   they have sussered sijipwracki and how times they have in-
countred robbers, but their inclinations must be made to appear by their
discourse :   otherwise one may rightly apply to these  dumb Heroes that
excellent mot to of Antiquity, Speakethat I may see thee.   And ts smm

manners , goejrom the pleasant to] the profitable, and from delight to ex¬
ample,! am to tell you. Reader, that here vertue is seen to bee alwaies recom-
penced, and vice alwaies punisiied, is he that hath sollowed his owne unruliness
hath not by ajust andsensible repentance obtained grace from Heaven'-, to which
purpofe I have also observed equality of manners in all the persons that do a£s,
unless it be whereas they are difordered by passious, and touched with remorse.
J have bad a care likewise to deal in such fort, as the saults, which great ones
have committed in my History , stjould be caused either by love, or by ambition,
which are the noblest of pajsions, and that they be imputed to the evill counsell
of slatterers'^ thatso the respe^i, which is alwaies due unto Kings,may be preser-

Sinally whether things ought to bej\or whether I hwe ja.lged of my Hero

hut have been contented to make no Hilas, nor yet an Hipolitus of

accused of sading therein ) that is you see throughout all my IVork.^ ivhcn as
Soliman/V spoken unto, thy Wghness,thy Mtjesiy, and that in conclusion
he is treated with thee, and not with you, it is not for want of R ssiM ,but
contrarilyit is to have the more, andto observe the custom of thofe peope,
who (beak, aster that fort to their Soveraigns. And is the authority of the
living may be of as much force, as that of the dead, yousi)all sind examples
of it in the moft samous Othomans, and you sijall see that their Authors
have not been asraid to imploy in their own Tongue a manner of speaking,
whijch they have drawn from the Greek^nd Latin'.) and then too I have made
it appear clearly, that I have not done it without destgn , for unlest it be
when as the Turk^ spe^k to the Sultan, or he to his inseriors, I have never
made ust of it, and either of them doth use it to each other. Now for sear it
may be obje&amp;ed unto me, that I have approached some incidents nearer than
the History hathstoewed them to be, great Visgil stoallbe my warrant, who in
his divine JEnesids hath made Dido appear sour Ages aster her own'-, where¬
fore I have beleeved I might do of some moneths, what he hath done of so
many years , and that I was not to be asrgidof erring, as long as I sollowed
so good a guide. I know not likewise whether some may not take it ill, that my
Heio and Hewnh are not Kings'^ but besides that the generous do put no
disserence betweenwearingof Crowns, and meritipjgthem, and that my ]ii-

Hoboycs, European Drummes, Cimbalis, and Syscs, which compofed a musick lit¬

<p>Tauris: Is the aslault were vigorouj, the desence was no less; the Persians were seen
to give ground; the Turkes were also seen to be repulsed ; and this salse Image of
of war had all the apparcnces of a true sight: Butat length, aster a great resistance,
the well-made Slave forced the gates, mounted sirst onthewalles, andpluckisig
down the Sophyes Colours for to set up thofe of the Sultan,   his valor and address
were the cause, that the Moon made theSuntobe cclipsed;   his vistory wasse-
conded with agreatshoutof the Janizaries, and of all the people, and nothing Was
heard over all the Hipodrome, but long live Sultan Soliman.     In the mean time
Ibrahimh^iTd,  who knew his sriend no less by his address* thanby his sace, waS
ravished to see ,   that all the glory of this astion could not be disputed with him.
When the noiseof so many voices was dispersed, there appeared a Troop like to
Christian?, and observed for such by the Crofses,  which were seen in their Co*
lours; they represented certain Cl^ristians,   who living under the Empire of the
Sophy thought they were obliged to dese.nd that Prince, though he were not of
theirRcligion, and indeed had sought sogenerously for him, as they bad been
the sirst in the war, and yet the last that were vanquislied.     This seigned Troop
had order from the Bassa of the Sea to resist for some time that of the Turkes,
which came at that very instant outof theCitty, and then to susser themselves to
be vanquished; and they that were attired like Turkes were commanded to chain
them, andto trail their Colours on the ground     But when the sight began, that
generous Slave,   vvho had drawn the eyes of all the Assembly upon him at the
taking of the seigned Citty ofT'(««m,sell suddenly from jcsting into a more serious
thought, and being carried away by the zeal of his Pveligion,   he passed from the
Turkish Troop into that ofthe ChristianS,   and by changing of party made the
sace of things to change: The Turkes, whom he had lest, laboured to vanquisti him
with the rest, but he beat them back to the very gates ofthe City; and albeit they
made three sallies more upon him, he repulsed them allthe three  times,   even
to the same, gates.  Allthe world was surprised with this adventure, and i^e/Zw/rw,
not being able to comprehend the matter, demanded ofthe Bassa ofthe Sea, what it
meant ^ But the Bassa, casting himsels at the seet of his Highness, assured him that
this criminall astion came not from his order,but that it proceeded from the insc-
lencie of his Slave ;   whereupon a motion of-choler seizing on the mind ofthe
Grand Signior,   he commanded that this   Slave should be instantly impaled.
But the grand Visier, rising from the place where he sate, and salling on his knees,
besought the Sultan that he would not mark the day of his Triumph with blood ;
but remember that clemency is properly the vertue ofthe Vistorious; that in
saving the lise of this inconsiderate he should be assured, that he would lofeitfor
his service ; and that he was of a birth and humor never to be ingratesull; that
knowing him as well as himsels,  he would be responsable for hhntohis High¬
ness ; and that being so sar obliged unto him as to dye for to save him, he besought
the Sultan to take his lise instead of his, is his sault could not obtain pardon.
Soliman reached out his hand to the illustrious Bassa, and in raising him up, said
tinto him, that were the Lightning in his hand,  his   prayers should arrest it;
and that  being unable to resuse him anything, he granted him both the lise and
the pardon of that r^sti man.  Ibral^im cast himsels again at the seet of the Sultan
for to render him tiianks, and aster he had obtained of the Bassa of the seathat
this slavesliould come and pass the night with him, he sent him a commandment
to attend him.   All the magnisicences of this Triumph being sinished, Soliman
was going to rise, andto prepare himsels for his return unto his Seraglio, when
as he perceived 0/»;^«, the Bassa of the l&gt;as onely sonne, who breaking through
the press, and leading a woman in his hand, came and threw himsels together
•with her at his seet. 1 know well, my Lord, said heuntohim, that luypresumpti^
on is extreme, but withalllknow too, that thy goodness is insinite ; neverthe-
Icls I have no other need of it in this encounter^ than that thou Wilt be pleased to

wherein thou receivest such glorious marks of thy Valour, thou wile sender u.

<p>one of thy Justicc. The Bassx of the sea knowing that he wets the moft 5"teresl^d
in the matter in hand, approached near to the Grand S.gnior for to beseech h m
with a great deal of earnettness not to give ear to the complaintsof a man, who
had beenso bold as to come and interrupt his Triumph ; that for his part, al¬
though he were his sbunc, he would crave no savour of him forhis sault, but con-
trarily he stiousd be obliged to his Highness is he would give him a chastisement,
that might punish him, not only for his crime, but for all others whereof he w^as
also culpable. A discourse so violent, and so sar dist.mt from the apprensions of
a sather, made Solman willing to becleaitd therein, being loth in a day of his
gloryhis people might say, thathehadresusedtohear the complaints ofthe op-
prelsed. Howbeit he would sirst demand the advice of the grand Visier/^r&gt;iA«/»,
who having no other aim but the glory of his Mailer, said unto him, that in a
time wherein Heaven had done him justtcein giving himthcvistory over hil E-
neniies, he should in some fort beunjustco deny it to them that craved it (is him.
The sirst sence of SoUman having been consirmed by the counsell of a man, who
might do all things with him, he commanded the Bassa of thesea to hold his
peace, and the woman whom Ofman had brought to his seet, to tell him what in*
terest ihe had in the fortune of that man; to the end that understanding the mat¬
ter from aperson that secmed least capable of disguising it, he might also give a
more equall judgement therein. That woman then having heard this command¬
ment, could not for all thatresolve to obey it, before stie had looked on OfnMn,
as it were to demand permilsion of him to answer unto it; but he having made a
sign unto her that he desired it, stietuinedher {^eMtoviztds Soliman, with both a
modest, and a consident countenance, which began already to obtain for her the
good-will and attention of all that could hear her. Alibech, so wasthiswoman
called, was young and sair, and one might have said that her beauty had been
without compare, is her complexion had not been a little tanned with the Sunj
she had a stately look, but Without pride, and such ingenuity in her sace, as
could not permit onetodoubt of her words. Aster that by Ofmans countenance
the knew he had permitted her to speak, stie began in these terms; for though she
v.'as originally of Versa, yet spake stie perseaiy the Turki^ tongue, which she made
use of in this occasion.

<p>die time he was in that Court he was Satrap of AderbLon, and so cci^dcrable with

<p>charges thev pofsess, and be declared ignoble,and uncapable of all manner of digni¬
ties. My sather was not ignorant of this custom and law; but he was perswadcd that
Tachmas would have insringed it for his sake; and is he would not, that want of
assestion would be a reason slrong enough to oblige him to make the Province re¬
volt, where hecommanded,and whereof he believed he wasabso'utelythcMaster-
howbeit the matter succcedcd not so, for the enemies whidi my Sather had made
him by his violences, meeting with so sair an occasion to hurt him, they represen¬
ted unto the Sophy, that is he pardoned him this sault, it would make hii.i the
more insoknt for the suture, yeaand that it would even overthrow all that Em-
pi re , the glory and force whereof consisted in the valour of noble persons, where-
with it is rcplcnistied ; at length they wrote in such manner, that my Sather was
declaredguilty,as contravening the sundamental! Laws of the State, and con-
tiraincd to undergo the chastisement, which I shall come to speak of^ by reason that
the Province, where he commanded so absolutely when he was in grace, revolted
against him, and lest him not scarcely the liberty to seek a resiige otherwhere • for
J forgot to tell thy Highness, that the same Law which commassded the utter r'uine
of my Sather, commanded also that he should pass his lise in a pcrpetuall pri-
son, and the person whom he had maried in another, for sear that living together,
and having children, it might one day cause diforders in the State.    My Sather
seeing himsels in so pitisull a fortune, went not about to move the heart of Tiis/;-
IW.W with payers and submislion, but contrarily sent him word, that descrving not
to be served by a man of his courage and valor, he would go out of his Estates,
with an intention never to re-enter into them again , but to oring war along with
him.    Being then in ^izt^^/m, he bought a Man of War, wherein he imbarqucd
himselson.A/.«rts»*4Vr, withhis wise, who as she was  the cause of his misfor¬
tune, so would she not abandon him in his exile.    They  continued some time in
this fort, not knowing what resolution to take, nor having any other dcsign in the
course that they held, than to eloign themselves from Persta \ my Sathers great
heart not permitting him to go and seck unto the enemies ofT^icZ-wrss for a place
of retreat; for though hebesomewhat cruelJ,yct ishenotwithstanding generous;
neither would he likewise address himsels to the Princes that were allied to our
Empire, for sear he should not be savourably received by them.   In the mean time
these irrcsolutions having no end, the provisions of the ship diministicd daily:
The Pilot was well hoped up to ask him where he would land,vvhen as he sound no
place in the whole universall Map whither ro go. Six moneths past away in this
fort in running over all the Seas of the Levant; and whereas my mother was with
child of me, at such time as Ihe irabarqued her sels, stie was not sar from the term
wherein I was to see the light, when as &gt;4r/«/o».s vistualls utterly sailed him; and
having imployed all his money in the buying of the Vcssell, and such provisions
of War, and for the mouth, as he had laid into her, he knew not what part to re¬
pair unto for the supplying of himsels in so adverse an adventure. The souldi-
ers and Mariners consulted together, and having gained the Pilot, they wrought
so with him^that maugre the command n\y Sather had given him to the contrary,
he sleered direstly to an Hand which they had discovcred ; whereupon Arsalen
being in a rage to see his authority contemned, went and pustied away the Pilot ^
rudely for to make him abandon the helm, as the poor wretch sell into the Sea;
and my Sather becoming his own Pilot, he took his scimitar in his right band,

<p>animated more by the sear of samine, than by their courage, resolved to obey his
pleasure. Aster my Sather had shut up my Mother in the Captains Gabbin, where
with sright slie was brought to bed of me by th? ailistance of her Nurse, who had
never abandoned her, they set upon the Vcsselljand aster two hours sight rendred
themselves absolute Matters of her, wherein they sound extreme riches, and abun¬
dance of Vistuall. This vistory gave new lise to his souldiers, who for the valor
which my Sather had shewed in this occasion, grew so devoted unto him, as they
craved pardon of him for resitting his will, and swore never to forsake him ; he
to win them the morc,divided the booty amongst them,reserving nothing for him¬
sels but the glory of having vanquished.   Aster this, my Lord, he took a resoluti¬
on to have no other Countrey but his ship, and to pass all the rest of his lise upon
all the Seas of the worI&lt;^ to seek out alloccasions  c^ sighting, and to take all
the Vessells that sliould carry the Colours of PerJtA, or all that belonged to the
Enemies of our Religion, which are the Christians: He propounds this design
to his soudiers, who approve it, and albeit my Mother withsbod it, he setled this
resolution at last. Behold, my Lord, in what fort my Sather.hath lived for the spacc
of eighteen years that I have been in the world,  and that which hath gotten
him so much same under the name of ArsaUntht Pirate throughout all the Sea«
that are known to us.    I have not for all that been always brought up in so wild
an elemcnt,for whereas he divers times arrived at Hands to sell ofs the commodities
which he had taken, he lest me from the age of six years untill sourteen, at which
time he took me to him again, under the government of a woman of the  Isle of
Cyprus, who truly had a great deal of care of me.    Thy Highness may be pleased
to dispence with me for the relating to thee allthe sad vistories which my Sa¬
ther hath obtained inso long a time,andwithallwilt pardon me is Ihave exten¬
ded my scis in this discourse more than I ought, for to make it appear, that the
lise which mv sather hath led, hath radier been an essca of his great heart, and of
his despair,thanof thebasenessandviciousness of his mind : But, my Lord, to

<p>This Slave having consirmed this promisc unto him, my S.ith:r permitted him to
write unto the place whence he said he was of, and so going to the Hie of Cyprut
he gave this Letter to Merchants, with whom he held correspondence, that under¬
took to cause it to be delivered; my Sather promising this Slave, that within three
moneths he would return thither for an answer of it; but in the mean time that
he mustforhissecuritygo along with him : This man not knowing what to do,
but to sollow the Law of the Vanquistier, resolved  to submit to that which he
could not avoid.  Not long aster we encountred a great nun of War, in whofe
i-iag my Sather observed hals Moons;  and whereas all his prizcj were scldom
O'".'?^^&lt;^''made of any save of Prr/^w/, or Christians, he purpofed not to meddle
withhei, but contrarily commanded his Pilot to quit his course, that so he might
decline her ; but whereas Arsalon was taken for a Pirate, and this change of course
seemcd to be a slight unto him who commanded that Vessell, he made up with
tullsayls unto us, the better to discern ours, and having well discerncd her, he
canie presently and grapled himsels sast unto us.    I cannot say, my Lord , what
this sight was, because the sright I was in kept me from marking it,howbcit I know
that at the very sirst, they of that Vessell leaped into ours; and whereat there were
many of my Sathers souldiers sick, they might peradventure have rendred them¬
selves Matters of her without the valor of the/M/M«Sla&gt;e, who seeing that they
which attacqued us were not Christians, demanded leave of Arsalon to sight, who
having given him arms, gave him wherewithall to gain us the vistory ; for he per¬
formed such marvellous things in this sight, as aster he had repulsed the enemy, he
leaped into their Vessell, sollowed by my Sather, and some of his, put very ncer
all that he met with there to the sword, rendred   himselse Matter of her, and
with his own hand, aster a long resistance, took Ofman ^ who commanded her, and
who by his Sathers order was going to Alexandria.   Aster this brave exploit,
this Slave was the savourite of Arsalon, of which grace notwithtt.mding he was not
much sensible; for though my Sather caressed him extremely, yet lest he not to
be exceedingly asslisted, when as he knew that the reward of his vistorie; sliould be
a perpetuall slavery; for albeit my Sather had promised to give him his liberty,
"when as he should have received his ransom, he had resolved nevertheless to break
his Word with him, for that  hemight not, saidhe, part with a man which could
make him invincible by his wondersull val jr.    In the mean time, my Lord, Ofman
sinding himsels wounded, and my inclination having always carried jne to the
comforting of others miseries,! visitcd him whilst he was ill, and more for the
care that I had of his person, as long as he was so, than for any beauty was in my
sace, he bare an assestion to me; and is I dare say it, the knowledge which I had
thereof^ together with his merit, and the compassion I had of his misfortune, very
much dispofed me to accept of it; the constancy which he sticwed was partly the
cause of my weakness,is at leastwise one may call aaassestionso, which hath no
other objest but vertue.   As soon as 0/r»4» was taken, he told Arsalon vihzt he
was, who gave him the means to let the Bassa of the Sea undcrstand what ransom
he was set at, and how he might deliver him; in the mean time, his hurts being cu¬
red, he contrasted a great sriendstiip with that generous Slave, speaking acertain
corrupted Italian unto him, which, they say, is very much in use here in Conjlanti-
nople.    As forme, aster I parted from the Isle of.Cr/r/w,mychiesestentertain-
mens was to talk with the Interpreter, whom my Satlier carried always along with
him, and by the continuall conserence which we had together, touching the diver-
sitics of Languages, I had almoft learned two or three, is not for to speak thera
well, at leastwise to understand them perscstly ; and whereas the Turkish and /m-
//Vrw were of that number, I did also many times converse with thofe two infortu¬
nate ones, thinking I had passe4 away the day exceeding well, when 1 could avoid
the company of thofe men of blood and slaughter that sollowed my Sather. Thus
I spent moft of my time, cither in the Captains Cabbin with my Mothers Nurse,
orintheirconversation.  They knew well enough by my sadness, that the lise
which I led was grievous UBtw me, yet had they the goodness not to speak tome

uci VM re h i; ;LJy than bdorc, and kept in the rank of thofe Slaves, which he meant
toil'l ip ». hrUl'on l.'nd. This resolution, being known to Ofman, and me, wrought
a Isianicssss 't in i.'s and the love which we bore one to another , and which we
had both ano concealed .is much as we could, began then to break forth. I could
not (perk tc hi o of n,y sithcrs dcsigns but with tears in mine eys,nor could he talk
tor.K of Tin e'cignnKnc^ which he believed to be inevitable, without declaring his
asicstionop lily unto ir.e; I believed , my Lord, that it was true, thinking it was
not a time httiiii: to diisrnible in ; he alsured methat his irons did not seem heavy
i.nto him, as long as he was with me, but the thought of being separated from me
si r ever, and-to be constrained to carry chaines otherwhere, was insupportableto
to him; he swaie to me surther, that he had not desired his liberty but toobtain of
hissathci, ajjainst whom he had never so much as once murmured, the meanes to
deliver nic out of the hands of mine. A discourse so obliging sound not an ingrate¬
sull soul, and I ivsolvtd to do what I could to keep my sather from executing so ig¬
noble a design; I cast my lels then at his seet,! begged this grace of him with tearesj
but for all the cssest of my rcquest 1 got nothing , save an express inhibition
never to  speak to him more of it.    Aster  that   he alwaies treated  me   ill -
</p>
<p>1   had no longer the libcrtie to entertain Ofman   as   before ; and   wee Were
all three for a long time together the moft unhappy persons that ever   were.
This coristraint for all that kept me not from letting him know at length, that is he'
wcuid promile to mary me I would undeavour to deliver him,  so as he would be

<p>der the dissiculties of it, and sind no other way to execute it, than to stay till we
came to the Isle oiChio, whither ray sather was to goe,   and there to cast anchor •
for whereas he had caused the Captains Cabbin to be divided in the midst, to
the end that I stiould lie on the one side, and he on the other, and that Ofman also
was every night locked up with a key, which ^rp/w himsels alwaies kept by him,
I resolved to steal icas sofdy as 1 could from him; but the dissiculty was, that ever
since he   purpofed  to retain the Italian Slave, he for to savour him, but indeed
to assure himsels of him, made him to lie with him.    I resolved then to propound
unto him his escaping out ofmy sathers hands; at sirst he doubted it was but to
try him, that I spake so to him,  and withall his own generofity withstood it, but
having acquainted him with the truth ofthe matter, he believed rae, and said, that
seeing my sather had broken his word with him, he might sail in his sidelity to
him alio; and on condition that Q/5»/«» would promise him his sreedom, he would
expofe himsels to any thing for my sake. I assured him ofwhat he desired , andha-
ving so good a second it was not hard  for me to sinish my enterprise.    But with-
OQt importuning thy Highness, my Lord, by a long relation, let it sussise to say,
we were no sooner at the road oiChio, where Ofman had some acquaintance, but
night being come,   and my sather asleep,  I went and stoleaway the key ofthe
Cabbin,wherein Ofmanviz^ locked;and the generous Slave,having shut up my sather
in hisjwherehesoundlyslept, came along with me to unlofe his srienci, snatched
away a sentinells armes that would have cryedout, and having killed him, as
well as the Pilot, we got into the skiss, and for the more surcty, the generous Slave
with a blow of his scimitar cut asunder the cable that held the vessell at anchor,
which by the light of the Moon we saw sall away from us,  and sloat at the plea¬
sure of the winS, without a Pilot, or any man awake in her. In the mean time Of¬
man and that Slave rowed with such speed, as wee soon approched to land, where
we happily arrived; and meeting withasanstuary inthehouseofone, who knew
Ofman at CktQ,   we in a little time sound the meanes to come unto Conslantinople^
leaving Arsalon no doubt in an extreme rage at our slight,   which was made with
much the more security,   for that my sather seldomsussered his great Vessell to
enter into any Port that was suspested unto him,  but sent   a Barque in for
the dispatch of^ such business as he had to do there, and upon that it was that I had
grounded my enterprise.  Now, my Lord,   aster I had delivered Oyw&lt;*» with the
help ofthe generous Slave, and had brought him back to his paternall house, when
he would have made good his word  which he had given us, this incensed sather
hath intreatedme as an insamous person, and a vagabond, and hath put that Slave
into irons, to whom his sonne oweth his liberty,  since that without him I could
iiot have executed that which I had promised ;   it is that Slave, my Lord ,   whom
thou hast so lately pardoned,  and of whom the Illustrious Ibtahim hath underta¬
ken the protestion.    Behold, my Lord, the disserence that is between the Bassa of
the Sea, and his sonne, whole sense I will not deliver, for sear I stiould be suspested
to interpret it too advantagiously for my sels;   wherefore it is for thy Highness to
understand itfromhis own mouth, and absolutely to dispofe ofmy happiness, or
ofmy unhappiness, ofmy lise, or ofmy death. ALbeeh having given over speak¬
ing   a consuted noise was heard , which secmed to judge the matter for her ad¬
vantage; but Soltman , desiring to render equall Justice, commanded the Bassa of
the Sea to speak his intentions. 1 have no other, my Lord, saidhe ,   thantochace
from my house a woman, that ought to be driven from all the earth,  and whofe
dispofition is so base and unjust, that stie could love a captive, when (he knew him
not for that which he was, and betray her sather; a woman descended from a Pi¬
rate    nourilhed amidst blood and cruelty, brought up amongst wicked villaines
whom the earth cannot bear, and the daughter ofa Persian thy Highness enemy :
Behold what this woman is whom my sonne will mary,  and for allherestate
brings nothing with her but insamy; he will tell mc ,  it may be, that he owes his
liberty to her, and I will answer him, that it is a good which stie hath not done

betrayed he r sather to polTess them , and hath not so much sollowed my sonne, as
she hath sought aster his good fortune; and then who knowes whether her hatred
to Arsalon is not rather the cause of her slight, than her love to Ofman ?   She was
weary of living in a continuall prison, and to speak truly of things, she owes her
liberty rather to 0/sw.r«, than my sonne dothow his to her,   since that at length
a ransom might have redeemed him, whereas nothing could have drawn her out
of her sathei i hands. What aslurancc can one place in a person, that gives no markes
of herassestion buttreasons; thatstislesall the motions of nature, to sollow thofe
wherewith stie is inspired by a difordinatelovc; and that begins her mariage with
an i:npiety&gt; Believe mesisman, said the Bassa beholding him , she thathath beenso
audacious, as to betray her sather for to sollow a Slave ,   may yet more easily be¬
tray an husband for a man of sree condition; she that could so cunningly steal a-
way the keyes of a sleeping sather,  may peradventure, being become the more
daring by the happy suecess of her former dehgncs, stab a dagger into the hear?
of an husband, when as siie (hall be as weary of him, as (he was of her sather. And
then, my Lord, said he, turning himsels to Soliman, who knows whether ai^ that stie
hath said be not a trick, and that being the daughter ofa Persian, stie comes not hi¬
ther to observe what is done here, and seek o-cahon to hurt us &gt; Howsoever it be.

<p>in a more deplorable estate than ever man was seen : Love then did not enter into
her heart by voluptuoushess, but I can say it was introduced thereinto by goodness
acknowledgement, and compassion; for is she had not been pittisull, she had not is-
sisted me Whenl was ill, she had not loved me; is she had not been acknowledging,
she had despised the love ofa slave, that had not the liberty to do her any service-
and is her heart had not been tender, slie had not been moved with my misfortuner.
nor given an end to them. It is true, that she is the daughter ofthe Pirate Arsalon-
that she hath quitted her sather to sollow me; that stie hath been brought up a-
tnongst cruell and bloody men ; and thatsiie is the daughter, not only of a Pirate
but of A Ptrsian. But, my Lord, all this, which seems to make against me, makes
for me in this occasion : for what greater mark can one desire of a solid and im¬
moveable vertue, than to see a woman of eighteen years of age, whofe inclinations
arc not corrupted amidst somany vices, and whofe innocencie isprescrved so en¬
tire, as she could not so much as cxcuse cruelty in her sather ? It is true, that she
hath sollowed mc, but it was to see no more murthers, nor sights, S(nd because she
saw a jusser temper in my mind : She hath not betrayed her sather to sollow a slave,
but slie hath quitted the Pirate Arsalon to deliver a husband; for having promised
tobeso unto her, nothing but death alone can keep me from it.    Moreover, my
Lord, she is not to be suspested of thy Highness, for though she be the daughter ofa
PersiaUj it is of a Persian the enemy of Tachmas, who hath for these eighteen years
waged War against h ira. I will not stand to say, that this woman, albeit the daugh¬
ter of a Pirate, is for all that of a noble extrastion, because the Alujsulmans mukc
Nobility personall, and belecve that it ought not to pass unto children; but I will
only say, that in the estate wherein my sathers fortune now is,all that can be desired
In a woman is contrasted in riiis same; stie is sair, she loves me,and slic is vertuous.
It is tru&gt;t, that sheis without wealth, and without parents,  but stichath lottthem
for the love of mc; and whereas by thy bounty my sather hath no nced,either of sup-
porl, or of riches, what can 1 Wisti for more in a Wise &gt; Is I take one that is rich, it
stiay be she will abandon me isl sliould happen to sall intomisery, but this that I
havechofen wil be the companion of all my misfortune$,withoutany sear that ever
slie will quit mc.   I know that I ow a great deal of respest to my sather, but I
know that I ow my lise and my liberty to this woman; I mutt then love both the
one and the other, or keep my word which I have given her ; for is my sather will
not susser himsels to be perswaded, we will go voluntarily into banishment;  we
are already accuttomed to misfortune, and the misery that we stiall endure toge¬
ther will no doubt be more supportablc to us, than greatness and riches would
be is we were separated.   As for the generous Slave, to whom I have promised li¬
berty, 1 know not by what reason my sather can pretend any right to deprive  him
of it; he is neither his slave nor mine ; and bytheseverett law of War he can lay
Aocla'im at all unto him : He is a Christian I acknowledge, but allthe Christians
here in Cbr^amin*plt wear not setters 5 he is a captive,  but that is to Arsalm^
and not to him; and a captive too, who aster a breach of promise might with Ju¬
stice break his chains ; nor hath he sought for liberty but to give it me, and that

persidious and ingratesull, and I had rather my sather sliould hate me with inj«-

end of speaking, and having observed by the Bassa of the scas countenance, that
the discourse had rather incensed, dian perswaded hira, turned her sels to Ofmau,
with tears in her eyes, and conjured him to obey his sather; I will not, sayd (he
unto him, have you saulty for the love of me; and since our asscstion cannot be in¬
nocent, extinguisli it in your heart, and leave me the care ofconserving it in mine;

for us, nor is the l.uidmore savourable unto us; thy sather and mine do banisli sis
sr(;ni them both, and nothing but death alone can sinish our miseries. Soltmanbc-
ing touched with thepitty of such tender appreheniions, would not leave them
long  in pain; and though the Bassa of the sea would havcreplycd, he forbad him
to withlLindhis pleasure; but whereas he knew, that the true reason wherefore
he oppofed the p.ill.'nn of his sonne, was avarice, so ordinary amongst the Turks y
he told him, aster he had consulted with Ibrahim^ that the vertue of Alibech hzd
charmed him in such fort, as he would adopt her for his daughter, and how irt
that quality he would give her three hundred thousand Sultannics in mariage with
her, commanding him to receive her for the wise of hissonne,andtointreat heras
is (he were his daughter, assuring him that he would hold the place of sather unto
her, and that he would interess himsels in all that regarded her. That for the Slave
whom he had already pardoned, it was his pleasure, that he stiould remit him in¬
to the hands of Ibrahim to dispofc of him as he Would. The Bassa of the sea, who
indeed had sound no other desest in the vertuous Alibech, than poverty, seeing her
to be rich by the bounty of the Sultan, changed his choler into giving of thank*
aid asl^^ucd Solm^n that he Ihould be obeyed.    Ofman and Alihchrendred him
such acknowledgement as was answerable to the savour they had received, and went
away with as much satijsastion, as they had had forrow:  But it viks SolimMs
pleasure, that J/,^, J; stiould sirst go and kiss the Kobe of Rox,la»a, who Vs^s still
attheslanding, where she had seen the Triumph. In the mean time, die dav beine
near to an end, the magnisicences of this Triumph ended also by a volley of Mu£
ket-sliotditcharged by the Janizaries, which was answered by all the sireas o3-
nance of the seven Towers, and that of all the Gallies.   Giiat S^liJ^th^^
t^red to the Seraglio, with the Sultana Queen, attended upon by alllTsrou^
which asterwards condusted the Grand Visier to his, he dut by his Taloi^wd

<p>Erahim Bassa, being unable to vanquisti the secret melancholy
which he carried in hisbreass, could not amidst all his Visto-
ries, and allthe honours he had received, keep it from being
as visiblc in his eyes, as it was sensible to his heart. TheCon-
quests which he had made of the Terjians, theBattails which
he had won against the Rebels of A sa, had indeed silled
the whole extent of the Empire of the Mujsulmans with
gladness: but this gencrall rejoycing made not his particular ;
neither were utility and glory considerations strong enough to give unto his minti
only that sirst motion which precedeth joy. He was not ignorant, that fortune had
not abased him, buttoxaischim insinitely; howbeit he knew likewise, that stie
had given him that which he desired not at all, and that slie had taken from him
the only thing which made up all his desires, and all his ambition; hepersestly
knew, that the more happy he was for another, d.«e more infortunate he was for
himsels ; and a news which he had heard the day htfort from Arsalons slave, had
stirred up so great a trouble in his mind, and agitated it withso much violence,
as forgetting all things to abandon himsels to gries, he rcmcmbred not that he was
obliged to be present at the rising of great 5o//&gt;»&lt;i«, of whom he was beloved with
so much tcnderness, as he alone had permission to enter into the Seraglio as often
as he pleased, a savour so extraordinary, that it had never been granted to any per¬
son. He had also made choice of our Illustrious Bassa to be not only his Grand
Visier, buttorepofc himsels upon him for all the assairs ofthe Empire. It was he
that commanded the Armies; it was he that made the Sangiacs, and gave them the
Government of Provinces; it was he that presided in the Counsell of State, and
that alone formed the resolution thereof in the Sultans Cabinet: Ibrahim was so
powersull, that he wanted nothing but the sole name of Emperor, to be the chies
of all the Orient. In the mean time these savours of fortune could not keep him
from holding himsels the wretchedest of all men; it was in this irksom thought
that the Ag*of the Janizaries sound him, when as he came to tell him, that the
Grand Signior complaihed of his sloth, and that it was his pleasure he should come
away unto him. IbrahiWy surprised with this commandment, which made him see
the sault he had committed, did what he could to conceal his gries from the Aga;
howbeit he perceived that there was some unquietness in his mind; Ibrahim to\d.
him notwithstanding that he would go straightway and justisie himsels to hisHigh-

unlikely th.tt t!ie lelicks of two Battells, which the Enemies had loft, sliould be .,
so siissicient power, as to dare to present themselves before an Army vistorious, as

believe that his Empire was so well setied, as there was no force able to sliakc so
areata Body; that for that which regarded his person, his Governmem was so
iiis&gt;, as all strange people beheld it with envy, and all his Subjests with joy.   The
El a had no sooner made an end of speakine, but the Sultan said unto him very
cblipingly, Why then, IbrahimyHnce thy mesancholy proceeds not from any thing
thr.t regards me,  it must needs be  scmething   that  concerns   thee in   parti¬
cular, and  as   I   am no  less  sensible   on   that side, than  on the other, I
will know  absolutely cs thee,   what   it  is   that   troubles thy minde j   for
though thou  hast  laboured to put on  a joysull countenance   in   answering
me, ytt li:;ls thcu not for all that destroyed the opinion which I have conceived.
Ibrahim, seeing himsels so ncerly prest, could not forbear blushing, and thinking
vu v.iiathe vvastolay, hecast down his eyes, and secmed to be strucken dumb,
which the Sukanhaving observed, imbraced him, and said. No, Ibrahim, do not
seek ro dishuise the truth unto me, I will know it of what importance socvcr it
may be : Look not on me in this considence, as on thy Soveraign, but as on 5#/i-
W.77, that is to sayy as on a man that will partake with thee in all thegood, and in
all the evill that can arrive unto thtc; thy courage hath made thee Ihed blood c-

<p>have suGcceded in his dignitie, never to think themselves securc : He had consirm¬
ed the Throne of Ba]az.et', he had been the only man that mounted him into it;
in the mean time for a recompence of all his services he was strangled by two
Slaves.    But, my Lord, not to go sofar to seek for examples, that of Chajsan
Baila, Visier under the reign of an Emperor, who could not be but great, seeing
he hath given birth to thy Majesty, is not he able to strike sear into the sirmett and
moft innocent souH since for giving good counsell, which had not been successsul
is it had been sollowed, he lofs that lise which he had so many times hazarded for
the sasi ty of this Empire : I sliould not have been so bold, as to have spoken of this
adventure In this occurrence, had I notremembred, that I have heard thy High¬
ness bemoan the misfortune of that great man: Now therefore demand no longer
of me thccauleof my gries, seeing thy Ma)csty knows it as well as my sels; but
is it be true that I am beloved of thee, as I cannot doubt of it without a crime,
pardon only my weakness, and believe not that the discourse which Ihave made
is anessest of my ambition. I know too well, my Lord, that I cannotgo h-igher,
and for that reason it is that I sear the inconstancy of fortune, who being unable to
raise me more,stiall be constrained to destroy me for to sollow her naturall inclina¬
tion ;  it is an order which she hath kept in all ages, and I dare not hope that she
will break it in savor of me.    But, my Lord, were  I assured that slie would be
contented with bereaving me of all the honors, which I have received from thy
Greatness, and that (he would leave me heavy laden with chains, as I  was when
it pleased thy Highness to sree me of them, provided sls^y') that siie would not
deprive me of thy Grace,  1 sliould be untroubled, and live more happily being
thy Slave, than now I do being sull of glory  and   savors.    The  Sultan having
hearkened to this discourse with a great deal of patience, could not at  length
forbear interrupting  him ;    1 thought, Ibrahim, said he, that  I had open¬
ed my heart so well unto thee, and so thorowly shewed thee my Love, astliere
rested nothing more for thee, either to sear, or to desire; butiince I am deceived in
my con(estures,I will pardon thy weakness,and is it be pofsible I wil cure thee of it.J
couldjis I wouId,sind some cxcuse for the violences which my predecesfors haveused
during their reignes, and tel thee,   that in an Empire which was not as then well
setled, it was in some fort convenient to lean rather towards rigor, than towards
clemencie; but I will not undertake to make their apologie serve niy turn against
thee; that which was just in their times, would not be reasonable in these; where¬
fore I will imploy other remedies,   which, is I be not deceived, will make thee
know, that 5//&gt;w^» can tell how to chain up fortune \vhen he pleaseth, andthathe
is resolved, to measure thine with his lise.   The Bassa would have aiisweied to so
obliging a speech,but the Sultan stayinghim said; I think, Ibrahim,thou hast not
forgotten, that it is by the meanes of the Sultana, my daughter Asteria, that I have
the commodity to see thee in my service.   I stiould be too ingratesull, replyed the
Bassa, is I stiould not remember, that I ow my lise unto her ,   and that which is
yet more precious unto me , I  ow her the honor of serving the greatest Monarch
of the world. That being, said  Soliman,   thou needest not doubt, that the design
which I have, sliould not please her; seeing that in a time,  when .as slie knew thee
notbutby thygoodaspest ,  slie judged thee worthy of her care; but to clear my
thoughts unto thee, and to dissipate the sear that masters thee, know, th.it I am re-
sclve'd to place thee in our illustrious alliance, by making thee mary Asi-eria; and
to leave thee yet a more precious gage,   receive the word which now I give thee,
r thou knowst, being what i am, that it is inviolable and sacred ) remember then,
thatlswear to thee by ALLA, that as long as 5'&lt;?//»M«sliall be living , thou
stialt not die a violent death; judge now whether I can doe more,   and whether
thou hast not been too blame to doubt of the sirmness of my assestion.    It is true,

<p>men- but,my Lord,-----and as he would have proceeded, he was sussocated in such

all the industry of agriculture, joyned to the heat of the San, the serenity of the

theSrench, which commanded them',  untill the time that AhdreaDaria, who is
of one ofthe moft illustrious races ofGenoua,   put our City into theestate which
now it is , namely under the Government ofthe Nobility.    I have madeknown
unto thy Highness the divers mutations which have besalleijour Republique ,  to
the enci thou maist with the less dissiculty comprehend that, which hath made all
this Conmionalty be divived a  long while since into two principall sastions •
the Heades of these two parties are the Sregoz.es yZnd. the Adornes , ingaged , as
well as all the rest of Italy, in two oppofite sastions,  so known and samous under
the name of the G«(r/sAs js, and Gibelius, Jwithwhom the Siestjues, the Donaes ,
the Spmolaesy the Grimald:esy the Juslinianoes ,   and all the other illustrious Sa¬
milies ofGenoua have taken part.   But to come to that which regards me direstly,
I will not sear to tell thy Highness what my birth is, being consident of thy ge¬
nerofity : Thou maist be pleased to understand then, that I am of the illustrious
race of that infortunate prince, from whom the valor and fortune of Mahomet the
second, thy great Grandsather , took his Empire, and hislise, and who interred
himsels with all his glory, and with all that of the Palcobgues under the mines
of this samous City of 0«/rt«s;&gt;?o;&gt;/s: Thou art not ignorant, my Lord, that aster
so great a subversion of that State^ and in so generall a destrustion ^ all that remai¬
ned of the Princes of the Imperiall House were dispersed over all the earth , and
not able to conceal their unhappiness' in generall, some of them concealed them¬
selves by changing a too samous name for their ^xeient sovtnne; Juslinmno Paleo^
logue, of whom I descended , was of that number ;  for seeing he had saved out of
that shipwrack wealth enough for a particular, but not enough for a Prince of so
illustrious a blood as his, he retired to Genoua, retaining but the mme of Jujlmiana,
which since hath been the surname of our House,  the very same with that of a Po¬
pular Samily,   which was before in the same City: And that poor Prince desi¬
ring to accommodate his quality to his misfortune, sliut up that secret within his
Samily, and in this forr, though we be in essest Princes,  yet have we past ever
tincefor Gentlemen. That which obliged him to chiise(jtsw»4 for his retreat ,  ra¬
ther than any other place of/srs/7 ,   was, for diat he knew how the Genoueses had
alwaies been well assested to that Empire;   how they had mightilv succoured
M'chaelo Paleologue ; and hovv in case it sliould happen that he stiouldbe known
for that which he was,he sliould be in a place ofsasety : And truly he had some rea¬
son to sear it,   for he had  rendred himsels so remarkable by the gallant astions
which he had performed,   and had so signalized himsels on the day of the taking
of Conjlantinopte, as he was the last that was seen to desend the breach ;  but at
length beholding the City taken, the Emperor Cmjlmtino Paleologue dead, and the
whole Empire stibverted , he stole away his person from the vistory of his Ene¬
mies; and being retii ed almoft alone he took the  resolution   which I have delive¬
red i know very well, my Lord, that it istoj much temeritie, in the estate where¬
in things are, for me to let thee understand, that I am of a blood,  which gives me
some right to pretend to the Empire   that thou pofsesscst at this present; but, my
Lord, 1 am to tell thee , that in the dispofition wherein I am for thy Highness,  I
would preser my former chaines before the Empire ofmy Ancestors; and that is

the dctestable custom, which is observed over all A^/y, that particular and perso-.
sonall hatred passed even to my snher, who yet could never approve of that ha-

<p>small importance, butthatitmay be imprinted in thy memory ; the lofs of tvvo
hundred vessels, and abpve sisteen thousand men, that were all swallowed up of
the waves, or dastiedinpeeces against the Rocks, wasso drcadsull an adventure,
as the only remembrance of it strikes horror into me: At length, my Lord, I csca-
ped that danger,aster I had an hundred times seen deadi, for which I have been very
forry I know not how often since; but whereas we had scarce any Icasurc to have
other enemies to sight with than the winds and the seas, I could not resolvc to re¬
turn to Genoua before I had sound some opportunity, that might make me known,
whether I was worthy to carry the name of the Jujlmanoes; so that the relists of
our Army parting from Bugta, where they had sought for a shclter, I would not
sollow them that were discharged; contrarily I imbarqucd my sels with the Em¬
peror of the Christians, who took the way ofMajorica, and from thence went and
landed at Carthagena.    But hardly was he arrived there, when as he saw himsels
constrained wholly to quit all his dcsigns of Asrica for to think of desending himsels
from the Srench. It would be unjust to abusc thy patience with the recitall ofa War
which no way scrvs to my discoursc,it wil sussice then that I say,how I sollowed him
three whole years together, except when he was at Genoua, whither I would not
go for sear of being retained by my parents.   But at last, aster I had been a witness
of all the brave astions which he performed in Navarre, in Germany, in Luxemburg
against the Duke of Cleves, znd in Guelderlandy I received express order from my
sather to come home to him, which I presently did, though the Emperor was
loth to let me go.   But, my Lord, what cause of misfortune hath that return been
unto me? Ah! how much better had it been for me that I had dyed in the Wars,
than to have gone to a place where so many grievous adventures were to besall me?
It was not, for that I was not received with joy, caressed by my kindred, imbra¬
ced by my sriends with all kindness, and is I dare say it, regarded by the enemies
of our house with more esteem, than that inveterate hatred, which had been long'
between us, would permit; but contrariwise it secmed, that the Sates had resol¬
ved to let rae tast all the content of a quiet and deliciou s lise, for to make mc seel
at once, both the privation of the good, and also the evill which was prepared
forme.   Aster I had then betto wed some time in receiving the caresses of our sa¬
mily, and that I had answcred all the quettions which my sather made me touching
the War , and my Voyages; aster, Isay, I had recounted unto him an hundred
times over all the occasions wherein I had been present, I desired  to make it ap¬
pear, that War and Gallantry were not incompatible, and that aster having been
three years in slaughter and blood, I was not returned from thence, nor more wild,
or moreuncivillj I took care then to inform my sels from my sriends, whether
there were not some Assembly shortly to be, where I might make comparison be¬
tween the Beauties of our Ladies, and thofe which I hud seen in Spai»&gt; There¬
unto they answered rae, that I might in a little time content my curiofity, for that
in three or sour dayes the Nuptials of two persons of quality in our City would
be solemni2ed.    I surther demanded of them whether a Nicpcc of Andrea Doriaes
held not ttill the Empire of beauty ? Or whether since my departure some other
had not bereaved her of that advantage, which had been given her with so much
justice &gt; They told me, that stic was sair, as I had seen her, but as for the prime
place, slie had been constrained to yecld it up to a springing beauty, which made all
that came near it to dy for love; and that they accounted me moft happy for not
being expofed to that danger. But when as I demanded of them by what salse con*
sequence they conjesturcd that I was inscnsible of love &gt; they answered me then,that
Isabella Grimaldi, the only daughter of Rhodolpho, was that same admirable person,
who could not be sussiciently praiscd, and of whom they had spoken unto me; and
that knowing the terms wherein we ttood, they beleeved that I was so generous,
as I would not susser my sels to be vanquislied by mine enemy. This discourse stir¬
red up such an emotion within mc, as hath made mc to understand since, that there
is asupreme power which forceth us, whether we will or no, and without the aid

could not meet with her any where, how caresull soever I was to do it.    I de¬

ly.    Scarcely was this discourse ended, but that devancing all the company len-
tsred  alone into the Cabinet, resolving to try the Eccho sirst of all; howbeit   my
Lord, I had no sooner opened the window, but insteedof obliging the Eccho to
answer  mc, I my sels loft the use of my voice, by the rapture wherewithal! I
was seized, in beholding the sairest creature that ever Nature made; stie was
leaning on aBalustrade of Jasper and Porphirie, which formed a Qnadrant   in
the midst Whereof stood a Sountain, wherein sour Nymphs of white Marble seeni-
ed to play together in bathing themselves; for by a marvellous artisice there part¬
ed from their hands in disserent astions, an abundance of water, which wetted
them, and made one believe that they cast it upon one another, making withall a
very  pleasing noise.    Is J had never seen this Sountain but in this incounter .  I
should not have heeded it so much, as to be able to describe it ;   for s was so siir-
prised With the charms of this unknown sair one, as 1 had no eyes but for her : I
changed colour twenty times in a moment, and hiding my sels forsearof beino-
perceived, I considered her with all the attention that a man could have, who sron^
admiration was already passed even to lovc;it being moft certain,that from the very
sirst instdnt I saw her,  I selt my sels forced withso much violence to love her as I
then sully resolved to dye, or to pofsess her. As I was in this estate all the compa¬
ny arrived, and stiewed me that they were forry I had quitted them so soon , be¬
cause there had been a dispute about the nature ofthe Eccho, which would have
pleased me very much i aster I had heard this discourse, without answering unto
it, I asked whether there were any that could tell me the name of that sair one,
who sare niusing on the brim of the sountain, which I saw in the midst of the Gar¬
den ; in saying so, I softly opened the window, which I had hals sliut, and prayins
them to make no noise,  1 shewed them that prodigy of beauty :   I had no sooner
made an end of speaking, but by an hidden knowledge, which prevented their
answer, I selt something within me, that told me how it was the divine Isabella-^
scarcely had this thought excited some trouble in my mind, when as one of isiy
sriends consirmed this truth unto me, and demanded of mc, is it was pofsible that
I should not know mine enemy? Why, said 1, interrupting him, is stie that Isce,
the daughter of Rhodolpho s 1 spake this so loud, that I made her turn her sace to¬
wards the place where we were, so that having perceived us she pulled down her
veil, and began to go away unto two womenthat were walkieg in an Alley a good
way ofs. Totell, my Lord, what became of me in this occasion, would be a dissi¬
cult matter; my reason proved so weak, and my paslion so strong, as little wanted,
but that forgetting all kind of good manners, I had at the very instant departed
from a place  that had been so satall unto me, as to let me see in one onely person
theobjestofmy hate,and ofmy love : Butat length, the spight and the stiameof
being seen with so much weakness, made me resolvc to try to conreal it; I said
then to him that had spoken to me, that I was ravished with having so sair an E-
ncmy, and that though she had arms which would easily render her vistorious of
all them that stic would subjest, yet was I generous enough , for to combat a per¬
son by whom one might be vanquislied without sliame.    Aster this they amused
themselves in seeking out the beauties of the Eccho ; thofe of the company who
had the worst and the hoarsest voyces, forbore not forcing this Eccho to reproach
them with their desest, in imitating thera :   As for me, who had it not unplea-
sing at that time, it was impoftible for me to sing, and howsoever I constrained my
sels, I could not call to mind so much as one air, albeit I knew many. This enter¬
tainment lasted so long, that at length, the hour of our departure being arrived,
1 returned to GeneuaybuK. so sad and nielancholick, that to conceal my unquietness
from my'Sather, I resolved not to see him .all that evening: I retired then to ray
chamber as soon as I was come home,and gave my people order to say,that sinding
my sels somewhat ill I was gone to bed, having sirst expresly charged them to make
no noise : Aster this 1 went into ray Cabinet, where I was no sooner alone, but

m&lt;.i e I considered this enterprize, the more 1 judged it, impollible ; the   arrogant

disiiailt to be forced ; but that which put me into surther despair, was the thought
that IjaL'clia her sels would be inslexible to my Love: For, said 1, is.it polsiblep
that a maid, who hath been brought up with the hate ofthe Juslimanoesy who no
sooner op-ned her eyes, but ihe beheld my house as her cnemie, can resolve, I do
III It say, to love, but only to indurc that I (hould adore her.    These divers agitati¬
ons troubled me in such fort, as I could not form any design;  but whereas love
cannot subsist without hope, I think that in the end I had surmounted my passion,
and broken my chain.":, is that satality which will have me ruined, had npt expofed
mc once again to a new danger.    I was scarcely out of my bed, when as my peo¬
ple told me, that I was invited to the Wedding of one of my Sathers sriends, who
wastolu iiKuied to amaidallied to Isabella y this news silled me with extreme
joy, and preparing to go thither, I took more care of my sels, than ever I had
iliji'c in all my lise before: But being resolved to see the arrivall of mine enemy, I
got mc ill good time to the place appointed for the Ball;   1 was no longer there
than to make the compleiuents, which are usuall in such like occasions, whcnas I
saw IsibelLi enter with such a dazeling M.ajesty, as impofed silence to all the compa¬
ny, and it seemcd that (he had inspired every one with modesty and respest.    Aster
that this dumb admiration had continued a while, there was a consused noise heard
of aicLunationsand piaises, which were given to her beauty; and the truth is
that envy it sels could not sind any thing in her to be amended. She hath a stature
s o ad\ antagious, and a port so majesticall, as never was there woman seen of a bct-
tcrprelence. Herhair is of colour brown, but so beautisull, as all thofe threads
&lt;.)s bmnishedgold, wherewith our Poets use to describe such, cannot represent
them; they sell that day carelesly upon her cheeks, and thence descended in thick
curls down her neck and bofoni, but with a negligence so replenistied with address
that It desaced the handtomert curiofity of all the women ofthe Assembly.    She
h.nth a complexion so white and vive, as there is no whiteness that seems not sal-
ou iinto It; but the (ame is mingled with so dainty a Carnation, whirh is stied a
bro.id Ml her checks, that the mixture of Lillies and Rofe?, of Cynopcr and Snow

<p>yet arc her looks so modest, and so sar from all artisice, as it is very easie to know
that they are innocent of all the evills which they make one endure.   She hath a
mouth neither too great nor too litde, butso compofed, and of so Vermilion a
hew, as there is no corrall that comes neer it.   Her teeth arc so evenly set, and so
white, as never were smiles so sull of charms as hers; and her bofom so delicate
and so comely, as imagination cannot represent it to it scls such as it is: There
is also a gracesulness mingled amongst all these marvclls, which cannot be exprest,
and which renders her more amiable than all that which I have delivered. To
conclude, be it for the whole form of the sace, or for all the seatures of it in par¬
ticular, or for the air in  generall, it is the moftpersest beauty that ever Nature
produced.    But, my Lord, had the souldiers that took me, lest me the  pisture
which I had of her, and the Letters which slie had written to me,  I could have
made thy Highness see the truth of my words, and that the graces of her mind do
no whit give place to thofe of herbeauty: It was then, my Lord, that Isabella
withall thofe allurements, appeared in that Assembly.    She was apparelled in a
Gown of Carnation Sattin, imbroidered with gold and pearls, whereof the sleeves
werebuttonedup with great Diamonds; the rest of her habit was of cloth of sil¬
ver, imbroidered with Pearls and Emeraulds intermixt. She appeared so charming
unto me in this estate, as I could not for all that evening take mine eyes from oti
her; and as I caresully observed her, me thought she perceived that 1 did not be¬
hold her asancnemie, and to render my joy yet more accomplislied, I marked
how she blushed every time that we met together in the same Brawl, but in a sa(hi-
on which perswaded mc, that it was neither for hate, nor for anger.    And where¬
as it is the custom of Genoua not to converse with the women of an Assembly, but
in leading them to dance, I took out oneof mykinswomen, whom I had seen all
the evening with Isabella, and that I might oblige her to speak to me of her, I said
unto her, that I sound it very strange she should hold such intelligence with mine
enemy; but without giving mc leave to sinisli my speech, slie answered me that the
talk they had together wasso ad vantagious for me,   as I had no reason to com¬
plain of it; and that as the praises which arc given us by our enemies, are more
glorious for us, than others, because they cannot be suspested of slattery, I was no
longer to doubt of my good meen and address, since Isabella her sels had judged
of it in savour of me, upon speaking of the grace and dancing of every man of
the Company.    This discourse ravished me in such fort, as I could not forbear
looking on Isabella, as is I would thank her for so savourable a judgement; and as
she hath a quick and piercing wit, sbe knew both by my demeanor and joy, that
mykinswomanhad given me an account of their talk, which pofsest her with so
much consusion, as it was impofsiblc for me all the rest of the evening to incounter
her eyes. At length, my Lord, the company being separated, I returned home, but
so sull of joy and hope, that my reason sound not it sels any longer strong enough
to oppofc my passion.    But not to stand on the recitall ofthese sirst proceedings
of my assestion, wherewith I have already but too much importuned thy H'ghness,
it will sussice to let thee understand, that in the continuance of this happiness I
{■i.v^ Isabella in two or three Assemblies more, from whence 1 alwayes went still
better sat issied; and aster I had beenso hardy, as to write divers times unto her,
and ready enough to sinde the means to do it, I knew at length that my vows were
notrejested, and that my temeritie stiould not be punished.   I obtained then the
permission to serve her, provided I were discreet, and that neither by my .astions,
nor by my discourse, I sliould give any cause of suspesting our intelligence : I ob¬
served this order foreligiously, that albeit there passed not a day wherein I saW
her not at her window, or an evening wherein I had not a Letter from her, or (he
from me, yet was no body ever aware of our commerce.    And to render my
good fortune more accomplislied, it hapned that the people being sallen into a mu-
tinie in the Isle of Corsca for some Contribution that sliould have been est'blistied

i.ressed me to tell him, whether his presencc would not be necessary for me there,

only to receive//^^s/Z^s^ Letters by the Cabinet-window, which opened towards
the Grot of the Eccho, and that in the same place I hoped to see and speak with
her. He was so surprized with this discourse, that he stood a good while beholding

lofe time , as soon as I knew that Rhodolpho was departed, and that Isabella was
at ^rs«*t with her mother, 1 resolved to go thither the same evening; now to do
thatsccretly,! told my Sather, that having made a match with Casar Doria, (^for
lo was that sriend of mine called} we intended to go and pass away some time
at an house which he had neer to Gaui, to hunt the wild Bore, and to injoy all the
delights that the sields and solitude could give us.    He approved of my resoluti¬
on, told methat the season was too sair to be passed wholly in the City, and per¬
mitted me to go away that very day; 1 went then and sound out DoriUy who for
his part had taken care to make the same thing to be believed; and having but
one Groom ()t the chamber with us, we took the way of (74«/, but as soon as we
were out of the sight of Csw/^, we crofsed the Mountain to get to Arena, where,

that 1 would not sail to be at the window, had for a pretext to get thither, and be
alone there, taken a Lute, laying that (he vvould at leisure study an air, which stie

<p>so ravislied to hear her, that notvvithlsanding the desire 1 had to speak to her, yet
would I not interrupt her,  though I insinitely seared lest she (hould be called away
before I had been seen of her; but in the end the sruition of a present pleasure
prevailed over the sear cs an uncertain evill. I heard her then with all the admi¬
ration  I was capable of:   For, my Lord, slie hath a voice so strong, so clear, so
sweet, and so chaniiing, as slie inspires the minds of thofe that hear her, with
the same passions which slie cxpresseth by the airs slie sings; and vvhereas night and
silence are the sriends of Musick, there rested nothing more to make my content¬
ment persest, thantoaddeto the delight of hearing, that of seeing distinstly: I
was not kng without enjoying that happiness, for the Moon, which had been a
pretty while up before, made an end of distipating of the sbadow that had reign¬
ed all over the Garden, and in rendring me that good ofsice , slie made me also
to be perceived of her, sothat she presently gave over singing, and approached to
the place where I was, but with so much circumspestion, and so much sear, as
made me greatly to pitty her.    She prayed  me with a trembling voice to give
her a Letta' is I had any, and that the next day, is I would let her down a Isrine,
sbe v;ould sassen her answer to it.    Aster I had laboured to assure her as much as
pofsibly I could, she made me to understand, that we could not have any long con¬
versation in that same place without being discovered, because is we spake softly
it wculdbc unprofitable unto us, not being able to hear one another; and is we
raised our voices,it were to be seared that we should be over-heard from a clofe ally
that was not sar ofs.    I consented then to be contented with seeing her, and recei¬
ving her Letters by the way she had propounded unto me; but whereas I had my
design concealed, I besought her to tell me in what part her lodging was, tothe
end i might atleasswise have the pleasure to imagine to my sels the place where'
she would be writing.    But before she anl'wered me, she looked round about, to
observe whether she might not be over-heard ; aster which she demanded of me,
is I did not see on my  lest-hand a Turret athwart the trees, which was joyn-*
ing to the end of a Gallery, that made up one sront of the Garden, and that an¬
swered to another altogether like imto it &gt; and having told her that I saw it, slie
added that her chamber was of an even sloor with that same place; and that the
perron of it was just against the end of the clofe alley, from whence slie seared to
DC over-heard ; and that is I would advance forth my head a little, I might see
the grateof her window.    As soon as slie had said this, (he went away, having
sirst assured me, that such evenings as slie could not come her sels to receive my
Letters, she would send a mayd to me that lay in her chamber, in whom slic
absolutely consided.    Asi:er stie was retired, and clean out of sigbc, I went pre¬
sently and sound out my sriend, to whom I gave an account of our conserence.
But, my Lord, seeing I must obey thy Greatness, in recounting asl my adventures
unto thee,  I must say, that aster I had been three or sour dayes obedient to/-
sabellaes   pleasure ,   one evening slie sent me that mayd which slie made use
of,  with   a Letier, desiring rae tp cxcuse her is slic came not her scls ;  for
that being somewhat ill in the morning ,  (he could not invent a pretext  to
obtain permission to come  into the Garden according to  her custom.    This
news grieved   nie exceedingly, and so throughly consirmed me in my desigrt,
that to execute it, 1 enquired -whether Isabella were retired to her chamber ? The
mayd told mc, that slie had lest her at her window, staying till slie returned, which
stie was instantly to do, because the doors would suddenly be sliut, for the keys
were to be c.nried to her mother, who had commanded that to be cxastly observed.
I threw her down my Letter then, and having dismissed her, I wentand desired
Dorta toassist rae in the rcsolmjoni had taken to descend into the Garden.    He
did all that he could to hinder me from is, but aster I had told him, that lex-

sick, and that in conclusion, I sliould enter into an house where there were none
but sleeping Women,  the rest of the train being at Genoua, or gone with Rhodolpho-

wy s^word with rae, whereupon I descended into the Garden, and calling to mind
that the clofe alley was corresponding to//^^.//^^Hodging, I went along through
it, forsearof being perceived, either srora the Gallery, or the mothers chamber ;
when 1 was arrived at the end of the alley, I observed that there was no light '"

gence wherein 1 saw her, as 1 knew well, that art added nothing to her beauty. She

th.at there was less danger in speaking with her, when all the World was retired,

<p>chance into the street where he was set upon.   Rhodolpho was so ravistied with this
discourse, as he could not forbear imbracing me,   and saying alowd,  that as the
conservation of his honor was more dear unto him, than that of his lise,  the care
I took to desace the stain  which he had made in it, obliged him more streightly,
than the blood I had shed to save his. As I would have answered, he ttayed me, and
went away to give order for all that he thought was necessary,  both for his sasety,
and mine. And whereas D«'/. dwelt not sar ofs,   he came not long aster into the
chamber where 1 was, but so surprised, and so amazed , to hear that 1 was woun¬
ded, to see me in Rhedolphoes house, and to sind Jstbella and Julta siting by my beds
side, that he was a long time in a doubt, whether   he was well awake, or no. Rho¬
dolpho, having been advertised that he was arrived, came and entertained him with
so much civility, and spake so advantagiously of me, as I was conttrainedtopray
him to change his discourse ,   and to think rather of the neccssity of our assaires,
than of praising me unjustly. Doria was instrusted then in the estate of things,and of
our intentions; .RWo//)/jo desired him to tell my sather,   that he would have gone
home to him , is 1 had not hindred him, to crave pardon for all that had past be-
t wixt them, and to intreat him to think well of it, that his daughter might be the
reward of the combat, which I had so happily undertaken for his desence; how
he was not ignorant, that Isabellahid been more equall than  he, in estecming of
me as soon as stie knew me ; and that for him he was not so ill informed of my dc¬
signs, but that he had been advertised of thofe which I had for his daughter; in
the end so to do, said he to Deria, that the Samilies of the Jujlimanoes and the Gr/-
maldies may be united with an indissoluble knot: More than this I have not to
say, Lodovico knowes the Nobility of my House, undcrstands the riches of it, and
cannot doubt but thatthe Principality of Monacoviill one day be Isabellaes. Do¬
ria ovomised to imploy all his address to make the matter succecd according to
our desires. ^o^o/p^is instantly requcstedhim, I earncstly conjured him, ind Isabella
with her eys only intreated him thereunto. He went then to my Sather,who was so
surprised with every thing that ror/4 imparted unto him,as he divers times asked
of him,whether he had not loft his understanding:what,said he,as I knew asterw.irds
by Por/.j in one very hour hath my sonne saved the lise of his enemy? hazarded
his own by the wounds which he hath received &gt; killed the enemy of Rodolphot
made peace between the Juslinianoes and the Grimaldi es ? and for a conclusion, hath
Isabella and the Principality of Monaco been ofsered him by Rhodolpho &gt; No , no ,
Doria, all that you tell me is sar from alllikelyhood ; you talk tome of blood,
of murther, of slaughter, of reconciliation, and nuptials all at once; how doc
you think that I can accord all these things, and can joy and gries be compatible?
But in the end, my Lord, that sirst transport being over, Doria assured the matter so
seriously untohim, as he was constrained to make no longer doubt of it.   I con¬
sess that in this incounter I was more happy than I hoped ; for as soon as my sa¬
ther was periwaded to this truth,  Deria sound his mind in the terms that I desi¬
red. 1 think, my Lord, Ihave already told thy Highness, hovi ledovico never ap¬
proved of that unjust hatred, which passeth with  the succession ofKinsmen, and
that was the reason why he was so easily carried to what I wislied.  He came then
accompanied with Dor;.? and some of his servants; tothe house of Rhodolpho,-who
received him with a sree and open countenance, and with such strong protestations
of acknowledgement and amity, as it was easie to observe, that his eyes and his

hard to imagine, that thofe twomen, who so kindly embraced one another, had

that aster h-e had his word for it, they might think of that which was necessary to
be done for their sasety.     My sather turning himsels then to me, said, that
hee  held   it  supersluous   to ask   my advice in a matter  that was   so   glo¬
rious for rae, and that I had sb happily resolved upon without him; so that,
saidhe, taking/A^(s//&lt;«by the hand, it ison you that the conclusion of this im¬
portant assair doth depend,    ^nt Rhodolpho seeing her blusli, without daring to
answer, told Lodovico, thathi% daughter could no better express her consent, than
by ihat sliamesastnest, which madehertoblusii and be silent; the modesty of her
lex, and of her dispofition not permitting her to testisieher joy, but in such a man¬
ner.    Rhodolpho and my sather then promised an inviolable sriendship one to ano-
ther,and ordained us to do the like in their presence;  and for a gage of this pro¬
misc, Lodovico, who ordinarily wore a rich ring on his singer, took it to me for to
give to Isabella, as a pledge of the saith which we had promii'cd to each other,    i
observed this ceremony with Ad much pleastire, as spight of my miseries and hurt
I never selt the like before, nor since ; but at length, aster this happy  accord , they
retired into another chamber to think ofwhat they sliould do : My Sather was
of the opinion^ as well as Rhodolpho, that he sliould (end to make his complaint as
soon as the Concell (liould be assembled ; bit that he held it not sit eidier for him
or me to stay in his house; that die Samily of the SpinUois were powersull enough
to keep themselves from having any manisei^ injustice done them;   and that albeie
their kinsnian had been the agresfor in that sight, yet the Laws Wonld have the
dead always to be savoured ,  and that he which had killed any one sliould be al¬
ways punislied; thatforthis reason he was to retire to his Principality of Mona-
c&lt;7, where he .Slight attend sasely and coramodiously the sticcess of things; th^tc
place being in a situ.ition soadvantagious, and so well fortisied, as it could keep
outaRoyallArmy; that as for me, I sliould sinde an  inviolable sastuary in the
Army of the Emperor Charles, whom I had aheady served;  but whereas I Was
not in an estate to travell, by reason of my wounds, which peradventure would
keep rae a long time in my bed; and for that also he could not go out of the Ci¬
ty presently, because the gates were stitit, he advised that without surther delay
and before the day appeared,,  I stiould   be transported into   some other housb!
whereof the Master wasso much rcspested, as no violence might be seared there
RhoMpho and Doria approved of thispropofition, and began to bethink them what

<p>doubted that some   urgent matter had brought him thither ;   wherefore he de¬
manded of him, whether he were so happy as to be able to serve him ?    Then my
sather recounted unto him in sew words all that had besallen mc , wherewith
he was so strangely surprised; but without giving him leave to make his rcquest
he to told him ,   that he was too blame in not causing him to be brought to his
house. And when my sather answered him, that he durst not doc it before he had
intreated him thereunto,   Simbaldo secmed to be ofsended with that circumspesti¬
on, but since the sault was done, he vvould pardon it upon condition,  that him¬
sels might go and help to convey me thither. And so calling to his servants he com¬
manded them to make him ready with all speed.   My sather did all that he could
to stay him from going, but could not prevail ,  for Simbaldo told him ,  that the
Spinolaes were violent, and that peradventure meeting them in the street a second
misfortune might happen , that when he sliould be present with all his train, he
could not believe they would be so daring, or so stroug, as to set upon us.    My sa¬
ther then consented to what he pleased, and he being quickly ready,   they parted
instantly to go to Rhodolpho, who in the mean time had setled his domestick assaires.
When Smibaldo was arrived,   and had represented to Rhodolpho how glad he was
of our reconciliation, be prayed my sather and him to arm all their people, and to
give order for whatsoever was necessary for the transporting of me ,   during the
which he approched to the bed where I lay, exceedingly asslisted to see them go¬
ing to separate me from Isabella, who was withdrawn to the other end ofthe cham¬
ber, when as Sinibaldo entred; but as  soon as he perceived it,  he told me that he
would not deprive mc of an happiness, which I was so suddainly to forego,and that
he stiould have leasure enough at  home to commend my valor ; that is he durst he
would have desired//.^ts//. to return thither again, but that he thought it sitter to
leave us at liberty together; herewith he went forth without  giving me time to
answer him ;   and he was no sooner out ofthe chamber, but putting  by the
curtain I  saw that Isabella was alone  there  ;    for the consusion ,   wherein
the house then was, had so bwsiedjuliay^ as slic never thought of that civilitie;
1 besought her then to comencarcr unto me, that I might bid her adew ;   at that
word the teares came into her eyes, and my speech saTTcd mc ;  she came then and
satedown by my bed side, with so much sadness painted in her sace ,  as much aug¬
mented mine; but aster I had inso reed my sels to speak, I said unto her; At length,
n\y dearest Isabella y   fortune hath joyned us,   and fortune doth separate us,  but
what rigor soever she doth exercise towards me,   slie cannot longer keep me from
dying with glory,   now that I have the honor to be yours; (he may indeed separate
our persons, and it may be for a long time, but slie cannot disunite our hearts,  is
so it be true, that your assestion is answerable to mine. You may judge, said stie in¬
terrupting me, whether a maid, that hath not seared to ofsend her glory, in loving
her enemy against the will of her Parents, be capable of change to a man that expo-
seth his lise for her sake,  and to save her sathers; believe then, and without ever
doubting, that all the powers ofthe earth, oppofed against my design, sliall not so
much as niake mc waver; and that Jsabella will be absolutely yours,  or never will
be any bodies. Her sighes sussocated her in such fort, as it was impofsiblc for her to
say more; and as I was about to give her thanks for so obliging a speech , and niin*
gle my teares with hers, Sinibaldo, Rhodolpho, Julia, Doria,   and ray sather came a-
gain into the chamber, so that all I couW do, wasto say unto her,    wringing her
hand, that she sliould alwaies remember her promises,  and that then slie should bo
moft assured ,  that nothing but death sliould separate us.    Immediately hereupon
they, which had order to carry me away, approched to my bed,   and by the com¬
mandment of Sinibaldo, seated me in a chair, that was prepared for me.   Rhodolpho,
\vho moft tenderly loved his wise, and daughter, began then to bid them sarewell:

<p>bad her to come unto me, and give me her hand.    To tell thee, my Lorcl, what I
selt in the moment of our separation would be impoftible for me,   [ince it is cer¬
tain that 1 had never so much gries, as I had at that time, in eloigning my sels from
Jsabella, but in the end I was to resolvc for it ;   and aster I had kissed her hand
without   speaking to  her   but with my eyes,    I was carryed away,   so loftj
as I do not remember the order that we held in the streetes ;   howbeit I was told
asterwards, that Simbaldo divided his men into two parts j and that I was placed
in the midst of them, where Rhodolpho and Doria had in charge not to abandon me,
whatsoever sliould arrive; Simbaldo put himsels into the head ofthe Troop,   and
my lather marched in the rear, to the end that on what side soever they were as-
saulted, a man of command and courage might still be there.   But whereas the
Spinolaes knew not that we were retired to Rhodolphoes house,  they never thought
of lying in wait for us, so that we got to Sinibaldoes without any bad incounter ;
Aster I was laid in bed, he and my sather advised, that it would be easier for Rho¬
dolpho to get away to Monaco as soon as it was day, than is he stayed longer, be¬
cause his enemies had not had leisure yet to think and consider of all, that might
hurt, or help them ; to that purpofe they judged it sit to disgnise him like a Mari¬
ner, and to put him into a Seluca, which might easily carry him to that place of
sasety. KWo//'^o consented to whatsoever they thought good, and Simbaldo took
upon him the care of dispatching the business: He sent then to the Port as soon
as day began to appear, to hire a Seluca, upon condition it sliould part presently j
and that the Master of it shoisld lend one of his habits ; the moiiey which was ofse¬
red to this man, was so much, as ravistied with this incounter,  and without sur¬
ther inquiry, he said that he was ready to part,   and that for one of his habis he
would lend it, so as he might be permitted to goe home to his house,  because he
had none there. He that made the bargain agreed he should do so ,   but for sear he
should discover any thing he would goe with him. The Master ofthe Seluca, who
thought of nothing but his gain, was contented with it; away they went together
to setch that habit, and that done, he lest that man in the guard of one of his sel-
lowcs, whom he had brought thither with him, and came and rendred an account
of his voyage. Immediately i?/jWo/;)/?o disguised himsels^,  and seeing it prettysar
day he took his leave of Simbaldo and my sather, who both of them promised him
to doe in his name all that they had resolved on, and whatsoever else they judged
would be requisite to procure li is liberty.   Lodovico and   heslieWed so much gene¬
rofity in this separation,  and  spake so obligingly one to another,   a% Sinibaldo
could not forbear telling them, that Spinola could not have been loft more profi¬
tably for the Common-VVealth , seeing his death had served to make two so great
and excellent men become sriends. When they had answered to this civility, J^^o-
&lt;io//&gt;^o came to me, withso much kindness , and such testimony of acknowledge¬
ment and sriendstiip, as I was sensibly touched therewith: He assured me once agaim
with oathes, that his daughter stiould be the reward ofthe blood which I had stied
for h im, provided I did not change my resolution.  The weakness wherein I was,
did not keep me from rendring  him thanks, as I ought,   forso obliging a dis¬
course; but at length he went away to sind out the Master  that waited for him:
Simhaldo did notlct him go without a guard ; he caused six of his servants to sol¬
low him aloof of, and he himsels went to the Port for to see him part. Rhodolpho
wassoforttinate,   that   he croft throughtheCity withoutmeetink any one that
knew him; he irabarqued himsels then with all pofsible speed,   and in a little time
arrived lascsy at Aso».s„, where he was received by his subjests with joy. ' As soon
asthcCouncellwasset, they  vvould have complained inKhodolphoesname^bnt
they sound themselves prevented by the spacc of a quarter of an hour onely . and
that the sather of him whomlhad killed,   had accused me for the death of his
lonne: for though our sight was in the night, yet was I known by my voice    and
the sollowers of him that was slain had marked ,  hovv he and I were ineased in
a particular combat. This accusation appeared at sirst so unlikely to the Tudses

<p>inveterate hatred which was between the lujltniames and the Grimaldies, they could
not comprehend how I sliould be induced to sight for mine enemy.  As they wer9
in this pain, my Sather presented himsels to demand justice of them for the vio¬
lence had been done me, and to colour the matter he told them ,  that passin^ by
chance along the street, I had seen Sptnola set upon Rhodolpho with so much advan¬
tage, as my generofity not able to indure it, I prcsendy resolved to labour the hin-
dring of that mischies, or is I could not, to side with the weaker party, as I have
done; that in this occasion I had been dangerously hurt; that nevertheless know¬
ing the power of the Spinolaes, and searing lest the Senate sliould be raisinformed
of the truth of the matter, I had absented my sels till such time as justicc was done
me.    My Sather made this discourse with such earnestness, and so advantagiously
for Rhodolpho, as iswas easie to discern that he was no longer his enemy.    But
whereas the assair was important, in regard it concerned three ofthe principall
Samilies of the City, they resolved nothing for the present, but reserred the mat¬
ter to the next day, with order notwithstanding to the Spinolaes to cause their wit-
nesses to be examined the day sollowing.    This news was instandy spread over all
the City, with so much admiration and astonishment, as no body could believe
it the sirst time they heard it; contrarily all thofe of Genoua said openly, how it
could not pofsibly be, for that the hatred which  passeth successively into the minds
of men cannot be extinguished in a moraent,and that by consequence it was net cre-
diblc,that I could pass from one extremity to another in an instant,and that I should
render to the greatest of mine enemies all that the dearest ofmy sriends could expest
from me.But as nothing can be long conccalcd,it was quickly known,that love had
begot sriendsliip,and that the passion which I had for Isabella,was the noble cause of
this adventurcTn the mean time the whole Common-wealth w^as divided; and al¬
though the sastion of Simbaldo were the stionger and moft considerable, and that
it was absolutely for us, yet could it not hinder the palling of an express order for
the searching out, and apprchension of us.    And whereas the dead party is al¬
wayes regarded, all the grace we could obtain was, that the  assair should not be
precipitated, and that it sliould be prolonged as much as the forms of Justicc
would permit. Whilst things past in this manner, I wrote every day to isabella,
who answered me with so much wit and sweetness, as I could not be but happy
in theconstraint wherein I lived.  Butat length my wounds being cured, I was a-
ihamed to remain sliut up in a house at  a time wherein I might make use of my
courage, and shewmy Judges that I was not a man to be cast away; howbeit I
selt an extreme violence for the executing of this resolution ; for though I were
deprived of the sight of Isabella, as well within Genoua, as is Ihadbecn saaher
ofl^ yet sound I for all that some content, in thinking that we were within the iu-
clofure of one and the same City ; but sense was to give place unco reason , and I
wasto sollow the will of 7/".^*//., which served much to make mc depart the ra¬
ther, for knowing the violence of my passion, slie imagined that being thoroughly
well, I would have much adoe to keep my scls from stcaling unto her some even¬
ing, according to the propofition I had made her to that purjpofc; so that to a-
void the mischies that might arrive to me thereby , stie pressed my departure: I
propounded it to my Sather, who approved of it; the dissiculty was to get forth of
&lt;;s»o«4 without danger; hut whereas Smibaldo never sound any thing dissicult to
serve his sriends, he told us, that he had an insallible means for to do it; that I
sliould but only get me in the night to his Galley, which being ready to set sail,
to go and joyn'withthe Squadron of Corsica y sliould for my occasion take the
course of SeslroyViherel stiould be received as in a place that depended on him,
and from thence I might easily go to Ligome in aTartana.    This order was cx¬
astly observed, but before my departure 1 desired to conser with Doria in private;
I conjured him then totake a speciall care to send me news of Isabella, as often
as pofsibly he could; and that he sliould not sail to write me punstually even the
least things that concerned her.    Dona promised to satissie ray desire all that he
might, and to forget nothing that he thought would content mej I mtreated

conclude, ray Lord , I can tell by long experience, that thy Greatness hath ex¬
traordinary lights for all that may be comprehended by a h-imane  spirit ; and
it is out of this knowledge, that I have have not explaned my sels more at large
in many places of my narration, which certainly arc not intelligible in all the ex¬
tent of thy Empire, but which cannot be ignored by the moft knowing, the mofs
mighty, and the moft vistorious Monarch of the World.    Soliman, not able
longer to endure these praises, given him by I bi^ah tm, sayd unto him smiling,
that hee had not permitted him to speak, but onely of his Adventures, and
that to obey him exastly, he was to pursue his dilcourse without slattering him.
The Bassa,  returning no other answer, butalowobeysance, continued the course
of his History in this fort: Icame then my Lord, to the Emperor of theChrissians,
vvho received nie, 1 dare say^ with jcy and kindnes5;he rcmcmbred still the services
I   had  him,   and in  consideration thereof vvould have given me imploymenc
ill his Army : But whereas I was uncertain ofthe continuance of my voyage, and
was rather well assured, that is my business was dispatchcd at Genoua, I should
instantly be gone, I excused my sels the best I could, and went and served amongst
the Voluntiers.   I lived then aster this manner without any other unquietness,
than what absencc brings along with it, which though it be somewhat harsli to a
man that is passionately inlove, yet tollerable tome through the pleasure that
I had done in receiving Letters from//.^&lt;?//.t : but I was not long in this conditi¬
on ; for three moneths ast:er my departure  I underssood the de?.th of Rhodolpho-^ I
knew that y«/;. and her daughter  were at Monaco; and to take all comfort sro n^
nie, my sather wrote me, how that allthe grace that could be obtained of the Se¬
nate, was the banisliing of me for ever from all the Territories of the Repub-
ru^uc, and that upon pain of lofing my head is I were sound in any part of them.
I ;cccivcd the news with so muchangUisliof mind, as I thought I sliould have dy¬

..ssliaion ut Isabella, which I saw so well described in a Letter that slie wrote me

<p>Upon mc to comfort her, and not to think of going to Monacoy till I heard from
her ; but at length, aster I had a while deserred writing unto her, I sent her word
that I would alwaies very exastly sollow her direst ions; that I besought her for
all that to consider, how I could not do better, seeing slic could not dispofe of her
sels, than to come to Monaco, vihere y without searing the violence of our encraie^-
we might live and rest in sasety; that theSpmolaes were not powersull enough to
raise an Army for to set upon us there, and that the Republique would not of a
particular interest make a generall cause ; that for the rest, time, it may be, Would
change the order of things; that sometimes sentences had been revoked less uniust
than that which banistied me, and for men that were not of the samily of the
Jusimiamesy and that peradventure were not more profitable for the publique
good : In the end I did all that I could to obtain permission to come unto her • I
wrote also unto Jultay with so much resentment of thatlofs, which was more con¬
siderable tome, than it was grievous unto her. Asfor my sather, I sent him word
that I would buy out my liberty with my blood, being resolved to perform such
brave things in the Wars, as my Judges, and mine enemies themselves ssiould wish
to see me again ; but that for the executing of so noble a design, he was  toper-

<p>him, I prayed him to soUicite y«//Vi, whenhertcars wercdryedup, toaccomplish
Rhodolphoes promisc. For Doriay I conjured him again to be caresull in curiously
informing himsels whether Isabellaes mind were as sirm in this incounter as ssi-
had made me hope it would be ; for I well foresaw, that J«/z., who, notwithstand¬
ing our reconciliation, had never loved mc, would bring some obstacle to my de¬
sign. Aster 1 had dispatched away my pacquet, I remained in so extraordinary
an unquietness, that I could not settle my mind on any objest, but such, as being
ingenious to persecute me, ofsered every minute to my thoughts the image of a
new misfortune; but how intentive soever it was, I could not foresee that which
arrived unto me. As I was in this deplorable estate, 1 understood by a Letter from
Doria, that my sather being insinitely asslistedfor my banisliment, was dead of a
Seaver, the verysameday thathe wrote this to me; and that to secure his estate
unto me, he had past it over to the Count of Lauagna, who questionless would con-
serve it saithsully for me. I must consess, my Lord, that the lofs so sliaked my con¬
stancy, as it was ready to sail, and I proved in this occasion, that theapprehen-
sionsof Nature are more powersull than all others; and to leave no place for
me to doubt of it, I had almoft forgot/p^s/^^ in this my sirst transport; but as¬
ter that reason had combated with gries, and that I was able to look upon my di-
stemper with a Calmer eye, I sound it yet sar greater than at sirst I had believed it
to be : I saw all at once, both the lofs of my Sather, and that too of my Mistris;
no way doubting but that it would be hard for me to carry Julia to that I desired,
there being no body now that had any interest to make her keep her word. Cer-
t tin dales aster this sad news I received onely a ticket from//.^s///», wherein con¬
trary to her custom I perceived some consusion, with an absolute command not
to hazard my sels as yet to come to Monaco, because her mother had told her, that
having much wealth inGenoua, slie would give some order to her assairs, for sear
of lolnig it, is slie sliould sofoon receive rae into her State and alliance; aster this
she made me a protestation of sidelity, but in suchtearms, as made me judge that
she hadnotexpressed all her thoughts: Yet was it not this ticket, that begot my
dispair and my sury ; a Letter from Dw., which I had received the same way,
cleared this anigma moft cruelly for me ; by it I learned, that the Prince of Mas-
seran, whofe state is situate between Piedmont, Montserrat, and the MUlanese , being
imbarqucd at nlia-Srnnca to pass unto Naples, where he had means, and busine ss,
hid been caught by so surious a tempcst three Leagues from the Port, thax all the
Pilots skill could not keep him from sussering sliipwrack before Moyaco, where
this Prince had been so fortunate as to save himsels by leaping into the boat, just

disputed with my sels, I resolved to go in person to Isabella, and demand a rea¬
son of her, why stie had not acquainted me with her new conquest ; for intheendj
sdd 1 I will have the satissastion to adore her innocent, or to hate her guilty.
But as'the body and the mind are sb straitly allyed together, thatthe one cannot
slitter without the other, I sell sick the very same day I was to depart, andsovio-
lendy, as the Emperors Physicians, who by his order vihted me every day, were out
©s hope of saving me ; and verily had I not had a spark of hope remaining, that
IsabtllayNas not inconstant, Ihadrcsused all the remedies which vvere given me,
and that were powersull enough to recover me throughly.    But as is the health of
the body had not been bestowed on me, but for the better supporting the evills of
the mtnd,l received my deaths wound by a Letter from Doria,vihich gave mS to un-
dcrstandjthat Isabella had maried the Prince of Ma(seran,and that to put it out of all
doubt, he had learned it from Selicianaes own mputh, who not enduring her
Mistrtsses insidelity, without sliewing her resentment thereof, had been turned
away out of thePrincesses service ; he wrote me also, that since the lastPac-'
quct which he sent mCjhe never had received any news from that inconstant one;that
Julia had made a journy to Genoua a little before that unlucky wedding,without her
daughter in her company,where (he had publiihed that that mariage sliould suddain¬
ly be solemnisedjthat having been advertised of it,he had gone to her for to demand
of her,   whether she would dislionor her sels in rendring so little respest to the
ashes of her dead hus'band, as to sail the promise which he had made me ? That her
daughter v/as no longer hers, seeing I had bought her with my blood, and the lise
of Rhodolpho; that it wiasa payment, and not a grace, which he required of her; and
that at last he was resolved to carry things to extremity rai^^er than indure to have
this injustice done me ;  that to all this slie had answered peremptorily, how her
daughter should never mary a man that wasbanislied from his Country ,  and that
isl would have promisc kept with me , 1 sliould come and solicit the performance
of it at GemuA; and that aster slie had said sb, how ssie had lest him , and would nor
hear him speak aword more. I leave it to thy Highness to imagine the deplorable
clhi; e, w hereinto this adventure put me,  it was so strange, that all my passions re¬
ducing themselves into one, I had nothing but sury remaining;   and despairso
sully seized upon ray soul, as I thought no longer of revenging my sels of Julia ,
nor lelaiting the outrage which I had received from the Prince of Majseran, nor
of punishing the insidelity of IsabelU, but my design was wholly then to makea-
way (els, and to exercise upon mine person all the cruelty which the crimes of o-
thershaddeserved. This deadly thought was so deeply setled in my heart, as is my
Religion had not with-held me,  I had killed my sels; but at length I resolved to
go and die like a man of courage, and in a place where I sliould never hear IsabelU

<p>named, and where Dona sliould not sind mc : I concluded then to pass into Swetli-
land, whofe King was at that time in War with the Done, with a purpofe to expofe
my sels to so many perils, as I might dye nobly in some one of thera; resolving yet
surther, that is fortune sliould work a prodigie in preserving me, to go and consine
my sels into the horrid deserts of Sinland. I stole away then secretly, and without
taking leave ofthe Emperor I  imbarqucd my sels upon the Baltique Sea, where
1 had not been three daies, but they ofthe Vessell,  wherein 1 was, discovered the
Sleet of that valiant King of Algier, Chairadin Barbarofa,  whom a drcadsull tem-
pest had driven into that Sea.     This incounter gave me as much joy, asitcaused
tear in them with whom I was; for I verily believed that I sliould soon set a peri¬
od to my paines, by sinding on the Sea that, which I went seeking for on the land :
And whereas I persestly spake the German tongue, I represented unto them, that
since there was nothing lest to our choice, but death , or slaverie, being not able
to sly, for that the wind was contrary to us,it was better generously to resolve for
die sirst ,   thanto submit our selves to the other; thatthe lofs of liberty being more
grievous and shamesLll,than that of lise, they were at the least to sell it dearly: In the
end, my Lord,! animated them in such fort, as against all apparcnccthey resolved,
not onely to sight, but to goe and boord the sirst vessell that should advance.  This
resolution was no sooner taken , but   Chairadin loofed two of his Sleet to come
up unto us; when they were within cannon sliot we discharged one against another
yvithout much essest, but suddainly they separated themselves to inclofe us, which
observed by us we vvould have retired, but the swistest ofthe tvvo having setched
us up, I presently boorded her; it was there, my Lord,   that I sought against ray
own good fortune, and that I laboured to lofe a lise,   which thou hsst rendred
precious unto rae, in preserving it since by a goodness    that never h.ad example,
and which thy power hath made happy in despight of the malice ofmy destinie:
I did then, my Lord, all that I could in this occasion to deprive rae of the honor
of being thy Highnes creature; but fortune, being resolved to save me, was adverse
to us, for to be savourable to me; for Chatradm, whon was unwilling to have this
vistory coft him dear,   and that saw well how we sought like desperate men ,
advanced with all his Sleet:  As soon as thofe of our Vessell perceived it,   their
weapons sell out of their hand,   and   I  was he alone that did not render my scls,
though it be true, that I lest not for all that to have the same sate, for having been
wounded in sour places, the lofs of blood weakned mc in such fort, as I sell down
1 ike one dead on the hatches; my swooning lasted so long ,   that I came not to my
sels again till I had been carried to another Vessell,  where allthe hurt men were
laid;^herel was drest amongst the rest, and intreated aster the same manner , untill
we came to Algier, where soon  aster I was sold to the Bassa Sinan, together with
three hundred others, which were destined to thy Highness; andso within a sew
dayes we were imbarqucd for Conslantinople, where I had the honor to be made thy
slave, and to wear chaines, which have been more glorious to me, than the pofscssi-
cn of an Empire, and which I would alwaies preser before liberty.  Aster this, my
Lord, I have nothing else to say unto thy Highness  concerning that    which re¬
gards the rest ofmy fortune, seeing it is the work of thy hands,  and that I could
nut bring it again to thy remcHibrancc without ofsending thy modesty,  knowing
well enough by experience,  that the image of thine own vertties makes thee cast
down thy lookes, and change colour:  I will not tell thee then by what meanes
thdii hast drawn me out of irons   for to raise me up to the greatest commands of
thy Empire, but I will onely say, that in the midst of this pomp, and of this glory,
I   am  in one day become the mott wretched of men; and not to keep thy Majesty
any loneer in suspence,   may it please thee to know,  that the generous slave, to
whom thy Highness hath given his lise, is the same Dona, whom thou hast heard
so oh en mentioned in my .adventures, that dear consident ofmy loves,and the moft

him to use him kindly till such time as he heard surther from him, not kiaowmg

coramanded him to break his chains ^forthwith, and to prpsecute his discourse.
Ibrahim would have sallen on his knees to have tVanked SoUman for thxt grace,
but he not sussering him injoyned him once again to satishc his desire;
and therefore cxastly to obey him, the Bassa continued in this fort. The
triumph being sinissied, I w.as no sooner in my Palace, but I sliut up my sels in my
Cabinet with that dear Slave; I will not tell thee, my Lord, the taking that Dorm
and I were in, since it is a thing that tuay be more easily imagined thaaspoken :
Doriaes amazement was so great to see me alive, to sind me in the habit which i
wear, and to oblerve me in the rank which I hold, as his reason above an hundred
times gave his eyes the lie : As for me, I was no less surprised to see him at Con-
siantinonle, and to imbrace him in the habit ofa Slave, than he was to behold im
with a Turbant. Our sirst motions of joy being over, I consess, my Lord, that my
sirst thought was for Isabella; well now, said I unto him, my dear Doria, hath the
Prince of Masseran triumphed over all my hopes , and hath he rendred himselt
pofsesfor of an happiness which he did not deserve, and which I thought I had
been Master of? 1 had not so soon made an end of speaking, when as Doria sell to
demand pardon of me, to accuse himsels o^ too much precipitation, to Commend
the constancy of Isabella,and to blame my despair ; but because this-discourse was
ot^scure, I requested him to clear it unto me : Whereupon he told ma, that Juli4
Vi/as no longer amongst the number of the living that the Prince of Majserajt waa
dead, at\d that IsabelU was never his wise ; but to particularize this unexpested
event, thou mayest be pleased to understand, that as ibon as Julia perceived the
PriHcc of Maserans love to IsahlU, ihe resolved, leeing the authority:'wholly ia
her sels by the dcith of her husband, to make that secret hatred (hz had alwayes
born me to slasli out; whereunto also may be added, that this woman being ambi¬
tious, it may be the Title of a Soveraign blinded her, and carried her to that cru¬
ell design of dcstroying all our pleasures; to attain the more easily thereunto, stie
thought It would be sit utterly to break ofs our commerce, which was not very
hard for her to do, for Monaco is seated onthe height of a great Mountain, almoft
maccessible on the three sides; the other which looks to the Sea is so steep, as one
cannot behold It without horror; there rests then bat one winding way which
ieadethto the Port, so that whereas this Town hath but one onely avenue, and
hath alwayes a Garrison in it, it was easie spr her to keep the Princess-from recei¬
ving any mtelligcnce from me, or giving me any; without doubt it was the sear

<p>juliavjasto perswade every one that this mariage was acconiplissied, tothe end
that is 1 were advertised thereof, I might be capable of some extreme resolution,
either upon mine own person, or on that ofthe Princes, or on hers, which i could
not execute without going into a place where I sliould lofe my head is I were
sound there. This design wasso well carried, that all they of Monaco beleeved
it themselves, and made others to bcleeve it. This universall error, it may be, had
not for all that been sastned on Doria, is Julia had not taken a particular care to
make him bcleeve what all the world beleeved; and indeed to speak the truth, no
body could have exempted himsels from this impofture : For this woman, having
suborned Seliciana with gists and great hopes, made a ssiew of chasing her away
with violence, and to make the matter be publissied the better, she sent her back
to Genoua, where she was no sooner come but ssie repaired to Dona all in tears. I
think thy Highness remembers, that this mayd had alwayes been Jsabellaes con(i-
sident, thou wilt not sind it strange then is P^'/rs did not doubt of her discourse,
when the assured him with a seigned forrow, that the Prince of Majseraa ha¬
ving maried the Princess with her own consent , and not being able to forbear
telling her of the promises which shee had made to mee , ihe had been ill-
intreated both by the Mother and the Daughter , vvho had driven her a-
way outragioasly. It was by this artisice, my Lord, that Doria was dccei-
vcci; and whereas this newes troubled him, and pofsest him with sury, he
wrote it unto mc as soon as he heard it, as I have already declared unto thy
Highness. But this man, whofe high and generous spirit makes the interests of
his sriends more sensible to him than his own, understanding that thePrince of
Majseran was at Genoua, resolved to punissi him, and revenge me; and for this es¬
sest he caresully informed himsels of the place where moft commonly he was, but
fortune, that intermeddles with all things,savoured his enterprise, by Icting him
know, that the day sollowing he was to go and see the stately Palace of Andrea
Doriahii nearKinsman, and whereas it was out of the City, he judged this op¬
portunity too advantagious to be neglestcd, imagining rightly thathe would go
thither with little company, since, as I have before delivered, he viasatGenoua
unknown. The matter sailed not to sall out even as he had conceived it; for he
was advertised that the Prince of Majseran was in this walk attended but with
two of his servants ; he went forth then speedily with the like number, and over¬
taking him in a place where sew persons could be witnesses of his astion. As
soon as he wasso near him, as he might speak to him, he asked him whether he
knew my name, and whether it were pofsible he stiould be ignorant that Isabella
could not lawsully be his, because stie was mine &gt; but since the thing was done, he
must at least render himsels worthy of so noble a conquest by the lofs of his lise,
as I had bought it with my blood; in saying so they both drew outtheirswords,
and Dtria without attending the Vrince of M'aserans answer, attacqued himso vi-
goriously, as he was constrained to give ground: They that accompanied him
would have oppofed themselves to this sury, but they that sollowed Deria would
not susser them so to do; and whereas they were equall in number, they began a
just combat, whereof the modesty of my sriend kept him from telling me the pai^
ticulars; but in the end, notwithttanding whatsoever the Prince of Ma seran could
perform, the vistory sided with reason, and Deria, aster the receiving of a slight
hurt pressed his enemy with somuch courage, as he ran him into the body in
sour'severall places, which made him sall down as is he were dead : A minute
aster. Nature doing her latt devoir, he opened his eyes, and seeing Doria coming
from parting their sollowers, and giving order to his help to carry him to
some place, he had yet somuch strength, as to call him, and before he expired to
crave pardon for the outrage he had done mc, and to pray me to consider the pow¬
er of ICabellaeseyes for theexcusing of his sault; moreover he conjured hmi to
tell methat the Princess had kept her saith inviolable to me;thcn he acquainted him
in sew words with all the violences of her mother, with al the rcsistances which
slic had made thereunto, and at the last swore that he was not he r husband, but that

<p>Julia had used this artisice, in hope to make mc away , as I have already told thy
H'ghness, not doubting but tlvat is I were dead slic should have carried her
daughter to all that slie had desired. Scarcely had that infortunate Prince made an
end of speaking,but he dyed in Doriaes armes, who with forrow remitted him int6
the hands of his servants, to goe and provide for his own sasety; so that without lo¬
sing time, and before this combat was divulged , he sent to hire a Seluca, and
without raurning into the City he imbarqucd himsels for Naples ; for
in the uncertainty of the event ofthe combat he had brought mony enough
aboiit him to mak his retreat into that place , and had lest a letter in
his Cabinet; which instrusted one of his sriesids With the order hee would
have taken in his assaires. He departed then sasely away in this fort, but the
next day he incountred the Pirate Arsalon, and in the manner, which thy
Highness understood yestcrday, became to Consiant mo pie .^utmj Lord, to make
all the rigor ofmy destiny known t6 thy Majesty, I am to tell thee sarther, that not
long since Doria hath met with a slave of Monaco, who hath related unto him , that
as sooon as Julia knew ofthe death ofthe Prince of Majseran, anger and gries seized
so upon her, as ssie died therewith in a little time; so that Isabella, seeing she
was Mistress of her sels, had sent a man into Germany to desire me to come and take
care of her State, and to receive her person for a reward ofmy sidelity : For she
knew nothing, cither ofmy jcalousie, or despair, which having carried me sar e-
iiough srora the place, whither ssie had sent to seek me, beguiled all her hopes, and
destroyed her selicity, by the sruitcless return ofhim (he had imployed unto me;
since that ssie lived in a very austere and melancholick solitariness, saying openly ,
that ssie was resolved to renounce the world, as soori as ssie knew, that I was no
longer in it. And whereas there ran a bruit in Genoua about a year ago, that I had
been seen in Naples, ssie dispatched away this man for to goe and see is it were soj
having made a vow , is his voyage proved vain, to ssiuthersels in aCloisserfor
all the rest of her lise; but whereas fortune hath never done any but extraodinary
things in ray adventures, ssie so wrought, that this than, putting himsels into a
Srench Barque to pass over thither, was taken by a Pirate, whofe vesltUs lay under
the covert of a Rock, which is near to a place by the Italians called Torto Hercoles.
And whereas he had a grat number of Slaves, he stayed not long from going to sell
them at one ofthe Islarids of the Archipelago, from whence by divers ace ideuts
this man camz to Conslantinople, where Doria by chance knew him , asliavinwac
other times seen him in Rhodolphoes service. Aster all this, my Lord, it^ill hot be
dissicult for thy Highness to imagine the deplorable estate wherein Isind my sels by
thy bounty, and by the propofition which thou hast made me concerning the Sul¬
tana Ajleria. I ssiould not be so hardy as to speak to thcc in these'tcrmes,iri did not
call to mind, that the charmes of the divine Roxelana have been of sussicient force
to vanquissithe moft vistorious Monarch ofthe world; and that for this reasoni
may hope to see thee sensible of my misfortune, to obtain pardon for my ingrati¬
tude, and to be heard in my justisications. It is true indeed, that to cxcuse my sault
1 need no more than to besecch thy Highness to consider,^ that isl could even banissi
from my heart the image of Isabella,forget her assestioh, her oathes, and her con-
stancie; become the mof^ ingratesull ofnien to his Princess; cause her death by my

<p>Will render my end more profitable and glorious, command rae to seek out death
lUthe midst of thine enemies, audi ssiallnotbe long without testisying by the lofs
of my lise, that lam not ingratesull, but because I cannot be acknowledging.
Andto incense thy just wrath, I will say surther, that the chastisement, which
I demand, will be instead of grace to-me, since that in depriving me of light, I (hall
no longer be sensible of all the misfortunes wherewith I am so heavily opprellcd;
1 ssiall cease to live, but I ssiall cease also from being rebellious to thy pleasure • I
shall restore the lise which 1 ow to the incomparable Asteria ; and I ssiall dye for
the ^ory of Isabella. In bries, my Lord, sincelcannotbe Astenaes, because my
love doth oppofe it, and my Religion doth forbid it; and since I cannot likewiie
live for Isabella, because my duty do-th tie mc to thy service, both by a gencrall
right, and by a particular obligation, death is the onely remedy that remains for
me to get out of so many miseries. Is thy goodness had not broken ofs my setters
and that 1 were still thy slave, now when that I know that the constancy of Isabella
hath triumphed over the artisice of our enemies, that I reign still in her heart, and
that on me alone her selicity or her happiness doth depend, I would employ all
my endeavour to sree me of my chains by a ransom : Bur, my Lord, I am tycd to
thee by stronger bonds; the obligations whereis» I am ingaged to thy Highness, the
benesits which I have received from thee, the honours thou hast done me, and the
last degree of glory whereunto I am mounted, are too certain proofs of thy love,
and of thy considence, for me not to be retained in my duty: It is then by these
sacred bands that I amtyedunto thee, and which I cannot break witliout sacri-
lege. Sinally, my Lord, the thoughts of liberty, vphich pass fora just d;sire in the
minds of all men, were an horrid crime in me; and I may well promisc thy High¬
ness, that 1 will never so much as dream of it : And as I am generous enough not
to doe any thing that may blemissi my love , so am I yet more not to doe
anything that may wrong my duty. There is no need then of guards to keep
me from going out of thy Empire, being sully resolved to sacrisise all my
pleasures , rather than doc any thing unworthy of the name which I carry,
and the choice which thy Highness hath made of my person, for to be the sirst in
thy savour, as I am in thy Estatcs. But without surther deserring pronounce the
sentencc of death, so just, and so much wissied for. Ibrahim having given over
speaking, Soliman rofe up, sell to walking a great pace, and with his eyes sixed
on the ground continued in sodeepa muse, as the Bassa doubted that he ssiould
obtain the essest of his rcquest ; but he was not long in this uncertainty ; for the
Sultan standing still, and beholding him in a manner that testisicd more gries
than anger, and more compassion than wrath, said unto him with all imaginable
kindnelTs that he held himsels insinitely unhappy, in that pofsessmg so great an Em¬
pire, that being so vistorious and triumphant, and that being able to give selici¬
ty to somany people, yet could not render the onely man whom he could love ,
happy. Upon this so obliging a disconrse,Jbraloim would have sallen on his knees,
but he would not susser him, saying unto him , that he would sein have obtained
so much resolution of himsels, as to part for ever from a man, who was so dear unto
him; that he had debated the same in his mind, when as he walked in that manner,
as he saW; but that at last the assestion which he bore him had surmounted his ge¬
nerofity, and that it was impofsiblc for him to resolve on so grievous a separation;
that he conjured him to cxcuse the essests of his sriendssiip, as he excused thofe of
his love;andtotestisie untohim, that as well as himsels he did all diat he could, he
would permit him to goe atd see Jsabella, provided he would pass his word unto
him toreturn again within lix monthes; with this promise also, that is during his
absence he could accustom himsels to this privation, he would give him his libesty
wholly and intirely. The Bassa was so surprised, and so transported with joy , as
having cast himsels at the seet ofthe Sultan, he was a good while without speak¬
ing , but at length, aster he had recovered the use of his tongue, he rendred him
thanks for so notable a savor,and told him,ihat none but Soliman could vanquissi So¬
liman; that this vistory which hehad gotten over himsels, was so glorious to him*

were not compofed at Genoua,  had he, not had theniea,nesto have thesentence
revoked, which had  been given against him.    And when as y/'r^/?/»? besought
him to to let him understand, how he thought to perform so unexpected a
a thing, the Sultan told him, that to comprehend his design, he was butto
remeraber, how one of hisCi^^owA-,   remrning our ofsr^«s(?,   and staying at (js-
noua, had been murthered in the streetes  by a popular commotion;    so that
having been advertised thereof by one of thcni that accompanied him , who
instantly imbarqucd himsels away,he had clrts^all tire Vessells oftheGenoueses,that
were sound in his Ports, to be arrcstcd; and that for the better savouring of his de¬
sign, an Ambassador was the day before arrived siom his Republique ,   whom he
had caused to be put in prison at Pera,   be srig perswaded that he had doneuothing
unworthy himsels therein, since the Gemueses had hik violated the Law of Nati¬
ons in the person of his Chaoux; how it was for to comnmnicate this assair unto him
that he had sent for him in the morning, but che sadness which he had tibserved in
his countenance, had hindred him from it, audcarried him into another discourse.
The Bassa then cast himsels at the seet of the Sultan, to assure him, that' he would
never essablissi his content on the ruincsofhis Country. Soliman told him,.thathis
generofity would not contradist his intention, and that so savourable an occasion
might not be loft,   he would send back this  Ambassador  with  allthe   Vessells
which he had caused to be stayed, for to redeem his liberty, and that ofDsria, who
had sussred somuch for him.    Th^t he would write a letter to his Republique,
whichsliouidbeconceived in such express tearmes, as they would without doubc
be mforced by sear to accord him more dissicult thinges, than thofe which he desi,

<p>He grand Visier was no sooner at home, but he sent thecom&lt;t
niand ofthe Grand Signior to the Bassa of the Sea, to return
him the Slave, with whom he had talked the day before; but
as he was generous and liberall, he caused twelve Watches,
the sairest that ever had been sound in all the shops of Con-
st oHtinopley to be carried unto him; for besides the disl^rence
of the inventions of them, their cases were so marvellous, as
the Emeraulds, Rubies, and Diamonds, made up the leass
part of their beauty, the art sar surpassing the matter: And
whereas this curiofity is the greatest with persons of quality amon^ the Turks^
having met with an hundred of them in a certain ssiop, Ibrahim could not choofe
any thing that was more gallant, more beautisull,or more agreeable to him, who
was ro receive them; but to render this present yet more magnisicent, he put these
twelve Watches into a little cofser of Nacre, gamissied with Gold and Turqueises,
and sent them unto him by six Slaves: As for that of Menacoy because he was not a
man of any great quality, he sent him a thousand Sultanins for his ransom. Aster
whichhessiut himsels up in a lodging apart, that was a good way from his own,
vyhich was too miich srequented with people,thcre to receive Deria at more liberty:
The Palace of the Bassa of the Sea t^as not sar from Ibrohimsy so that it was not
long before they brought him his dearest Deriuy to whom that Baslla in re^uitall of
that gallantry which had been used towards him, had in exchange of his setters
given him a chain of Diamonds. It was in this interview, that these two sriends
selt all thofe joyes and pleasing raptures, which true sriendship causcth in the soules
of two persons, who for so many years had been in despair of ever seeing one ano¬
ther ; their hearts were at one instant so rcplenissied With pleasure and admirati¬
on , as not able to express together their amazement And their joy, they remained
a good while embracing one another. Without the ability to speak ; but at length,
Ibrdhinis ^alXion being the stronger, it obliged him to open their sirst dlscdt/rse by
IsabelUyincaWm^Doriahis Prelervcr, in giving him thinks for exppsing his lise
todeliver her, and revenge him; and craving pardon of him for the pains he had
sussered in his captivity, as counting himsels the innocent cause thereof Dorta
answered to all thofe things with as much kindness as could be; but whereas love
is more powersull than sriendstiip, and as this paslion reigns imperiously over all

<p>it were true indeed that the Princess loved him still &gt; He tvould know, of hinjj whe¬
ther the Prince of Majseran was an handsome man ? And as is his sriend could have
divined what was done overall the earth, he conjured him to tell him, whethei*
he did not believe that//^^eZ/rs would be turned Nun when they ssiould arrive at.
Genoua ? In the end, aster he had asked an hundred questions, whereunto D^rta had.
no Icisuretoanswerjhc perceived his error, and desired himtopardonhim for it
with so much earnestness, as he could not choofc but smile at it. But amidst all
these mutuall caresses,there were some moments whereinDwrs.was surprized with
marvell, and whcnas reason began to repofsess its place in the mind of Ibrahins, he
was aware of it; and seeing his eyes sattened on his habit, he easily apprehended,
that he did not express all his thought; wherefore not to leave him any lohgcnn
this uncertainty, he said unto him, that for the renewing of their sriendssiip in as
ttraita manner as formerly it had been, it was sit to tell him in sew words, that
he was still Justimano under the name of Ibrahim , and that although he wcie the
servant of Soliman, yet was he for allthat the enemy of Mahomet.; that he desired
him therefore not tofuspcst him lighdy , since he could not do so without wrong¬
ing him ; that is he had not been too much pressed by the aslseiirs which he vvai tq
communicate untohim, and which required speed, he would have recounted to
him, even at that very instant, the wondei-suU progress of his fortune, but he would
do that at leisure whilst they vvere in their voyage together; that in the mean
time he ssiould sirmly believe hovv nothing was able to shakc his saith, and that he
would live and die in the Religion of his Sathers.   Upon this discourse Dori*.
consessed unto him ingenuously, that he had been strangely surprized with sinding
him Grand Visier, and the Sultans Lieutenant-Generall throughout all the extent
oi his Empire, since to beth.u and a Christian seemcd to be two things incompa¬
tible; but inregard of that which hehad told him, he vvould asterwards forbid
his reason to judge any more upon apparances: Hovv it was notwithstanding true,
that hehad believed that he was not absolutely culpable, but hovv it was certain
also, that being unable to cPHCcive this adventure, hehad been troubled to think
in what terms he ssioisld dare to inform and clear himsels therein.    Ibrahtm an¬
swered, that he would easily forgive him this injury, seeing he himsels could^ not
in a manner conceive by what means 3 or by what wayes fortiine had condusted
him to the point wherein he then was: That inthemean spacenot to lofe time,
which wasto be so precious untohim, it was sit he ssiould tell him, that Soliman
had been so good as to permit him to go and see Isabella; and that he might do it
with glory and sasety, the Sultan had sound out an undoubted expedient tp (jause
the Sentences which had been pronounced against  them, to ^e revoked.    But
whereas DssrM could not easily believe that which he hc^rd, Ibsahim recounted e-
very thing unto him from point to point, just as it had been resolved in the Sultans
Cabinet; but he did not discover untohim, that he had ingaged his word for his
return within six moneths, for sear he ssionld be astlisted ^t it; for as spr his side^
lity he no way misdoubtcd it.   Dorta sinding that he purpofed to return out of
handto Genoua, told him, that he had loft a very asscstionate sriend in the person
cs StmhaldoMio^N^%deado^ sickness, as the Slave of Monaco had informed him,
but that he had lest a sonne behind him, the heir of all  his vprtucs and one that
promised great matters.   Is he not called GiovAtmi 'Lodovico, replied Ibrahim, aster
he had bemoaned the death of Simbaldo? Y^SysaidD^na, and he w,s AoT^bove
a dozen years old when you went away, and yet then there was great h^P? of him.
Hereupon one bi-ought Ibrahim word, that the Slave of Mo»ac^ wa? come, which
made I).rM represent untohim, diat being to return to ^.«.*^,he held it not gt
that this Slave ssiould see him in the habit he wore, because he could not nqsliWy
forbear pubhssiing of k, which might prejudice hipi m^ch, or at leastwise pblig«
him to make a publick mamsestation of his advemurcs.    Ibrahim iigrecd w^
h.m therein, so that he charged him, who brought him that message, to carry this
Maveto the quarter where theOfsicersof his h^ouse were lodgedVwhich was a
great way ofs from his own, with order to tsse him well, and not to let hh^ go

sels to Doria, and desired him to work in such fort, as he might have the Letter
which the Princess had wrote to him by this man, to the end hemight be assured
of her sidelity.    Doria told him  that the matter was not very dissicult, and
that to oblige him to deliver it, he need but let him know, hovv he   was
still alive ;   and   because also hee was to  see him during their Voyage, it
was requisite  to tell  him,   that   hee had been a slave as well as they , and
sreed in the same manner, that he might not be surprised when he ssiould see him a-
bord the vessell. Ibrahim a^^roved of this counsell of his sriend, and prayed him
to go instantly and labour to bring him that preticustreasure, which was able to
make him happy. Dona condiscending thereunto, the Bassa caused him to be con¬
dusted by tour llaves to the place where that of Monaco was, who a good while
would not part with Isabellaes Letter, till he saw y«/?/w^w, because he could not
bcleeve, that a man whom he had gone tofe8k for at Naples, should be at Constan-
nople; but Doria swore s o seriously unto him,  that Juslmiano was alive, and that
he (hould see him within a sew daies, as at length, knowing him to be a man of
great quality, and Justmianoes sriend, he sussered himsels to be perswaded, and de¬
livered him Isabellaes Letter, which he had with much ado preserved all the time
of his captivity ;  presently whereupon Por#&gt; returned to Ibrahim, who attended
him with extreme impatience; as soon as he perceived him, and that they which
condusted him were retired, he lovingly imbraced him, and conjured him no
longer to deser his happiness, bat Deria without answering him rendred him that
precious gage of Isabellaes sidelity, which pofsesscd our Illustrious Bassa with such
joy, that he could hardly obtain ib much tranquillity from his mind, as to read this
Letter: But at last, aster he had kisstd it with transports that cannot be imagined but
by thofe who know the force of this noble passion, which reigned in his heart, he
opened it, and saw that it was thus.

<p>Hardly could Ibrahim retain his teares in reading/y&gt;^s/7^sj letter, which had
made him change colour more than once, according as it was either more or   lets
obliging; and as jealousie   and ser.r are undoubted markes of strong assestion ,
thai which the Princess testisicd unto him gave him at one instant both griesand
joy; he was grieved that Isabella ihould suspee^x him of insidelity, he was not forry
that ssie was assraid to lole him; and as is he had not read it weil,  he began to run
it over again, and aster he had made an end of reading it, he looked on asl sides of
the paper, to see is nothing else were there written :   He read the superscription of
it, he considered it even to the very seal; and in the end bethought he should have
committed a crime is he had loft so much as'one sillable of that pretious pledge
of Isabellaes love. This letter (b mightily increased his slame, that his unquietness
grew to be halsso much more than it was.    The discourse of the Princess seemed
lo presling unto him, as he began to sear in good earnest, lest  ssie ssiould take some
extreme resolutioi. before he could get to Monaco ; he concluded therefore to for¬
ward the matter as much as he could ,  and for a beginning he lest Dbria,  aster he
had caused bookes to be given hira to entertain the time withall, and commanded
some of his servants to wait near untohim for to serve him ;   the rest of the day
he bestowed in giving order for all things necessary scr his voyage   he commanded
a Christian Slave, in whom he much consided,  to cause an habit aster the Italian
sassiion to be secretly made, and gave him more moiiey than need, both to pay for
it, and to procure the sidelity ofthe Jewes, who ssiould sell it unto him ; for it is
srora thofe kinde of men, that the great diversity of Nations which people C^}sstau~
timple and Pcra, are surnilhed with all things necessary for them, be it household-
lhisse,apparell, or Jewells.    That done, he caused the principall Ofsicers of his
house tobe called unto him, and having told them ,  that theGrand Signior sent
him upon a secret expedition,  from when :e he stiould not return in six monthes
he commanded thera that during his absence they (hofild obey, as himsels, a man ',
who was as it were the Steward of his house; and tha;t they ssiould cause all the rest

<p>remony at his departure from Pera; for it is the custom ofthe Sultan to receive no
Ambassadors but such as have one of them on,according to the manner ofthe Coun¬
try. He was sustained under the arms by two Capigibassi ; the Bassa that condusted
him, marched two paces before him to present him to the Sultan, who received him
with some civility :when as he had sainted theGrand Signior,he delivered thcLettcr
that the Republique had written to him,which Soliman gave unto a Dragomaujwho
interpreted it unto him for forms sake only,for he understood it better than he. No
sooner had he done hearing him,but he caused the same Interpreter to tell the Am¬
bassador, thatthe injury which he had received in the person of his C^&lt;w«x, wasso
great, that is hehad sollowed his just sury, his head had answered for that vio¬
lence ; how it was for that he had caused hira to be arretted, but that he had since
changed his mind at the intercession of a Christian slave, who had been asutor to
him for it,and that had sound grace before his Highness; but that for returning him
back, as he was going todo,together with all the vessels which he had caused tobe
stayed in his Ports, and for forgetting also the outrage that he had received from
his Republique, they were to accord him one thing, which he desired of them.
And when as the Ambassador had answered him, that the thing ssiould be impolli¬
ble is they did it not, he told him, how all that he would have was, thatthe Se¬
nate ssiould revoke the Sentence which they had pronounced against Jujliniano, and
that Doria ssiould be no more troubled for the death of the Prince of Majseran; that
it viasjustiniano to whom Genoua owed her sasety, and to whom he was to render
thanks for his lise ; thathe remitted both him and Doria to his condust, for the
putting of that in execution which he desired ; but that he ssiould take good heed
they saylcd not therein, because is that ssiould happen, nothing ssiould be able to
keep him from making War upon Genoua it sels with all the forces of his Empire:
This Ambassador was so surprised with hearing the Sultan speak of Juslmiano and
Doria, a% it had divers times like to have made him forget the respest which he ow¬
ed him, for to interrupt him , but at length aster Soliman had given over speaking,
he answered him, that the thing he desired was sobenesiciall to the Republique,
as his Highness need not sear to be restised; that the merit of thofe two excellent
men was so generally known, as the Senate had not obeyed the Laws but with gries,
and that doubtless they would be extremely joysull of^ so just and specious a pre¬
text to insringe them. Asterthis Soliman dismissed him, and told him yet once
again, how he ssiould remember, that in this occasion they were to satissie him, or
to have him their enemy ; howbeit he somewhat caressed him in bidding him sare¬
well, and excused the not receiving him with ^1 requisite Ceremonies for some
reasons which he might not tell him ; that in the mean time he ssiould prepare
himsels for his departure, and that he ssiould have his dispatch. When he was re¬
tired according to the custom, that is, without turning his back to the Sultan, /-
brahim camcforthof the Cabinet, and cast himsels at his seet, to give him thanks
forso many tcstimonies ofthe assestion which he received every minute from his
Highness. But Soliman took him up, and told him, that eight years service well de-
scrved that acknowledgment; that withall likewise in labouring for his good,
he ssiould establissi his own selicity, which would never be persested till he saw
him contented • that the impatience he was in for his departure, was occasioned
by the desire he had of his return, and that it might no longer bc deserred, he
was to go and make an end of taking order'for his assairs, and that immediately
aster noonhe ssiould come and bid him adieu, and bring Dena with- hira. Ibra¬
him ansviered to all these things with asmych generofity, as kindness; and for a
conclusion, he deeply protetted never to think himsels acquitted of the insinite
obligations wherein he was ingaged to his Highness, but in sacrisismg his lise for
his service. He would have proceeded surther, but the Stsltan interrupted him,
and once more commanded him to have no other thought than of going to see the
incomparable IsabelUy and of giving lise again to Solman. A^cr this thg Grand
Visier durst not make any reply, but retired homewards to go unto his dear Do¬

Balsa was sain to speak to him before he  would heed him, or be drawn out of so
sweet acontemplauon : But when as D)na seemcd tobe unwilling to stir from
thence, till he had at leasure considered that Master-peece of Architesture, Ibrahim
told him he was contented   he ssiould , so as he stayd not long about it, for
that having goodlier things to ssiew him, and not having much time to spare,
they were to raannage so much as they had, till dinner was made ready, in letting
him see all the beauties ofthe Palace which he had caused to be built: That where¬
as he was skilsull in Painting, in Perspestive, in Architesture, in rarities, and in
all parts of the Mathematicks, he ssiould be glad to know, whether according to
his judgement all the rules of thofe sair Arts, and ofthofe excellent Sciences, were
sound to be observed there, as according to his they were.   But sirst, sayd Doria to
him, I would sain know, how in so little a time you could make up a building,
which for its greatness, and for the magnisicence of its strusture, would require
the whole lise of a raan, and the treasures of a great Prince.    This last, replyed
Ibrahimy is the only necessary thing, for with it is done in a small time, what whole
Ages, and all the industry of man could not do without it; and both to answer
you, and to take srora you the means of troubling me with new objestions, I am to
let you know, that having a purpofe to build this Palace,I easily sound out a way to
do it, as well speedily, as magnisicently :  For dispofing of all the Revenue of the
Empire, I could want nothing save Artisans to execute my design, but fortune sent
incthcm ; for good luck would, that a great Architest, two Painters, and two
Sculptors, having put themselves in company together for to pass outof Italy in¬
to Spain, from whence they had been sent for to make a stately Palace for the Em¬
peror, were taken by Pirates, who asterwards sold them here at Constmttnople; and
whereas I have alwaies been very caresull to inform my sels of places where any
Christian slaves were, that I might relieve them, I met with these same, knew
what they were, and employed them for two whole years together; aster which I
sent them back in a vcssell laden with riches.   You have peradventure heard say,
that the Turkj do not susser the image of any living thing to be made, and that the
Alcoran seems to forbid it ; but as in all Religions heresies do from time to time
arise, this same, which is compofed of nothing but absurditics,hath not been want¬
ing ther.ein ; for some remedy whereof they one day cast into the River of Adex^-
lia, that runs by Damascus, two hundred Camels lading of Books of the disserent
opinions of their Religion, retaining but six of them, which since have produced
many others, whereof one maintains upon this Article, that the rest havemisun-

Dona-was not yet resolved to quit so rare an objest, had  not the Bassa forced
him to enter, that he might observe the Vaulting which sustained the Paviglion,
whofe key-stone was an Onix ofa prodigiou.s bigness, and whereof the Artist had
so well contrived all the colours, and made such use of them, as he had thereof
formed a Coronet of slowers, so admirably well done, that it beguiled the sight :
The rest of the Vaulting was all of white Marble, the better to set ofs so sair a
work, but so well joyned and polissied, as it secmed to be made of one entire stonc
Aster he had sussiciently considered so rare a thing, Ibrahim caused Dena to observe,
that oppofite to the Paviglion, which he so much admired, was another just like
unto it; but before he went surther D^-r/-* stayed to consider a great low covered
Gallery which compass d the Court about, and whereof the roof served for a Ter¬
race, with a rail and ballister of a leaning height; ic was sustained with pillars
of white and red Marble, and paved as the Court with white and black.   But
whereas /^r^/'/TW knew that there was somewhat yet more marvellou'j to be seen,
he   made his dear Doria to pass along under the second Paviglion, and although
the vaulting of it was sairer than the other that he had already seen, yet did he not
make any stay there, so much was he ravissied with   the magnisicent Fore-sront
of  Ibrahtms Palace, which wholly discovered it sels from thence ; and truly
I must consess, that see hadreasonso to be, since all that art and materiasls can
eontrihute to the beauty ©sa work, was eminently sound in this same. There ap¬
peared a great Building that took up the whole brcdth of the Court, which was
retrenched some thirty pacesfrom the House by a Ballustrade of Jasper and Por¬
phirie, and raised on the Palace-side the height of sour steps, which formed in the
middle an hals pace of the same matter.    The pavement of this Court was gray
and white Marble, and in the midst of it was a Sountain, whereof the bole was of
Oricntall Alablasler, trausparant as Chrissall, and six soot Diameter, born up by a
pillar of'divers-coloui'ed Marble; the out-iide ofthe bole was inriched with
little Sea-iMonsters of hals relieve, admirably  well done.    Roundabout the
pillar were sour Harpies of Brass, their paws reaching to the depth of the Cisteni,
and their backs turned oppofite the one to the other to uphold the pillar ; the tips
of their wings cxtendedaliso to the bottom of the Alablaster bole, as secming to,
bear it up'; :they had womens saces, but Serpents writhen tails sinissiing in antick
soliage, which met together on the top of the pillar just against the Center of the
bole, whereunto likewise it served for an ornament: In the midst of thisbole was
a Vase reverst, made alio of Orientall Alablatt:cr, which on its soot sustained a
roundibaslsy whereupon were set the three Graces, almoft quite naked, made of
Carmthianx».eta\l; they stood back to back, ejesting Water out their breasts, and
eachof them holding a Coriiucopia, which met all together a little above their
heads; out of the slowers and sriiits, which were represented there with suitablc
pieces, made of Agates, Onixes, Turqueises, Carnaline?, Topazes, and Emeraulds,
issued six spouts of water, which sell down Jnto the bole, |nd disgprgcd themselves
into the Cistern through the muzzcls of six Lions that were seen on the outside
thereof.    As''-" ^^^ ^^^ othersj, whicS ilsucd srora the bneasts of the Graces, and
that did not ipinoiu, they sell just into theheads of six Dragons of brass, which
were on the brim of the bole, and that rendred them; again through their mouthes:
These Dragons secmed to strive to get out of it, holding die brim with their tal-
loiis, the rest of theii'bodies, except their heads, and the tips of their wings, secm¬

sound at one and the lame time where withall to be laiishtd.    The Cittern of this
Sountain was of Marble, but wrought with such art in Mofuque vvorK, as there
appeared in thebottom through the water sisties, lo admirably well represented,
thatonc might bedeceived by them at the hrst hght ; this Cistern had also round
about it a little Balustrade of Jasper , for one to rest, and meditate upon.   Aster
that D&lt;»r/^had well admired this Sountain , hegave his whole mind and attention
ro'observe the beauties ofthis marvellous srame; he saw then, that from each side
rherewcnt awing of building, which extended even to the Balustride of Jasper
and Porphirie,  and whereof the strusture and symetrie was  suitable to   the
middle sront: Each ofthese wings, as well as the grand sabrique, had a Co-
rola,   covered  over with ssieetes of brass,   whereof the moity having received
an imprelTion of sire,  it had rendred then of a mixt colour between purple
and blew , which the Painters cannot well reprtsent,   and which ssiewed a
wondersusl objest,   being oppofed to the other ssieetes, whereunto had been gi¬
ven a tinsturcof gold.    The rest of the roof was covered in the same manner ,
as well asthcPaviglions, whereof 1 have spoken ;   but when as  Doria came  to
cast   his eye a littk lower, and to observe that all the ornaments ofthis Sabrique
were of laspcr, Chalcedonie, Agate, and Onix, he was so surprised , as he could
not forbear demanding,  whether this which he saw was not inchantment:   But
though the abundance of Sestons, of Trophies of Armes, Arabcsques, Vases of in¬
cense. Srizes, Corniches interlaced with Drapery, extinst Torches, Cornucopi¬
aes, and Chaplets of triumph, gave him a world of admiration ,   yet was  he sar
more surprised to behold sour and twenty Columnes of Touch, which seenied to
sustainthe sirst Order, and which were placed by two and two in equall distance,
between each window;  the basii and capitalls of them were of white and red
marble, in correspondencie to the body of the building,  which was wholly con-
strusted thereof; but to preserve these Columnes,  and to render them withall the
more magnisicent to the eye, they were twyned about with the leaves of Achanthes
ofbrass guilt, which yet was no hindrance, but that one might distinstly discern
of what stonc they were made, so as the beauty of them might be admired for their
prodigious greatness.    Over the Entrata was a statue of5o/«&gt;»&gt;«» onhorseback in
base relieve; and on each side betvvecn thofe Columnes were six Niches, silled with
sixgreatstatuesof women, habited ^X''&lt;««r//'«s, and representing the divers Nati-
tions subjested to Solimon, who with one hand seenied to ofser him their Crowns^
and with the other leaned on the Scutcheons ofthe armes ofthe Kingdomes, which
they represented.    Aster hehad well observed all these marvailcs of Art and Na¬
ture, Ibrahim told him, that having yet many things to ssiew him,   which it may
be dcserved his approbation, as well as thofe he had already viewed, it was requi¬
site they ssiould make a turn in the Garden, that all the outside might be conside¬
red before he let him see that the inside was not ill understood; he made him pasS
then under a great Vaulting, which traversed the whole body ofthe House,   from
whence one descended to the Garden by a large hals pace of Porphirie. This Vault¬
ing was all of Mofaique work, compofed of disserent Marbles and Jaspcrs ,   upon
a ground of Alablaster, but so wondersully wrought, as an excellent Painter could
not with a pencill interlace a soliage raore artisicially,   better observe the lights^
and the (hadowes, nor make a sairer piece with liquid colours^ which by his mix¬
ture of them he renders such as he pleaseth, than this excellent Artisan of so beau¬
tisull a work had done with suitable pieces, whereofthe colours were all simple
and n.iturall,aiid the joyning of them together imperceptible to he clearcstsighted
eyes. Jbrahim,  whofe impatience was extreme,  and who imagined, that every
moment imployed by him any other way, than in thinking of his departure,   was
an outrage to hii love, and a crime towards Isabella, pressed Dona so much ,   as he
made hira descend into the Garden ;   howbeit he stayed a little on the top of the
hals pace the better to consider the beauty and extent 6s it.    He saw upon the sirst

<p>dinary bigness, about the which were seen upon the bases of green Jasper six sigures
of sislier- men,   as big as the lise,  whereof there were three that held each of thera
a 1 rident in his right hand,   with the arm listed up for to dart it;   and the other
three testisied by their astion the joy which they selt  for having hurled theirs so
rightly, as that they had therewith struck a Sea Monster, which was represented
in the middle ofthe Round, lying hals along on his side ,   his head and his tail out
of the water, and with so much art,   as  he seemcd to be somwhat pained with the
hurts which the three Tridents had given him ,   and from whence issued three
ejests of water, that were in stead of blood to him.    Just oppofite to the hals-pace
and the Round was a Grot, admirably sair,  both for the matter Uvhereof it was
tormed, and for the art wherewith it was made,  so that Doria, being much ta¬
ken with this objest, seconded the grand-Visicrs design , and went on as sast as he
desired him; the Bassa, not to lofe time, caused him to observe in going along,
that on each side of his Garden was a clofe arbor ,   erested with porticoes of ver¬
dures, where the Gardiner had made it well appear,    that he was not ignorant of
all the beauties of Architesture, since it had not any ornament there,  which was
not ofthe same proportion, and ofthe same symetry, as was observed over all that
stately Palace.   He made him also catt his eye to both the sides of the Grot, ♦ from
whence there ran a Balustrade of Jasper,  beyond the which was seen on the right
hand a Laberinth,so artisicially contrived, that it might be called a prison without
agate; it being moft certain, that without at the least a prodigious chance, or be¬
ing taught by him that made it, onecoald not get out of this D-s^*?/^ , whatcare
soever a man took to mark how he went into it: Doria would sain have gone and
made tryallofit ;   howbeit Ibrahim-woald not susser him ,  but obliged hira to
look toward the lesLsidc ofthe Balustrade,   where was seen a Grove of Orange,
Citron, Pomegranate, and Mirtle trees j  and although the profpest ofthis place
was delestablc, and the sent of it odoriserous, yet Doria past by them to admire the
mervailcs ofthe Grot, whercunto they were then near; but wlscrcas the description
of it would be too loug, it ssiall sussice to say, that it was of an Oftangular toriii;
that although it was ofa just depth,  yet it was for all that so lightsom ,  as asl
which the Orient hath of moft rare was there tobe seen: And to conceive a light
Idea of it, one must imagine, that he beholds together all the mastcr-picces, or to
say better,all the miracles of Nature; one must then sigure unto himsels great rocks
ofChristall, of Emeraulds, and of Rubies, where there was seen in some of them,
thatthe Sun had not leisure to sinissi his work,  being without colour in divers
parts;  one must also paint forth to his imagination that wondersull ennamcll of
Orientall Shells, whereof the diversity is so agreeable, be it for their formes, or
for their lively colours, so well mingled, and so wellforted,  that of all naturall
things they are the sairest, and moftpersest; one must likewise conceive that in his
mind, which all the Painters cannot represent-,  I mean thofe great Conques of
Nacre,  where the bcamcs of the Sun leave so beautisull an impression of their
light, as neither Opales, nor the Rain-bow have any colours that are not surpassed
by the luminous Argent whereof they are formed , and which makes me name
them with reason the savorites ofthe Sun.     But aster all these things one must
imagine yet an insinite number of great branches of Corrall, of all colours which
Nature hath produced, namely of all the Carnations, white, black, and ofthe co¬
lour of sire. There must be surther added to all these mervailcs the sairest congela¬
tions and the rarest petrisications, whereof Philofophers, or Historians have ever
spoken to us: Asterthis, I say, one may conceive part of thofe things which Doria
beheld in this Grot, where all the artisices of water vvere seen admirably well
executed; there was a sall which ran from a rock of Christall, and which loft ic
sels presendy under another, whereofthe noise wasso charming, as there is not a
heart so light, nor a humor so sullen, in whom this murmure vvould not have ex¬
cited a pleasing sancic; and that sthere raay no doubt be made of the agreeable-
ness ofthis inchanted Grot, I will say no more, but that J^r^W himsels, howso¬

waies joyn magnisicence to curiofity, all his Bocks were bound up in plates of
Gold, cnammclled with white and green, and placed in order upon ssielves of E-
bony, which were bordered with a dcntile of Goldsmiths-work, enarameled with
the lame colours. There were also in this Gallery between the windows a great
ruiiiber of Maps, both univerlall and particular ; and upon a Tablet over the
Books a many of Glubes and Spheres, disserent from one another, according to the
divers opinions of all them which have treated of such matters. In the same or¬
der likewise he had placed all forts of Mathematicall instruments, the sairest and
the bell made that ever were seen ; as concave Mirrors, Clocks, Olomestres, Cir¬
cles of proportion, and Astrolabes. But v\hereas Ibrahim contented not himsels
with ntc.ssuy things, but would also have thofe that were for delight, he had
there a niin»berof thofe paintings, which by opticall reasons do make such excel¬
lent and charmingiUusions; for that purpofe then hehad Cilinders of severall
j',ieatiicsse8, and to resressi the sight of them which read, he had of thofe Christall
Triangles, which by the essest of a marvailous rcslestion do take and give all at
one time the colours of the Rainbow to all the objests that are seen through them.
He had also divers magnisicent Desks, Profpestive-glasses, and before the middle
window a Tabic of Ebony, garhissied with Gold, and enammelcd as the ssielves ,
with aStandilh upon it covered all over with Emeraulds, some dark, some clear*
which made a soliage admirably well represented. At the end of this Gallery that
looked upon die sirst Court, was a door which opened to the Terrace, whereof I
have spoken, and which answered to the Paviglion in the middle, where the
Grand Vilicr had made a Cabinet of Arms, which he would needs have his dear
sriend to see; he led him then by the way which I have noted, bnt Dana at his
entrance into it was exceedingly amazed and surprised; spr the very sirst objest:
tliat his eye met withall, was a Trophy of Arms, sustained in the air by the prodi¬
gious vertue of a great Adamant, which was the Key-stone of the roof of this Ca¬

sity; the second performed the same thing with water; and the third , but the
moftniarvellousjby the means of that powder which is called white, ssiot ofs, not

he would have stayed a long time in Philofophying on all these secrets,by maintain¬
ing, that neither water nor wind, could ever have the same astivity with sire and
so by consequence that which he saw could not be without inchantment; but /-
brahim told him they vvould speak of it at leisure during the voyage they vvere
going  to  make,  and without barkening to him surther, he made him go forth
at   a  door oppofite to that whereby they had entred, and which gave upon
the same Terrace that answered to the end of the Gallery on the lest wing
where   the   Illustrious Bassa had caused all the Turkissi  Emperours  to bee
drawn ,   from   Othoman ,   who was the sirst ,   to Soliman then  reigning.
But whereas he was not contented with having their saces represented but would
have the Othoman History also painted, there was in this Gallery sourteen great
Tables, in each of which was an Emperor as big as the lise, and within the same
srame all the principall astions of his Reign; but the same so well done   so di¬
stinstly, and so well ordered, as Doria was ravissied therewith, and plainly swore to
Ibrahim, that he would not stir out of that Gallery till he had considered all these
Pi stures attentively, and that he had expounded them unto him.   The Basla decli¬
ned it as much as he could, butat length seeing his sriend persist in his obstinate
curiofity, he resolved to satissie him, upon condition nevertheless, that he ssiould
not stand to particularize all that he saw in thofe Tables:    And whcnas Dona
had ssiewed him that he was contented therewith, he requested him to pardon him
is in the profccution of thofe painted Histories he saw a number of vistories gain¬
ed over the Christian?, which much against his mind he had sussered to be there
but that in the end he durst do no otherwise.   This said, making use of an Indian
Cane, which he ordinarily carried in his hand, the better to make Doria observe
what he was going to ssiew him, he began to speak in these terms.
</p>
<p>l[he Pourtrait of Othoman the sirst Emperor of
the TUKKS,
</p>
<p>YOu see, my dear Doria, in this sirst Table, which you ssiall not see above once
again in all the rest, I mean a Prince replcat with all vcrtucs, and absolutely
exempted from all vices, who owed his fortune to his own proper valour, and
who alone laid the soundations of this great Empire: And indeed his memory
hath been so reverenced, that even to this day all his Succesfors have held it for a
glory to carry his name. You may observe in his Physiogminy that he was a Prince
as prudent, as the rest of the Table will ssiew him to be couragious.   This battell
which you see asar ofs, is that which he obtaincdagainst the Teggiur ofthe Town
of Prusia; but mark a little how the industrious Painter hath so done it, as all
these sigures seem to move, and thatinthisdiforderonemay know the vistorious
party; he hath done it so too, that Othoman is easdy discerncd there: But is this
tight be well represented, this assault of that Town of PrHJta, and where he aster¬
wards cstablissied the seat of his Empire, wil not seem less marvellous unto you.
This pane ofthe wall, which you see sallen down, and which lets you perceive them
plainly that desended it, is it not admirably well done ? These other Towns
which you behold so distinstly, are thofe of Sinopa in Galatia, of Angauri in Phri-
via, of SebastainCapadocia; and these which you see surther ofs towards thofe
Rockr, are the rest which he gained on Mare major.    As for this Land-skip, set
thick with Town-s which you see beyond Pr«/»4, it is of Natolia, that he wholly
conquered; and this Array which sccmeth to march, and whereof all the souldiers
are laden with booty, is the sirst that ever passed into Europe,and that made strangc
havock under this excellent enemy. But without slaying to coofider the rest, let us
pass on to this other Table.                                                                             Tbe

<p>THis Prince was the truly worthy sonne of Othoman, continued Ibrahim, infor

sion to the Empire ; but js he were unhappy in this encounter, fortune recompen-

<p>IS the lise of this Emperor had been longer;, he would have yet surpassed his Sa¬
ther, both in valor, and in prudence, and we ssiould have seen the Table of his
vistories silled up more than it is; but whereas his reign indured but two years,
he had no more time than to take Andrinople, conquer a great pare of Thrace, and
bring also under his subjestionthe Towns of Pe^gamas, Edrenuta, Zemeniqua, and
some others, as well on this, as on the other side of the Helespottt, which ycm lee

<p>TO describe unto you the humor of this Prince, before I speak of his Triumph?,
I riiust tell you that he had together both force and weakness, curtesie and cru¬
elty, and agility in his age; that he was both' terrible and loving; that he was in-
satiableinssieddingof blood, and that nevertheless he never put any one to death
but moft justly. It was as well by these according contrarieties thathe rendred him¬
sels admirable to Pofterity, as by his valoiy which being seconded by fortune made
hira take P/:;^*^, the capitallCltie of Macedema, conaner Mtsid from Dragus, and

which the Painter hath made to be seen more disiinstly, than thofe 1 have already
sliewed you, .is being of raore importance. D^rw could not then forbear interrup¬
ting Ibrahim, for to pray him to let him know whether thofe millions of armed
and nghting men which he saw in this Table, were not the piesture of all the Bat¬
tells that were given dming the reigns of all the Emperors. You have reason my
dear Donay answered the Illustrious Bassa, to be amazed at the prodigious number

upon whom Vistory, which you may see here represented in the air, rsirows down

and whofe lise would have desaced the glory of all them that preceded him , had

<p>The Pourtrait of Bajazet, the sisth Emperor of
the TURKS.
</p>
<p>THe nature ofthis prince cannot be well represented but by the lightning, which
terrisicth universally, which ravageth indisserently, pasleth in a momant, and
perissieth in an instant; all of them qualities admirably besitting JBajax^t y sur-
named by his subje^s Guilderum,  that istofay,  the lightning of Heaven. But
whereas the remembrance of his lise strikes me with horror, by reason ofthe un¬
heard-of cruelties which he exercised, it ssiall sussise to tell you, that aster he had
gotten some battailes, which you see presented in this Table,  taken the Town of
Eritz^Ay and thofe of HisipoUsy Iconiumy Casura, Mtgdia, and Ajsara from the Ca-
raman; and gained also by arme s from a Greek,  named Theodorus , the Town of
Damacia, and that of Delphofy which you see here near hand; aster he had,  Isay,
sacked all HungariUy Bofsinuy and Croatia; deseated the Srench, Burgingnians, and
Hungarians, in that memorable battail of Nicopolis; aster he had, I say, silled the
whole Universe with terror, put all the Provinces where he passed to sire and
sword,he loft in one onely battel his Empire, and his glory, serving Tamerlan, who
had vanquissicd him,   all the rest ofhis dales; and at last was constrained, for his
geting out ofmisery, to make his tomb ofhis prison, by beating out his braincs as
against the iron barres of the cage, wherein he was inclofed; An astion so strangc,
it is impofsiblc not to bc moved with it.But let us see how the eldest ofhis children
began to reestablissi the diforders ofhis sather.

<p>T is easier to conquer, thanto reestablissi; to increase ones selicity, than to retire
from a misfortune; ofa petty Soveraign to become a mighty Monarch, than to re¬
mount into a Throne from whence one is descended. It is no little glory to Jofue,
aster the utter disljpation of his sathers Sate , to have been the sirst in raising up a-
gain that mighty Empire, by regaining from Tamerlanthe City of Prnsia, which
you have already seen , as having been before the chies seat oftheir Empire, and
very near all that his Predecesfors had pofsesscd in Asia. He did the like in
Europe , as you may see in this Table; and when he was returned into A§a , his
brother Musulman, fortisied with the succor of the Greeks, incountred him in
r^eWeriVt, gave him battail, which he wun, and taking him prisoner caused him
to be strangled, aster he had reigned sour yeares. But this cruelty was repaid unto
him, as you will quickly understand.

<p>That which you see a sar ofs is the same, whereof I have spoken ; and the other
which you see near hand, isone that he obtained against abrother ofhis ,  called
Moysesiv^ho had cstablissied himsels in Greece: And truely the History doth declare,
thaty«s&gt;*/»w« did in his own person perform miracles at that battel, I whereof
he had all the glory,and all the advantage;but as soon as he saw that he was peace¬
able in his State , he abandoned himsels in such fort to vbluptuousness, as he be¬
came more cowardly, than he was valiant before, so that Moyses having rallied his
forces, which were dispersed by his deaseat, gave battel again to Musulman,   who
ssiamesully sled, was taken, and brought to his brother, that quickly revenged the
death of Jofue by taking away his lise.   But let us behold the sequel ofthe History
of this third Sonne of Ba]ax.ety which will not be long.
</p>
<p>The Pourtrait of Moyks^ the eighth Empe¬
ror of the TURK S.
</p>
<p>MOyJes having reigned but three years, you may not expest the sight of many
conquests, in this Table; all that he could doe was to give some rest unto
Asi/K to spoil the Country ofthe Bulgariansy take the Town of Spenderovt a yredwce
the Po^&lt;i&lt;iH to his obedience, and win the battel which his Nephew i^^ew^s pre¬
sented hira with, who not long aster rallied his forces, and came uponhimwith
a srcssi charge, where Moyses had the worst, by being abandoned ofhis Souldier s in
this sight, so thathe was taken in^ marissi with one of his hands cut ofs, whereof
they soon cured him by putting him to death. Now though tjhis Table be not
much silled, yet certainly it is none of the meanest; the colours of it are so Vive ,
the digcsting of it so beautisull, this order ofthe Architesture so well understood,
as it may bc said in viewing this piece, that the art ofthe Painter hath supplycd the
desest ofthe matter.
</p>
<p>The Pourtrait o/Mahomet the ninth EmperOr of
the TURKS.
</p>
<p>AT length aster so manyLofses, Captivities, Sackings, Massacres, Sratricides i
and civill disscntions, the Turkissi Empire began to reassume its antient
lustre under the condust of Mahomety^NhQ aster he had repulsed all them that had
atttacqued him, conquered Pontusy Cappadocia, atid all thofe other Provinces, which
the Painter hath so well represented a/arofs; his armes were also vistorious in
divers incounters under the leading of Amurath his Eldest sonne. Mahomet subdu-
edlikewise Serviay Salachia , a great part of Sclavonia, and Macedottia; chaccdall
the petty Kings out ofthe Icsser Asia to establissi a Bcglierbey there, which is as
much to say, as a Vice-Roy;, at last, aster he had performed a thousand brave ex¬
ploits, for a recompence ofhis vertue, he reigned a long time, and dyed peaceably
in his State ofa naturall death, exceedingly regretted of all his Subjests. Butbe-
fore wc pass on I must cause you to mark one address of the Painter, that perad¬
venture you have not heeded, which is, that to make one knbw the diversity
ofProvinces, and Armies, which you have seen throughout all these Tables, he
hath alwaies observed the attire, armes, standarts, and briesly all the particular
things of every Nation : Aster this advcrtisemem the rest of these pieces will give
you "lor c cont^";"'s"t Y«&gt; than the other have done. Let us see then, whethe?^,

<p>The Pourtrait 0/Amurath the second, the tenth Empe¬
ror of the T UKKS.
</p>
<p>THe Physiognimy ofthis Prince is not deceiving, and although it doth promist
us much, wee stullyet sind more: Aster then thatdiis Prince had deseated
Muslapha, the last sonne of Ba\az,et, whom the Greeks had made to rise up againls
him, as also another Mustapha his brother, whom the same Greeks had likewise
protested, he turned the sury ofhis armes against them; taking from them the Ci¬
ty of Tbesalonica,  which the Painter hath   represented  unto us as sair as the
Historians have described it, and whereofthe perspestive is so marvellous, as one
hath much adoe to believe that the running in ofthis gate is not essest ive.   But let
us return to the Vistories ofthis Prince, who spoiled the higher Misia,  took the
To^Nn of Senderovia, conquered the Countries of Sarmian, and of Sarcan,tvso
mighty Princes of the lesse Asia,   and the Town of Coni from the Caraman :" The
Hungarians having in the mean time broken the peace   which  they had con¬
trasted with him, he returned into Europe,   and was sb fortunate, that the Christi¬
an Gallies, which lay at the strcight of Helespont to hinder his passage,   were con¬
strained by soul weather to retire;   he in the mean while came to that memorable
plain, which gave name to the samousett battel that ever was heard spoken of. And
see you not how the Painter hath been pleased to represent it I Mark this Squadron
a little which gives ground, and this other which is broken; consider the lest wing
which is routed; observe this clofe Battalion, which is going to attacque this other
that is ready to sly: Asfor the body ofthe Battail, where you see so  great a dilbr-
der, and such a consusion of dead horses, men overthrown, blood spilt, and armcj
broken, it is here in this place,   where the Painter would represent the death of
Ladisiaus, which arrived in this battel, with the lofs very near of   all the Nobili¬
ty of Hungary; some sighting to revenge the death oftheir Prince,  and others to
recover his body ;  but to ssiew clearly that the vistory was on Amuraths side, the
Painter hath represented Renown,   which seemes to sly over his Troopes for to
advertise them of it. Howbeit not to stand longer hereupon, it ssiall sussise to say,
that aster the battel of Varnes he conquered Peloponnesus ; that he dismissed himsels
absolutely from his Empire, which to took upon him again soon aster, for to ob¬
tain a battel  against  the valiant Huniades ; he made the King of 5o/^/4 also his
Tributary, which   was his  last vistory :   For the couragious George Scanderbeg
Castriot, King of Albania, who had been his Slave, and that had acquired unto hiin-
sels with so rnuch  justice the glorious  title ofthe Buckler ofChristendom , opo-
sed all his cntcrprises with such valour, as this great Prince, seeing himsels forced
so raise his siegc from before Croya, dyed with gries and spight at it.

<p>]T was not without some cause that this Prince would be surnamed Bovi, which
is to say, Great, or the Terror ofthe World, seeing all his astions have been so
great, and high, that is his excellent qualities had been without blemissi, this
Prince had been incomparable. He was great in his cntcrprises, great in courage,
great in condust, great in prudence, a great Poliucian, great in conquest, great in
beauty, and in subtilty of wit; but he was also great in impiety, in dissolutcnes-,
in revenge, in persidiousness, and in ambition. The greatness ofhis courage, and
of hisenterprises,carried him against theGreeks, Hungarians, Trebisondtans, Mtsi-
ans, ralachians, Transilvanians, Bofniaus, Albanians, Rhodians, Ve;tttians , and divers
other people. In conclusion, my dear Dona, this Prince had to do with all the
Warlike Nations of the World ; but this Tabic contains too many things to he

obedience, Stina, Carinthta, Synope, the Hand of Meteltn ; and aster the battell

<p>was Emperor. He loved the reading of History, he made verses in his own toneue
was very skilsull in Painting, and even to the point, that he sent, as I havealrcad
delared, the Battell which he obtained against the Sophy, drawn with his own haul
tmto the Venetians, who conserve it still unto this day in their Treasuric.   There * *
also a great number of his works tobe seen in the Seraglio:  He was very EIo!
quent, and nothing curious of the magnisicence of Apparell ; and that which I
moft admire in him, is, that he alwayes resuscd thofe adorations which are accu¬
stomed tobe rendred to the Turkissi Emperors, never sussering any to cast them¬
selves on the ground in speaking to him, nor to do him reverence on their knees'
And truly is this Emperor had not blemissied his glory by that prodigipus desire
of reigning, which carried him to take away the lise ofhim, from whom he had
received his;  to cause two of his Brothers, eight of his Nephews, and asmanv
of his Bassaes to be strangled, he had been excellent in all things.    But to pass o-
ver his Vistories lightly, because time doth press us, I will onely tell you hi sew
words, that be won a samous Battle of the Sophy at Zaleran-^ that hetookT^w-
ris, which he kept not long ; andKemanat\i\% return; he rendred himsels Master
of Aladulta, aster he had vanquissicd King Ustagelu; he passed into Sina, where
he deseated Campson Gaun, Sultan of Cairo, in a battel neer to Aleppo, which was
rendred untohim, as viell as Damascru, and all the reH of Siria; from thence go¬
ing to Jerusalem, he conquered all Palestma by the valour of Stnan Bassa, who ob¬
tained a Battel neer to G^^c.^; whereupon ^s//&gt;w, having passed the deserts of £s*»s
sought a battel vvithThomembeyhard by Mat harea, and constrained him to retire
to Cairo, where was given the moft memorable battel of our Age, for it lasted three
dayes and three nights in continuall sight ; but in the end Seljm was vistorious
and kirced the MamelHcks to abandon the City unto him; and having recovered
new forces, they were utterly deseated, and Thom^mbey taken prisoner.   Aster he
had given the pillage of Cairo to his souldiers, as you may see in this Table
where this drcadsull diforder is so well exprest, he went and took ako Alexa»'
dria, Damiettta, Tripoliy and all the rest of Egypt and Arabia : One of his Bassaes
obtained likewise a great Vistory against the Perljam, Butat last, aster hehad been
in somany sights, won so many battails, and conquered so many Provinces   in
less   shantvw) yea-rs, as he thought to return triumphant tothe seat ofhis Empire
he dyed at Chimrli, in the very same place where before he had given battel cohis
sti her, aster he had reigned only eight years.

in need of aU his condust, and of all his, valour. This Battel which you see a

is Bagadet, where Soliman was crowned King of Persia ; but though I have some
ssiare'in this War, as well as in that of Natolia, which you may see also in this
Table, I will reser this narration to another time, that may be more opportune
for us. 1 know, my deai Doria, that this propofition displeases you, but you must

rendred Argter Tributary ; that he hath also subjested Pialli, Tripoli, and Gerbes :
But aster all these things, thatwhich 1 sind tP be moft excellent in thelise of this

narchs, than I commend him for all his Vistories: And whereas I make more ac¬
count of the gists of Nature than of the presents of Forttine, I had rather m^ikc
you anElogium ofhis person in partictslar, than speak surther to yois ofhis Con¬
quest.^ which are alreaciy but too great on Christendom side.   Behold then, my
dear Dona, this Majesticall sace, and this vertuous physiogiiomy ; did you ever
see a more goodly man ? or one of a better aspest ?  There appears in his eyes a
vivacity of spirit, and a sweetness which charmeth hearts, and in the air of his
sace a certain tranquillity, which sussiciently ssiews that thisi Prince is master of
hi-^ passions, and that without doubt he hath no interior trouble; I know not whe-
sher my assestion to hini doth blind ordazle me, but I see spmething ofsuch state
in his port, and of so much majesty over all his persoiii as I hold it irtipoflible for
one to look upon him, and not to love him; Surthermore this goodly apparancc
is notdcccitsull, and the qualities of this Princes soUl are so noble £«iid vertuous,
that is he werea Christian he would be of all men the moft persest.    He h^h to¬
gether, both much valour, and much condust; he is insinitely just towards his own
pconle, and exceeding clement towards his enemies ; he is so rigorous an observer
of Ins word, a$ he  vvould resolve rather to lofe his Empire ,   thin not to
keep It,  when once he hath given it :    He is great in spirit, great in judge-"
mcnt, and great m memory ; he understands the Mathematicks, and the  uni¬
versall History, so admirably, as nothing can be propounded to him tPuching
thofe matters which he resplyes not upon the place.  Sinally, he isaPrihct thac

<p>hanged with black Velvet, set all over with tears and slames imbroidered in pearl:
Here it was where Ibrahim desired his dear Doria to remember the things which he
ssiould see in thischamber,more particularly than all the rest of the Palace, tothe
end he might testisie to the incomparable Isabella,that ssie had always reigned in
his heart, and that to conserve the memory of her, he would never optn his eys in
waking,without beholding some marks ofhis love; he caused him then to observe,
that in the seeling of this chamber were sive great Ovals,in each of which was aTa-
ble,&amp; between every of them hung sestons of slowers and sruits,all gik;the rest of the
seeling being done with corni(hments,whereofsome were of azure,some ofburnissi-
ed gold. In the middle picce,which was greater than the rest,was a woman represen-
ted,\\homDoria presently kncw,because she had somthing oilsabella in her,although
it was a very irapersest resemblance; for Ibrahim having loft her pisture, could do
no more but instrust the Painter with the colour of her hair, with the form of
her sace, withall the seatures of it in particular , with the vivacity of her com¬
plexion, with her stature, and with her bofome ; for as for the air and gracesul¬
ness, which cannot be exprest, bui^in calling it the soul of beauty, it is a thing
that cannot pass from our imagiiption to that of another, and that conseqiicntly
did not permit Ibrahim's Painter to make any marvellous pisture of Isabella ; but
in conclusion it was resembling enough for to cause them, who knew her, to judge
that ssie was thought of when this piece was made.   This irapersest resemblance
having entertained them a while, Doria considered all this Table, and saw (as I have
already declared) a woman sumptuously apparelled, who trampled under her seet
honor, vertue, and love, which were seen represented with the marks whereby they
are known ; and that with her right hand, listed up on high, ssie took srora for¬
tune, who appeared over her in the air, a little Crown , which ssie seemed to re¬
ceive very contentedly, with this Motto,  All for her.    Doria easily comprehended
this Enibleme, and no way doubted, but thatthe Bassa had caused it to be made
out of the opinion he had, that Isabella had despised her love, her promises, and
her constancy, to cspousc the Prince of Majseran, who was but a petty Soveraign.
Aster he had commended the art of the Painter, and the invention of the design,
the Bassa leading him towards one of the corners  cs the chamber, the better to
view the second Ovall, demanded of him whether this other Table would bcas
intelligible to him as the sirst ? Doria approaching to it ,  and considering it,
beheld a Love, in whofe sace choler and sury were sb well painted, as it was easie
to imagine that he himsels hadburst his bow, broken his arrows, thrown away
his quiver, and torn his head-band, which were seen scattered about hira; and that
which better expressed his despair, was, that having nothing lest hira of all the
marks of his Divinity buthis torch, he plunged it, all slaming as it was, into a
sountain to extinguissi it, with this blotto, I cannot.    Doria was so ravished with
this Table, as he coisld not forbear considering all the beauties of it, and whereas
the explication of it was easie, he told the Bassa, that he vvould pardon him for
that he vvould have cxtinguilhed so sair a sire as that wherewith he was inslamed,
at such a time as he thought it to be unjust, but that he held him happy for that he
could not do it, and for having conserved a slame,  whkh he could not put out
without a crime: Aster this he admired the Art of the Painter, and principally
of the torch, which this Love plunged into the sountain, where the excelknt
Workman had so well represented that naturall antipathy betwixt water and
sire as never did any one behold a thing better imitated : This sountain seemed to
boil with choler to see her enemy so neer her ; and this slame desiring to eloign
it sels from that which would destroy it, seemed exceedinglv to strive to get from
it, and rising up on high in wreathing about the torch,mcltcd so great a quantity of
wax, as all the sountain seemcd to be covered over with it.    Ibrah,m not mcrm
P,,r/^ to admire this piece any longer,constrainedhim tolook upon thethird   cie-
siring him howsoever not to bestow much time in it, because iliat Table did ont-

qually ; this woman was on the brink of the Sea, the agitation whereof ssie be¬
held with delight; in one hand ssie held a Crescent, with the other ssie seemed to
p(;int at a Camelion, which was at her seet, and that leaning his body on a part of

</p>
<p>You will withput dpubt sind another sanstuary,  said Doria tp the illustrious
Bassa, whp, answering him no otherwise than with a sigh, made him enter into his
Cabinet, the door whereof was on the right hand ofthe chimney,  not sar from
his bed, which aster the custom ofthe Country was rolled up in a great Persian ta¬
pestry Counterpoint of silke and gold.   But is Doria had admired all that hehad
seen in this Palace, he beheld with astonissiment the magnisicence of this Cabinet
"whereofthe embowed roof   and   walles were inriched with a soliage of pretious
stoncs, upon a ground of black marble, where birds,slowers, and sruites, werescen
so admirably well done, that the art surmounted the matter, although Topazes
Jacints, Opales, Emeraulds, Rubies, Diamonds, and Carbuncles were the colours
wherewith all these things were represented.    Round about this Cabinet were
ssielves of Ebony, sustained by curtrofespsgpld, which projested out cs the wall
wall by equall distances, the edges, and uper part ofthese shelves,   were enriched
with Orpheury, enammelcd onely with white and black, the better to set ofs thofe
things which were upon them; but to speak that in sew words, and consusedly,
which would be too long to describe in order,  one might see there Caskets of
disserent Ambers, great Vases of Christall of the rock, of Cornalinc, and Agate ,
with branches of Corrall, which might rather bc called trees,   by reason of their
prodigious greatness: Sinally, all that Persia, China,  Japon, and all the Oricntall
Countries do produce of moft rare, rich, and beautisull,   were sound amasscd to¬
gether in this place. Aster that Doria had said all, that admiration, and amazcracHt
can make them say, who love, and know rarities, they repassed through the cham¬
ber, to go unto a door that was oppofite to that of the Cabinet,  whereby one en¬
tred into Ibrahims Bath, who, being accommodated with all exterior things, ac¬
cording to the custom ofthe Country where he lived, did not sail in having a
goodly and magnisicent one. It was a place spacious enough, in form Oftangular,
invironed about with seates, whercunto one ascended by sour steps of Jasper, and
Chalcedony,   whereof the twolowcrmoft werccovered with water even up to
the brim ot the third, the sourth being wholly out ofthe water:   At each of the
eight angles was a Colum, aster the Corinthian manner, of Jasper mingled with
divers colours; the Columnes were planted on the sourth step, which served thera
for a pcdcstall, with their Bases, Capitalls, Srizes, and Corniches; the Srize Was
carved in hals relieve, where naked children were seen , who seemcd to combat in
the water with little Sea Monsters,   and to wrastlc with them, with esforts so a-
greeableto their yeares, as the workman dcserved no little glory for the same.
All these sigures were so lively set forth, as they secmed to move,   so easily may the
imagination bc deceived by things that are well represented;   over the Srize was
the Cornissi,  and above that just perpendicular  to every Column rofe up a twy-
ning wreath of Oaken leaves, laid one upon another,   made of green Jasper,  and
bound with silets of gold, mounting up on the i ibbs of the vaulting, and meeting
the middle in the form ofa Chaplct of Triumph. Allthe walls were overlaid with
a compound stone,called AventMrina,and whereof they scemed to be sramed, so ex¬
cellently was this work contrived.But amongtt all the beauties of the place the grea¬
test was, that between thofe eight Columns, whereof I have already spoken, there
were as many Niches, sour of which were silled with great Vases of gold,  that
served to lay the persumes in,   and other things necessary to the Bath ; the other
sour which separated thofe former, were silled with sour Nimphes of white mar¬
ble so admirably sair, as Nature hath never made any thing more beautisull, than
thc'idca ofthis excellent workman :   These sigureswere allin disserent astions j
some of them seemcd to uncloth themselves for to enter int^ the Bath;  others to
come out of it,  putting on their cloathcs again; but all with such art, asDoria
consessed, that Sculpture had never ssiewed any thing more persest. He considered
also that the water, which was seen in the Bath,   sell  into   it throiigh vHo
Vases of Chrittall, which were held by two men , laid along on the brim of the
Bath and represented as Rivers use to to bc painted:   Out of one the Vases isliied
hot water, and out ofthe other cold ,  to the end one might by that mixture sind

tMotind, with a Table-cloth aster themannerof theCountry , upon which were
iet a many of silver Chargers, where in each of them were seen twelve great dissics
oi that which wc can the essence of porcelain, rcpleiiilhcd with divers fortes ot
meates; for it is the custom ofthe Turkes never to cat inany mettall; howbeit they
.re not without great store of silver vessell, onely for magnisicence; and indeed the
•:raiui Visiers Ci'ibbord of plate was so sumptuous, as Europe hath not a K.*ig that
can (lievv so sair a one. D;r/.t then beholding that prodigious amass ofBasons of
5'oMeiigMvcn, great Vases ofsundry formes a-.d of divers bigrtesscs, Slaggons ,
water Pots, andCisternes of gold , with Liouj muzles and Dolphins hals imboft,
could not s)it)car telling Ibrahim that Isabella vvould dyeforjoy, is ssie certainly
knew at what rate he bought the pofsclsion of her ; but the Basla returning him no
other answer thereunto than a sigh, told Deria it was time to dine, that they might
attcivVnids go and take their leave of 5o//w.«;z; that in the mean space, whereas
ihciro.teiior ceremonies were disserent, although their minds were not, hehad
trivcnordei that he ssiould be served in his chamber. Dona went out then of this
Hall, aster lie had observed, that the Per/J"^» Carpet was set all about with great
&lt;:ii(hioiii)s cloth of Gold, upon Carpets of the lame sluss, for Ibrahim and the
Ofsicers of the Empire which did cat with him, to sit upon. The Bassa would
have condust:ed his dear Dona to his lodging, but he would not susser him , so
that he was constrained to leave him in the hands of an Italian slave, in whom he
conhded for all things. These two sriends were not long at meat, for at this time
Ive and sriend(hip produced the same impatiency in them both ; the Bassa came
inu)s&gt;9r/4(rjchamber just ashe was going out, having taken a resolution together
logo immediately to the Seraglio, that they might part away the night ensu-
iiig. The It.tlnw (lave assured the Bassa, that in the evening he ssiould have
kich anh.ibit as I&gt;(?r/.i wore ; for //'r.iW li.rd caused him to quit that of a slave,
as loon as he was at liberty, and by the means ofthofe Jews, of whom Ihave
.already spoken, procured him oneof the Italian sassiion. They went away
then to the Seraglio, where being arrived, Ibrahim made Doria put on a
Turkissi robe, no stiMngcr being permuted to speak to the Sultan but with this
ceremony. The Balsa entred in sirst, to let his Highness know, that according to
his order he had brought his dear Doria ; Soliman ssiewed himsels much sa¬
it-tied therewith, howbeit though he vvere somewh.at impatient to see him, yet
would he tor all that sjieak once more to Ibrahim without witnesses, wherefore he
&lt; anted him to pais along with him into his Cabinet, whither he wasno sooner
come, but looking on our illultrious Bassa with eyes where generofity combatted
.-net, and retaining the tears which kindness .and amity would have ssied in this
hardleparation, he spake mito him with such obliging terms, as/^r^^;«. was not
long without partaking with him inhis melancholy, so certain it is that passions

<p>who 'never gave place to any man in generofity, cast himsels at his seet, and pro¬
tested unto him, that he would not depart before his Highness had testisicd that
he would rely on the word hehad given him to return precisely within the time
presixed ; that he esteemed himsels very unhappy in not being known to his High¬
ness for that which he was, andthat being neither base, ingratesull, noralyarj
he was for all that suspested of thofe three crimes by a Prince, for whom he^
would sacrisise his lise with joy, who reigned in his heart sar more absolutely
than over his people, and who touched his soul with so much tcnderness, as he
plainly selt that he could not turn his steps towards Isabella, without turning his
eyes towards Soltman. Ibrahim pronounced these last words with such^ear-
nestness, as the Sultan no way doubted but that he had truly expressed his heart •
he raised him up then in imbracing him, and promised hira thathe would live in
some quiet of this assurance of seeing hira again ; that in the mean time it was

<p>Elogium of our Illustrious Bassa, as caused hira to blussi more than once; he spake
of his valour, of his prudence, and of his condust in great matters ; sinallyhe as¬
sured him, thathe was as good a Generall of an Army, as he was a good and saith-
sull sriend; he told him surther, that he desired him to receive his sriendssiip as
he already pofsesscd his, having begun to love hira as soon as Ibrahim had made
known tohinis by the recitall of his adventures, what his merit was, and the as¬
sestion which he bore him ; moreover, that as all the interests of Ibrahim were his
so he gave him thanks not only for all the services he had rendred him, but for
all thofe which he ssiould render hira in time to come ; andfora mark of the ob¬
ligation wherein he would stand ingaged to him for it, he conjured him to ac¬
cept of aScymitar whichhe gave him, whereof the hilt and scabberd were asl
covered over with Diamonds. PonV» answered to all these things with all the re¬
spest that he owed to so great a Prince, and being sallen on bis knees to receive
that precious eage of Solimans liberality, he was with a great deal of sweetness
and civility taken up by the Sultan, who prayed hira to assure Isabella, that the
constancy of her Justtniano had been sb sirm during the time thathe beleeved her to
be unsaithsull,as he durst swearfor him, thathe had never sought aster,nor assest¬
ed glory, but outof the hope of dyincT more nobly ; he entreated him also to pre¬
sent her from him with a box of Gold, set with Emeraulds, which was silled
with two Chains, the sirst was of Diamonds of an excelsive greatness, and the se¬
cond of Pearls, so big, so round, so even, andso clear, that the Oricm hath never
ssiewed us sairer. Ibrahim would have spoken to render Soliman thanks, and to
have made himsels the bearer of that Trcasure, but he impofed silence on him,
and sayd, that it would be enough for him to entertain//^^r/Ai with his own as¬
sairs, without charging himsels with a complement from another. Butat last
the Sultan being unwilling that Doria ssiould see him capable of any weakness, and
seeling that this conversation could not long endure without his salling again in¬
to meiancholy, he told the Bassa that he had given order unto the tesqucregi-
basli, who is the Grand Signiors principall Secretary, toraake up the Amb.assador
of Gemuaes dispatch ; that his Letter was conceived in such pressing terms, as that
Republique durst not resuse what he desired of it; that in the mean time, smce he
must resolve to see him depart, he thought it sit that he ssiould go and give order
to his assairs, to the end he might as spon as it was night repair to the Ambassa¬
dor of G^w«'««&lt;'-s vessell, which hehad caused to come from Pera to Conslantinople,
and would attend for them at the Port. This sayd, he dismissed P^rw, aster he
had testisicd much assestion unto him, and retained Ibrahim for one moment more
to take his last saiewell of him ; it was at this instant that Soltman (hewed the
greatest marks of his good-will to the Grand Visier, since it is moft certain,
that silent Ibrrows, though they be not so eloquent as others, yet arc they at the
least aiorc perswasive. When Pslr/4 was gone the Sultan imbraced Ibrahim, but

for him in another chamber ; in their way back they talked of nothing but great
Solman; DorM wasso satissied of him, as he was constrained to consess, that he
ihould want common sense is he were not charmed by the rare qualities of so ex¬
cellent a Prince.    Ibrahim answered hereunto with so much melancholy, as Dorta,
was sain to speak of the Princess to him for to draw him out of it; wherefore he
dextrously told him, that Isabella would be astonislied at the present which she
(hould receive from him.    At this sweet name Ibrahm began to take heart again,
and somewhat dissipating hisheavyness,hctjmed alibis thoughts to his departure.
As soon as he was at his Palace, he entred with Doria into his chamber, where ha¬
ving sent for the Italian slave, he understood by him, that  hishabit was ready;
whereupon he called the principall Ofsicers of his house once more before him,and
told them that he was going to depart away upon that occasion wherewith he had
acquainted thera before, and therefore they ssiould give order to the Porter of his
Palace, that he might not be troubled for the rest of the day, but to send  such as
came about gencrall assairs to the Bassa of the Sea, who during his absence was to
deal for him: Asterthis he commanded them to withdraw, and remained alone
with Dona, and the slave that had brought him his habit.    Now the night be¬
ginning to approach, he held it time to think of parting,  and this slave being of
counsell with them, was appointed by him to go and take that other of Mona-
rn^ and condust him to the Port, whether they would come to them.    Ibrahim
having put on hishabit, took  some   Jewels  with  hin&gt;,  in   case   hee ssiould
stand in any need upon the way by forae unexpested incounter, and   percei¬
ving it tobe dark enough for them to go forth without discovcry, he caused
Doria to dcsccndbyaback'stair, which brought them to a door that opened into
the Garden, the passage out of the which not being sar distant from the Port, gave
them the commodity to get thither easily without  being seen.    And whereas /-
brahim knew precisely whereabout the Christian vessels lay, and espccially thofe of
Arabasladors, he went direstly to the place, where he was attended for by the order
of thcTesqucregibassi, who when he gave the Ambassador his dispatch, had or¬
dained him to be as soon as it was night at the Key, there to receive the two slaves
of whom he hacs been spoken unto him at such time as he had audience from his

<p>Ever was voyage more profperous, than that of Justiniano, ne*
never did the winds more justly second the desires of the Pilot,
and never was the Sea more constant   in calmncss of weather,
than it was in bringing this Lover back again to the Haven,
from whence the tempcst had driven him.   But to savour the
impatience he was in to be with Isabella, let us only say, with¬
out particularizing his course, that aster he was come to all the
Vessells, which the Grand Signior had caused to be arrcstcd,
and drawn out of captiviy all the Christian Slaves which were sound in the se¬
verall Ports where they touched, by vertue of an absolute power that he had from
the Sultan ; aster, I say, that he had passed the Archipelago, and lest Ciprut on the
lest hand, this profperous Sleet arrived in a sew dayes within sight of the Land of
Genoua : There it was where the Ambassador began to reap the sruit ©s his voyage,
by the pleasure he took in thinking that he was going to enter into his City, as it
were in triumph, by bringing thither again thofe sb many Vessels which restored to
the People their kindred and sriends, to the Nobility their children and their
riches, and to the Senate the Grace ofthe Grand Signior, and the lives of two Il¬
lustrious Citizens.    As for Doria, he selt that motion in his soul, which Nature
gives to all thofe who see their Country again aster a long exile, and that not trou¬
bled by the unruliness of passions sollowing without resistance the thoughts where¬
with ssie inspires them ; he had then an extreme pleasure ,   but yet it was a quiet
pleasure. Butfor y«/?/&gt;"^«&lt;», itwasnot so with him, he did not look upon this
Land as the place of his birth, but as the residence of Isabella, and in an instant
he passed over again in his memory all that had arrived unto him there ; and his
transport was so great, that joy produced some essests of ^lies in him ; he chan¬
ged colour divers times, he was unquiet and musing, and is Doria had not forced
him to speak, and express his minde by his discourse, it was to bc doubted in bc-
holdinghim, whether it were hope, or whether it were sear, that agitated his
soul; whether he regrettedCo»/?4)*r/»op/^, or desired Genoua; so certain it is that
violent passions pervert the use of the scnses.   Tears , which ought not tobe but
the marks of forrow, serve sometimes for joy; and silence, which seems so proper
for sadness, is often the estest of an extreme pleasure ; but as we come to one and

his Ve'It 11 to cast anchor three miles from Genoua, and going to pass into anothei^
akerhc had assured thera thathe would obtain their liberty , or be exiled with
,hem, he &lt; bierved that Alphonjo Sptnola, Captain of one of thofe redeemed Ves¬
sel 1   ai d brother to hira whom 'justiniano had slain in desendlllg Rhodolpho,  hung
b ,ck, and v ould not sollow him, whereupon he would needs know the caUse of it;
but Alphonso, vvhofe generofity was extreme, seeing himsels obliged s(&gt;r his lise, and
s,,. his liberty to Justiniano, who during the voyage had testisicd unto, hini with
much resentment the gries hehad had for the misfortune wherein he had been
ingaged ; and knowing likewise that the death of his brother had hapned with
someiiiit'k, he besought the Arabassador not to think it strange is he did not at-
tciul uLon him to Genoua, being absolutely resolved never to enter into it without
his Deliverer ; that knowing his Sather, as he did, he was well assured that he
would with alibis power oppofe them that would revoke the Sentence which had
been eivcn against Justiniano ; so that to hinder his violence, he purpofed to write
unto him, that is he would have his sonne again, he must pardon his enemy; that
his fortune was conjoyned with his, and that he would never have such a reproach
laid upon hira, as that a man, who had drawn him out of setters, and brought
hira back into his Countrey, should not injoy the liberty which he had given him.
Alphonjo pronounced this speech with somuch earnestness, as allthat heard him
were ravilncd with his resolution; and Justiniano was so charmed therewith, that
not .'l&gt;le to forbear imbracing him, and not sussering hira to say more, he conjured
him that he would not force hira to be ingratesull; that is nothing buthis blood
would satissie the revenge of his kindred, he would be moft ready to ssied it for his
sake, but having forae hope to serve thera raore profitably in his person , when oc-
ca(i( 11 sliould present it scls, he would spare no care nor good ofsice for it, so as ic
might be done without ofsence to his honor; that he had performed  a gallant a-
stion in desiring to stay with him, but that he (hould do an unworthy one, and sull
of inhumanity is he ssiould consent unto it ; and that therefore it was more just,
that he stiould go and dry up his sathers tears, and moderate his sury by the  joy
which hiblight would bring him, than to do a thing that would procure him his
hatred.    Alphor.jo did not yecld at sirst to the desire of Justiniano, but the Ambassa¬
dor and I)&lt;7rM tiding withsaim,he was constrained to submit to their scnsc,and to let
his inclination be overcome by anothers reason.    These illustrious sriends parted
with somuch adoe, as is Dona had not perceived by Justmianoes watch, that the
time of the Senates Assembly pressed the Ambassador to depart, is he would have
audience as soon as he ssiould arrive, they would have spent a great part ofthe day
mthis noble contestation, whereof all the glory consisted in obliging his enemy.

<p>thered together in a very great number, and they no longer doubting but that
these vessells, which now they knew, brought them back both their brethren , and
their children, such a noise of acclamations arofe on the suddain, as they all spake
without understanding what they said themselves, and without being understood
of others; wives called spr their husbands; sathers inquired aster their children;
some ran into the City to advertise their sriends of it; others ran out of it with
their whole samilies; they in the Vessells cryed to let them know whether all were
well at home; at last so great a noise was formed of all these cries and raurmures,
as the Ambassador had much adoe to make his orders bc understood : He comman¬
ded all tlie Qhiestaincs to Accompany him to the Palace, and particularly Alphon¬
so not to be sar from him; tsicy traversed the City in this fort, sollowed by the po¬
pular multitude, who ceased not from testisying their joy, both by their teares,
and by their acclamation. When they were at the Gate ofthcPalace, the Am¬
bassador advanced three or sour steps before his Troop, thathe might the better sur-
prise that honorable Company. At his sirst appearing they sought to know the suc-
ccss ofhis voyage in his sace, but as soon as they perceived all the Commanders of
their Vessells, the gravcst and moft moderate amongst thera could not chuse but
ssiew signcs oftheir amazement, and joy; and when this sirst emotion was appea-
sed, the Ambassador, haying made a low obeisance to the Duke, and the like to the
whole assembly, began to speak in this fort.

<p>The Oration p/Antonio Lomelino to the Duh^and
Senate of Genoua.
</p>
<p>IS the profperous succcss ofmy voyage had been an essest of my condust , ofmy
care, and of my address , I ssiould without doubt have had so much modesty
as to declare in sew words the estate of things, for to attend from so honorable
an Assembly the praisej which a service of such importance would have dcserved,
without giving them to my sels; and I ssiould also have been so generous, as to
have been sully satissicd with the onely thought of having been profitable to ray
Country; but whereas Ihave no part in the glory of this astion, but contrarily I
my sels am obliged for my lise tothe Deliverer of so many illustrious .^Javesat
I have brought you back , and which are all, either your kinsraen, or your
sriends, it behoves me, both that I may not be ingratesull in ray particular, and
that also I may keep you from being so in generall , to report sathsully unto
you how the matter hath past, to the end thatby understanding all the circum-
stances you may the better know, how it is the interest ofthe Republique , which
makes me speak with so much earnestness.
</p>
<p>You arc to understand then, my Lords, that whereas the Emperor Soliman belie¬
ved, that the Law of Nations had been violated in the person ofhis Chaoux, he
thought that hemightdoc the like in that of your Ambassador, so that as soon as
I was arrived at Pera, and that according to the custom I had demanded audience
of his Highness, I saw my sels constrained to pass by his order from my Vessell into
a strcight prison, without telling me the cause therof, in such fort as he that came
to obtain the liberty of others, saw himsels deprived ofhis own, and laden with
chaines. 1 was two dayes intreated in this manner with a great deal of rigor, and
I very well perceived by the countenance of them which guarded me, that they
believed my head was the onely price ofmy liberty. As I was in this unquietness I
saw the Aga ofthe Janizaries enter, who caused mc to be told by Dragoman ofthe
grand Signiocs, whom we call an interpreter, that his Highnes^s willing to give me
audience had commanded him to condust rae to Constantinople without any ceremo¬
ny; this mutation surprised me somuch the more, for that I could not imagine the
caiisc of it, having been well enough informed, that Soltman doth not easily change
hisresolutions, .and that repenting is a motion of the soul which is almoft un¬
known to him: In the meantime I beheld my setters broken ofs, without seeing

it is a man whom you have exiled because he withstood a violence; it is a man
uhomyou have chased away because he had beenso generous as to save his ene¬
mies lise; it is a man whom you have banissied because he ssied his blood totake
part with the weaker, and vvho by misfortune killed one of your Citizens, noi
only to securc his own person, but to assi'st an undesended raan; sinally, my Lords,
it I shy JttsiiNiano that we are living; it is by him that we breath the air of our

<p>tarried but one day longer before we arrived at the place, where h.* was retained
Solimofts Order had come too late to work that which he had formerly given, and
the succour of jujliniano had been in vain ; Now s leave it to be judged, whether
the reparation be equall to the crime, and whether Philippo hath realon to oppofe
the return of Justiniano.    But not to conceal one important thins? that may lead
him to a goots sense, I must say surther, that Alphonso, who cannot'^be worthily t-
nough praiscd, and whofe presencc keeps nic from speaking more of it, knowing
how sar he is obliged to Justiniano, is absolutely resolved to sollow die fortune of
his Deliverer; it is by his order that I speak, and his silence doth sussiciently prove
this verity unto you; it is notbut to consirm what I say that he iscome hither,&amp;:rto
obey JststmianoyVjho would not let him stay with him as he desired. At last,my Lords,
is Philippo will preserve his son he must joyn his prayers to thofe of all the people,
who conjure you to accord the grace of him who hath silled your City with abun-
dancc,&amp;: all the samilies ofGenoua with joy; all the acclamations of gladness, which
you hear at the Palace gate,speak to you for pardon and mercy;but is you oppofe the
severity of the Laws to prayers so just,so pressing,and necessary for the publick tran¬
quility, I have to answer you, that it is not to ofsend them, but to satissie justice,
which ought to be the rule of thera ;  and that the sarae Lawes, which will have
a crime punissied, will also have vertue recompcnced.     Is there be need of exam¬
ples of Sentences that have been revoked, all antiquity will surnissi us therewith :
Aristides was banissied by the Oftracisme, and repealed within three yeares aster;
Cimon vJaseyiMedsron\ Athens y  and intreated to  return , even   by   thofe that
had driven hini away ;   at Sparta one Leontidas was used in the same manner; a-
nubngst the Lacedemonians. Philoxenus had the same fortune;   and is we will go to
Rofitey we ssiall sind, that Seneca was banissied by Claudius, and called home againby
him for some praises which hehad given him in a letter of consolation, thathe
wrote to Polibius his savorite; judge now my Lords,   whether slattery spoken
with a good grace may enter into comparison with the service that.Jnstmiano hath
rendred you.   But to pass from antiquity to the   modern age, have we not
seen amongst the  Venetians HortensioCcntarini condemned to a perpetual banidi-
ment, who returned into his Country a little aster with the same  honors   which
heformelyhad there ? And without going to seek for authorities amongst our
neighbors, which we may sind amongst our selves, hath not one seen Antonia Pre'
^o2.&lt;i exiled for ever from his Country, who nevertheless was by adecree from the
Senate restored to his former liberty in Genoua? I could also sind many other
particulars in History to consirm my propofition, but I think itmay sussice,   that
Greece and Italy have marked you out the way, which you may  sollow without
sear of sailing, aster so many Illustrious examples. Howbeit you will peradventure
say, that albeit you could insringe your Lawes in savor of Justiniano,  because   he
hrth done you such great services, yet Doria cannot pretend to the same grace, see¬
ing he himsels oweth his liberty to our Deliverer; but I am to answer you for the
glory ofthis disintcressed sriend, who hazarded his lise, by a generofity without
example, to revenge the outrage which the Prince of 3/(i/^4« did to Jujliniano,
that this astion scemed so gallant to Soliman, when as Justiniano recounted it unto
him that he hath judged Doria worthy of his protestion: Besides do you not ima¬
gine* that the interests ofthese two illustrious persons can ever be separated.    And
to tell you all that I think in this incounter, prepare your selves to execute what
I h.ive promised, or resolvc to lofe at the same instant all the commanders of your
Vessells, who have every one, as well as my sels ,   solemnly sworn never to enjoy
the liberty which Justiniano hath gotten us,  unless   he be partaker of it with us.
As for me, vvho doe certainly know of what importance this astair is for the pub¬
lique good, I ssiould think that I ssiould betray my Country, is I ssiould conceal the
eagernes vvhich I observed in the mind of Soliman, when as he told rae that one ot
his slAves having sound grace in his sight, had besought hira to pardon us; and that
he had consented thei-cunto, provided that you ssiould revoke the Sentences, which
yuuhad given againis Jt^jliniano ^nd Doria; wherein is you sailed,he sworcinsury,

prey of despair and forrow,   had not the sight of his Sonne been at length sound
more powersull, than the image ofhis past misfortune: He knew so distinstly the
sense of Alphonjo by the motions ofhis sace,  as being assiamed to be less generous
than he, he let his resentment be surmounted by so noble an example, which pre¬
sently appeasedall the troubles ot his spirit ;   so  that seeling himsels in a more
peaceable estate, and seeing the Duke about to speak,  he to prevent him besought
him with teares in his eyes to restore that unto Justiniano, which his profecutions
had taken from him; it being just, since sie had rendred him a sonne, that he ssiould
render him his liberty.    This discourse so ravissied the whole Assembly,that con¬
trary to their custom, and the respest of the place, they sent forth cries of joy,
which did not cease very soon; but amongst the rest the young Count of Lavagna ,
together with Alphonso,vjho were present,   thought they should never have been
silent again;   the sirst could not sussiciently commend this astion, and the other
could not forbear saying,   that he was more obliged to his sather for vanquissiing

the Citizens \vhich hehad delivered, but with this glorious disserence, that the one
touched ihtm v.-th compallion which looked on them, and thatthe others mspired
all d,cm that beheld them with joy, the former were sreemen that were made llaves,
and dielc were slaves to whom liberty was given : And is heretofore at Rome he was
crowned with glory that saved the lise of a Roman Citizen, what crown, and what
glory was not &gt;i?w.t»o Worthy of, who by his generofity hindred notonleythe
death of so great a number of men, but the utter destrustion of his country ?   And
i lukcd iie was received with so many acclamations, as never was so universall a jov
icen in Genoua before.   This while the Ambassador being set forth in a Seluca with
yi!l&gt;hc,i\n and (ome others, and having a good way out-gone Jnnetins Galley, made
with .ill (peed to Jujliniano, who since they parted from him had scarcely spoken
to Dona, so much was he taken up with the thought of Isabella.    As soon as they
werencTr enough tobe understood , they began to talk to him of triumph and
glory, lu^t having the patience to stay till they were aboord the vessell to let him
s now the happy (iicccls of their voyage.  Dona answered this interrupted discourse
with  crycsofjoy; but y«/?/w;./w made it appear by the moderation ofhis, that
his liberty was not the terra of his desires; he received his sriends for all that with
a great deal of civility, and without attending their surther relation, he would
have rendred them thanksfor their careand assestion, but they had too much to
say 10 permit him to speak.    The Ambassidor would have discharged the Senates
Commillion; &gt;4/pW/9 would have acquanted him with the generofity ofhis sa¬
ther ; another would have dclcribed unto him the extasie of the people ; and mau-
ver the coldness of the Nation, the impatience they were into speak all together,
iiKiSe a consiilion amongst them, which yet kept not J«/?/«;.t;7e trom clearly per-
'civing, that his generoiity was acknowledged, and his grace signed. But where¬
as the t;alley still approached, Julitmano sayd, that it was not just they ssiould stay
from goingto meet thofe Illustrious sriends, who came to restore him to lise, in
J estoring him to his liberty :  He commanded them to weigh Anchor, which being
pieseiitly executed, they made towards the Galley, that, carryed along with sayls
;iiul oares, reached them in a little space.   There it was where Justiniano selt an cx-
tiaoiilinary emotion upon the sight of the young Count of Lavagna, whom the
Airbaslador (hewed unto him ; he  whofe sather had alwaies been the protestor of

<p>for him as Sinibaldo had had ; and conjured him to ssiew him the same savour.  On
the other side Doria, though he were not well satissied with Andrea Prince olMeU
phi, nor with Jannetin his Nephew, yet carryed he himselt curteously unto hint
and then went and received the civilities of his sriends.   During all these caresses'
Jannetin desiring to   give some mark of esteem and joy to Justiniano, caused a lar-
gcss tobe distributed amongst the slaves, to the end they might row with the more
speed.    Justiniano received this gallantry very civilly, and withall assured the
slaves, that when he came home he would remember that they had brought him to
the Port, as accordingly he sent them the next day two thousand Crowns.    As
soon as they approached to Genoua , all the vessels that were in the Port, having
received a commandment to ssioot ofs all their Cannon when Justiniano (hould ap-
pcar, sailed not to salute hini ; the Galley answered them with sour peeces of
Ordnance, anda volley of Musket-ssior, and the like did all that were on the
walls.   Is one would^dcscriBc the number of Citizens that were at the Port, the
acclamations of joy,  the thronging that was there to see these resuscitatcd men,
thetumult that was amongst them in striving who ssiould come nearest to their
Deliverer, it would almoft take up a volume that ssiould treat of nothing else; it
were better then, that amidst this popular crowd we ssiould condust Justiniano to
the Senate, sollowed by the Count of Lavagna, Jannetm, Dona, Alphonso, and all
the Commanders ofthe vessels, as also the slave of ^o»/ir£', -whom Justiniano had.
en joyned not to budge from him.   When sirst they appeared, the Duke out of more
than an extraordinary savour advanced to receive him, aster which he appointed
all the Senators to take their places, and then commanded the Register of the Se¬
nate to desace the Sentences which had been pronounced against Justiniano and Do-
riUyand to read the abolition of them, which was conceived In such gentle and
advantageous terms, as it plainly appeared, that even their crime dcserved more
glory than punissimcnt:  The reading whereof being ended, the Duke began to as¬
sure Justiniano in the name of the whole Assembly, that .aster they had satissied the
pleasure of Soliman, yet held they not themselves for all that acquitted towards
him; that the Senate in gencrall, and they allin particular, were resolved not to
stay there, but to testisie unto him with more utility ,   that they were not wor¬
thy ©s the benesits theyhad received from him; that they desired him also to raze
outof his memory, as he was razed out of their Records, the remembrance of
the sentences which had been given against him and his sriend.   To this Justiniano
answered, that inbanissiing him they had satissied Justicc, and that in repealing
him they had rather (hewed their clemency than their equity; that the service
which he had rendered to the Republique, was not considerable, seeing he had
done it but to satissie his duty; and that also, in acknowledgement of the grace it
had done him, he swore solemnly alwaies to hazard both his fortune and lise for
the interest and glory thereof, so often ai occasion ssiould present it sels soi^it:
This sayd, he turned him to Philippo Spmola,  and intreated him to pardon AU
phonso tor his sriendssiip towards him, and to belecve that it could never have
sound place in his heart, had he not persestly known during his voyage, thatthe
death of his brother had made hira ssied more tears, dian he had loft bloud ; that it
his generofity would permit him utterly to desace out of his mind the resentracnt
of that unlucky accident; he besought him to adopt him for his sonne, and to at¬
tend from him the same services, and die same obedience, as he could have desired
from him of whom he was so unfortunately deprived ; but is that contrarily
the apprehensions of Nature did still ihvite him to revenge, he promised to banissi
himsels voluntarily; and is that were not  yetenotigh, he would lubraitto the
greatest rigor of Justicc.    P^r%.wassomovedw.th this discourse, as is hehad
not already signed ihe grace of Justiuiauo in coiisideratison of his son, he could not
have sSn doing it,and embracing hini; so true it is that vertue hath powersull
harmes for a gencsous soul. That venerable old man answered him with teares in
his y'/that h^ruld never oppofe ^/p^^^^^^^^

no was no longer alive, yet had not the Count changed the order of his assairs, be¬
ing absolutely resolved not to conser his estate upon his heirs, before he was cer¬
tainly assured that he was dead. Asfor D.r/;t, theCount cou d not get himtogo
along with him, though he would have been glad to have past the rest of the day
in the company of his sriend, but his kinsraen carried him much against his will
away with them, having sirst condusted Justtniano as well as all the rest, to the
Counts Palace, where every one departing, except some sew whom he retained at
dinner with Ju(ltniano,he led him to thechamber of Leonorahis wise, who recei¬
ved hira with a great deal of curtesie, and sodid Sophronia, Leonoraes sister, which
was there with her. But as soon as civility permitted him to retire, he turned
all his thoughts to Monaco-; and whereas he saw that the neccssity of good manners
would hole! him three or sour days at Genoua to receive and to return the visits of
his sriends, he resolved to seud thither the same day, the rather for that he judged
it tit to understand the Princesses pleasure before he went toher; he propofed his
design then unto the Count, and desired him to let him have one of his servants
for to execute it,and to put Into his hands the Princesses Ofsicer,whom he had sound
a slave at Constant inople. The Count could not resuse him so just a request, but on¬
ly told him that he was to dine sirst ; Whilst they vvere attable their conversation
was no other than asking Justiniano questions concerning his fortune, Vvhereunto
he still answered with somuch address, as without saying any thing against the
uiith, he discovcred nought that might prejudice him ; howbeit he recounted un¬
to them his gries and despair, whenas he believed in Germany that IsabelU had
maried the Prince of ^/.?j/cr4«, as also that having taken a resolution to die , he
V vent and irabarqued himsels upon the Baltique Sea;that there he was made a slave
was carried to ConstantmBple,and given to the Grand Signior, where Dm^ arri¬
ved asterwards by an adventure almoft like tohis; that "his good fortune had so
wrought, as his Highness having sound something in his person, which touched
his'inclination,his(hvery hadnot been very hard, is his Sriends, his Mistress
and his Religion had not been obstacles to his selicity ; but he would not let them
know thathe had been Grand Visier, nor how in thatChargehehaduiightily ser¬
ved Christendom, for sear lest this astion ssiould have been ill interpreted by them
that could not dive into the bottom of his heart. Dinner being done, lustiniano
dclired the Count to permit him to go and write in his Cabinet before he was
hindercci by company, which no doubt would be with him ere it were long The
(.ount, who was not willing that his own pleafore ssiould destroy that of his

<p>"im a long time from drawing up his Letter ; but in the end aster he had wri
allthat which his respest, his joy, and his passion had inspired hira with, he gave
his packet to a Gentleman, whom the Count had asiigncd him for it; he praved
him to go, and come again from Monaco, with all the speed that poflibly he could-
and to add moreover to that savour the observing the astions of IsabelU    at such
timeas ssie ssiould understand of his return , and that ssielhoisld see him    whom
he had sent her back ; that Ofsicer of hers too he caressed exceedingly, snd assu¬
red him thathe would acknowledge the pains which hehadsiissered for his consi¬
deration. Justiniano had no sooner ended his dispatch , but that all the illustr'-
ous persons of the City cametovisit him, with an extreme impatience to learn
from his own mouth the success of his adventures. But v\hilst he is satissying the
curiofity of so sair an Assembly, and telling thcni things which we know as veil
as he, let us go and content ours at Monaco, and see with what eye , and in what
manner the Princess will receive the agreeable newes of her Lovers return.   When
these happy Messengers arrived the next day at Monaco it wa% very neer night so
that although one of them belonged tp the Princess, yet was he not known   nor
vvould he discover himsels, the better to surprize her :   It wascnly told then to
Isabella, that a Gentleman from the Q,ount of Lavagna, andangther, who were
newly arrived in a Barque, desired to speak with her, and that they had order to
deliver their message to none but her sels    She was at that time in her Cabinet
where slie had ssiut up her sels that day to read over all the Letters vvhich ssie had'
received from Justiniano; ssie was vexed then to bc interrupted in an imploymenr,
that made up together bothherjoy and her gries; ssie comraanded notwithstan¬
ding that they ssiould be brought in : But when ssie came to know hira, vvhom ssie
had sent to seek lustiniano, ssie was so surprized, and so amazed, out ofthe opinion
she had that his voyage was in vain, as the apprchension thereof keeping her from
speaking, gave the Counts Gentleman opportunity to tell her, tha.t lustmiano had
given him in charge to present her with a Letter srora him. This discourse re¬
vived her spirits for a while, but searing ssie had not understood him vvell,ssie made
that agreeable name vvhich touched her heart so scnhbly, to bc spoken to her once
again; whereupon the Gentleman told her, that the paper he had presented to her
vvould satissie her better than he could.    She cast her eyes then upon the Letter,
vvhich assured her that it was lustinianoes h3nd,so that in an instant ihe aba\idon-
ed her sels over wholy to joy, and with an extreme precipitation broke up the
seal of thcLettcr for to read that which sollows here.

and whereas it was late, ssie got her to bed without eating anything, notwith¬

and to oblige hira to make hast, ssie sent hira a Diamond worth sive hundred

neccssity of your antient misfortunes hath constramedyou to carry your scls in this fort ; ht

<p>They who know, by experience the essests of love, will easily imagine that
which the sight ofthis Letter wrought in the soul of Justinmr.o ; he had for all that
a domestique enemy, which went alwaies traversing his pleasures, by putting
him in mind that he was yet a slave at Constant mople, though he appeared a sree¬
man at Genoua In the mean time the Count sent him word how hebejceved he
had forgotten, that he was in his own house, and that it was he which wasto en¬
tertain and honour his sriends there. This rtproath of gallantry obliged him ro
go in unto them,who all lest him a little aster,s xcept Vena, to give him liberty for
to think of his assairs; but whilst he was setling his house, the Count sent him all
rhe money which he had received of his estate in his absence, with order tc&gt; his
Steward to render him an accompt of it. Justiniano was so amazed, both at his
own riches, and the generofity of his sriend, as he had much ado to resolve to take
that which was his own ; howbeit searing to do an outrage to the Count, instead
of doing him a civility, he received his mony, but would not susser the Steward
howsoever to particularise anything ofhis assairs; telling hira only, that provided
he could assure him he gave him nothing of another bodies, it ssiould sussice for the
nuking up ofhis accompt; that in the mean time to make some acknowledgment
for the care he had taken to enrich hira,hc gave him twelve thousand Crowns.This
man searing a check from his Master,playd t}\i\egcniTofo as much as he could,and la¬
bored exceedingly not to accept ofa thing which he earnestly desircd:but at length
he must obey the pleasure of Jujliniano, who thinking of nothing hut Monaco gave
order for the making him clothes against the next day ; and not to loic time, aster
he had desired the Counts Ofsicer to proviilc him attendants, to make up his Train
with all pofsible care and speed, he went forth with his dear Por/^ to render the

great a company in his chamber, as that which he had met widi abroad; for al-

and hearaSerenado of Lutes and Voices which the Count gave him,upon reniem-
briim that he had heard say, how the sirst palhon of Justiniano had been by musick :
Thetount alio presented unto hira a Srench Gentleman, whom he dearly loved,
and deiiiedhim tocitecmof him forhis sake, untill such time as he ssiould make
himsels worthy of it by th.-knowledge of his merit, which without doubtwpuld
not be long sirst. This complement being sinissied, every one retired save Doria^
whowi I.Id not abandon our Lover, untill he had restored him into thearmsof
his Miitris. The night past away with a great deal of unquietness and impatience
s )v Jn'hniano; but whatsoever resolution he had taken to be gone by the break of
day, he re uld not get out ofGenoua before it was almoft noon. In the end he ira¬
barqued hinudl in the Galley which had been prepared for him, taking no more
With I.; r. nun hi J dear Por/^, and sbraeof the Counts people for to serve him: He
had at that instant so extraordinary a joy out of the thought that the term of so
s!r&gt; t a navigation ssiould be the sightof7/^^ts//4, as it reslested in his sace,vvas seen
in hi  eyes, appeared in his discourse, ssiewed it scls in all his astions; and one
would have thought, that he went out of slavery in going out of Genoua, and that
Monaco wa$ not only the place of his birth, but that he was attended there to be
dec tared the Conqueror of all Natious, to receive the honor ofa Triumph, and to
mount into a Throne; that he was also expested by the Princess for to be crowned,
not by the hands of fortune, but by thofe of love. And whereas he had not so much
ambition, as desire to be beloved, the Empire of allthe Earth could not have given
him a joy so sensible,as that ofthe heart of Isabella. This Princess imagining right¬
ly, that Jusliniano would not be long before he came to see her, had given order at
the Port, that as soon as a Galley ssiould be discovered from Genoua--vilrdy ssie
should be advertised of it, being perswaded that they would not let lusl-iniano come
in a Sckicj; so that when he appeared, notice was thereof given the Princess, and a£
the lame instant all the wall was set on sire with a vasley of Musquet ssiot; all the
great Ordnance likewise was discharged, the dreadsoll noise whereof could not
keep y«y?/«;4«6. from being plcalingly assured, that thofe slames were an essest of
them which love had kindled in the heart of Isabella, who presently dispatched a-
vvav ssie principall of her servants, and the moft considerabk of the Inhabitants of

<p>thorough the midst of them, and so he marched till he came to the Portall of the
Castle , where the Princess attended him.    When as sirst he appeared ssie advan¬
ced to receive him, so that to save her some stepps, and to sollow his inclination,
he went as sast as pofsibly he could, and kissed her roab.    It  was at this  instant
that thofe  persest Lovers selt that which cannot be exprest ; and albeit they
had resolved on both parts to contain themselves,   and had also prepared their
minds for the making of some complement to one another in this incounter,
their silence,   and then  their interrupted discourses , made it apparent to all
that beheld them ,  that excess of pleasure excited such a trouble in their soules,
as would not permit them to express all that they thought; but to conceal this
agreeable transport from the eyes of her subjests, the Princess caused lustinia¬
no to enter , aster ssie had salutcd Doria with a gteat deal of civility :  When
they were arrived at Isabellaes chamber, all that had accompanied thera were
obliged by respest   to withdraw,  two or three excepted, which remained to
entertain Doria , whilst the Princess talked with Justiniano.    Never were two
hearts rcplenissied with so much joy;   never had two spirits more charming
transports; and never did two amorous persons' so persestly express the mo¬
tion-; of their soules by their onely lookes ; they said both of them together,
and at one instant , that they had alwaies   loved one onother; that they still
loved  one another;   and that they Would love one another eternally: But as¬
ter this dumb language had made all their apprchensions to pass from one heart
to another, Justiniano began to render the Princess thanks  for all her   goodness
towards him ;   but ssie, not able to susser the continuanceof this discourse, con¬
jured him  to remember,   that their interests could not be separated ,  and that
owing him   all things it was unjust to thank her;   espccially having done no-
thing'^for him ,   than what ssie coisld not chuse but doe ;   namely to weep for
his absence,  to sear his changing , to apprehend his lofs, and to renounce asl
the pleasures of this lise, since ssie could not have that of seeing him.    Jujli¬
niano ansviered thevennto,  that this neccssity ,  which ssie had impofed upon her
sels, was so sair a mark of her assestion, and so glorious for him , that unless
he ssiould be the moft ingratesull of men,  he was obliged to thank her eter¬
nally ; As for the rest, her teares being of so inestimable a price , ssie must not sind
it strange, is being  unable to render her any service that could  merit that
honor , he resolved at least to tell her often,  that he knew well he was unwor-
of it.    This conversation was interrupted by the Sergeant-major of the Ga-
rison    who according to the  commandment which the  Princess had   given
him for it ,   came to demand the word of Justtniano ^ this GaUanterie sur¬
prised him as pleasingly, as the  former which had been done  him upon his
landing at the Port; and as he was no less civill, than J/^M/^ was obliging,
he said unto her with a low voice, and beholding her with eyes sull of love,
and respest, that a man ,  who knew not how to rule his desires,   and that would
die her Slave , was not in a state to command others:   But what reason soe¬
ver he could allege,  he must obey Isabellaes pleasure ; yet was it not for all
that but upon condition, that ssie ssiould give the word as well as he,  and.
that he ssiould   not, but aster her,   sinissi this mysteric of Warre,   which at
this time was absolutely guided by love.   For as is these two illustrious per¬
sons had agreed together about this gallanterie, the word ,   which the Princess
Lave to the  Sergeant-major , was sound to be Jt^stintano-   and that  whi^
%ullintano gave, aster he had long resuscd to doeit, was the sair name of//4-
iella     This conformiticofspirkandthought was equally pleasing tmtothctn;
forthough they knew not what each of them had said,  yet did  they undcrstand
i^by a cXkment between them; for Jusituiane assured the Princess, that raauj
cer her cXsie Isabclh ssiould reign still at Monaco; and the Princess assured

seat of th.it to come, could not trouble his pleasures;  and his present happi¬

an hearing her talk ; but at length, seeing that this reason did not content her, he

of it in my perlon, you ssiall understand, that aster I was come to Coustantiuople,
laden with iron, as well as my companions, without any disserence betwixt us,
but that they tried every day to break their chains, and that I bore mine with a
tranquillity of minde, yet melancholick withall, which made them perceive that
lise and liberty were not the objest of my desires; this knowledge which they had
of my apprchensions during the voyage, was the cause that they concealed from
me the resolution they had taken, when we were come to Censtantinople, of killing
their Guard, that so they might save themselves ere they sliould be presented to the
Gr.md Signior; andthcy carried thekdesign so well, as it was not discovered a-

<p>saw nothing but tears of forrow, but as soon as the lot had scpar.Tted the soitu-
tunate from the infortunate , these last changed their forrow into ra^e and ciio
ler so transported them, as they could not endure the sight of thcnulia't were de¬
livered : Yet was it not they whom destiny relerved for this suprenie disc^race- so'
the Bassa having moderated his siiry, would have our lives once more depend' ab¬
solutely upon the caprichiousness of fortune ; he ordained then, that cs thirty
which we were, no more than three ssiould susser; and the lot so savoured the d- -
sire I had to die, that I was one of thofe unhappy men, according to the sense of
othcrsjthough in mine own heart I was ofa con trary opinion.The two that proved
ray companions in this sad adventure, were without doubt the worthiest of all the
slaves, they were young, handsom, and courageous, and even such as the very Ex-
cutioners themselves, who were to take away our lives, had some regreet to
see, that chance had made a choiceso unjust according to their thinking, sothat
one of them moved with compassion, went and advertised the Bassa, that in lolin;*
us he would lofe th e propercst slaves that ^vere in Censtantinople, and the sittest to
make a present of to his Highness.    The Bassa, who repented him already of his
violence, inregard of his own interest, and yet desired that some one of us ssiould
be punissied, resolved at length for the last catt, that of wc t/jree butoneslienJd
dye, and that according to the sirst order, chance ssiould still be the absolute niastcr
of our lise or of our death.    The lot was not more savourable to me in this la(t
incoiinrer, than in all the former, and I was the sacrisice destined for the publiquc
s seiy ; I was then presently bound more straitly than before;  they made nie my
sels carry the preparations of my puniihment; and without boasting 1 can avow,
that I  saced death with tranquillity enough : 1 dare not almoft say, that in this
wofull estate you were the only objest of my thought, yet it is true how I imagi¬
ned, that this obstinacy of fortune, in chusing me still to be ("acrisised, was an c'^t^
of your desire, and that she did not judge rae unworthy to live, but because yoii
judged rae unworthy of your assestion.    In the end I received this sentencc, as is
it had been pronounced by you, and in that thought I wenttoray punissimcnt with
so much resolution, as bred wonder and compalTion in them that beheld me.   As
for my sels, I was sar from being asslisted at mine own proper miseries; I had
some delight in my setters and chains; and the very sight of death could not keep
mc srora having forae happy raonients; for my love, doing its last and utterniult
indeavour, in sollowing me to the grave, perswaded me, that is you had seen the
same Justiniano, upon whom at other times you had accunnslated glory, be ready
to yeeld up the ghoft in adoring you, with the moft cruell torraents that the rage
of tyrants hath ever invented, you would at leastwise have breathed scJrth some
sighs, and ssied forae tears.    The Princess, not able to endure that he thould cunci-
jiucthis discourse any longer, somuch trouble did this deadly image excite in her
soul, assured hira with a great deal of tcnderness, andher eyes sull of tears, that
this narration touched her   so sensibly, as albeit (lie could not doubt but that he
had cscaped this perill, yet could ssic not chuse but be in sear for hini, and seel siich
a gries in her mind, as (he was not able to express.  Justiniano \\a% no \ts% moved
with the tears ofthe Princess, than ssie had been by his relation; and when he had
rendred her thanks for so generous an apprchension, Dorta told him, thathe could
not beuer acquit himsels of that devoire, than to acquaint her by what inchant¬
ment he got out of this adventure.    Isabella having testisicd by her astion, th.u P&lt;?-
rMsHmpatience washer?, Justiniano profecuted his History in this manner.   Since
your Excellency will know how I was delivered, 1 am to kt you underltanti, that
to go srora the place where my doom had been pronounced, to that where it was
to be executed, we wer e of nee essity to pass by one of the saces ofthe Sciiglio, and
my good luck would have it, that when we carae to that part, the ^nlt.mx Ajlena,

<p>many things of my constancy and resolution to Soliman, as it begot a desire m him
to see me; io that sending a coraraand to deliver me, I received order by a Truche-
man to go unto the Grand Signior.   Totell you , Madam , what this change
wron-ht^in me would be to no end, since it is easie for you to judge, that he, who
so much despised lite, received it not with much joy; and I dare say, that 1 stood
in more need of constancy to resolve to live,  than another would have had to re¬
solvc to die : Howbeit Iwent to his Highness, and whatsoever aversion I had from
lise, yet did InuL forbear rendring him thanks for granting it to me. When sirst I
appeared before Solimanhe began'to speak to me; for whereas he knew before that
\\\.\s of Italy, he beleeved that I would understand a language, which at Coustan-
s/wop/s they caU the sr^w^^toung, and spoken there by every one for the commo-
ditic of commerce, and which also I understood persestly, because it is no other
than r, corrupted Italian.    It was not,forthat this Prince, out of an extraordinary
curiofity proper to thofe of his Nation, is not acquainted, not onely with allthe
Orientall tongues, but with the Spanish, the Srench, and the Italian ; howbeit in re¬
gard he doth not exercise them, he understands them only, without being able to
speak them with sacilitie: nevertheless I must for the present except the last,which
in consideration of rae he learned asterwards very persestly.    It was then in that
laiiguage,wherof 1 have spoken, that he demanded of me whence I was, what was
my birth and profellion, and by what adventure I came into the power of the Bassa
S:rAn.    \ answcrcd him that I was a poor Italian Gentleman, whofe lise had no¬
thing', remarkable enough wherewith to entertain so great a Prince; and that the
only char.ccof Warhadmademea slave at Argier, where the Bassa had bought
me not long aster.   1 consess 1 had somewhat ado to disguise the truth, but being
resolved that I would never be heard spoken of more, I did not tell what I Was,
soi tear is it had been known, and that it had been discovered hovv I could have
given a (iissicient great ranfora, intelligence would have been sent to Genoua ofmy
being atConstantmople.   Soliman told me then, that I had something in the air of
my tace, that ssiewed me greater than I had delivered my sels to be, and that all the
rules of physiognomy were salse, or I had not spoken sincerely unto him.    I recei-
\cd this dsscourse with a great deal of respest and modesty ; aker which he talked
tojne ofthccustoms of my country, of war, of fordsications, and when he percei¬
ved by my antwers that I was not absolutely ignorant,though in diis occasion I was

</p>




<p>an obltinate rage to persecute me, when it sees that I am resolved for the greatest
misfortunes, and that death passeth with me for a soveraign good, it withdrawcs
me from that Port, which I held to bemoft secure, to expofe me to the tempesta-
gain by apparent selicities: But it may be too ( said I surther sighing) that there is
some justice in its crueltic; the temerity which I have had to love, and to hope to
be beloved s.sthcmoft admirable person that ever will be, is not yet sussiciently
pnnissircJ; gries, despair, exile, imprisonmcnt, and certainty of death, arc not tor¬
ments proportionable enough to my crime, which being insinite,demands also an
cttrn .11 chastisement: Lctus susser then ( condnued I ) since the incomparable Ija¬
bella is not satissied, and let us accent of the lise, which isgiven us for apunisli-
mcnt, and not fora grace. It was asterthis manner. Madam, that I resolved to re¬
ceive all that fortune prepared for me, with a design no longer to oppofc my
xeason against her humors, and blindly, and without resistance, to obey this invisi-
ble power, which mocks all human prudence; which puts us into the Port upon
the point of sussring ssiipwrack ; which precipitates us from the top of happiness
Into the abjsme of misery j which ovcrturnes Thrones; which dcstroyes King-
domes; which causes Kings to die; and to say all in a word, which soveraignly dit-
pofes of the whole Universe. This resolution being strongly cstablissied in my mind,
Isoundmoretranquillity inmy scls;andthoughl was alwaies insinitelysad, yet
for all that it is certain, that my melancholy was more sociable; and to speak truth,
it was in seme fort necessary that I sliould sind my sels in this estate; for Soliman sai¬
led not to send for mc the next day to talk with hira; and this second conversatio n
havingsatissicdhiinmorcthan the sirst, there past not a dayasterthat, whcreini
had not the honor to conser with him: History, War, Geography, the Mathema-
tiques. Painting, and Musick were the subjestof these entertainments: And where¬
as this Prince loves the Sciences passionately, and that the Orientall people are
notatthisdayadisted to them, he was ravissied to see that one of his Slaves was
notignorant in all these things; so that I may say with truth, that there was not a
man in all his Empire , whom he esteemed more than my sels. In the mean time I
am to let your Exccllencic understand, since you will know all my fortune, thac

V he, eas 1 . ecount mine own History, and not that of the Grand-Signior ,   1 am to
,ncak.,nely of thofe things, wherein I have some interest:   You  ssiall understand
ihen, that Zdebis, the Chies ofthis sedition,being sallen sick ,  had forsaken the
Camp, and was redred into the Capitall City of 7V&lt;«to/w, with the best Troops ot
liis Army; whereof 5o/sw^« having been advertised, he resolved to go andbesiege
him; notdcrbting but is he could get hira into his hands he ssiould easily prevail
overall the rest. This design, having been approved of, was not long before it was
executed; wc marched direstly to this City ; approches to it are made; trenches
are cast lip, batteries are raised;   and in a sew daies the avenues   to it are so well
clofed lip, as it is impoflible for any body to goe in or out.   At length, to abridge
this narration, Zellebts, being in a (hort time ieco\ered , desended himsels socoii-
ragsoudy, that aster he had sustained three assauks w ith great lofs of ours,   the be-
sieged were still in case to make sallies every day, which extreniely incommodated
om Army.  During all these passages 1 had divers times besought his Highness to
permit me to venture my lise for his lei vice, which 1 could not obtain, oecause a
Slave is not sussred to bear armes: I lived then in this fort with a great deal of vex-
.uion, tofee my scls in a (hamesull idleness atluch a time,   when as occasions were
soi^itcn presented, wherein I might have dyed Nobly.  As I wasinthis njelancho-
Ivahe Grand-Signior, being much incensed to see this Town hold out so long,
1 el' dved that his Army llioulcd perissi there, or t arry it by force; and for that essest
he caused a generall aslault to be given: And though there were a body ofthe enc-
n.ierAimy in the sield ,  he commanded nevertheless that they ssiould not careso
much tor the ruard of thcTrenches, as for the attacquing ofthe place; and the rea¬

<p>sollowed only by two thousand Janisaries, but he was quickly cleared in it, for he
had not marched sisty paces, but that he saw the rest of his souldiers come in dis¬
order, having avoided the sury of the enemy, who was pursuing them still.   5*//-
man no longer doubted then but that this was Zellebts his Array which attacqued
his Camp ; and being a Prince of a great and generous spirit, he purpofed to sight
with them : But as he was ready to march direstly to the enemy, he was much sur¬
prized to behold from the Towns side, that not only his souldiers had abandoned
the assault, but that Zellebis in the head of thofe of Chientaya, went beating them
before him in a terrible diforder. As for me, who always sollowed the Prince with¬
out other arms than a light chain, which 1 wore on one of my legs, I assurcdly be¬
lieved that he was loft, as indeed without almoft a supernaturall assistancc it is cer»
tain that he could not have cscaped: He was clofed up in the midst ofhis ene¬
mies, his Army was dispersed, sear had seized upon his Troops, and is an advanta¬
gious plot of ground had not been met withall to put part of his Forces,  and his
Person in sasety, this mischies had been v/ithcut remedy. But, Madam, must 1 tell
you how it was by my means, that this day, so unlucky in the beginning, had a glo¬
rious end.? Yes, Madam, I must tell it you, and since my valor was but an etsest of
my despair, and that you were the cause thereof, it is just to let you understand
how it was by you that I saved both thelise, and the glory of great Soliman.   Re¬
member then, is you please, this verity in the process of this Narration, to the end
I may not be accused of vanity in delivering things which I had not executed
without you: I ssiall tell you then. Madam, that in this universall diforder I
conserved so much judgement to observe, that on the lest hand of that quar¬
ter where we were, there was a place which Nature had so well fortisied, as with
very little desence it was impofsiblc to be forced; I advanced then boldly to ssic
Grand Signior,andmaugre thcprcssllethim see what I had already noted, and
caused him to perceive,that in attending the rallying ofhis troops he might be there
not only in assurance, but in an estate to keep thofe ofthe town from joyning with
them that were without.This advice having satissied him, he comraanded to go and
seiz on that plot;but as is the enemy had been acquainted with this design he advan¬
ced to dispute it with us. There it was. Madam, that I ceased to be slave for to be a
soldier,for having taken a scimitar which I sound amongst the dead bodies,I got in¬
to the head of our troops, with so much resolution ,&amp; so much good fortunc,as I did
things there which I dare not relate: in the cnd,Madara,I inspired our soldiers with
such valor,as reasuming courage wc repulsed the cnemy,8c seized on the place,where-
of I have already spoken to you.But when I saw Soliman in sasety,! went and cast my
sels amidst some of our forces, which were sighting still with thofe that were come
out of the City ; and perceiving that our souldiers were preparing to slic, in hope
to get to the place where 5&lt;j/&lt;w^» was, I threatned to kill them is they returned
not to the sight: This so extraordinary a discourse being seconded by some essests,
which secmed marvellous unto them, they resolved to sollow me: Behold mc then
the head of this couragious Brigade, whom I condusted so fortunately, as I made
them carry that in two hours, which a whole Army could not do in six weeks be¬
fore   At last. Madam, being resolved to perissi,or do some great matter, I so hotly
Dursued the enemies, that aster we had killed a great number of them, made tsic
rest to slie, and put sear into all the remainder, I drove them even into their town,
where being emred alone with them, certainly I performed things, which made mc
olainly see, that despair is more powcrsuller than vafor ; but whatsoever I couJd
Eave done, doubtless I ssiould have sallen there is I had not called to niinde, that
the breach being abandoned, I might through that place ""^^ °"^^°^i"/^
thither I made then with extreme speed, and sinding none on the R.^rapar s but dil
armed people, who were there assembled to see the success of die busin=^, I cahly

jlmiild not ha/zard a Battell, for that the Town was loft, sothat they retired; and

<p>t^ge ^"hich the obscurity of the night gave them to come and beat up some of our
Qaarters.    Aster this he made a sign for every one to withdraw; I would have o-
byed like therest, but he let me know that this Commandment extended not to
r :, and that he dehred I ssiould stay with him.  It was then, Madam, that Soliman
s). rni&lt; untedmyinsensibility,by forcing me to begin to serve him with amity, and
iiot v^ith ahmpleacknowledgeraent, as I had done before; and indeed to speak
truth, one must have renounced all reason not to have been moved with so much
generoiity.   He intreated me not as his Slave; he spake not to me as to his inseri-
cur ; he care [sed me not as his equall, but as is I had been an hundred degrees
ihove h'ni, both in my birth, in my merit, and in my valour: And to testisie unto
i.ie that thiod'scourse was not a slattery wherewith he meant to recorapcnce me, he
sware to me that it would be long of me is I did not reign in his Empire as abso-
b'.tcly as he himsels, and conjured rae to surnisli him with the means for it, because
without me he sliould be constrained to be ingratesull, fortune being so much his
enemy, £.s he could not do goiid to the only man he loved, is I were not willing
to it   lib.    At last, Madam, aster an hundred of the moft conjuring protestations
ih'uc.nbe imagined, and asterhehad prayed mc above an hundred times not to
think ill of him for the propofition he was going to make me , he undertook to
periwademeto quit my Religion for to imbrace his, because, said he, without
that he r-iust be ingratesull, 1 must be a slave, and he must likewise be the moft un-
happy.;t men, there not being a more cruell adventure (^continued he} for a ge¬
nerous Prince, than not to be able to recompence a gallant astion, and tobecon-
straineuto leave a person in servitudc whom he loves, and whom he estceras so
much, as to divide his Empire with him.    Aster that this Prince had said all that
generofity and assestion could make one to say in a like encounter, I besought him
not to asslist himsels unjustly,since I was going to give him the means to recorapcnce
nie,not only for the services I had rendred hira,but for all thofe which I ssiould ren¬
der him in time to come. Hereupon such a joy appeared inhis sace,as sully assured
mc that he had expressed the meaning ofhis heart; but it continued not long,when
as 1 humbly desired him to restore me my chains, and to leave mc to the liberty of
my Religion;that I demanded irons of him,to testisie that I would not go out ofhis
service,&amp; that I besought him not to ask any more of me a thing, which I would uot
doe for the pofsession ofthe Empire ofthe whole world, for sear i ssiould be infor-
ced to displcase and disobey him. What ! said Soliman unto me, ssiall I give chaines
to my   Deliverer ? ssiall I retain him still to be a Slave that raakes rae to reign?
ssiall I bind the hands ofhim that hath crowned rae &gt; and with a strange injustice
shall 1 make him a captive that hath made me vistorious^  No, no, it ssiallnotbe
said, that I could not recorapcnce them, that have served me, but with a sliamcsusl
servitude: The demand, which thou hast made me, is worthy of thy generofity, but:
this recompence would be unworthy of Soliman. He had questionless proceeded sur¬
ther, had he not observed my countenance to change, andsearing thathe had dis-
plcised me, he began  to ask mc pardon, when as I perceived that I was wounded
in the lest arm by the blood that trickled out of the sleeve of my habit,' so that
doubting that I would sall into a swoon he called in company ;   and notwithstan¬
ding any thing I could say he would nccdes see my wound searched, which was not
sound dangerous, but which might have been so ,  had the dressing of it been any
longer leiaidcd. It is a strange thing that I did not perceive it, andisthepro-
pc tion    which Soliman made unto me,    had  not moved me so violently,
as t'. make my wound burst out a bleeding,  I believe   that I had gone away
without heeding it.   Soliman caused nicto be caried into a Tent, withso great a
care, as one would have said, that on the conservation ofmy lise depended that
of his.    I began then to beno longer regarded as a Slave, but as the savourite of
the   Emperor;   every  one  observed and caressed me,   and even he that had
bought mc, that had laid rae in irons, and had condemned rae to die, was one of the
moft caresoll ofmy health.    In the mean time Soliman entred the&gt; next day into the
Town with all the ceremonies of a Prince, that is Vanquissier ofhis rebclhoL-s lut.-

<p>X Mch avarice and vioknce had banissied from them; they threw down ssieir .rm '
and craved pardon; howbeit there were forae of them, who searing to rendcS
v.-a-cb they had taken away, made strange Propofitions: But theGrand Vssicr hr
ing wise and prudent, thought it would be better to make them hope forGrsr^"
than to make them stand indread of chastisement, for sear lest putting them in de
ipair they ssiould be carried again to some new violence. He promised them then
to (peak to the Grand Signior for thera, and to assure hira that the newsof his
death had so asslisted them, as not able to be revenged on thofe who they believed
tiadcausecl it, they would at least be revenged on the enemies ofhis Religion* This
discourso began to calm their spirits, and whereas this multitude seeras always in
luch like encounters to have but one soul, which makes thera operate, though thev
be compofed of persons of disserent thoughts, they sofsered themselves at length to
be perswaded that their crime ssiould not only be unpunissied, but also be recom-
pencedj as a mark oftheir zeal and assestion.  In the mean time the Grand Visier
dispatched away with speed to Solman to advertise hira of this diforder, and to be¬
secch his Highness is his assairs would permit it, toreturn unto Constantinople,for
tear some newsedidon ssiould arise there; how it was unlikely, diat the Christi¬
ans, Jewes, and such Turks as had been plundered, ssiould not complain of the out¬
rage had been done them, and that these complaints ssiould not be pursued with a
i5ew mischies : He informed him also, that the assairs of Hungary went not very
well, and that his presence was necessary for the good of thingl.  Soliman received
this unpleasing news with a great deal of gries, being serry to leave the vistory o-
ver Zellebis to another, howbeit he judged his return to be of too great importance
to be deserred; so that aster he had given the command of the Array to the Bassa
Sinan, and instrusted him with the order thathe would have him to hold, we de-
paitedfor   Constantmople with as little company aspofsibly we could, to theend
the Army might not be weakned, I say we departed. Madam, for since that fortu¬
nate day whcreinray despair was soadvantagious for rae, I was inseparablesrGm
Soliman ; I had a part in all his secrets, he told rae all his thoughts, and my advi¬
ces, and my counsells made up moft of his retolutions.   His return^ to Censtantino¬
ple produced many essests there, he gave joy to the innocent, sear to the guilticjand
hopetothe Jewes ard Christians; andtruly all these apprehensions were not ill
grounded, for he rewarded thofe that had been saithsull unto him; he severely pu¬
nissied the seditious; he caused all that had been taken from the Jew^s and Chri¬
stians to be restored to them ; he made their Chappells and their Houses to be re-
edisied; and for their goods which they had been robbed of, and could not be
sound, he paid them with his own money. Aster this , Madam, tranquillity was
more solidly cstablissied in Constant inople, than it was before ; yet did not the Em¬
peror judge it sit to return into Natelia by reason the assairs of Hungary would not
susser him to be sofar absented from it. During this intervall I had the honor to
talk every day with Soltman, and to receive so many marks of his amity, as I could
no longer resuse him mine; but whatsoever good will he bore rae Of I ™ay be
permitted to speak so) he could not forbear perswading me to be of his Religion,
whercunto I sb strongly oppofed my sels, in letting hira see the ridiculous errors
which it teacheth,as not able to raake him angry with mc, I forced him many dnics
to laugh at them. In the mean time it hapned, that one morning he sent an extra¬
ordinary express for me, and just as I entred into his chamber, a Bassa, named Ru-
stan, who hath maried a daughter of Solimans, and is a cunning and dextrous man,
entred in also with me: When I was come in,Seliman told mc,that hehad bought a
pisture of a Merchant, that was come from Tauris, which he would ssiew me, for to
know whether he had not been cozened, and whether it were true ihat he had skill
in painting: He gave mc then a case covered with Diamonds, which I opened
with so great a transport, as is Solman had had a quiet spirit he had perceived ir;
for. Madam, is one may say, without blasphemy, that there is any thing in the
world which doth rcscmbleyou, k is certainly this pourtrait;  and whereas the
pisture which you gave me was taken from mc, I believed at sirst that it was it.

<p>cannot live without pofsetsing h ;r. Iconsess that this discourse surprized me,
forthough it might have been said in a ■allanrry, yet 1 certainly knew by the man¬
ner of Solimans (peaking that he had his heart touched. He would have me ac¬
cord with him, that the Physiogminy ot this pedon vvasspintuall; that it had a
certain ai r of i^o.vs//»«&lt;« the Sultana Queen, vvhom he had somuch loved, and tor
vvhom he had still so much respest : 1 know well, said Soliman unto me, how it js
incciiiprelKiilible, thathe whichhath the sairest women ofthe World in his power,
ssiouldh.comeinamourcd, itinaybcof the imaginadon of a Painter, and that a
mixture of colowrs, which cannot raake but a dumb image, ssipuld sprce me to for¬
get all the mod persest and the moft charming that I have seen, yea, and Roxelana
too, whom I love more than my lise. 1 know well enough besides, continued he,
that this person may be sair, and not be very amiable ; that ssie may have desests in
her minde and in her humour, which her pisture doth npt ssicw rae; that this
sweetness vvhich is in her eyes, is not peradventure in her heart; that this majesty
vvhich appears in her sace, doth cover it maybe a wicked and base soul; and to
say all, diat ssie is quite contrary to that I believe her to be: But in the end I am
compelled to this inclination by a supcrior power, vvhich will not permit me to
vviihstand my sels: It is not because 1 know not well enough what is reason, but
it is becaute in this incounter 1 cannot sollow it: He prayed rae that I vvould
counsell him, soasit vvere according to his desire. I knew well by this discourse
that this passion was too violent to bc oppofed, sb as J only said to him, that the
sirst thing vvhich his Highness ought to do was to inform himsels vvlicre the Mer¬
chant had met vvith this sair objest of his love, to the end he might be assured
the Painter had dealt saithsully. He told me then, how that man had already ae-
qiiainted hira that this person wasnaraed Selixana; that ssie was the daughter of
I he Governor of Mai^anderon ; that slic lived widi Axiamira , eldest daughter tp
r.ie/'w.;,, Sophy of Persia, who k was thought was in love with her, but the re¬
port was, that Sehxana, by reason of some secret inclination, or for spme reason
that was not known, did not receive the assestion ps that Prince savourablywliere-
fore this being so, he resolved to send Bustan ip disguise for to see her, to ofser her
all die magnisicences of the Seraglio ; or is ssie would not receive them willingly
to bring her away by force, which would not be hard to dp, because he had le?rnt
by another, that the Princess Axtamira, with whom ssic lived, went almoft every
yecT ioMa^^anderon, which is situated on the bank ofthe Cajsian Sea. I saw very
well aster this discourse, that being generous I wa, not to disguise my opipion in
so important an occasion; Uook then the liberty to say unto Soliman in t^ie gentlest

<p>execute that which he had said, provided he would give him a Vessell well surnisli
ed with all things necessary ; thathe would cause all his souldiers to be atdred
Jike Slaves, to the end they might be the less mistrusted; that as for him, he would
alio atrirehimsels like a Merchant, and lade his Vessell withall that was moft rare
atConstantmople of the commodities of sw^'/js, and moft proper to touch the in¬
clination of women ; that aster this he besought his Highness not to command
him to say more, and to be contented with the Oath that he made him toreturn
him his head at his seet, is he did not bring Selixma. This promise did so sooth
the passion of the Emperor, as not able to keep hiraiels srora sollov;ing it, he had
the goodness to ask my pardon is he did not submit his sense to mine, telling me
how I had at least this advantage, that he consessed I had reason, and that he would
remember how his glory was dear unto me, since I had been so generous, as not to
sear to oftend him in oppofing my sels to ihe injustice of his design; that in the
mean time we ssiould deal in such fort as Roxelana might have no notice of it. In
the end. Madam, Rustan had the equipage he required for this goodly conqucst,and
1 had more civilities than I dcserved. Howbeit 5o/;»/^« was constrained a little as¬
ter the departure of Rustan to interrupt his amorous thoughts, for to think ofthe
assairs of Natolia, ij^hich since his return to ConstantinopievJere very much changed-
for as soon as Zellebis had been advertised by his Spies, that the Emperor was de¬
parted, he took as much care to joyn with his enemy, as he had used before to a-
voidhim : And ysihereasSinan had order to give battell, when occasion ssiould
serve-for it, the two Armies were not long before they incountred together. Is one
ssiould alwayes judge of the event of the sight by the number of the Souldiers, it
is certain th"t the Bassa would have vanquissicd Zellebts, who had a great many
sewer than he, but he was so unfortunate, and according to some, of so sittle under¬
standing, that he let the enemies Army take all the advantages of the sield, whe¬
ther it were for the situation, or the wind, which drave all the dust and the snioke
in the saces of ours, whereby they we're extremely incommodated.  It hapned also
that when the Battell began, the Sun was covered with clouds, so that the Bassa Si¬
nan not having observed on which side it wzz..   cr not having fore-seen that it
might break forth,he placed his souldiers with their eys just against it,who soon as¬
ter perceived that this light which blinded them, kept them oftentimes srora being
able either to strike their enemies, or to avoid their blows. At last5Madam,the Sun
cleared the deseat of the Bassa, and the triumph of Zellebts, and the Emperors Ar¬
my,was so routed, as in above eight day? aster a thonsand souldiers were not sound
together.    This news very much asslisted Soliman, and whereas I was the only con¬
sident of his pleasure, and of his gries, I received order to come unto hira ; but 1
was scarcely entred into his Cabinet, when as he sell to asking of me, whether 1
would have him dislionoured ? Whether I had resolved to let that be loft which
I had gotten ? Whether I had taken the Capitall Town of Natolia to serve for a
retreat to a coward, which had blemissied the glory ofhis Arms":" For at length,
saidhe unto me , the Bassa .&lt;&gt;/!^4» is retired thither, aster he hath loft a battell, and
aster lie hath kt mine enemy take the Arms of the Empire : Now judge, Ibrahim,
condnued he, what I am to attend from thee; thy vaJor hath once already csta¬
blissied ray glory, it is again by thee that I must hold it; from thy hand it is that
I will have the head of Zellebts, and from thy arm that I look for vistory: Oppofe
thy sels no longer then against my will; nor can I ever resolve that thou ssiouldst
quit me • 1 love thee too well, or to say better, I love my scls too well to give thee
liberty to go out ofmy State.    Resolve then for that vvhich I have so often deman¬
ded of thee, and which I dare not almoft express more clearly imto thee, for kar
of grieving thee; at length Ibrahim, take a Turbant and a Scimitar, and aster
that  I make thee 'the chies of my Empire, mine enemies are subdued, and Soliman
is contented.  It is certain, that the mdnncr wherewith this discourse was pronoun¬
ced somewhat moved my minde, but it is true nevertheless that it never sliaked my
soul; I besoughtthcEmperornottP hearken so much to the assestion he bore
me, but that he wo isld also hearken unto reason; thatthe hist blinded his judge-

bicst that when 1 was loaden with chains I had the good fortune to vanquissi thine
enemies; do thou judge then by what I have done, of thatwhich I will do in this
tiecalion, wh-iias so many tcstimonies of assestion render me indebted to thy Great-
n.ss, and that being no longer settered with irons, I may make use of all my ad-
diei";, and of all my force: Let aScymitar then, ray Lord, be only given rae, and
Jet Bic be placed in the formoft rank tjs thine Array; and to oblige thy Highness
from requiring that only thing of me which I can resuse rhee, do but consider seri¬
ously, and consult with thy moft secret thoughts, and then demand of thy sels, is
the }(&gt;i;d hap of Christendom had been such, as that thou wert powersully persWa-
ded (is the truth of our Religion, whether thou wouldst be capable of changing iK
tor the conquest of all the world : But it is too much importuning thy Highness
to a&lt;k a just thing of thcc with so many reasons; and it is, as ic were, to commit a
crime to raake any doubt of obtaining it. Soliman heard me with agrcat deal of
iinquietncls,and whenl had done speaking he was a pretty while without answe¬
ring me : And although the thoughts of men arc hard to be known, yet I well
observed, that chokr, reason, and amity reigned successively in his heart;   but at
length, aster he had di/putcd with himicls, he said unto rae with somewhat a more
quiet countenance. That not being able to change his mind, nor being able like-
wise to rid himsels of the assestion he bare rae, he had sound out an expedient
which I could not resuse him, unless I were resolved to incur his hatred;'and
which he would grant nie, is the 3/«p/;n, who  is the bead of their Religion,
thought he might do it without ofsending the Prophet. He propounded then unto
mc, only to take the habit of the Turks, To the end that being believed to be so  he
mi-htconkrChargcsuponmc, .and keep rae about him: And to perswade'the
people that I had changed ray Religion, he would so order k, that the Muphti
Ihuiild aslure all the world, that he had performed the ceremony of it in private in
thcMolqueot the Seraglio; that he was consident this raan loved his head too
well to reveal a secret ot so great importance ; tJiat in the mean dme I might live
a t .hi iltian under the habit of a Mussulman, and render hira the happiest Prince of
the Earth. I contes^, that I had more ado to answer to this last propofition. than
tothe. titer; howbeit 1 requested hira to remember,thatdissimulation was not to
go so tar as to the Alt.irs; that ovc and war did many times permit soch thing,
but that Religion required much sincerity ; and that in the same which I profcK
sed, there ua,.an express Comraandraent to publissi it openly. I would have prp-
cceded  biiteholerso (urmouuted the Sultan, as I was constrained to hold niv

<p>should make no surther reply unto him ; that allthe grace he could do me was to
permit me to go and consult with the Patriarch of Censtantinople, and the Religi¬
ous men of Pera, about an occasion wherein they had as much interest as I • for it
maybe, said he unto me, aster I have savoured them somuch in consideration of
thee, I may very well destroy them for the same cause , and on them revenge my
sels of thy insensibility, and ofthe anger I am in for that I cannot leave loving
thee, to the end thou mightst punissi thy sels: But go, continued he, and let mc
hear thy last resolution within two dayes: for otherwise I ssiall be able to take one
which may make thcc repent, that thou hast so ill acknowledged the assestion that
I siiil bear thee, maugre thy obduratencss.    When he had given over speaking, I
withdrew with a profound respest, and considering with my sels what I had to do,
it scemed just unto mc not to rely upon mine own proper sense in a matter of so
great importance.    Thofe menaces of 5'o/wm?; would not have ssiaken me, had
they been addrest to noi.e save my sels,  but the sear of involving so greata number
of innocents in a mischies, which ought not to have regarded any but me, made
me resolve to have recoursc unto the reason of c thers, mine not being sree enough,
nor sussiciently disintcressed to operate justly in  this incounter.   The aversion
which I had for lise, being absent from you, helped to perswade me too, that my
Religion permitted not that which was desired of me. I assembled then the Patri¬
arch of the Greek Church, and his principall Calviers , for the Latin is not yet
establissied in Constantinople ; and whereas I had seen them oftentimes aster I was
there, I propounded the matter unto them, with all the circumstances which I bc-
1-ieved was necessary to tell them, to the end they might thel)ctter undcrstand the
importance of the assair: I let thera know the extrenie assestion which Solman
bare me; the menaces he used against thera in consideration of me ; the promises
I had received from him is I did that which he desired ; at last I expofed the mat¬
ter sincerely unto them just as it had past, and without disguising ray sense I gave
them to understand, that provided they might bc in sasety, I ssiould bc glad they
would sind that I could not satissie Solimanhutviith the lofs ofmy lise. They be¬
gan a dispute then, which lasted a good while; they would nottrustto their me¬
mories, but would look over their books, and not judge turaultuously ofthe assair.
The opinions wercdivided for an hour and more, anJeitherside seemed to have
very strong reasons to maintain their party; but in the end the Patriarch told them,
that as amongst us we daily see religious men sent soa-th in the habit of Merchants,
or Gavaliers,forthe converdng ofsouls,so the same disguiseraent raightbe permit¬
ted to one, provided it were for the same cause, and that the sole interest of Chri¬
stendom carried me to this deceit, which certainly would bring me to happiness
in heaven, and to glory on earth, is Icould resolve to execute it generously; that
the power which I had over the spirit of Soliman, might peradventure be so great,
as to make him doubt of his Religion; that it may^be his convcrlion raightbe
reserved for inc; and that is this ssiould happen, it would render the greatest ser¬
vice to Christendom that ever was rendred unto it ; that thereon peradventure
depended the sasety of an hundred thousand persons; and that in conclusion his
advice was, that I could not sail in this occasion.   This opinion being become ge¬
ncrall amongst them, they conjured mc to submit my sense to theirs, in Satissying
Sol,man,and that they would ingage their conscknces to me, that mine ssiould be
discharged of allsault in this incounter, so as I let not ray sels be blinded with
srcarness, and that the protestion of Christendom were the only motive that car¬
ried me to this disguiseraent.  I did what I could to oblige them to change their
advicc • I made an hundred objestions, and an hundred demands to them ; 1 told
them, diatalthoughlssiouldnotbeararmsagainstChristendoni, as I was sully re¬
solved not to do, yet I ssiould not alwayes forbear hurting it, is I icrvcd   n oth r
occaiiuns, because I ssiould still be augmenting the Turkissi Empire. But they toM
Bie, so as I carried the war to the Persians, it would amuso Solman "nprohtably o

of thy Arms.   Is thy goodness doth not resuse me this which I beg of thee on my
knees, dispofe of me as thou pkasest, I am resolved to sollow thy direstions ex¬
astly, and to obey thee in all things.    S.oliman was so contented with the obtaining
of that which he desired, as he swore unto me above an hundred times, that the
three things which 1 had demanded, ssiould be inviolably observed. But not to lofe
time, laid he unto me, 1 will have thy change publissiecl presently, to theend the
people may not bc surprised with it; in the mean space I will go and give order
for the Muphti to come to rae, and will command him to repair to thee eight
dayes one aster another, to make the world think thathe instrusts thee, and pre¬
pares thee for this Ceremony, which ssiall oblige thee to keep thy chamber the
whilst, the better to make it be believed that it will be performed.   At length. Ma¬
dam, not to prolong this discourse with vain repetitions, the business was done as
it had been propounded, and this dumb ssiew was so well carried, as no body bc-
3eevcd it butto he so. As Icng as I kept the house I was visited by the chiesest of
the Empire, who judged rightly, that the assestion of Solman having no other ob¬
stacle to hinder hi.n from imploying me, would without doubt bring me into an
estate able to serve them, as indeed it was not long before I perceived that their
conjestures were true; for the second day aster ssiis impofture, I sound, that 1 had
an house, a magnisicent train, rich clothesj and to conclude an equipage propor-
tionabk to the iraployment which 5&lt;&gt;//»j^«gave rae, by making me Gencrall of
the Army in the place of the Bassa Stnan : And to testisie his amity the better unto
rae, he gave rae wherewith to render secretly to the Patriarch of ConHamimpU, and

ready to march, when 1 had satissied the civilities of the Ceremony, so that at
such time a§ I went sirst to salute himinaTurkisli habit, I sound that that, which
J believed sliotlld haveb*cn one of my ordinary visits, was a sarewell for rae to go
and command-the Army of Natolia.  I will not tell you , Madam, the joy which
this Prince ssiewed in this occasion, it wasso great, as my tongUc hath notancx-
prestion powersull enough to paint it forth unto you; but in the end to let you
see in whaicstate 1 was with him, I have but to tell you, that aster hehad sully in¬
strusted mc about the assairs of Natolia, and that he had commanded me to take
upon me the Condust of his Army, he told mc,thattodonic justicc, and to pu¬
nissi the Bassa Sinan borh for the cruelty he had before times used towards nie, and
forthecowaidische had ssiewed, his pleasure was, that yeelding mehis place, he
ssiould withall take that in my service which 1 had held in his, naraely. Madam,
that he ssiould be ray slave as I had been his. I must consess here, that without play¬
ing the generpso this propofition grieved me very much, and notwithstanding asl
the respest I had to Soliman,as soon as he acquainted me with his intention I cast
niy selt at his seet, humbly to besecch him not to coraraand rae the doingofso ex¬
traordinary a thing, nor to require, that a man who had been my Master, ssiould
be reduced to misery and insamy; that for my part, Icould never resolvc to put
hini in tbains that had commanded me, and who, it may be, was more infortu¬
nate than saulty: I .-represented then unto him that the sate of war doth often¬
times mock at humane prudence; that force and number do not alwayes sussice to
have the better; andlastly, that vistory doth not always attend upon valor and
justice. Aster all these reasons, which peradventure had not been potent enough to
move him, 1 begged the liberty and fortune of this man fora recompence of asl
the services which 1 would render him, and besought him tobe contented with ab-
senting him from the Port, by sending him to be Governor of forae one of his
Provin^^e^.   Soliman resisted my rcquest at sirst, but asterwards consented thereunto,
upon condition that the Bassa ssiouldknow how rauch he was obliged unto mc;
then hegave me a Letter for him , whereby he was commanded to r^^mit the re¬
mainder of his Army into my hands, and straightly imbracing rae, Go,said he unto
me, my dear Ibrahim, whither thy glory calls thee, where mine requires thee, and
where vistiory attends thee: But when thou ssialt bc accumulated with honoutj
when thou (halt have re-establissiedthat of my Arms, and triumphed over mine c-
nemies, come and receive the recompence that I ssiall prepare for thee, and quietly
enjoy the sruit of thy labors. Juslmiano having observed some change in Isabellais
sace, thought it was sit for him to say, Uperceive, Madam, that this name of Ibra¬
him doth surprize and astonissi you,but your astonislimcnt will cease, when I ssiall
have told you, that in changing of habit I did not change my name, andthat ihis
which 1 bear, is the same with that of Ibrahm amongst the Turks.   It is true, an¬
swered the Princess, that I.was strangely surprized by this name, but it is true also,
that my astonissiment is not yet sinissied; for could it be pofsible that you ssiould be
that Ibrahtm of whom the relations of the Levant hath told us such wonders?
whyse vasour hath done such miracles, who hath conquered a part of Versia, gam¬
ed so many great battails, caused Soliman to bc crowned at Bagdet, and who pasktli
for so extraordinary a man, as it is not believed the Orient hath ever had the like.
Now, I pray you, hold me no longer in sofpence, but aster you have cleared that
unto me whkh I ask of you,   pursoe the sequek of your History, and acquam t me
cxastly With all that hath besallen you.    I know very well. Madam, rep yed jujti-
mam, that aster that which you have said, I ssiould, is I were modest , dis avow my
sclsbut being true and sincere I must conscss,that I am thatlbrahim whora same hath
so much slattered, as 1 cannot tell how t«know my sels by the P^^'^^sJ'^^ ™
your Excellency hath made of me by her report: Rely not then upon that which
this deceiver hath told you, and to make you the ludge thereof do but give car

<p>h^T oops, ind iiKOuraging thera to do well, (for 1 had learnt the language ofthe
Countrey persectly) I assured them, that in leading them to the sight, 1 would be
the sirst tilt would be ingaged therein ; that 1 would perform the part of the soul¬
dier, as well as of the Generall of the Army ; that I would reserve my sels no¬
thing of all the booty which (hould be gotten from the enemy, but the sole plea-
sureof having inriched thera.    Aster this discourse, they made ssiouts of joy,
which perswaded rae that I was agreeable to thera. Then carae all the Commanders
to take the Oath of Obedience to me, and to assure me that they would sollow me
to the death : That done, I marched direstly to the enemy, who was not above sis¬
teen or twenty miles srora us ; but whereas he had been advertised that the Slave
whichhadsakenC/3;VKs^M, was Generall of the Array that was comming to at-
taque him, the remembrance of what had past made him to sear that which was to
iniue, and for that reason he discamped in hast, with a purpofe to redre to a side of
Natolia, where it had been impofsiblc to have forced him   to sight.    When I per¬
ceived his design by the way his Array took, I resolved to prevent him, by causing
ray forces to raarch a whole night with all pofsible speed : The matter succcedcd so
happily, that my Army having had leisure to rest three or sour hours, began to
see  that  of Zellebts  appear ,   who being  soon  advertised   of this warlike
stratagem, entred int(9 such despair for having been surprised in this fort, as he re¬
solved to accept ofthe Battell which 1 presented unto him.    I wasgladto un¬
derstand his design, andtoinspireniy Souldiers with the same thought, I assured
them, aster I had given order for all things, that the justice of the cause we desend¬
ed was a presage of the vistory; that it w^as easier to punissi Rebels, who carried
a domestique enemy in their hearts, which reproached them with their crime,
than to vanquissi men whofe Arms were lawsul!; that they whom we were to sight
with, being resolved for it more by sear and neccssity, than by valour, it would be
but too easie for our glory to remain vistorious :   I represented also unto them ,
that the travail they had endured in gcing sofast, was not disadvantageous unto
them, it being raoft certain, thatthey which sly are wearied more than they which
purine thera; that the etidof the War depending on this battell, I was resolved
to vanquissi or to dye; andthat all the savour I demanded of them was, to sol¬
low the way which I was goingto ssiew them.    I h?d no sooner doneipeaking,
but they testisied unto rae, both by their ssiouts andby their astions, their desire
to sight; so that not sussering so noble a heat to cool, I marched on forCmoft to the
Enemy. I will not stand. Madam, to particularize this battell, since it would be
to abusc your patience, and be wanting in good manners, to cn:ertain you so long
with matters of war; it sliall sofsice then to tell you that which regards mc direst¬
ly, seeing you will have it so,although it be not without blussiing.  Wherefore I
shall only say. Madam, that at sirst the enemies received us couragiously, and thac
they repulsed us severall times with such ardour, as despair did more in them than
valour in us; butasterthatthe vistory had hung ballancing on either side, and
that^thehopcof carrying it had pofsessed each party more than once, it wa   mv
good forttine, niaugre the consusion of die sight, to know Zelleb^ by the mark,
which had been given me of hira. He wasof'a reasonable extraordinary liSs

<p>band, and the other at his saddle-bow ; he was also many times armed aster the
Persian manner, so as no way doubting but that it was he, I brake through the press
to meet him, and calling him by his name, I told him, that the same Slave, who
before had vanquissicd him in his chains, was come to make hira satissastion for
that outrage in Arms ; I spake to him in this fort, because I had understood that in
a speech to his souldiers, aster he had heard that I was Generall ofthe Arniy,hc had
told them in a jeering way, that I was still so tired with wearing of irons, as  it
Would be easie for him to overcome me: Howbeit fortune dispofed of it other-
wise, not btcause he was not a more valiant man than 1, but because I was more for¬
tunate than he.    As soon as he understood that which I have told you, he seconded
my deiign; and that we might the better enter into a particular sight we sreed our
selves, as well as we could, from thofe that invironed us, and being separated from
the rest,we began our combat. I doubt not, Madam, but you will be astonissied with
that which I am going to acquaint you with, since it is certain, that one will have
much adoe not to be ibrprized with a thing which hath no example in all Antiqui¬
ty, and which your imagination would not fore-see.   It hapned then. Madam,
that some of ours having observed this astion, and having told it to their compa¬
nions, this rumour spread it sels so suddenly amongst the two Armies, that as is
thofe two great bodies had had but one spirit, which had animated thera,they took
both of them the same resolution, and consided so in the valor of their Chiestains,
as they determined to bespestators of the vistory, which they attended from them.
They of my party said, that they would not ssiare the glory of this day with me,
and that I would carry it away well enough without their succour; and others-
muttered, that he who had known so well how to begin the war, knew also how to
sinissi it gioriously.    At length. Madam, the moft earnest to sight, separated them¬
selves to behold us; and as is there had been some inchantraent inthis adventure,
every one retired to his own Ensign, and in an instant the sield ofour combat pro¬
ved to be in the midst of two Armies in Battel! Array. This event surprised mc in
such fort, as it had like to have coft me my lise; for whereas, maugre the heat of
the sight, I had conserved somuch coldness ancl judgement, as to mark what was
done, and to be astonissied at it, going to turn about my head towards my souldiers
to '^ive thera assurance that I sought for thera, I surnissied mine enemy with such an
opportunity, as being loath to lofe that advantage, he struck me so great a blow
with his Scymitar upon my Turbant, as I was almoft bcrek of my senses, and is by
good hap it had not turned in his hand, I had certainly been loft : Hereupon arofe
cries from both parties, which amidst their consusion testisied their thoughts unto
us; and whereas mine had observed, that I had received this blow by looking at
them, they would have advanced, which I perceiving by the enemies countenance,
I separated my sels some dozen or sourteen pacesfrom Zellebis to charge them not
to stir, and to consirm them in that design I returned to Zellebts with such courage,
as they were perswaded it would not be easie for him to surmoiint rae.  Howbeit
we disputed this vistory a long tirae,and verily this man combated with such heart,
as g.ive mc a great desire to save him; so that his horse having thrown him to the
eroimd upon a blow that I unwittingly gave him, I told him that is he would ren¬
der himsels I would promise to get his pardon of Soliman; but being got up again
with fory, and having answered me, thathe would have the vistory, c)r die, I
^vo^ld not combat him with advantage, so that being alighted from my horse wc
beean a new sight, which was more infortunate for him than the former: For seel-
ling my scS hurt in the lest arm, the desire which I had to vanquisli redoubled m
such manner, as in a litde tirae his death put sear into his Array,and joy into mine.
Some of his soeing him sall would have advanced to revenge his loL^, or to reco¬
ver his body, but they were so rudly repulsed, as they were constrained to change
Ihat design ^nto that of breaking and slying :   I then comraanded ray men to cry

cv s Tkn the head of Zellebt/to Soliman, who doubtks. was not so glad .it the
clca'4'of Ills encray for the interest he had in it, as he was because he believed that
this astion was glorious to me: And whereas he had an extreme deiire totee me,
1 had order to return unto Constant mople as soon as Natolia ssiould be peaceable, and
that 1 had secured all the revolted places. I was not long before I was in an estate
to obey him, for whereas Zellebts was the onely man that remained ot the tVace ot
Chaz.-hasen, so considerable with the Calenders, and the Deruis, there was no one
sound amongst them vvhom therest vvould obey ; the equality of their birth and
condition was the cause that never a one in particular vvould indure that another
ssiould command, and this dissension put them into such diforder, as they were
more revolted amongst themselves, than against their Soveraign. I profited by the
advertisemcnt I received hereof, for Soliman havingient me an absolute power to
pardon, or to punissi, I commanded them to yecld, promising to make their peace
with the Grand Signior, but threatning that is they did not accept of the pardon
which 1 ofsered them, to extirpate them utterly , and to cause all the Deru/s, and
all the Calenders to bc banissied from out of the whole extent of the Turkissi Em¬
pire. This was done in a conjunsture so savourable, that they all with one voyce
resolved to render themselves; there was not a Town which did not open their
Gates, receive a Governor from my hand, and a Garrison strong enough to keep
them from rebelling another tirae; and for raore surety, I caused allthe Deruis and
Calenders to be disarmed, representing unto thcni, that the profession of men of
Religiondidnot permit them to have Arms; and that their crime could not re¬
ceive a lighter punissimcnt, than to be contented that the raeans of their suture of-«
sending ssiould be taken from thera. At length. Madam, aster I had set an order to
all things, I returned to Censtantinople, where for a recorapcnce of that little I had
done, iS'o//w4« raadc rae Bassa, and Grand Visier, which is the prime Charge of
that Empire; for it had so sallen out, that he vvho pofsessed it died in my absencc.
I did all that I could to resuse this honor, but in the end I was constrained to
acceptofit, both by the Commandment of the Grand Signior, and by the coun¬
sell of the Religious men of Pera, and of the Patriarch ofthe Greek Church,
whom I still acqu.inted with allthat besell me, by a Priest disguised like a slave,
which alwayes attended on mc, alleging this reason to me for it, that the more
power I had, the more utile I ssiould be for Christendom. Behold mc then the sirst
person of the Empire next to Soliman, but with an Authority so absolute, as never
was there Subjest seen so independent from his Soveraign. I was some time in-

<p>to give him an accompt of his voyage, he learned, that the business had past in an¬
other manner; for Rustan had been so dextrous, and so happy in his enterprize as
he had forcibly carried away the person whom the pisture which Solman had'gi-
ven him represented: But, Madam, this person was not Ss//'Ar/r»4, and this adven¬
ture is so deplorable, that although it be not intermingled with my fortune but
onely in regard it is the soundation as a war, which I am obliged to lelate yet
would I let you undcrstand it, seeing you will bc acquainted with the whole coursc
ofmy lise, did I not sear to importune you with so long a Narration. The Prin¬
cess interrupting Justiniano, desired him not to speak to her any raore in this fort
and to tell her, n^t only all that which had besallen him, but all that which he
knew concerning thelise of Soliman; it secming unto her, that this Princess lo¬
ved him too well not to have his History joyned to his; whereupon Jujlmiano be¬
gan thus.
</p>
<p>The History ofthe Srincess Axiamira.
</p>
<p>'A S soon as .R»/?rt«, aster he had quitted his Vessell in ^/wsr^/w, and had taken
X\ another upon the River of Araxes, \vas arrived with his souldiers disguised
at Maz^anderon, which is a Town situated on the bank of the Cajpian Sea, and the
Capitrillof Hircania, at this day calledDiargument, and had cast anchor in the
Port, he understood that the Princess Axiamira had been there a pretty while, al¬
though it was rot as yet the season wherein ssic used to come thither; but forsomc
disoider which had hapned in the Sophies Court ssie had advanced her voyage.
^«^^»,secing such a wondersul! good hap for the comraenceraent ofhis cnter-
piize, thought of nothing else but to seek the means how hemight be introdu¬
ced into the Castle, for the which he began to sall in with the Merchants of the
place, and to part with some things thathe had brought thither, at a price much
below the ordinary, to the end his design might succecd the rather; as indeed
hehad not been eight dayes in the Town, but he received order to let the Prin¬
cess Axtamira see the goodliest things he had ; he obeyed this commandment
with joy, being in good hope that ss//.vrs«4 was with her: He carried her then a
great many Mirrors,little Pi&amp;ures,and curious Watche^which are the rarest things
amongst the Persians; but he was exceedingly suiprised and astonithed whcnas wai¬
ting in Axiamiraes chamber for her coming out of her Cabinet, he heard one call i
maid, that had brought him in, Selixana, who, though ssie was very sair, resembled
not a whit the pourtrait which he had:this amazement doubdess was great enough,
but it redoubled more whcnas the Princess Axiamra entred into the chamber, and
that he certainly knew ssie was thcOriginall of that satal Pisture, which hath since
caused the ssiedcling of so much blood, and so many tears. He was so strukcn with
this sight, that at sirst it gave the Princess occasion to think, that being a Merchant,
and not accustomed to converse with great persons, he was outof countenance;
howbeit at length he told her in the P^r/4« tongue, that within a little while he
ssiould have rarer things yet to ssiew her, hoping by this artisice to have the oppor¬
tunity tofee the Princess once again, the better to consirm him in the belies that
what he beheld was true. Axiamira, giving credit to his words, bought onely
a Looking-glass, and some Watches, and then ordained him not to sail in letting
her have a sight of thofe rarides he spokeof, as soon as they were come to his
hands. Rustan retired in this fort, but so sull of consusion and astonissiment, as he
was a long time before he could bcleeve that which hchadseen, and longer yet
before he could resolve upon what to do in so unexpested an event. What! sayd
he to himsels, as he told me aster his return, is it pofsible that Selixana ssiould be
turned into Aximira &gt; that the daughter ofthe Governour oiMa^anderon Ihould
bccpmc the daughter of the Sophy ofP^r/S^? or that through an extraordinary ad¬
venture a Merchant ssionld be so daring as to assure a thing to Solman, whereof he
was not well assured himsels ? Hereupon having opened the case wherein thc^n-

<p>sture was, which the Grand Si.nior had given hi.v, and also rccollestiiig his inia-

<p>so mightily, as he was ten or twelve daies hck upon it, during wuicn tune nt uia
nothing btitp-iss up and down in his mind .ill the reasons thatmight induce him,
cither to the forcible carrying away ofAx.'.:n,rra,oi-to the restraining hmi from it:
On thecne side he thought, thatthe Grand Signior having made choice of hini for
the service of his amorous paslion, he (hould be but badly received, is at his return
he only brought back for the si uit of hi.-; voyage, that Selixana resembled^ not the
pic^urcwhicli had been given him ; He seared also that Solimans hope being sru-
strated, that which he had of being Beglerbei of Syr/a would be so too ;  Wherefore
regarding the matter aster another fort, he laboured to sind anothers  satissastion
in his own. But the more he considered the design of carrying away of Axiami-
r.i l)y force, the more obstacles he sound therein; he was not powersull enough
to force the Tow n or Castle, and the retiredness wherein the women live over all
the Orient, permitted him not the means to work upon any ofthofe that were neer
the Princess for thekiborning them : But above all things, the sole apprchension
that Soliman ihould not approve ofhis design,and ssiould be ofsended to understand,
that instead of forcibly carrying away the daughter ofa simple Governour, he
ssiould have forcibly carried away that of one of the raightiest Princes of the
world, put hira into an unquietness that cannot be exprest; and I verily believe
by diat which 1 could conjesture out of his own relation , that this last sear had
absolutely mastered his soul, and carried him to return without cnterprizing sur¬
ther, had not the raisfortune of the unhappy Axiamira raade hira change his opi¬
nion, and brought her to contribute her tels to her ov;n ruin, without thinking
of it.    This excelknt Princess took so much pleasure in sissiing, and was so deligh¬
ted with this sport, as there were lew sair dayes which ssie imployed not in this
maritime chase ; and whereas all Persta was quiet, having no war either domestick
orforein, ssie went to this innocent warsare, more accompanied with sissier-meu
than souldiers, and almoft without other arms than nets and hooks.    During the
time that Rustanssicknds lasted, he observed that -/4.v/^w/m was two or three days
a sissiing, and having dextrously informed himsels   from forae Merchants who
dealt with him, that the Princess used oftentimes so to do, he understood what I
have declared, so that no longer judging this design, whichhe had believed to be
impcslible, other than a httk hazardous, and having a Vessell that was an excel¬

<p>end they ssiould not marvail 2t his departure, he to obtain permilsion for it caused
the Princess to be told, that having received advertisemcnt how a vcssell of hii
Country was within three or sour daies to beat a Port that was not above ten
miles from A'saz,anderon,he was resolved to go and wait for it there,to deal for sonic
commodities which he thot^glit he had had, but had forgot to bring along vvith
him; that at his return he vvould not sail to let her see the rarities, whereof hehad
spoken, not being able to do it sooner by reason of his sickness :  And to (hew that
he intended to return again, he sussered himsels to be unpayd by forae Merchants
that were in his debt.    He parted then in this manner, leaving the Princess very de-
lirous of his return, in regard of her inclinations to such rare things • but where¬
as he had no design to eloign himsels much, and had observed how'the Princess
used ordinarily to take that way whereby became thither, he put his vessell into
the covert of a Creek three miles from the Port, where the point ofa Rock advan¬
ced sofar into the sea^ as they that cane srora the Towns side could notsee them
which were there, before they were so near as they could not decline a sight.   It was
here where Rustan resolved to attend the Princess, being consident that ssie vvould
not be long before ssie came thither, because he knew it was the place moft proper
for her sport: In the mean time to beguile the vessels, which palling by might dis¬
cover him, he set up the Slag of Per(ia in his Main-top, and caused all his men that
appeared on the deck to change their habit; for the cunning of this raan had pro¬
vided for all things, and had not oraiited ought that could conduce to the hap¬
py success of somischievous a design. Now accordingly this deplorable Princess,
noway doubting of the treason that was intended against her, resolved the next
day aster 'Rustans departure, to recreate her sels on the sea; but to make up her mis-
fortunc, slic would not that day go a sissiing, but onely take the air, and pass away
the time more sreely with her women.   In   the mean season Rustan had made a
speech to his souldiers and Mariners, vvhom he had gained with gist.s, to encourage
them to well-doing,  is it hapned thathe ssiould command them to attacque a
vessel. He told them, that what he desired of them was the least exploit he could
expest from their valour, since it was a vessel without Ordnance, and more laden
with women than souldiers; that above all things they ssiould beware of doing
any outrage to the Ladies; but for the men, that they ssiould not spare them, k
being necessary that none ssiould cscape which might testisie ought concerning this
Astion.    Aster this he set a sentinell on the top ofthe Rock to discover when
Axiamiraes vessell should come out of the Port, for to advertise him of it.    The
impatience of this Ravissier lasted not long; for, as Ihave already declared, the
next day aster his departure, the Princess resolved to go and take the air :   no
sooner was ssie on the sea, but the sentinell advertised Bustan of it, who with all
speed sitted his ssiip, and prepared his men to do that which he had commanded
them.    Scarcely had he given order for every thing , \vhcnas the Princesses vcssell
appeared; ssie was sitting in the Stern upon Cussiions of cloth of Gold, with all
her women about her, and attired like an Amaz,cn, as her pisture represented her,
having a Dart in her righe-hand, upon which ssie leaned : As soon as ssie perceived
Rustans vessel, ssie rofe up suddainly to observe it, as is (he had forescen what was
to arrive unto her ; this sirst apprchension was quickly seconded by another more
grievous one; forjustas the Princess rofe up, .K«/&gt;?« changed the design hehad of
sollowing her,  that so hemight draw her the hirther from the Town, into that
of letting upon her immediately, so that he commanded his men to make up with
sull sails to the vcssell, and board her, expresly forbidding any Ordnance to be ssiot
ofs, for sear of lofing that which he meant to preserve, and^that the Castle too might
not thereby take up an Alarum, and come to the succour of the Princess.    This
was not so soon sayd as executed ; Axiamiraes vessell was boorded by that of Rt*-
stan, who sirst of all leaped into her, for to save the Princess from perill, and to en¬
courage his men. Which seconded him so happily,  as the resistance of Axiamrm
Guard was in vain ; the surprise and astonissiraent wherewith they wercseilcd,
served not a little to make them be so easily vanquished; for in a quarter of an hours

<p>they strove who ssiould sirst pals into their enemies vellclJ, lo much did tliey tear ct&lt;
abandon their Mittiess, chilling much rather to bc slaves with her, than to remain
sree without her. Aster this i^///?4« held it necessary to sink thePrincesses vessell ,
whkh was instantly done, but he thought it was not sit to cast the dead bodie.s into
thesca, for sear lest some of them being driven a ihoar by the waves ssiould be a
signthat the Princess had not dissered sliipwrack, as he desired it ssiould be bclee¬
ve?, in regard they would b; all sound sull of wounds.   He caused all the dead bo¬
dies then^tobe carried into his vessel, with an intention when they ssiould be
suither otS, totiirow themover-boord in sackshals silled with some heavy things,
which asterwards was accordingly executed.   When they had sunk the Princesses
vessell, he commanded his Pilot to stcc.r towards ^/&gt;^rs/;^, and to employ all his
«kill in making thither with al! the pofsible speed he could ;  he gave order also to
his souldiers to keep themselves continually ready to sight, and unto two of his
men caresully to watch for the discovcry of w hatsocver ssiould appear at sea , and
presently to advertise him of it.   Thi,sdone,hc went to the Princess, whom they

her striving, and the gries (lie was in tofee her sels so carried away, had so weak¬

out lise.    The resentment which Rustan shewed for it, and the care he took to
assist her, though it was rather the essect of his interest thanof his pitty, caused the
Princesses women to have some comfort amidst their misfortune :  They laboured
all ot them together then to make her come to her sels again; and a little aster she
assured them by a deep sigh, that ssie would soon be sensible ot all her miseries; and
?.ccordingly within a while ssic opened her eyes; but not being longer abk to make
any resistance, and seeing Rustan by her, whom ssie knew, though ssie had never be¬
held him but once before, and that he had changed his habit, ssie was constrained to
have recourte unto her tears. RisHan seeing her in this estate , sell on his knees be¬

<p>end that nonebut ssie might undcrstand what he said unto her. She made some dis¬
siculty to agree thereunto, but at length ssie was forced to obey.   He recounted to
hex chen, how her unhappiness was an essest of herbeauty; but he did not tell her
that 5o//sw^« had loved her under the name of Selixana, onely he acquainted her
that her pisture had begot this love, and consequently the design which he had exe¬
cuted; howbeit he perceived that Axiamira did not bcleeve him, so that to perswade
her the better, he ssiewed her pisture to her, which ssie presently knew, and calling
her women to her to look upon it, ssie put them in mind, how the Sophy having
caused her to be drawn one day with Selixana by an excellent Painter, whom for¬
tune had brought into their country , he had coramanded many coppies to be made
of them, which he had given to Merchants for the publissiing of her beauty all a-
broad, and that of Selixana whom he insinitely loved.   Upon this discourse Rustan
Was no longer troubled to conceive, hovi Axiamira had been taken for Selixana,
easily imagining that a Merchant, who itmay be understood not the Perst an tongnt
very well, might be deceived in taking the pisture of Selixana for that of Axiami-
YA, and that of Axiamira for that of Selixana, and much the rather, for that the Mer¬
chant had got thofe pistures without ever seeing the Princess, as we came to know
asterwards. But to return to this asslisted sair one, aster that Rustan had acquain¬
ted her with the cause of her misfortune, he would have inlarged himsels upon the
magnisicences of the Seraglio, upon the excellent qualities of Solman, upon the
excess of the passion which he was in for her, and have perswaded her that her un¬
happiness would make her happy. But this generous Princess, not able to endure a
discourse so sar distant from her sense, sayd unto him with a voice much stronger,
than the weakness wherein ssie was would seem to permit her; do you bcleeve then,
that a person which might have succcedcd to the Crown of Persia, can resolve to bc
the slave of Soliman ? to spend her lise in priscn ? and to have for her companions
insamous creatures, who are for the moft part the resofc of Pyratcs 1 No, no,Axtit-
suira came not into the world but to reign, and her death ssiall make it soon appear,
that ssie knows not how to obey : Fortune hath put mc into your hands, but mine
stiall deliver me out of them.   Aster this ssic mused a pretty while very profoundly,
Rustm not daring to answer her for sear of surther incensing her ;   then suddenly
(peaking again, and addressmg her sels to him, Can I hope,  sayd ssiee unto him,
tor any sincerity in a man thathath so cruelly betrayed ? me and can I belecve that
what he hath told mc is true ? for how can it bc imagined that Soliman, whofe re¬
putation is so great and so sair, ssiould be capable of causing an innocent Princess to
be forcibly cai ried away for to make her his slave ? and how can it yet be concei¬
ved, that this Prince, whojis sayd to be so amorousof a certain Roxelana,  and
who hath loved her so long, could be in a passion for a pisture, yea in such a passi¬
on as hath obliged him to violate the law of Nations, to forget naturall equity, to
outrage a Prince as mighty as himsels, and to do an ast so strange as it is without
example in all Ages ? Tell mc then, I conjure you, said the unto him, the true cause
of my disaster, and hide not from me that which time wiU clear unto mc but too
well.    Rustan seeing her mind a little quieter in all appearance, thought he might
gain her by gcntleness;   wherefore he assured her with all the ardsicc that pofsibly
he could use ; how all that which he had told her was true, but how it was true
also, that the image ofthe Seraglio, which seemed so dreadsul! unto her, was a nocer
essest of her gries; that all the grace he would demand of her was nooUier, but
that ssie would live untill ssie had seen 5o/;w4», which savour ishe might obtain of
her, he was well assured, that the sight of so excellent a Prince would make her
change her opinion.    Yes, said ssie, interrupting him, I will live, is n»y g"es will
permit it • but I will live only to seck out the means how to revenge the death, that
Iwill£ivc my sels, as soon as my complaints and cryes have made some one to
know ?hc outrage which Ihave received, to theend that the report thereof being
bruited abroad, the Sophy my Sather may, by learning the cause of my lofs, take

sels, which (tie perceiving said surther uato him. You may take from me iron,sire,
and poison, but not the will to die, and by it I ssiall alwayes sind means to cMecute

not in an estate to be perswaded.   Aster this he caused her to be scrred very care-
solly without ever entring into her chamber, yet did he for the moft part hear all
that ssie said to her women ; for searing lest (he ssiould ofser to get out ofthe Cab¬
bin for to go and cast her sels into the Sea, he lay alwayes at the Cabbin-door*
not daring to trust any body with the guard of a trcasure from whence he hoped
for all his fortune. I will not recount unco you the generous and pitisull discourses
of this infortunate Princess daring this voycge, since it would but augment the
regret, which you will have for her lofs; For^ Madam, aster a Navigation profpC*
rous enough; aster they had passed over albthe Caspian Sea by gayning the Coast; on
the lest hand; aster they had arrived at the River of yir&lt;s.wj, which disimbokes it
scls into this Sea; had traversed by Land thorough the Whole Countrey ofColehit'
da,novicalledMtngrelta j-^heve Rustanhttodkhiin to his former Vcslseil again&gt;
which had stayed still for him there ; had travelled Mare mayor, or Pontns EHXtuttj^
from one end to another in its length; aster that, I say, they were come to the Bis-
pherus of Thrace, in a place where they even touched the ssioar, there arofe so suri¬
ous a wind, as they were constrained to take in all their sails. And whereas the Pi¬
lot had advertised Rustan, that he forc-saw the comming of a great storm, and that
within an hour at the surthest, he thought that in regard rhcy were not sar from a
place where the Skiss might easily land, it would not bc amiss to pcrsWade tsit
Princess to go assioar, seeing they were within Solimans Dominion, and where they
needed not sear to abandon their Vessell.    He caused then one cs the Princdse*
women to be calkd untohim for to acquaint her with the perill wherewith they
were ihrcatned, that ssie might propound unto her the avoyding of it by the means
which I have related; this Maid, who out of the sear of death approved of Ru.
st ans propofition, did all that ssie could to get her Mistress to imbrace it: But this
couragious Princess said unto hervvith an admirable constancy, that ssie was re-
solved to attend the soccor of Heaven, imagining indeed, that the storm wherewith
ssie was threatned, could bring no alteration toher fortune which would notbe
advantagious to her.   Daring this contestation the Sea was moved in soch fort, as

<p>without ceasi ng in the mean time to use their tittermoft indeavour to with-stand it;
but at last they were sain to give way to this violence, and reser their lives to the
condust ot fortune. Already had the Pilot abandoned the Helm,his Compals stood
him in no stead, the Mast was all to ssiattcred, the Sayl-yards torn ofs, the Tackle
rent in picccs,thc Vessell took in water on every side, the souldiers cried out in
despair, the Mariners abandoned themselves to gries, the Princesses women were
all dissolved into tears, Rustan himsels had almoft loft his understanding, whenas
in the midst of so generall a consternation he heard the Princess cry unto him with
a quiet spirit, and with a seded and consident voyce; at length Axiamira stiall not
be a Slave, ssie ssiall dye v/ith glory, Heaven is armed for her succour, and (is I de¬
ceive not my scls) her death shall be the cause of her revenge.    Scarcely had (he
sinissied these words, v/henas an hideous wave hitting the Vessell with an unexprei-
sable impetuofity,dassied it with such vioknce against the point ofa Rock, aj
they sussered ssiipwrack in that very place.   I will not tell you. Madam, that which
Rustan himsels could not tell us, for this mlEsbrtune was so sudden, as in an inltanc
he sound, that of all his Vessell he had   nothing  lest him but a plank   which
sloated to his hand, as he was labouring in the water, and wherewith he saved hU
lise by sustaining himsels upon it; for this man was so fortunate, as without other
industry than strongly sastning hirofels.so this plank, the Sea (which according to
its custom retains nothing ofall the rapines that it makes) cast him on die (hoar,
ivhere he remained almoft in aswoontill the tempest was over, which was not long
sirst; so as it might have been said, that this Princess had served for an oblation
to pacisic the sury of the incensed waters'; for two hours aster ssie had sussred (hip-
wrack, the Sun beginning to appear, dissipated the darkness ofthe night, and the
tempcst, and restored calmncss and tranquillity to the Sea. _ Rustan, being wholly
come to himsels again, got up to the side of a Peock to see is he could discover a-
ny mark of so sad a wrack, but he could discover no other thing than forae of the
Tackle and Planks of his Vessell, which the waves had brought to Land, so that de-
spairing of any comfort he went to the ihabitaticn that was nearest to the place
where he was, and stayed these certain days to make search, is at least the body of
Axiamira might have been sound, as also to meet with some means for him to re¬
turn to Conslantinople: As for the Pcincess,all his care in vain,hc sound indeed seme
dead Souldiers and Mariners along the ssioar,but of her he never could have any ti¬
ding-;  so that the unhappy Axiamira is doubtkts without lise, and without sepul-
ture.' In the racan tirae i?«#^« thinking of his return, although he were neer to .1
place where Prince danger, the youngcst of Solimans sonnes was rcsiding,yet w^ould
he not demand any assistancc from hira, for sear he ssiould be obliged to tell him .1
thing which was to be concealed; wherefore he had recoursc to the Governor of
slmall Town that was not above sour miles from thence where he had sussred ssiip¬
wrack, who fornissiing him with all things requisite for his journey, he returned
by Land to Conslantinople with so melancholick a countenance, as at hrst sight one
might easily perceive that his enterprize had not been profperous: I was at th.it
time with his Highness, and I have not loft the remembrance of sodokl^ull a con¬

drelTing his speech tothe Princess, as is (he could have heard him, and calling to
mind her last words, which he had caused to be repeated to him more than once, he
cried out with an exceeding transport. Yes, Axiamira, thy death ssiall be the cause
of the revenge which thou desirest, and the gries which I ssiall have for it all my
lise, ssiall bc instead of an eternall punissimcnt unto rae : There needs no Arms to
invade my State ; there needs no proclaraed Enemy to sight with me, I carry one in
my bofom which ssiasl alv/ayes surmount me; repentance and forrow ssiall be in-
separably with my spirit, and the image of so unhappy, and of so beautisull a
person shall accompany me even to the grave. Soliman having been constrained
by the excess of his dilpleasure to give over speaking, I did what I could to restore
tranquillity to his soul, but his gries wasso vive andso strong, as I needed a great
dealof time to vanquilh, or to say better, to moderate it. Behold, Madam , the

<p>already to apprehend the end of his narration, and for that cause had spun ou
that ofthe Adventures of Axiamira as much as pofsibly he could,in exastly rccoun
ting her History ; and all because he was not yet well resolved whether he ssioulc
deliver the truth of things to Ijabella; in the mean time, whereas ssic was in iiiuct
impatience, and that night began to come on, ssie desired him nottolok such pre¬
cious minutes, butto profecute his discourse. I v/ould willingly have had you dis-
pence with me, answered Justiniano, for leading you once more to the wars   but
since you will be acquainted with all my fortunes, I am to let you understand' that
being absolutely determined not to wear a Turbant unprofitably for Christendom
I had no other thought but to divert the Arms of Solman from Hungary, where I
knew he had a deliga to imploy his greatest forces; the lofs of Axtamira surnissi^ed
me soon aster with means to put so just a resolution in essest : For whether it were
thatsomeof thePrincesses women were saved by a prodigious good hap, and had
acquainted Tachmas with the cause of the death of his daughter ; or that the a-
boad, oisuddeii departure of Rustan,whohad alwayes past at Maz^anderon for a
Merchant of Couslantmople, had begotten somesuspition ofthe truth, advertisenient
came that T^i^/'/^^j was levying a mighty Array: Tne* Truce which had been so
long between these two Princes, could be no obstacle to this war , for it had never
been observed exastly; and forae particulars had often committed asts of hoftility
on either part, so that according to the Maxims of State, a plausible pretext could
notbe wanting for an  Army to raarch into the Orient, as of ten as Solman had a
mind to it :   hi the mean time it happened that the Georgians having past over Eu¬
phrates, did much spoil in Cemagena, robbing all that went to, or came from Meso-
potamia, so that the Sangiacs of the Province having complained of it, and seeing
that Sohm^v-i took no order therein, they passed to Diarbech, where in all the Coun¬
trey about Birthathey did grsat havock, and rendred that with usury which the
Georgians had lent thera.    This conjunsture sceraing too savourable unto rae tobe
neglestcd, I repaired unto 5&lt;7//»?/iw, who notwithstanding the advertisemcnt hehad
received that Tachmas had put himsels into Arms, could not be drawn for all that
to think of this war ; the image of Axiamira reigned still in his heart; he could
not resolve to sight with the Sather, whofe daughter he had caused to perissi ; and
is some resentment of glory had not been still remaining in him, I think he would
rather have let Tachmas invade his Empire, than oppofe himieJs against him.    But
to ssiew unto you how hardly this Prince was drawn to make a war, which he
believed tobe unjust, I have no more to say, than that aster I had used all my ad¬
dress to remonstrate untohim, that the war of Persia was a thing nodonger in
his choice, since knowing what his Governors had done in Diarbech, and Tachmas
hajring an Army on soot, he was not to doubt, yea though he wre ignorant that he
t|Is the innocent cause of Axiamiraes death, but that he would sall upon him; that
aster I had told him how it was alwayes advantagious for great Princes to begin
the War; that it was a mark of love to his Subjests, not to susser the sire tobe
brouuht into their houses; andthat I had made hira also to consider, that at last
it\v()uld be better to be in an estate to ssicw grace to his Enemy, than to receive it
from him ; that in this occasion it did not concern his particular glory alone, but
that ofthe Empire; that being innocent of the misfortune of Axiamira, he was
not to sear that heaven would becontrary tohim ; andthat is this death was tobe
lamented, it would sussice to imploy his tears and sighs therein, without beholding
the blood of his Subjests ssied.    Aster all these things, I say, he made no other
answer, but Axiamira is dead for me, I must sacrisice a part ot ray State for her; and
that my Subjests may not murmure at the Conquests which I (hall susser Tachmas to
gain upon me, I will labor to obtain others  of the Christians, without obliging
thcc, as I have promised, to serve me therein. I vow unto you, Madam,   that this
discourse surprized me extremely, -not knowing which way to oppok my sesl a-
gainst a will so sully determined: And that which put me into surther despair ot
being able to execute ray design was, that the Mother and Wise of the Einperour
hated me with a serret hatred, because I had always savoured Mujtapba and ^m^ger,

Astrologcrand Mathcraatician, calkd Mule Aral,   whom the peopk accused of
Magkk, by reason of the wonders which every day he did; hoping, aster I had
won hira with gists, to make hira say unto oV/w^« whatsoever I would haVe him.
I sent then secretly mitoP.rw;«/i/«, not knowing how to meet with any other ex¬
pedient tliatcoukisaussic rae otherwise; and whereas my orders were as well exe¬
cuted as the Grand Signiors, it was not long before he was brought to me.   In the
mean spacc Iwas resolved to speak no more ofthis war to Soliman, untill such time
as that which I projested sliould utterly sail rae. As soon as Mnk Aral vsas arrived
at Constantmople, 1 talked with him in private, and aster I had ingaged him absolute¬
ly to do what I would have him, I discovcred my design unto him, which never¬
theless I covered with thegood and glory of thcEmpire^ to the end too he might
serve mc the more saithsully. But this man told me, how he held it sit that the Stars
sliould bc observed, and his books consulted with a little about this war, because it
might so happen, that without any impofture or lying he ssiould bc obliged to per¬
swade Soliman to this voyage; and howsoever, though the stars did not concur with
our intentions, yet would he be sure to keep his word with me. I parted with him
in this manncr,having sirst intreated him to make a ssiew ofthe best cSe^s ofhis Sci¬

he was to say unto him.Mule Aral sailed not in obeying me, for he had not been a

to others he revealed the raoft secret adventures of their lives; and he was sohapp])!
that of all the things which he assurcd,none raist,or at leastwis^ might receive a savo¬

<p>aster lie had made his observadons, came one evening to me with a contented look
and assured me, that his Science was salse, or I ssiould Crown Solmta, King of p,/
sta. it IS certain, Madam, that I did not believe the discourseof this man, but onelv
icemed to give credit to his words, tothe end I mightnot disoblige him, although
the success of thingsasterwards made k good The next day he went to Solman
ancl with a consident countenance told hira, that the war of Hungary would prove
u nlucky to hira ishe undertook it, but that of Persta glorious; and assured him sur¬
ther, that is he eutred sirst into the Enemies Countrey, one of his Slaves   whom
he very much loved, ssiould Crown him King of Persta.  Mule accompanied this
discourse withso many circumstances, which would be too long to repeat, as at
length Soltman, who was very scrupulous in al! things,which he believed cara'e from
above, prepared himsels for this war with as much precipitadon, as he had had
repugnancy to kbel:ore.    As soon as AIulc was gone, he sent for me, to command
me to alter all the direstions which he had given, and to cause all the Troops to be
inrolled for Persta : And whereas this Prince carried an unmcasurable assestion
to me, he had charged ^«/e not to discover any thing of that to rae which he had
said to him, desiring to make me believe how it was in consideration of me that he
with-drcw his Arms from Christendom, thereby to ingage me the more to his ser¬
vice. Whilst things were in this estate, an accident sell out which began to give
great hope of this voyage of Persta, and to consirm Soltman in the good opinion
•which he had of Mule Aral; for it hapned that one/^/^w^, Satrape of Caramama,
a man of great account with the Sophy, who had maried one of his sisters tohim,
and though ssie dyed a little aster this Mariage, yet did this aUiance render him
more considerable than before.    This man, I say, having received forae out-rage
from that Prince, aster he had served him in divers incounters with the cxpcnce of
his blood, requested of me that I would obtain some place of sasety for him with¬
in iSoZ/w^wj Dominions. I will not tell you, Madam, what this excellent man did
in this war, since it is certain, that his generous astions doc well deserve a rela¬
tion in particular; neither will I stand to recount this voyage exastly unto you;
'whereforc,that I may not abuse your patience, and make the best use of the rest of
the day, I will only tell you. Madam, that having had a Commandment to condust
the Vant-Guard with ^/4W4, Iwas so fortunate as I surprized Tauris without any
resistance, which at the sirst astonissied the Enemies, who nevertheless lest not to de¬
send themselves couragiously in all other incounters. Tachmas performed wondeis
in his own person, and so did also one Deliment; but at length fortune in two ran¬
ged battels declared her sels for us; so that as soon as Soliman was arrived in per¬
son, he had almoft no other imployracnt than to receive the Deputies of Townes
which submitted to his obedience.    A part of Astyria and Mesopetamia were subje¬
sted unto him, but in such fort, and so absolutely, that from the Mart of BaUera,
which stands at the mouth of Euphrates, entring into the Guls of Perjia, even to the
last Town, they rendred all unto hira.    The moft notable ofthis great number
were Caramida, Medinum, Orsa and Ancesa; but that which Sofiman rejoyced mofi:
at, was the redustion of Bagdet, where he was Crowned King of Persia by the hands
of the Caliph, who to do me honor, and to testisie that I had contributed some¬
what to the happy success ofthis war, would needs have me serve in the Ceremony,
and help him to set the Crown on the head of Solman; so that by this circumstance
nothing was more to be added to Mule Arals Predistions, who at our return was
recompcnced sussiciently.   Asterthis, his Highness bestowed some time in giving
direstions for all things before his return to Conjlantinople, where he was resolved
to be received in triumph, but a little sickness that he sell into by the way deser¬
red this publique rejoycing, which nevertheless was performed within a while as¬
ter ; and I may say that this Triumph was as happy for mc, as it was glorious for
Soliman^ seeing it was there that I came to know Dona in the habit of a Slave, who
can recount unto you. Madam, that fortunate dayes pasl^ige raore agreeably than I

(he had of ^o/zw/t;;, and y«y?.'«/&lt;2wbeing\ come to himsels again, assured her that all

tained themselves in this fort, untill that being arrived neer to the Castle, the
Count and the Marquis came to meet the Princess, who entertained them with a
great deal of respest. The Count, to acquit himsels of theCommission which
the Senate had given him, said unto her, thathe was not come only to congratu¬
late with her for the happy return of Justiniano, but also to give her thanks (For it,
as the moft important service that ever she could have rendred to the Republiqiie;
that this savour from Heaven was doubtless due to her vertue, and to the vowes
ssie had made for him, rather than to the desires of the Senate, who had rendred
themselves unworthy of it; how to testisie unto her, that the presept: had utterly
desaced the remerabrance of the past, he intreated her that ssie would honor Geuoun
with her presence, whcnas ssie had resolved upon the triumph of Justiniano y to
theend that by the pomp and magnisicence which they would bring unto it, tstcy
might at leastwise testisie their joy, although they could not testisie their acknow¬
ledgement. This discourse made Juslinianoes heart to pant, and the Princess to
change colour; for the understood vvsell enough, that the triumph he spake of, was
to be her mariage. She answered with very much modesty, that generall causes be¬
ing without doubt more savoured of Heaven, than particular interests, it was to
be certainly believed, that Juslmiano had Been restored to his Countrey for the on¬
ly glory of the Republick; and that having nevertheless encountred her parti¬
cular selicity in this generall happiness, ssie had more reason to give thanks unto
the Senate, thanto receive any from them; but, condnued ssic, interrupting luHi-

was gon from the company, demanded of the Count  whedier
it were true that he had brought the Srench liberty into Geuona^
as he had formerly told her during the time of her solitariness.
It is so true (answered the Count ) that is you knew in what
sassiion we live, you would be surprised with it; Howbeit your
amazement would cease as soon as you ssiould knoW the wit,hu-
raour, and address ofthe Srench Marquis. And seeing his pre¬
cepts arc not oppofite to pleasure, but yet conserving Vertue with a great deal of
retpest, he was not much troubled to sind out sollowers, both amongst the men and
the Ladies. But is it pofsible ( said y«/?/«/&lt;iw ) that he could vanquissi thatjelousic
which it so naturall to thofe ofour Nation ? He hath for that ( replied the Cpunt )
made use of an artisice, which he alone was able to invent: He observed within a
little time, aster I had raade hini known to all the persons of quality, every love in
Genoua, and wrought so well by his address, that in a ssiort while he was the univer¬
sall consident thereof. When as he saw himsels master of all mens secrets, he began
to perswade us all in particular to the Srench liberty ;   to call us Tyrants over our
wives; and to make us comprehend that there was extrenie injustice in prohibiting
conversation Unto Ladies, who alone could render it agreeable; That as for him, he
was resolved to ra.akc thera happy whether they would or no : and for that essest
Csaid he unto us) all they that have sisters must permit me to see and talk with them ,
to the end that having made them know, how Vertue ought npt to be untrastable^
andhow they think more harm when they are by themselves, than they Would do
is they knew us raore particularly, I may make that succecd which I have projested
for your advantage.   Besides (said he unto us) this essay cannot be dangerous • for
whercaslneverhave an assestion that lasts above a week, you need not sear'that
I ssiall make any great progress therein.    Each one in particular durst not resuse
him that which he demanded, as being his consident; so that in a ssiort time hee wa«
introduced intoall the Honks of quality,raauger the soverity of sathers, and there-

Hereupon all thofe ofhis sastion cryed it up with a great applause, and his advice
was sollowed, although there were some that did not allow of it: The women al¬
so made some dissictslty thereof; but at last the Marquis prevailed. He changed then
the whole Order ofthe company, saying it was the custome of France, that conversa-
tion ssiould be the greatest pleasure of a bal; so that he played the master ofthe Ce¬
remonies in such manner, as in placing every one, without ssiewing himsels assest-
ed therein, hee placed each one according to his inclination. Aster that it
was a good while before he would susser the Violins to play, that the more com-

must be acknowledged (said the Princess) that this is a rare man, and descrves that

the Count) to call it happy for us, but it hath not been happy for him, though the
end was to him glorious. I belecve (said Jusliniano interrupting hira ) that her ex¬
cellency would be well contented to undcrstand his fortune. And I ( replied the
Count) to obey her, is I did not sear that the Marquis will not give me leasure for
it, but will come and interrupt my recitall thereof I am much deceived (said Dorii)
ishe doe not give you all the oportunity ypu can desire; for I have well observed
that the saire Emiha hath not displeased him; and that being gone from hence, be¬
cause ssie was not well, he sollowed her caresully with his eyts, and isl mistake not,
he is gone to seek out some occasion to see her, or to premeditate some letter, or
verses to express his passion. The Count being of Pom^i opinion, yeelded to the
request which the Princess had raade himj and began to speak in these tcrmes.

<p>The History ofthe Srench Marquis.
</p>
<p>I ssiall tell you then, Madam, that the Marquis is of an illustrious House, and of»
Province inSrauce, the name whereof is not in ray remembrance; and without
particislarising any thing more ofhis lise, than the last astion which gavs him unto
us, you are to know that his vertue begot him envie , and consequently enemies ist
his country. And whereas he had alwaies lived at court, and in the warres,the late
King Srancis ssiewed him a great deal of respest and good will, although hee was
as then but very young. Hc had not been wanting then at the battell of Pavy, where
he had performed wonders in person, and so happily for his g!ory,a3 the King him¬
sels had been a witness of his valor; yet were there asterwards for asl that three
Gentlemen in his Country, whereof the one was called Marse, the second Beniers,
and the other Dtncourt, amongst whom sell out a quarrell, occasioned by the doubt
of his valor. Marse had hated the Marquis ofa long time, so as it is credible, that
being unable to sinde out any other meanes to desace his glory, hee publissied
openly, albeit neither he, nor the other two, had ever parted from their houses dii-
ring the warre, that the Marquis had sled srgm the battell of Pavy. This discourse

of thtm a dasger by his side.This new spestacle drew the eyes of everyone upon tncm,
but r,t kngtli, aster the sound of trurapets,the oaths, &amp; other ceremonies requisite m
soch like astions, they began their corabat, wherein they both ssiewed a great deal of
adrds and valour. At the sirst Marse secmtd to have some advantage ofthe odier, he
appeared more astive,niore ardent,and more vigorous; but towards the midst of die
combat it was easie to judge, that Beniers had made spare ofhis forces togiv^the o-
ther leasure to t pend his. Marse grew saint,&amp; the other so couragious,as no man had
ever seen one siaht more valiantly. They were a long dUie before dicy could hurt one
another; for it^hapned that thofe two s words,which each of them had, and that car¬
ried terror by the eyes to the heart of thofe who beheld two men armed in that man¬
ner, were notwithstanding against their intention a meanes to make the combat en¬
dure ; in regard that the lest hand sword served to ward the blowes which they gave
cne another, aswell as is each ofthcra had had a buckler.    When they perceived that
their own armes kept thera from dcstroying themselves, they cast away their swords
both at once, and salling a grapling together with a great deal of precipitation they
had recoursc to their daggers •" But Beniers being the stronger,'and the more delyver,
hath Marse down under hira, and his hand wherewith beheld his dagger being in¬
gaged under the others, Beniers seekes for nothing else but a place not desended by
his cuirace where he might kill him, &amp; already had he his arm listed up fortoftabb
hJm,whenas theKing, who would not lofe amanwhichhad ssiewed so much cou-
rage,thrtw down his warder in the midst of the sield to make them leave ofs, which
caused the people to give a great ssicut for joy, whereat Benires turning his head a-
bout gave hlarsk oportunity to disingage himsels, and in this manner the Kings au¬
thority sinissied their ccrabat. But admire. Madam, the caprichiousness of chance, by
this which I am coming to tell you : The Marqui?,about whom the quarrell was,ar-
rivcs in poftat the very same Towne, where the corabat was sought; he askes where
the King is?and whereas the people are never well informed of things,he is only told,
that he is beholding a combat, which he hath permitted unto two Gentlemen, who
had required it ofhim. This novelty touches him with curiofity; he goes without
surther inquirie,or any thought that he had any interest in this assair: he comes thi-
ther,hcc beholds the combat a while amongst the multitude,makes vowes for Marse,
whok demeanor and personagc pkased him, wissies against his own proper interest
that he may carry away the vistory, and without knowing it takes his enemies part.
But one of his sriends having perceived him, approaches to him, and in sew words

<p>shamc, despight, and sury. There is one then ( said he unto him that had acquainted
him with this bad newes) which dares accuse me of cowardise; and even the Kin
who knowes sull well whether I tied from the battell or no, in stead of punissiing thss
Impoftor, does him the grace to permit him the combat ; renders himsels judge of
it, is ready to heap glory on him , and to declare him vistor is he surmountshis e-
ncniy.No,no,I cannot susser it,and I must cast my sels disarmed as I ani,into the midst
ofthe lists; 1 must sight with them both together, or asunder, it matters not which so
as I may be revenged, or die gioriously. As he was in this resoludon theKing threw
down his warder to make the combat cease; and though the Marquis his minde was
much troubled, yet had he observed that Beniers was in a condition to be vistorious
over his enemy, at such time as the King had given that signal! of peace; which put
bim into such strange choler, as hee resolved to break through the press, to goe pre¬
sent himsels, and in person demand satissastion for the ontrage had been done
him by so black a calumnie. What ( said he to himsels, in seeking still to approach
neerer) the King takes care for the lise of a man that spoyles me in my honour! hee
hath not permitted the combat then,but out of hope that my enemy would vanquilli,
since assoon as it appeared that he had the worst, he retayned the hand ofhim that
would have stabbcd him, and saved the other from the punissiment which he was go¬
ing to receive: But it is just that he ssiould perissi by my hand; and that I ssiould
be revenged by my rels. Inthemean tirae the press was sogrcat, and the people
so thronged together for to hear what the King said to Marse and his adversary, as
the Marquis could not come neer hira, till he had told them, that their courage had
obliged him srora having either of thera acknowledged for the calumniator: and
that in persuance ofthis grace he commanded them to publissi every where,how they
knew from his mouth,that the Marquis had been one ofthe formoft in the sront ofthe
battell; that he had been one ofthe Ust which he had seen sighting about him; and
that is all the rest had done their devoir aswell as he, hc had not loft his liberty .Then
turning himsels to the principall persons of his Court, I am (laid hc) a witness of
that which I say ; and is any one dare make any doubt ofmy speech, I will raake him
seel what the displcasure of an incensed Prince is. The Marquis seeing the King
leave ofs speaking, cast himsels at his seet, and surprised in such fort, both the
Court, his enemies, and the King himsels, as it was a good while before hee could
be heard, so great was the murmure. But at length,aster the people had been com¬
manded to silence, the Marquis spake to him much asterthis manner. I know very
•well. Sir, since your Majestic is satissied ofmy courage, that I ssiould be so too; but
it is not sussicient for your glory, that they whom you savour ssiould be valiant, ssiey
ought also for the justisying of your judgement to be thought such by allthe world;
And therefore (is I may be permitted to speake so) I cannot indurc that they, who
have traduced me two hundred leagues from the battell, ssiould not by experience
undestand, that 1 know not how to recoil, either in a generall, or particular combat:
Grant me then out of justice that, which you have granted out of grace to mine cne-
mie ; your equity and your glory is concerned herein, and you cannot resuse me
the combat which 1 demand,witliout covering mc with ssiame and consusion. The
King having attentively heard him, said, that his resentracnt was noble, buthe
could not for his own glory accord hira that which he desired : That the publique
testimony which he had given of his valour, was more glorious than the death of
his enemy, who by his comniandment would bc constrained to ipublissi all his lise¬
time the contrary of that which he had reported; That ishe Ihould permit him
the combat, he ssiould seem to pofterity, that he himsels had made d&amp;ubt of his va¬
lour ; that it would be to equall him with his enemy, which by no means he would
do, neither was it just he ssiould. The Marqui.s hearing the King speak aster
this fort, wasso seised with spight and gries, as he could not answer him. Inthe
mean time the King, advising with the chiesest ofhis Court about what satissastion
hemight give the Marquis, never heeded his going away; for suddenly thrussing
himsels amongst the press, hedidso, as before he could bc sollowed hetookpolt,

whether he had not spoken that which he disavowed; and aster all,to quit th   King¬
dom for ever.    But the latter gave him not leave to execute his design; tor he died
of sickness.  As for Marse, as soon as he knew that he was returned into his coun¬
trey, hc sent hira a challenge; whereunto he answer?, that ui regard of the Kings
charee  to the contrary, he could not accept of it.    The Marquis neded with this
resusall, resolved to force hira to sight ; and watching for him a good while aster
in a Wood, that was not sar from ^4r.re/house, and whither he went oftentimes
to walk, he perceived one morning a Provoft-Marssiall, accompanied wkh two of
hissellows, who carae along thorough the Forrest; he hid himselsfor sear of dis¬
covcry, and heard that oneof them named him, and said that the King would have
him apprehended is he could besound. Thisdiscourse obliged him tofollowthem
asar ofs; buthe was much astonissied when hc saw them enter into Mar ses house :
whereupon he no longer doubted, butthat it would be impofsiblc for him ofa long
time to sind an opportunity to sight with him.   He informs himsels more particu¬
larly of the business; remains certain daies about this house, and at length learns,
that thcProvoft-MarssiallwassenttoyW&lt;tneto apprehend him ;  for the King had
been advertised both of his retreat, and of the time when he departed to return in¬
to has Country; So that oppressed with many niisfortunes,he resolved to go and pass
away certain raoncths in some other place,  hoping that in the mean time they
raight peradventure be wearied with continual! guarding of Marse. Hcwcnt then
into Provence for his more security, where one ofhis particular sriends lived, thas
was retired srora the Court. Being there, he understands that the Kings displeasurc
is pacisied, and that his encmie is dead; so that the impofsibility which he saw to be
revenged, makes hira take the resolution never toappcar again at a Court, whofe
Prince had not intreated hira very well. He passeth into Italie, as being Master of
his Astions and Estate ; and aster he had seen all that is remarkable on this side the
mountains, hestaied in theend at Genoua, where such pleasant things have arrived
untohim, as one vvould hardly belecve they were true, they were soextraordi-*
nary. You have much obliged me, said the Princess, byacquaindng me with all
these passages; but I vvould sain know, what cause Morse had so to h|ite hira? I
rather think Madara ( replyed the Count) that there was some love in the quarrel;
isl be not deceived, As^ne had sour sistcrs,and die Marquis but one; andthcy were
both neighbours together in the country, so that visidng one another very often,
according to thecustoraof France, Marse sell in love widi the Marquis his Sister
and the Marquis, who alwaies returns Love widi ufory, became enamoured of all
his sour at once. He loved the eyes of the one, the stature ofthe other, the voyce of
thethird,andthe witof thelast. And in these sour raayds, he said that he had the
moft accomplissicd Mistris in the worid. This solly lasted long ertongh to give Mar.

<p>hon, hc repairs to the Marquis, speakes tohim ot-(W&lt;tr;cj bisters,aiid demands ofhim
which of them pleaseth him moft.    Heanswcrs, that they please him all alike;
that the eldest is plump, sair-hayr'd, white-skin'd; that ssie hath agrcat dealof
sweetness in her eyes, and in her humour, butthat it is great pity ssie is no taller.
This man, who was called Alsac, beleeved that this was ssie which touched die
Marquis his heart, since he sound but this little desest in her.    But the other pro¬
ceeding on in his discourse^he thought it was the second; for (said the Marquis)
the advantagious stature ofthe next; that stately look ; that dark hair; that ovall
visage; and that noble pride, which appears in her port and all her astions.
Would render her incomparable, were her complexion somewhat dearer, and that
ssie spake a little more than ssic does.    I was deceived (said Alsac then) and it is
this same that hath vanquissicd him.    But (continued the Marquis) the mouth of
the third; her white teeth; that quaintness which ssie hath in the ayr of her sace;
that merry and joviall humour j andthat which goeth beyond all the rest, that
charming and passionate voice ,    which ssie governs with so much art, gives
her such a grace, as would make her sumiount all hearts, were it not foralittk
inequality of humour that appears in her.    Nay now I know not which of them
it i.s, said Alsac to himsels; but for the last (continued the Marquis) it must bc
acknowledged, that that sressi and vermilion hew, proceeding from her youth,
which may be named the soul of beauty; thofe sparkling eyes; that black hair;
that comely neck; that mean and well proportioned stature; thofe white hands;
and that which is moft inarvellous in the age of sisteen yeares, that nimble wk,
ivhich renders her the entertainment of a company ; which makes her talk very
agreeably of all matters ; and which puts a particular charm into every part of
her;deserves almoftthc whole heart of a worthy man, isssie did notliveinthe
Country, and had but for six moneths onely breathed the air ofthe great world:
but that originall sin which takes ofs much of her value, and the sole thought
that she isacoimtry Gentlewoman, is a soveraign preservative for a raan ofthe
Court.    Alsae was then very much perplexed; howbeit hc conceived that the ob¬
stacle which the Marquis brought to this last, was the least considerable; andthat
thereby he would conceal his passion.    But this conjesture was not for all thatso
strong, as hc   durst   settle his judgement on it ,  as on an indubitable thing.
He presses the Marquis yet in another manner, and precisely dcraands of him,
whether he be in love or no ; the Marquis, who thought hc was not to speak fori-
riously, answers, that he is, more than all the men of the wodd; the other in-
treats him to tell him with whom ; and the Marquis, who believes that this man
Ihathno hidden design, is contented to tell him , for to keep hira still in doubt,
thatk sussiceth he assureshim,how in that which he loves, all thcbcautks ofthe
body,and allthe graces of the mind,are incountred; and that a master-peeccot
Nature might be made of it, is one could see together, what he loves asunder.

<p>Than th twhichssieboreto him by the jcalousiewhichssiessiewed,^.r.e was at a
nonpkas    he perceives by his Sisters speech, thatthe Marqtus had spoken toher
Tlo^c • thatUe did not hate him; and that ssie suspe st s notwithstanding that he
hath a mind to her which sings, although according to Alsacs opinion it ssiould
beto the youngcst.   Howbeit he conceals his unquietness from his Sister, and re-
soivesto sound thera all, charging this not to speak aword to the rest of what
had past between them.    She withdraws, and the second arrives with a look and
a modesty diat made him bekeve he ssiould be much troubkd to draw anything
outof her concerning that which he desired to know.   But he was much ama¬
zed, when as at the sirst propofition which he made to her of it, ssie sreely told
hira,but with forae little preparation before hand, that ssie beleeved the Marquis
loved her eldest as a Sister; that he delighted to hear the third sing; that the wit
ofthe last did not displcase him; but as for her, ssic thought that he had given
her such tokens of his esteem of her, as he had given to none of the rest; and
that he had at sundry times spoken to her in that manner, as ssie could no longer
doubt of it.    Howbeit, that for three or sour dayes last past, ssie thought that to
spight her, or to raake her more savourable unto him, he had caused cne of her
Sisters to sing more, and had eyed the youngcst more than he used to do.   That
as for her, ssic could alwayes rule her will by his, but is he would permit her
to speak the truth, ssic must consess unto him, that ssie could be contented to mar¬
ry with a Courtier, being so strongly dis-inclined from the Country, as ssie could
hardly resolve to talk with them that came to visit her.   Her Brother promises to
doe what he can to content her, and having charged her to be secret, he dismisses
her, and sends for the third.    What ssiall I make of all this (said Marse to him¬
sels) I cannot learn yet whether the Marquis be truly in love or no, however I
am sure that I have two Sisters which are already desperately in love with him,
but it may be, continued he, that the other two will clear this enigma unto me.
Inthe mean tirae ssie whom he had sent for appears with her jocund humour;ssic
demands ofhim at the sirst dassi, whether it were to propound a Lover unto her
that he had sent for her so in secret;he answers her,that ssie was not deeeived,for in¬
deed it was to ask of her whether the assestion of the Marquis did satissie hcr&gt;
She replyes laughing, that the obligation which ssie had unto him for having
ta.ipht her so many excellent ayrs, for having taken such pains to make hersinz
wtll, and to tune her Lute to her voice, deserved that her answer ssiould be so-

oblige his Sister to oppofe his assestion.    She answers  thereunto with agrcat
deal of wit, that ssie would think her sels insinitely happy to be sacrisisedforthc
selicity of her Brother; but as for that which concerned the Marquis, ssic was to
tell him, that her lise had not yet been long enough to bc able to discern a seign¬
ed assestion from a true; that it was so little a while since one had given over
intrcating her like a Girl, that ssic durst not as yet rely on her judgment; that in¬
deed it was true, thw Marquis had taken some such particular care of her, as made
her think he did not wissi her ill; andwhercashe was the sirst wo.'"thy manthat
had spoken civilly unto her, ssic consessed sreely unto him , ssie coulcl not chuse
but be obliged tohim for it; butthat therein ssic promised to sollow his diresti¬
ons exastly.    The address ofthis maid was not such, but that her Brother percei¬
ved by the change of her countenance that the Marquis pleased her raore than (he
made ssiew of: But whereas he desired to have the liberty to think of so strangean
adventure, he sends her away, injoyns her to bc secret, and assures her that he •will
alwayes testisie that ssie is dearer to hira than his other Sisters.    When ssic was gone,
besell a walking up and down (for the Marquis knew all these things astcrwatd
by the third of these Gentlewomen, who out ofthe conformity that was betwixt
them continued still his sriend, maugre all their diforders) and having been a while
without speaking; What, said lie,the Marquis shall make my sour Sisters bc in love
with him, whilst himsels peradventure is not taken by any of them, and I ssiall be
so unhappy as not be able to touch the inclination of his one ? He will laugh in
his mind at his conquests, and ray misfortune; and whilst tothe prejudice ofmy
house he ssiall be laden with the savours of sourraaids, I ssiall get but cold civili¬
ties from her, whom I love passionately , and that alone can make up my sdicitic
But,continucd he, what counsell can I take ? Is I have recouse to violence; isl quar¬
rell with him ; is I sight with him, and will make him explain himsels by force,
for the interest of my Sisters, then I ruine my sels with her; I lofe the hope of ever
pofsessing her; and it would be an ill way for one to prove his love unto a generous
person, to kill her Brother.    It is better for me then to dissemblc a while; to ob¬
serve all his astions; to endeavour yet to discover whom the Marquis is in sovc
xvithal! ; and is at last I can learn nothing certain , then to propound unto him
the choice of my Sisters, in demanding ofhis.    Behold in what fort Marse rea-
soned with himsels .about so intricate an assair (at leastwise he hath recounted k
since in this manner.)    But as Marse was thus troubled at home, so was the Mar¬
quis in some fort with his Sister, who having another design with hers~els than
the marrying of Marse, would have him dispenscwith her for entertaining hitn
any longer, and permit her to take all hope from hira.    Howbeit the Marqtus,

soursokmaides whora I can love, isso great an inhuraanitie, in the humor wherein
I am, as is you consider it seriously you raust needs repent you ot it. But, anlwerea
his Sister laughing,  you doc not love thera,  for how can you share your leU a-
raongst so many &gt; 'Not love them ( replyed the Marquis) naughty Sister, come, you
doe not know me, is you believe as you say; for it is raoft certain that I love them
with ^11 ray soul; and that in all ray lise I never sound my scls so constant,   nor s o
amorous. And whereas this maicl could not very easily comprehend,  how a man
could love sour at once, andtearm hirasels constant: for to make her understand it,
he told her,  that by a very extraordinary adventure hehad no great assestion t or
any ofthcra in particular, but meeting in thesesour persons separately, with that,
which he would have in one alone, he was so despcratcly in love therewith ,   as he
was never in such a passion before. He told her surther,  that ordinarily when he
sound any thing that was amiable in a woraan,   he excused the desests which were
in her, and becarae in love widi all her person; but that in this incounter, through
a caprichiousness of love, he was Wounded in another fort. For, said he seriously ,
it would be impofsible for me, in the estate wherein my mind now is, to love any of
thofe maides single; and I ara never raore joysull than when I see them all sour toge¬
ther. I behold the whitness ofthe sirst; the look ofthe second;   I hear the voice of
the third; and admire the gcntleness ofthe last. In conclusion, lam so satissied with
this manner of loving, that when I could, by an unheard-of miracle, take from thofe
sour maides all that doth please me in them,   to make thereof a Ma^er-piece and a
niervaiJj such as I raay imagine, yet ssiould 1 rather chusc to love them as I doe.   For
in ssiould love but one of them , 1 ssiould be without consolation when ssie were in
chokr; whereas contrariwise 1 am never altogether unhappy :   isl have angred the
sair one, the brown one regards me savourably;   and is I am out with the serious
one, the merry one comforts me with her jocund humor;   and when it salls out,
that I am upon good tearraes with all the sour, I have such delight as cannot be ex¬
prest. One prepares a bracelet for rae,   another ties a band about my hat,   a third
gives mc powder and essences, whilst the sourth causes her .pisture to be drawn for
the love of me. In pursuancc hereof, I sing a song that is agreable to all sour, which
each ofthcra applies to their own partkular for a mark of my assestion, and which
they al!_ commend with address and joy : and that which is yet more worth than all
these things, is, that this passion is so sair and so extraordinary, as the end of it can
never be unhappy.    For when as I my sels would contribute to mine own mine , it
IS impoftible that ever I ssiould arrive to that infortunate terme , which for the moft
part hnissies all loves, I mean marriage. Is I ssiould love one ofthese maides, it may
be that utterly lofing all reason against my custom, I ssiould also mary her;   but lo-

<p>IO                      IBRAHIM, or            Part 3;
</p>
<p>sull for my diversion,and not to constrain you to marry him.    i am so m   h
sriend of liberty, that 1 cannot endure the least violence, either in niy sds orT ^
nother; and isyou resist me never so little more, I seel that I ssiall doe what vn^
would have me; but at the very same instant I ssiall take Poft to goe (eek out so
new objest for ray passion, without vvhich I am not able to live.   They vvcre"'^
Ion? tirae yet pleasantly disputing on either part concerning this matter • but a!
last the Marquis his Sister, vvho vvould not lofe so savourable an occasion to disco.
ver unto her Brother the design vvhich she had, gives him to understand, that du-
ring his absence, a Gentleman of their Neighbours, extreme rich, of great coura?s'
and of much spirit, had sallen in love vvith her; and that he being to return from
she Arn. y in a ssiort space, ssie was asraid lest some mischiesmight sall out between
him and Marse.    It is not that I have any assesti, n for him, said this Maid   but I
must consess to you, that I will never mary Ar^r.se, though I think I could resolvc
to be the others Wise.    Come, my dear Sister, answered the Marquis, doe not dis¬
guise your thoughts; say that you are in love; that your passion is violent, and
vvith these charming words you ssiall obtain of me all that you can desire- I'will
return to the Court eight dayes sooner than I vvould have done, to leave you the
liberty to use Marse as you please ; but when I goe I will leave our Mother an ab¬
solute power to mary you according to your own mind ; for I ara so glad to see
that you are not inscnsible , that I love you for it sar niore than I did.   As they
were thus talking, Marse arrives, the Marquis hides himsels against his Sisters will
gets out at a back-gate, mounts on hors-back, and rides to Marses house, vvhich
was not sar ofs, where he sinds thofe sour sai r Sisters, or to say better, his sour l\li-
stresses, all of them more joviall than ordinary, for they had every one in particu¬
lar some hope to be the Marquis his Wise, by reason of the propofition their
Brother had made to them of it.   They had alio attired themselves extraordinarily,
to give hira new wounds; for they knew Well no day past w ithout his visiting them.
The eldest had a garment on of green cloth-of-Silver, whereof the sleeves were
tyed up with carnatioii-silver'd ribbon, and her hair with the same, which did
not misbecome a person sair-complcxioned.    The second had on a night attire of
pure white silver tinsell , which gave a kind of lustre toher scriousand raodest
aspest ; the third alwayes glittering,was in a wastcoat of gridilyon sattin, set all 0-
ver with silvcr oes ; asfor the youngcst, though her garment was plainer than
therest, yet was it the gallantest ; her habit was nothing elie but silvcrd tissany,
imbroidered with slowers, lined with carnation tassata, and her head was cover¬
ed over with carnation and white seathers, which raui!: needs doe well with a young
person, whofe hair was black, complexion clear and lively, and eyes wondersully
sparkling.    All these Sisters were much amazed in themselves, at the care which
each of them had taken on one and the same day, in setting forth themselves as
much as pofsibly they could; and the Marquis wasso surprised to see them all at
once with such magnisicence and jollity, that he could not imagine what ssiould bc
the cause of it; for commonly they observed diis order amongst themselves, that
dieie was one alwayes carelesly drest, to theend that each of them in their turn
might ssicw, both assested handsomnes s, and handibnie carelesncss.   But at length
theMarquis accoasts thera, divides his comp ementsand looks, comraends them all
sour together, and without knowing what was in their thoughts, does things which
consirms them in their opinion.    He talks to them of love openly , swears that he
is in such a paslion for them, as he was never in the like before; and whereas their
minds were prepofsessed, they bcleeve that it is an address of Court to speak overtly
ofthese matters, and to leave it to her, whom one !oves,to apply it to her sels.    She
whomhebehelclbeleeved,that it was as much as to say, it is for you ; and thofe
whom hc did not behold, beleeved, that out of respest he durst not encounter their
eyes, in speaking of a thing which might make them blussi; in sine, they were all
very well contented and very well satissied.    The Marquis, who did not love to
make unprofitable vilits,demands new savours of them; hc will have a bracelet
made ofthe hair of all sour; they laugh at itatsirstj they resuse him, or to say

munisTohhowi, where he sinds him still tobe; he does what he can to make

toTxplIin hirasels, withstands it, parts from this sair company , carries away the
bracel t,and conies back to his Sister, who was very melancholick.    For it had
happened, that her Lover being returned, had surprised her talking With Marse •
and whether he had understood ofhis design, or that ssie had before acquainted hiin
with it  diey had salutcd one another very coldly, and had talked as men that took
pleasure to contradist each other.   So that, said ssie to the Marquis, aster ssie bad
recounted unco him that which had besallen, I see the matter in a case to break
forth, and suddenly to produce some mischiesj it we doe not look to it in time-
No such thing, asiswered the Marquis, for whereas I have promised nothing to
Marse, and that he too h.ith not spoken to me of his love to you, or of any pur¬
pofe he had to marry you ; I raay tell him ishe moves me about it, that I am en¬
gaged to another, and to raake that true , cause your Lover to come to me,
audi will prcmise him my consent.  I know that thereby I ssiall banissi my sels
from a place, where I have agrcat deal of pleasiire ; but since I am of neceslity to
begone away within eight dayes to the Court, I could not make a better end of
this adventure.    For ys/&lt;?rjc forbidding me his house, I stiall have a sair occasion
to write them a letter of adieu and despair: withall, continued he, I perceive that
I begin to accustorae ray scls to the savours which I receive from these Gcntlcwo-
Hicn, sothat now thchappiness which love gives me, being turned into an habit,
it is no longer hapiness tome.    The Marquis his Sister wasso astonissied to hear
him talk thus, as ssie could not forbear laughing at it : They past the evening in
thisfort, and not to lofe time, the Marquis his Sister advertised her Lover , that
the next morning he ssionld repair to her Brother to acquaint him clearly with
the intentions he had for her.    The note which ssie sent sailed not to work the
essest ssie expested from it; her Lover comes just as the Marquis is rising, speaks
to him of his passion for his Sister, ssiews that he covets his alliance, and inthe
end expresses his desires so clearly, thatthe Marquis without surther delay leads
him to his Mothers chamber, who savoured her Daughters wissies, propounds the
matter unto her, gets her to agree unto it; and whereas this Lover was absolute
Master of his Estate, and of his own will, they resolved to acconiplissi this Mariage

<p>12                     IBRAHIM, or           Part ;.
</p>
<p>within sour dayes, to the end that the Marquis, who was to return to the Court
might be at his sisters wedding. Thsog^s being in these tcrmes,   Marse arnves, who
</p>




<p>was come on purpofe to his Mistresses Mother, to discover his design unto her. A
soon as the Marquis saw him enter, he descends, he goes and imbraces him, invites
him to his sisters wedding, before he acquaints him to whom ssie is to be maryed-
seemes to believe that he is not intcressed therein; talks to him of dancing and
joy; hoping thereby, that ^^rje,  seeing the matter resolved, would not explain
himsels surther, and peradventure would alter his mind. As indeed, Marsehearlni
this discourse, and knowing that his rivall was returned, makes no doubtbutthe
Marquis spake the truth, onely he doubted,  in regard ofthe manner of the Marquis
his speech to him, whether he had observed that he assested his sister.    He was mad
that he had not declared himsels sooner, and that he was arrived so latc; and in this
unquietness, he knew not whether he ssiould goe in or no, to be thespestator of his
Rivals trytmiph; whether he ssiould quarrell with the Marquis, though he knew
not as yet that he was saulty; whether he ssiould depart away without saying any
thing unto him; or whether he ssiould trouble this wedding with some strange vi¬
olence; in sine he was so consounded, as not knowing what to doe in so unpleasing
a conjunsture, he sussered himselsto be condusted along by the Marquis, whofe
adress in this occasion was such, as without seeraing to perceive any change in his
countenance, he still continued talking to him of diversion and joy;  and that too
with imbracing and putting hira gently on towards his Mothers chamber; where¬
unto as soon as ever they were entred, the Marquis presented his brother-in-law to
yl&lt;/^rjc, who saluted him very coldly; in the mean time hehad leasure to tell hij
Mother and his sister in two words, that to keep Marse from ssiewing his hatred
and resentment ,   he was not to be lest alone  with   anybody.    Asterj'that civili¬
ties  were rendred on either part ,  the Marquis thought it was sittting that he
ssiould entertain the company; hc began then to  quarrell with his sister , for
that   ssie   was the cause of his rejoycing at a thing which was repugnant to
his mind;    but  withall he   was wcH assured,   that this   thing ssiould never
give him joy again , either for her*, or  any other ,   and thac  this compli¬
ance was no doubt the greatest mark he could render her of his love.   Marsi
hearing  this discourse, demanded ofhim,  whether   he meant   mariage by thai
which he spake ? and the Marquis without surther delay,   answered him laugsiing,
that it was of that destroycr of lovc; of that Tyrant of libertic; of that enemy of plea¬
sure ;   which moft commonly disjoynes all that Love hathutisted ;  which disco*
vers all the desests ofthe mind and humor,   to persons that believed they were al¬
together persest ;   and that which was worse than ail the rest for hira,   which ba-
nissics love, inconstancie,   and gallantry srora amongst men, to introduce into the
stead of it, jcalousie of honor, a salse constancie, and domestick cares. So that, a$ you
speak ( replyed ^4r.s€ interrupdng him ) you believe it may be that you ssiould
muchobligeoneofyour sriends, isyou ssiould   mary his Mistress to another.  Ishe
ssiould tell rae, answered the Marquis, that he would raary her, I ssiould not con-
tradist his intent, for I am so much an encmie to constraint, as I never oppofe any
thing; but otherwise isa worthy man ofmy sriends (hould appear to me extremely
anwrous, I doe not think I ssiould doc hira any great wrong ,    is I ssiould deprive
him of the meanes of marying hi^ Mistress,   in case his passion ssiould diforder him
so sar,   as to give him a desire to doeso: And in the humor that I am, the greatest
proof of assestion that I can render unto a maid, when I become inaraoured of her,
is not to marry her: yea, and I have met with forae, unto whom, the nioresavou-
rably to receive my assestion, and to testisie unto them th» respest which I bare
them, I have declared at the sirst sight, that in becoming their Servant,! had ik) de¬
sign to become their Master; and in assuring thera that I was their slave, I assured
them that I would never bc their Tyram. It may be, replyed &gt;W^r;^,   you have not
alwaies spoken so openly; that I havenot, answered theMarquis, when I believea,
that thofo whom I loved had wit enough not tofuspest that I had any such bad in-

you cond ran, have nothing in thera that cassies with reason ; nor ahomain am
Ih t they havenothing indiera but that which is bad; for I have too much love
for the Sister, and too much respest for the Brother; btit howlocver I am consi¬
dent that you will not sollow thera.    It is true, said Marse, tartly enough , that
inconstancie is not that wherewith he is to bereproched; and I know not whe¬
ther on the contrary, Vertue oppokd will not prove to be the onely crime that may
be imputed to' him.   The Marquis perceiving that the other was preparing him¬
sels to answer, and peradventure with bitterness, continued to speak of the injustice
of men in the dikerning of things.    For, said he, is the diversity of good books
renders a raan knowing ; is diversity of voyages serves him for an agreeable stu¬
dy, whkh illuminates his mind, and informs his judgment ; is the diversity of
sair arts is a knowledge that pleases; is the diversity of tongues passes for a lau¬
dable curiofity , why ssiould one think thatthe diversity of loves can produce no¬
thing diat is good ^   And why will one have the grace of novelty •, which is
the charm of nature , to be a desest in love &gt;    For my part , said Marse,
I wil! no longer oppofe this doftriiie, since an universall change cannot be but
advantagious for mc, glorious for forae, and equitable for others.     The hidden
sence ofthis speech was easily understood by all thecorapany ; but the Marquis,
who inthis occasion did not d ;iire to dive into things, alter'd the discourse, and
said unto yl/.:rje, that his Sisters must needs honour this Wedding with their pre¬
sence, and that he raust rejoycc with thera, for that they are not so neer to slavery.
The honour that you will doe them, answered Marse;, wil! surprise them , not
because your civilities hath not given them occasion to attend more from you,
but whereas this newes is unexpested, it is sit that I ssiould goe and advertise
thera of it, tothe end they raay prepare themselves to receive the grace that you
will doe thera.    The Marquis pressed him extremely to pass away the rest of the
day with them, but he would by no means stay ; He invites him also to his Sisters
Wedding, talkstD him of Bak, Lutes, Musick, and of all the entcitainnicnts u-
suall in such like Seasts: whereunto the other answered still with speeches ofa
double sence. The two Rivals quipt one another civilly, which doubtless might
have produced some unlucky adventure, had not the raerry humour ot the Mar¬
quis sweetned the conversation.    Marse took his leave of the company, with a
forced countenance, which raade them conceive that he had strange unquietness
in his mind.   He went home then with so much e^ries, as hc could not longer con-
ceaUt, and to miiiissi k in some s brt he desired to make his Sisters partakers of it.
Hesendsfor them, acquaints thera with the mariage of his Mistress, tels them that
the Marquis isunsaithsull, inconstant, a cheater, a courtier ; that cares fornothine
but to please himsels; that hath made a mockery of them ; and then recounts all
their conversation unto them.   These sour Sisters were not more amazed at this
Wedding whereunto they were invited, and the lightness of the Marquis his hu¬
mour,.

<p>mour, than to know by their Brothers discourse that they were Rivals, and equal-
ly beguiled ofthe hopes which they had conceived.    At sirst they beheld one ano¬
ther, as is they would silently  reproch each other for concealing themselves in their
designes : But the third ofthese maids, whofe mind v/as not so sensible of gries^and
that could not be long without giving seme marks of her humour,aster ssie had pau-
sed a little,began to speak,and said with atone ofthe voice of admiration,    I mnst
consess the Marquis is wondersull dextrous,   that could deceive s-bur inteiessed
maides; and though I did insinitely esteem him, continued ssie,  I did not think he
liad had so much wit, nor that he was so unv/orthy of my sriendssiip. The miiidcs
of the three others were not so moderate; and though the eldest was of a very sweet
dispofition, yet could ssie not chusebut ssiew her resentment.  The second, alwaies
haughty, nianisested hers,   by seeniing to ssiare very much in that of her brother •
but as for the youngcst, ssie was vext to the heart, for having so ill assured herlirst'
conquest; and albeit ssie had a great deal of wit,   yet ssie could not forbear ssiewin^
her choler.Howsoever the third  continued still saying, that this adventure wasa
new charm, which ssie discovered in the Marquis, and that ingaged her to esteem of
him the more. In the mean time the wedding; day arrives; 'Marse seignes himsels
sick because he would not be at it; the sisters cxcuse themselves upon their bro.
thers sickness:   Howbeit thethird makes a secret match with one of herkinswo-
meiijthat dwells not sar of, to goe and see this seast in disguise; they mask them¬
selves then very bravely, and appear in that assembly accompanied with certain
niendisguised too as they were. As soon as they were entred into the rooom, the
Marquis knew her that touched his heart still;   he   approaches to her, makes her
an hundred complements, and continues telling her, that he loves her passionately.
But ssieiwithout reproaching him, answers,  that ssie does not doubtof it, andthat
the conformity which is between thera ought to work so sair an essest.  That never¬
theless it was sit they ssiould a little better examine their thoughts,   it secming just
unto her, that two persons,   which made profession of beguiling all the world in
gallantery, ssiould not be beguiled between themselves.  Thissaid, this gcndewo-
man made the Marquis sit down by her,   whilst the rest of the company were dan¬
cing, and with a raoft pleasing relation acquainted hira with all that had past, be¬
twixt her brother,   her sisters, and her sels. Hereupon they promised much good
will one to another, esiceming too much of themselves for ever speaking together a-
gain oflove. Shecounselled theMarqnis not to come at their house ,  but since he
was to be gone to the Court the day sollowing ro senda compkment to her brother
and her si(ters,as indeeed hc did.iThe Marquis e-^ok poft the next raorning, leaving
his sister very well contented, Marse in despair, three ofhis siisers in cholerenough.
&amp; the other latissied.Ever since that,Madani,there hath alwaies been a secret hate be¬
tween these two houses, until such time as Marse made the report that caused the
cmobat, which Ihave;. recounted untoyou,8c that consequently hath so happily forus
brought theMarquis into Italy.   I consess, siid the Princess, that the history hath
much delighted inc; and that I am much obliged unto you for a?cquainting rae vvith
so gallant and extraordinary a man. As ssie was saying so,   the Marquis came into
the chamber again;   whereupon ssie began to charge him for keeping so long away
from a company,   which sound his insinitely agreable to them-But he with a re-
spestive boldness, answered ,   that knowing very well how the Count would im¬
part some part ofhis humor unto her,   he seared not to acknowledge,  that bdng
in doubt he should not alwaies well remember what ssie was, and also what he was,
he went away to expofe himselsto the lookes ofthe sair ^^milta,   to the end that
having his heart re[)lenissied vvith love,  he might have nothing but veneration for
her. Isabella could not forbear laughing though ihc blussi'd in looking on Jusltnta-
no: vvho told the Princess, that this foresight and respest ofhis, mentcd a great deal
of acknowledgment. And I too am resolved not to bc ingratesull; but I sear when
as you know mc, said ssic to the Marquis, that you will have a paslion for me quiw
contrary to that wich you seem to sear.   For in sine, whether is be constancy or ob¬
stinacy, I never change mv determination;   when cnce I have taken a resolution,

Ver Iv sail he Princess, there was never anyone so sociably inconstant; for com¬
mon y       a    so unjust as to desire that our sense ssiould lule that of others, to
approve of nothing but what pleaseth us, and to condemn all that contradists
our Tinions.   And they which are ofthis humour, hnd in therasclvcs wherewith
^o maintain their kverity.   They say , that whereas there is but one reason m all
things, there is but one way to be sollowed; that all they which csloign them¬
selves from that, doe goeastray, andthat so they maybe justly blamed     I ac¬
knowledge, Madam, replyed the Marquis, that there is but one reason, but 1 mam-
tain allo^, thatk isso dissicuk tobe known, as he who thinks he hath sound it,
is oftentimes surther from k than others, which without judging soveraignly of
any thing simply, sollow the sense wherewith Nature hath inspired them.    And
indeed to speak truth, is it be necessary for the equitable judging ofa matter, that
one ssiould bc look from all, andso indisserent as to lean equally to each side, or
to say better,not to lean to either; hov/ is it pofsible that any man ssiould be so hardy
as to make any judgment ofthe astions of others,principaIIy of that which regards
Love? But since I have been taken at Genoua for an Astrologcr, permit me to
play the cunning raan inthis encounter; I say then, Madam, that our reason is
notso absolutely loofed from sense, bat thac our temperament hath a great ssiare
in our opinions; andthat that just mixture ofthe sour humours, which renders
the spirit so clear and solid, and our health sofound, is scldom sound inany bo¬
dy.    There is alv/ayes one ofthcra that predominates over the rest, and by it we
ast according to the pleasure thereof; we ace grave, merry, chokrick, or patient;
inscnsible, or passionate.    And certainly it is not so much the rigour of a melan-
cholickmans Mistress, that raakea hira cry out, sigh every minute, ssied tears, pass
away-Bights without sleep, rave from the purpofe, talk alwayes of despair , and
appear with a langor, that seeras to be an essest of an extreme asslistion; as the
power of this predominant hunioiir, which forces hira to receive all things aster
this fort.    And to prove that which Isay, wc are but to consider, that is the same
rigour were addixstto a man ofmy humour, he would receive it in another sa¬
ssiion; the jollity and joy which proceeds from the temperament, is not easily
troubled by things without; and certainly , that which makes the melancholick
man complain in Love, would giveme occasiou to laugh; that which makes him
to sigh, would induce me to make verses of gallantery; that which makes   him
weep, would quite cure rae ofmy passion ; and isl ssiould pass nights without
skep, k would be, doubdess, to give Serenades v I ssiould not rave inconversing,
to weary others, arid make them hatcnic; I ssiould not entertain my Mistress with
my despair; nor ssiould I sill her imaginadon with sad thoughts, which putdn&lt;^
her into a bad humour, might make her to use me ill asterwards.    But contrarS

<p>ly, I would talk to her still of all the delights of them that love one another ; and
whereas Love is alwayes represented in the midst of sports,   laughters, and'plea,
sures,  I would indeavour to inspireherheart with joy, that solmight theraoi^
easily introduce love into it, to whom the painters do alwaies give a bed of slow-
ers, without ever laying him on thornes.   In sine , Madam,   sar from perswading
my passion unto her by the langor of my sace, I v\7ould ssiew her so much satissasti¬
on in my eyes,   as ssic might very well perceive that her dominion would be plea*
sing to me; and that I would not bc like thofe people newly conquered,who by their
melancholy makes one bcleeve that they arc alwaies meditating some revolt. There
arc also two kindes of Lovers, who by the humours which predominate in them
are made to doe strange things , the anxious, and the chokrick. Andssioughthe
former are not so sar eloigned from the melancholick   , but   that they have
some  conformitic together;    nor  the chokrick   from that sparkling humor,
ancsthat sire which animates me; yet are they for all that dissering in many things.
The anxious is satissied with nothing; the pofsession ofselicities, which he hath dcli¬
red, molest him; he wissies for quite contraiy things ;  he loves and hates ail at a
time; he hath a secret enemy within himsels,  that mingles bitterness with all his
pleasures; he beleeves when his Mistress ssiewes him savours,  that (he is too prodi¬
gal! ofthcra, or that ssie deceives him; in conclusion he is easily displeased; nothing
can content him; and when the person whom he loves gives him the least cause of
jealousie, it is enough for him to meditate on a murther. A man like mc , in such
a like occasion, would mock at his Mistress,  and his Rivall; a melancholick man in
France would sight very couragiously, but as for an anxious man, Steel, Iron, and
poyson, would be the least armes that he would make use of   As for the chokrick,
he would receive the rigors of hisMistress withtrajispoits of sury, sofar forth as to
ofser assronts to her, to threaten her with all things; but as she dotides, which form
the tempests, are dissolved when thunder breakes forth,  so this man of choler hath
no sooner exhaled his sire by his cries, but he goes outof hirasels,  and one onelv
look ofthe person beloved sinding yet some impression of heat in his heart,  doth
therein easily kindle that again of lovc; Sinally he is cisily angred,  and is as soon
appeased.Therearc jet of another temperament,   who are so patient, as they are
almoft inscnsible; and cold predominates so much in them,  as k it arrives that love
warmes them a litde, they are capable of enduring any thing :   For they are so pow¬
ersully surmounted by laziness,   that for sear of stiring they dare not change their
Mistress, but susser all things without complayning.   You see then, Madam,^ that
the diversity of the humours of the body cuntributes much to our appreheniions i
and that one and the same thing is seen aster a quite disserent manner.   And is we
will give credit to the Astrologers in this behals, they will tell you also,  that Sa'
turn by his insluence makes all the melancholicks ast, as I have declared; that they,
over whom Jupiter predominates, are ofmy humor;   that Mars inslames the soules
of thofe , whom he governcs, with the sire of choler ;  and that the Moon inspires
thofe,   whom   ssie   commands,   with a coldness , which makes them almoft in¬
scnsible. You will tell me it may be,   Madam , that these Starres are sofar distant
from us, as it is hard to comprehend how they exercise an absolute power upon
men; but isyou consider that which they doe in the universall world,  you will the
more easily belecve that which they doe particularly in man: for in sine the diver'
sitie ps seasons is derived from them ;  and this successive change of heat and coW,
of slowers and sruites, which arc seen every year, is sound also in our selves.  Wc
haveourscasonsaswellastheyear,  and even as age changes our temperament,
in changing our humours, we likewise change opinions.   The second age of lise)
which is the sidl for lovc, scldom sayles in producing of violent passions, whicli
are often sollowed by imprudence and indiforetion. As for the third, the passions
therein are not so lively, but withall they are better governed : One conccalcs the
pistures which he hath of his Mistress;  One no longer ssiewes the bracelets ot W'l
which ssie gives; One hath as much care of her conservation as of his pleasure ; ana
k h in thi» age alone, where gallantry, a little   reason, and a great deal of love.

arrive toone ..ndthe same person, according tothe change of his humour's, ot
his temperament, and of his ages, doth demonstrate, that albeit there is but one
reason to be sollowed, yet we doe oftentimes form many according to our tan-
cie. Wherefore 1 doe not think I ara upon a bad ground, in not amusing my
kls about to vain a search, as that ofthe true reason of all things, seeing it is
so dissicult to sind ; nor in sollowing, as I doe , that which pleaseth me, and all
thatwhich kcms amiable to rae; neither in leaving that liberty to others, which

<p>Aster theMarquis had given over speaking, and lest the company very much
satissicd with his wit, jHsliniano,v/ho v/ould not abandon reasons party, and who
desired the Princess ssiould think it was not out of caprichiousness and sancy thac
he had veneration for her, answered theMarquis in this fort. You combat rea¬
son with so much force and address, as it cannot be easily beleeved that you doe
not know her; and the same wit which you have made use of to overthrow her
dominion, nianisests sussiciently unto us that you are one of her subjests; and is
at any time you quit hcr,it is only in this passion, from whence some, who are not
acquainted with the nobkness of Lovc, would banissi her. But for al! that it is
certain, that ssie sinds a place every where ; that ssic can bc the Mistress of all men;
that ssie can subdue all the passions, and all the griess of the mind ; make thofe of
the body to bc supported without impatience; withstand our temperament, and
the insluences of the Stars ; and by her insinite force makes us vanquissi our
selves, by obliging us oftentimes to destroy our own pleasiires.
</p>
<p>To know this truth,we arc but to considcr,that the humours which predominate
in us, theconstellation ofthe Stars, and that change which time works in our
temperament, do not change anything but our inclinations, which certainly arc
caukd by all thek things: Howbeit that is not powersull enough to delude reason,
who no way depending either on the melancholy humour, or on the Stars, can al¬
so judge soveraignly of all the apprehensions wherewith ssie inspires us. She hath
a seat more trankendent than our inclinations, whkh many times are sound tobe
very low, and corrested by reason. All Andquity would fornissi us with exam¬
ples of it, and the wisest have lest us marks of owing all their vertue to their rea¬
lon, which having made thera preser the study of Philofophy before their inclina¬
tions, hath kept thera from being the raoft insamous amongst men. And truly it

<p>clinations (hould have the condust of our lives : And to make it apoear Z'
we have a destiny more noble than that same, we are but to observe thatT
Creatures, which move not but by instinst, have one like unto it and prn
rail to al! their kind. All Harts seek diBamum when they are hurt all B d
cs season sock for the Spring-time, and sly from the Winter withoilt savlins
which the Lyons doc not, nor so many Birds that doc not ssiist Country Thi?
instinst then is seen in all the creatures without ever sailing, even as the race of th
Sun, the course ofthe Rivers, and all other things which doc cot depend of them'^
selves, doe alwayes sollow the sirst order that hath been given them, and that isso ne"
necessary to them, as they cannot sail. But as for man, it is not so with him • he is
absolute Master of his thoughts, and of his astions; nothing forces him wssiine
violents him, and he is so independent from al! things, as he can even attenipt ui&gt;on
his own lise, as was often seen at such time as it was lawsul! to preser death before
servitude. It cannot be said that this astion, which destroyes Nature, is an essest
of a naturall inclination; there must be then a more powersul! reason ssian our in¬
clinations, seeing it is certain, that of all the interiour apprehensions which Nature
gives us, there is none so strong, so predominant, nor so universall, as the desire of
lise. In the mean time, since there have been men sound able to vanquish it by rea¬
son, it may bc consequently beleeved, that there arc a great number of others, who
can force their inclinations, and judge soundly of all; and who, without consider-.
ing that which pleaseth thcm,considcr only that which ought to please them. For in
conclusion, our inclinations doc not move in us so powersully as one may imagine
they doe; they having nothing common, as I have already said, with this instinst
of unrcasonable creatures, which forceth a whole kind to doe One and the same
thing, and which is instead of reason to them; since we see, that not onely all Nati¬
ons, all Provinces, but all men in particular, are so disserent one from another, that
many times there is more disserence between an Italian and an Italian, than between
the whole Nation^and that ofthe Persians and Tartarians.Our inclinations,!s wc will
know them well, are no other than a secret motion, that carries us without violence
to please our selves more with one thing than another; some love the Woods better
than the Rivers; and others the Waters better than the Forrcstg, and that raay be per¬
adventure by temperament; they leave not both of them for allthat to know, mau¬
gre their inclinations, the beauty of thofe things, and to delight in them, which
doe not touch their minds the moft sensibly. But to ssiew that it is somewhat too
weak a thing to deceive reason , we arc but to consider, that use alone forces our
inclinations. Liberty, which is so naturall to al! the World, is a good that is not
desired by all the women of Italy; custome onely makes them sind their houses large
enough for their walks; and the place of their devotions sar enough for their voy¬
ages. Judge then aster this, whether reason can susser her sels to bc vanquished
by enemies which time doth surmount. As for the passions, I consess, that they
are a little more dissicult tobe destroyed; but yet I maintain, that is reason will
oppofe them, ssie will appease them, and restore tranquility to the mind that is mod
troubled. Is reason then will ast, it is certain, that, maugre the force of tempera'
ment, the insluences of the Stars, and the ages of men, wc ssiall see the mclancho*
lick sociable; thccholcrick patient; theslothsull more astivc; a young Lover with¬
out inconstancie, and without indiscretion. I acknowledge nevertheless, that there
is a kind of passion, or to express my scls more clearly, a kind of Love, which rea¬
son cannot destroy. This impotence pxroceeds not, for all that,from her weakiiess»
but it is because ssic never destroyes that which ssie hath establissied; and because
this Lovc, whereof I speak, is rather an essest of our reason, than of our passion;
and truly, when a Lover hath, in the person whom hc loves, met with the beauty
ofthe body, ofthe mind, and ofthe sold; when as Venue is mingled with all these
charms; when as his vowes are not rejested • when as he searcs but the incon¬
stancie of Fortune, and not that of his Mistress, it is impofsiblc to say otherwise than
that reason is the Mother of a passion, that doubtless cannot diforder the mind;

assure them that they could never be troublesonie unto her, yet they retired, ana

Marquis would not abandon the Count, nor Dona, his dzar Juilimano,vjho never¬
theless could have been well contented to have been alone forthe better entertain¬
ing of his thoughts, but civility and sriendlhip kept him from it. When as they
wa e ."bed, Dsrsa, who could conceal nothing from his sriend, acquainted him, that
Horatio, of the illustrious House of Cibo, and the Count's Brothcr-in-Lavv,_ was in
love with his Sister ; and that he almoft was so too with the Count's Sister-in-Law,
although he had seen her biu twice since his return: Howbeit that he had used his
best indeavour to oppofe this passion, in regard he knew very well that this Maid
had an imperious humour, which would not be easily vanquissicd. Jusliniano an^

<p>He morn-ng bringing joy and delight again to this sair
Troop, the Princess would needes have the Count and the
Marquis bestow that whole day too upon her, and to pais k
away the more agreeably ssie led them to Monton, a little
Town, some mile from Monaco, where the Princes of her
House had built a magnisicent Paviglion, which ssie desired
to ssiew unto theMarquis. &lt;-/£milia sinding her sels better
that night, raade one also of the company, so that theMar¬
quis was in the best humour of the World. And whereas the
Princess observed that his respests werenot dis pleasing toher kinsworaan, she said
to the Marquis, for to oblige hira to talk , that whereas love ought to be without
supercherie as well as war , he having not as yet declared himselsto bc i/£miltai,
ssie might by his observance and services be induced to bekeve that he was capable
oi a solid assestioii^ and so ingage her surther than was sitting. &lt;'y^mtliahla{kti
at this discourse, and the Marquis \vithout giving her leave to speak, assured the
Princess, that he ssiould not long conceal himicls, andthatthe Count could con¬
sirm this truth unto her. Indeed, laid the Count, he hath not used to keep himsejs
from being knowen, and is hewodld take the paines to recount unto you th'e Srll
adventure that besell him at Ge&gt;ioH.t, his address would appear to the beautisull (vs*
tnilia, and the relation no doubt would give your Exccllencic much content. With¬
all it will be better walking towards the evening, than in the midst ofthe day, and
you cannot pass it away better. The Princess , who was perswaded, that the Mar¬
quis his adventures could not chuse but be very pleasant, intreated him thereunto
with a great deal of civilitie; hc excuses hirasels a while, but in theend ssie con¬
jures him to it in the name ofhis last Mistress; It is ssie indeed, answered he, that is
moft powersull in my h^art, and that makes mc to obey. The Princess condusted
them then into a Cabinet, that was open on sour sides , and whereof all the walks
were of cristall glass from the top to the bottom , that so the profpest might bethe
more sree. Aster they were set down there on seates of ebony, covered with carna¬
tion .Uld silver tinsell, the Marquis began his History in this fort.

<p>Nation; That it is I who have reconciled vertue and s,alamerie at Genoua; who
have declared ray sels the protestor ofthe liberty of you Ladies; and who in conclu¬
sion have by my care and address deserved amongst them the glorious title oftheir
Deliverer. I tell you all these things, that you may not think it strange, is in the se¬
quel ofthis discourse you understand some adventures , where the civility ofthis
hde the raountaincs is not regularly observed. I know, answered the Princess, all
that you have done forthe publique libertic; theCount hath already ac(]uainted
me, that the galanterie, which is seen now at Genoua, is an essest of yours; and thac
in the end you have been so powersul! in perswading the- vertue of women, as there
is scarce any brother or husband that is longer jealous. I ara not forry , replyed the
Marquis, that so worthy a man hath drawen you my pisture , for though I doubc
not but that he hath somewhat slattered me, yet you \vill not chuse but know me.
In the mean time since ! raust satissie your curiofity, it is necessary that 1 give you

and that si^e hath a kind of I know not what c.^s[ with her eyes, which perswaded
me ssie would not be very cruell. Is I were known more particularly of you than
i am, I would not tell you, Madam, that I loved Livia, since it would be enou-h
to make you comprehend it, that I say to you ssie soemed sair unto me. In sine, ssie
had no sooner made an impression in ray heart, buti sought the meanesto touch
hers. Anc^ although it be ray custora to explam my sels clearly in matter of love, and
never to leave her, whora 1 krve, to devine ofmy passion , yet in regard I durst not

I had painted forth ray love,to her Mistress; but though 1 had imployed all tS
therein, yet could I not obtain any am'wcr. Lucretia indeed told /. Lbe   2 ;
via esteemed very much of me, that my wit plcakd her,  that my converskt on w'"
agreeable unto her ( for I  had talkecs with her twice at the window bXTZll
oiLucretia ) but that asterall 1 was noc to pretend to her assestion.    1 consessIh
for this time her reiistance provoked rae more than her be^utv.  Behold me then ic
solvcdto know from whence the impodibility of my enterprise procectkd;  I call
la Roche to my succor, and command him to leoair to Lucretia, and to imploy all
his cunning to discover Livtaes true thoughts. He presses her,  he intreates hei he
thre.iten; to abandon her,   and yet for all that ssie acquaints him with no part ct"
that he dclires to understand. At sirst ssie tells hira , that ssie knowes nofsiing; aster
wards that ssie is obliged to be saithsiill toher Mistress; then,'that it is a thin? past
remedy; and last of all, without any thought oftellinii him that which he reqnired
ihe saies that Livta is ingaged in an assestion to another ,   whom ssie will not name!
This newes put me into choler,   and made me resolve once more to temptthelide-
litie of Lucretia; to which essest I gave la Roche a diamond, therewith to oblige this
wench to meet him one evening, and discover untohim the v.hole truth of I;sMs;
history.     My liberalitie sailed not to perswade her better than his eloquence, (he
nicetes him in a place sir enough out oi the v.ay to be overheard of any but my selt,
^vho umkrslood what ssie said without her perceiving it; and there, aster (he had
sussered her sels to be a little intreated, stie spake in this fort unto him. 1 know veiy
well that I commit a str,-,nge insidelitie against my Mistress,   but since it is to con-
serveyoii, and that you promise me you will not sprak ot it, I hope I ssiall notie-
pent me. 1 will tell you then, continued ssic, that about three dayes agoe,   wheiias
my Mistress was making an end of dressing her,   and that (he was doing ibraethiiie;
about her head, where (he had no need of rae , ssie observed that I looked out at the
window with a great deal of attention, and that I had also pulled up the grate. And
whereas siie asked of me ivhat it was 1 looked at so earnelsly, I answered her boldly,
that it was at the worthiest man of all her lovers; meaning your Master, who then
passed along thorough the street.   I sear me&gt; replyed (he sighing, that you and 1 are
not ofthe same opinion; howbeit, Lucretia., who is he that you do treat so advanta¬
giously to the prejudice of others ?Ic is laid I bein.::; become more hardy, theSrench
Marqui?, who verily hath an ayr,   and a countenance,  which none ofthe rest have.
And for my part, I consess unto you, that 1 (hould bc more sensible fora raan of his
Nation, than of ours. 1 cannot tell, Lucretia, answered ssic ,   whether I Ihould have
been as sensibly touched as thee, is he of whom thou speakest had sound ray heart
without ingagenientjbut this 1 can tell, ray dear girl, that it is not in an essate to
receive anv new irapression, for the truth is, lam in love. Arc you in lovc, saidi
mightily surprized &gt; I, siid (he, 1 am in love,  and that so exceedingly, as I am re¬
solved to tell him so much this day, who is the cause of ray passion; and who aster
my ill intrcating of hira for two yeares together, is resolved to return unto Naplch
ofwhenceheis,andnever toconie to Genoua ai,a\n.    But I doc not purpoletobeto
vertuous, as to be thereby infortunate all the rest of ray lise ,   wherefore, my dear

widiso a quarter of an hour aster I never think of her raore.    But in this cncotin^
tert sell not out so, for still I conserved a littk assestion, and a great deal of de¬
sire to be revenged.    But before I would resolvc on anv thing, 1 was willing to bc
vet better informed ofthe raatter, andto understand certainly whether//orz-s^-
L lay concealed at Leanders.    It was ray good hap, that ^aleno, whom que¬
stionless you know , and that hath a wit very proper to irabroyl an intricate
assair ,  proved   to be a  dear consident of his.     And whereas we had con¬
trasted agrcat sriendlhip together at ray being at i?owi?, I went and sought him
out    and^having sound hira , I soon obtained  of him what 1 desireds.^     He
told' liie , that not above an hour before he parted srora Leander; how it wa$
true that Hortenso lay concealed in his House ,   by reason of an amorous ad¬
venture v/herewith he was very much troubled ,   because he was   inaraoured
ofa ndvce oi Cinthtoes, named AureLa, withwhom Hortenslo had had a parti¬
cular comraercefor a good while together : How he was in good hope , Hortenslo
going away, and having no surther pretension there, that he might have decla¬
red his love to Aurelia , but how sar from that, Hortenslo, not onely remained hid
in his house, but had also obliged him to carry a letter to this Gentlewoman, to
crave her pardon for his parting away without bidding her sarewell, excusing
hirasels upon this, that his gries for leaving her had kept him from doing so. He
told me likewise, that Aurelia had received Hortensio's letter tvith much testimo¬
ny of assestion ; that Leander had been greatly tempted to discover unto her how
ssie was betrayed, andto make his profit of his sriends deceit; but that in con¬
clusion sriendssiip had prevailed with him above love.    That being returned to
Hortenslo, he had very much prest him to let him know why he was unsaithsull
to Aureliat how hehad sreely answered thereunto., that his inclination was to
Ltvia; how for the other, he served her out of acknowledgement, it being moit
certain that he was very much obliged unto her.    How aster all this he had de¬
manded of hira, whether a sriend of his ssiould disoblige him in thinking of her,
since he loved her but for consideration^ Uow Hortenslo wasnetled with this dis¬
course , aM had testisicd unto him that he would not endure it.   Behold, Madam,
theestate of things ; Livialowed Hortenslo, and was beloved ofhim; I loved X#-
via, and was ill intreated of her ;   Aurelia loved Hortenslo ,  and was  betrayed
by him ;  Leander loved Aurelia ,  not daring  to discover it unto her ,  and
was an instrument of his sriends treason; salerio was Leanders consident, and be¬
trayed him for my sake ; Lucretia for being saithstdl to/^ ^css^s, was unsaithsull
to her Mistress; in sine, we all of us almoft did that which we ought not to have
done.   The business standing in these tcrmes, I resolved to speak once more with

dcbt^   Iwent and attended L;^^.some three or sour steps from her door wil'
mind that retained little of the Srench civility.    At hci^rst appe   inS^^^^^^
onely by Lucretia, I advanced direstly unto her, and presenting her my h^and wTh
contemning negligence, I said unto her in somewhat a bitter niaiiLr sw
be,tairess Uvta, that being unabk to merit any thing of you as a Lover   v.7 ^
the quality of a Gentkraan-Ustier I raay be perraitted to help to lead ion    s
i&lt;now not, answered ssie, with aforious countenance, what renders you sobold.
to interrupt me in my way ; but I know very well, that is you have not a m
pole todiipkaso me, and did know my humour, you would not be so incoiili
derate as to dare to speak to me with so much liberty; for I make profeslion ofa
modesty, which cannot susser such things, and which you raight very well under
stand by the coldness wherewith I have alwayes treated you.    I consess that the'
discourse neded mc ; Icould not endure this sevcre vertue in aperson diat had
none but for me ; andthat reprochingme with her rigour, seemcd as though she
Would make nie serve for the triumph of her Lover.    I retained her then by the
arm, as ssie was ofsering to goe away, and in a quipping and jeering manner, be¬
holding her with a malicious smile, I said unto her; icis true, Livia, that! have
been rassi and inconsiderate in daring ro list up ray eyes towards a person of so ex¬
traordinary a vertue, as cannot suifor one to adore her; as cannot endure one
ssiould speak to her of Lovc; as loves even darkness, and hates the light, bccaiis: k
niight discover that which ssie would conceal from moft men.    Indeed, answered
ssie, I hate the Sun, because by it I see you.    It may bc, said I unto her with thesame
countcnance,and looking justly on her, that you do not hate the Koon so much to¬
wards raid-night.    Whereupon (he strove mightily to get away, but in regard!
held one corner of her vail, ssie durst resist no turdier, perceiving plainly that I no
longer respested her.    Nay, said I unto her, as ssie would have gone from me, yoii
must hear me whether you will or no, for since i t is a sutc of Love, it is but just
that you ssiould hear me, as well as you have heard niy Rivall ; and that to bc well
informed ofthe justice of our cause, you give him audience in the night, andnie
in the day; for] doe not desire that in consideration ofme an handkcrcher ssiould
be hung in the Window; that LwrrssM ssiould descend into the garden; that a door
which seem? to be ssiut, ssiould be lest open; nor that I ssiould bc a gallant, who
seems to be absent, and yet sades not to be at the adignation which is given him.
Verily Livia's astonissiraent raadc nie almoli- repent for what I had spoken, but in¬
deed I could not contain ray resentment.    The sirst diing that Livia said asterthis
discourse, was; h.hLucretia,youhawe betrayed me s But this Wench,who inthis
occasion appeared to mc to be the moft dextrous and daring that ever was,answered
her with an extreme precipitation; I Madam ! would to Heaven you were not more
betrayed, in acknowledging that which I never revealed.    In the mean time , l»
Roche, who had heard allthat I said, wasr iich vexed at my enga^m^ Lucretia by
my discourse; so thatapproching to me, s e said softly to rae in Srench, 0 Sir^
what have you done? I doc not know, said I (sepping a little back, but, is thou
canst, re-accommodate this diforder.    During this, Lucretia swore salse oaths to
heiMistrcisfor the clearing of her innoccncy; and the ^oor Livia was so surpri-
ledj as sile could resolve of nothing ; in sine, wc v.creall sour exceedingly perplex¬
ed ; I was vexed for having spoken so lavissily ; Lucretia was much troubled in
justisyin;&gt; her sels; my Agent knew not what to doe, either for Lucretia, or forme;
and Z-zr/.s could think ofnoth ing that would satissie her : She vvould sain-have
railed on me, but ssie saw that I was too much acquainted vvith her assairs to be
incensed more; She could have been contented never to have seen me again, but (he
seared lest partin.a; away without saying any thing unto me, I ssiould publissi that
which I knew. At last, (hc vvould willingly have recalled me,for I vvasstept a lit¬
tle from her,and stood niusing with my sels, biu her heart vvould not consent that (he
ssiould use any civility tome aster that vvhich I had said unto her.    Behold,]\la-

<p>ic,arprocheduntoL,^/.,andsaidunto her forthe justisicatson ofi;.rr../-*, with a
kenSg irnccritic: I knoi very well, Lady, that I do put my sels in singer of being
turned away by my Master,   in dikovcring a thing unto you, which he grs^tly la¬
bours to conceal, but the condition wherein you are, and the innoccncy of Lucr^^'s'
forces rae to open it unto you. Know then, continued he,   that whatsoever he hath
said unto youis not theessest of niybodies treason, butofAstrology, which he un¬
derstands pcrkstly. It is a kicnce wherein he is become so expert,   that is I ssiould
recount unto you the mervailcs, which I have heard hira tell, you would be migh¬
tily forprlkd with it. And whereas he is passionatdy in love with you, seeing you
very rigorous to him, he hath spcrtt every  night for these eight dayes in con¬
templating the Starres,  and turning over his books,   to dikover the cause
thereof, and without doubt it was by  this meanes that he is come to know that
whichhe hath said unto you: he hath ssiewed me, condnued hc,the garden, where
you were, in a great s}ass,  though I would   not undcrstand what you said.
Trudy the invention ofthis lad amazed me ;  it was in vain forme to make signes
unto him to hold his peace; the raore unquietness that I ssiewed, the more he conti¬
nued speaking; and 1 may say that 1 was never in greater pain, for I heard all that he
said. But whereas! saw that he went consounding things, andthat from an Astro¬
logcr he would quickly make me pass fora Magician ,  in talking of an inchanted
glass,   I resolved to help forward this trick,  that so I might make him hold his
tongue, Vv herefore I called him somewhat rudely,  and having commanded him to
withdraw, 1 came to X/sM with civilitie enough,   just as Lucretia was saying to
her boldly, how (he had already heard it assured indeed, that I dealt with telling of
fortunes. And having sainted her for the better colouring ofthe business,   I seemed
to bc very angry with la Roches imprudence, in discovcring to her a thing ,   whicsi
I would not have known, inregardof the brutissiness of the people, who imagine
that one cannot observe the Starres, without having commerce with the Dcvill; and
know not how to put a disserence between Astrologic and inchantments.   But
hnce the sault was done, I desired her to oblige mc to her discretion, by not publissi¬
ing that which had been told her. I said unto her also, that parting from the Court
of France, I had past through Provence , where hapning to be lodged near to a great
Noftradamus,  so admirable in this sciencc, as it was not known whether he ssiould
be tcarmcd a Prophet, or an Astrologer , I had been so happy, as to touch his incli¬
nation, andto gain his sriendssiip even to the point to teach me apart of the ex¬
cellent things he knew, either for Astrologic, Phisiognom'y, or Chiromancie.   In
hne, 1 (pake to her with so much art, as ssie beleeved me; and beleeved too that L«-
cretia^a, innocent, who on her side played her part so well,   as ssie made me assia¬

<p>scls much perplexed, when as this old man said to her i n a grave tone that m
men had imployed all their lives in this study,and had taken upon ssiem'ssie naaie s
Astrologers, but that sew had come to the point of descrving ir.Then turning him t
mc with a more open countenance, he said unto me, that iTi were such a one as hi^
daughter told him, he would serve me with all his heart; that he was very mu h
assested to men of merit, and to the lovers of sciences, whereofthe vulgar wer
ignorant; and that in conclusion, is, he ssiould tell me truth, he must consess that i^n
times past he had given himselsto judiciary Astrology; but that the trouble of do¬
mestick assaires had kept him from excelling therein ; howbeit that he still kncwe-
nough to be able to discourse a little with me of it, is* I would come and viUit hini
at his house, whereof he ssiewed me the door. I leave you to judge, Madam in what
a case a man raightbe , that knew not so much as the names of the Signesand Pla-
nets; I made use of considence then in the incounter, and told him that I vvould
not sail to come and take outalessonwith him, and assured hira that he (hould
have a scholler of rae, vvhich vvould receive his instrustions vvith a great deal of
joy. Leonardo Q so is this man called _) took this true speech for a modest
civility ; and said unto me again, that he ssiould be glad to hear me tel! him
something of his fortune; and to perswade me that he was knowing he said to nie
also, that he had a great clesire I ssiould goe and dispute vvith him a little in his Ca¬
binet, that he might know whether the Planets ( except Mars and Saturn^ whofe
insluences be the happiest, are not they whofe pararclls are the greatest. Now forme
that ssiould have been healed of a quartan ague vvith a word less terrible than this
I saw it was time to retire , vvhich I did aster I had told him again that I vvould
very ssiortly come home to him and ssiew him my ignorance. He vvould have obli¬
gee! me to enter presently vvith him , btit I excused my sels dextrously from it, and
so departe4, aster I had salutcd Livia civilly enough, and beheld Aucretta vvith a
iign, that testisicd unto her how I was forry I had given her so much unquietness
inso little a time. I was not sour stepps from them but regarding this adventure
with a more quiet eye, 1 sound it so pleasant, that I had no other paslion but to
make it last as long as I could : And this manner of revenging my sels appeared so
sweet unto me , as I thanked la Roche above an hundred times for sinding out this
invention, seeing it had succcedcd so well. Now entring into my lodging I met
with Valeria, unto whom I gave an accouilt of all that hapned unto rae , wherewith
sie was so surprised and ravissied, as he could not believe that which I told him, so
much did hc sear that it was not true. He would not rely upon my word, but would
have the testimony ofmy Agent too; and though I was ofsended at it, yet was he
above an hoWCr doubting whether it were a jeis, or a truth, which I told him. But
in the end, perceiving I spoke seriously he believed me, and this trick so pleased hij
humor, and touchedhis inclination so mightily, that hc loved rae a great deal the
more for it.lt was advised thanisince the sather had had a part in the dcccite,and that
the business raightbe divulged, that it was better to have me pass for an Astrologer
than for ah impoftor, and to sow the bruite of it about the Town, before Leonardo
Ihould have leisure to discover that hc had been gUlIcd: But I oppofed this advisca

<p>sood while, for, said I, no sooner ssiall Ibc considered as a Contemplator ofthe
tarrcs, but they will come and ask mc an hundred questions, whereunto I (hould
not know what to anslvcr , so that I cannot tell how to turn my scls in this assair.
What yoii ssiall answer, said my Agent &gt; You ssiill inswer, continued he, just as o-
thers doe; sometimes I, sonietimes no, bc it savourably or satally, and for the rest,
much good may it do them ; for in conclusion, 'an Astrologer never warrants any
thing. Valeria sell a laughing at this discourse, and told me likcWise for the uphol¬
ding of this opinion, that this sciencebeing so dilsicuk as it was, it might be that
chance would make me prophecy sooner, than all Astrologicall rules and speculati-
ons; That I was but to (peak alyvaies obscurely; never to assirm any thing with cer¬
tainty; to consider a little the quality and age of persons; to speak scldom of the
past, or thepresent, vtsithout good information threreof; andof tlic suture to din

that as soon as hc had perceived him, he had made as though he had not Ceen

answered, I can scarce tell, so much am I still transported with astonishment and

particulars of my lise, as none but my sels could know; and this he sound out al
moft in an instant, by drawing some sigures upon a paper , and looking on niv"
hand, for he is also both aPalmisterand a Phisiognomist. Is it not the Sren h
Marquis (said Leander, interrupting hira)otherwise the Marquis of Touraine that
lodges here hard by ? The very same, answered Valerio; I had never the honou
said Leander, to talk with him above once or twice, but 1 perceived then by h'^
countenance and his discourse that he was, I will not say, an Astrologer   but  \
</p>




<p>leastwise a man that was addistcd to extraordinary sciences; howbeit I did

</p>






<p>I was there. And this too is one of the least things he can doc ; for is I shall tell
you the truth, I have seen and heard a pisture speak, and that is it whkh causes
the consusion wherein you see me. Leander was so surprised, as Valerio told nic that
he changed colour at it, and earncstly intreated him to bring him acquainted with
me, which he promised to doe, upon condition that he ssiould not publish what 1
had told him, for sear I might bc suspested to be a Magician; and that at lcn&lt;^th
aster many other discourses on this subjest, they parted very well satissied one of
another. And for a conclusion, Valeria s2.id unto mc , this is the sirst sod I
met withall; then he recounted to me how hc went unto the Academy, where he
had imparted to a great many the Wonders that I did ; that to publish them the
better, he had told them unto them in their ear, and had prayed them not to
ipeak of it, or at least wise not to name me; that going from thence he went and
made a turn about the Market-place , where he had met with a man , who re¬
counted unto him part of the things that he had told in secret to the Academy, as
one that was verily perswaded of it; which had so astonissied him, as to keep
his countenance hc was sain to enter into a Tennis-court, where hehad sound a-
ncther man, whom he knew not, that was talking very earnestly to sive or six per¬
sons, which hearkened to him very attentively, and assuring thera that Iwas the
greatest Astrologer ofthis Age; ancl that hehad seen mc doc an hundred things,
whi^h he recited unto them. That whereas he could not forbear laughing, he had
set himsels merrily to contradist him, but that this raan without going about to
seek for reasons to convince hira, had told hira roundly, that he spake in that raan-
ner, because he did not know rae, but that he spake upon certainty, for that I was
one of his best sriends, it being not an hour since he parted from rae; so that aster
he had recounted all theso things unto me, said r'".j/^no, despairing of making a
better encounter than that ofthis man,I came away to sind you out,so satissicd with
my lye, as is it ssiould alwayes succecd so luckily, I would raake a vow never to
speak truth again. Aster we had laughed well at this adventure, and rightly ad¬
mired the santasticalness of the World, which loves to bcleeve, or at least to pub¬
lissi bad newes, and prodigies, we saw my Agent return, whofe voyage had had a
quite other success. He had met but with sew to publissi that whichhe desired
ssiould be known,so that being mad for having done so little for a man ofhis humor
and address, be had resolved not to come back till forae good adventure bcsdl him.
He had sought then in vain for some one to deceive, when as a Maid, naraed Camib
la,-who seryed Aurelia, said to hira in passing clofe by him at such time as on:
could scarce see, sollow mc. It is sussicient to say, that this Lad was brought up
in my service, to make one be assured that he sollowed her soot by soot, for sear of
lofing the sight of her. This Wench led him into a by-lane, where sew solks
came, for it was almoft nothing .but garden walls; When they were arrived
there^ Camilla told him, that a person very considerable, both for her merit &gt;
and her beauty, attended a speciall service from me; that the reputation which
I had of being the civillest of men , made her hope that I would not resuse her; and
that is I would do her this grace , I ssiould not sail then to be at a little garden
door,  which (be shewed him in the same lancj and to oblige him to trustin

ctsaintance, and how do I wissi that he raay never think of rae    There is nothing to
be seared, (aid la Roche unto her ,  when as he knowes your adventures, for he is as
dis-reet as he is knowing. But at last aster a reasonable long cominunication, where
Camilla still assured, that ssie would by no raeanes serve such a Maskr, ssie told me ,
that I was not to sail,   is it wcrcpofsibk, in being at that garden door the same
nieht when as the Moon was down;   or is 1 could not bc there accordingly , that
then 1 would be there the next night at the same time ; that ssic would be .ready at
that place to give me entrance, and her Mistress in the garden, where I ssiou d speak
with her. 1 conkss, when la Roche related this unto us that I could not chuse but take
sreat pleasure in it, ^and much desire to read the note that was written to me.   Is I
had as happy a memory as a ^#w^»^« Herof , I would recite it unto you without
changing a illlable, but since I hive it not, it ssiall sussi'ce that I do tell you in gene¬
rall, how Aurelia intreated me with a great deal of ci vilkie and assestion ,   that I
would imploy that niervclous kicnce,  which 1 exercised so nobly, in setting her
wind at rest; that from rae alone ssie expested succor for her unquietness, and that in
sine,is I v/ere a Srenchman(which according to her sence was to say civill) I would
not resnk her. Valerio was so ravissied with this encounter ;   my Agent was so glad
of it; and at sirst dassi I sound it so pleasant, as we past away an hower very merrily.
But whenl perceived that Valerio would have mc try this adventure, ray pleasure
diminissied by the hals: The more I oppofed his will, the more he persisted in Van¬
quissiing mine; it was in vain for rae to represent my ignorance unto him, thedis-
ordcr that might arrive unto rae by it, the perplexity Wherein a man would sind
himselsto be, when he raust speak of that he does not know; for to all these objesti¬
ons he had wherewith to answer rae.   Hc in the sirst place laid it down to mc for a
ground, that to the end I raight not be taken for an impoftor by Leonardo, and to au-
thoril'e the cheat which hc had used to an hundred persons, in assuring them that
I was a great Astrolo ger, it was necessary,   that I ssiould use two or three one aster
another; that otherwise I ssiould lofe the reputation which he had gained me ;  that
isl resuscd to meet Aurelia, it was irapofsible bttt ssie ssiould speak ofit to some bo¬
dy, and so I ssiould be cryed down ,  and out of abilitie to be revenged of Livia by
this artisice ;  that I cduld notracetwitha sairer occasion toraake ssiew ofmy art
with sacilitie, in regard it required but the beguiling of a maide,' who doubtless
was well perswaded already ofmy sciencc, since ssiehad been so hardy as to intreat
me to come and speak with her; that in sine, seeing ^«rts//&lt;« had been so weak as
to belecve things just as one vvoulcl desire ssie ssionld bcleeve them , it vvould questi¬
onless be very easie for me to sadssic her; And for a conclusion,said he unto me, ssic is
young, (he is sair, (he wiU meet you in a garden ,   and irt the night, judge now as¬
ter all this, whether you are not to go thither. It is certain that this last reason mo¬
ved me very much; and ] selt then such a repugnancie inresusiiig a sair maid, as I
nude no longer question what I ssiould doc; wherefore I prepared my scls for it,
and for the more secur i ty,   Valeria and my Agent armed themselves to attend rae at
this garden door. As for my scls I carried nothing but my sword vvith me ,   for I
could not sear that the universall adorer of women,   ssiould be betrayed by a wo¬
man. But before I tell you what arnved to me in this garden, I must recount unto
you. Madam, that vvhich was the cause of this adventure; for we vvere made ac¬

<p>der was the sirst whom Valerio had perswaded that I was an Aiirologer'-, and sonie-
what niore;and that Leander vyas the same in whofe house 7/or/-s«/;o lay concealed*
1 remember all this, said the Princess, interrupting him , and to testisie it unto you'
I remember that Leander loved Aurelia, and durst not tell her so much, because Hor.
tenslohad ionie coranierce vvith her, although it was //methat pofsessed his heart
and that L(s;*«^i?r play'dbut an outward part in being constrained to scrvetheim-
pofture of his sriend, and to carry Hortenslees letters to, Aurelia as ishe had bccnab-
ient, though indeed he lay concealed in his house for to goe every night unto Ljvi/
in a garden.Since it isso,said the Marquis, I am then but to tell you, Madam,that
^ster Leander had been povverstilly perswaded of the wonders which r^/mo had told
him I could doc, he changed the resolution he had taken to stay till//orssw/a had
broken oir with Aurelia,\nto that of disabusing her by a pretty subtiil way, it (he h-d
had a true ground for it, an.l that I had been siich a one as he beleeved me to be. And
behold how hereasoncd with hirasels; I am going, said he, to Aurelui for a letter
which (he is to give mcto day for Hortenslo, whora ssie beleeves to beat Naples, or
on the way thither, ssie hath already shewed a great deal of gries for his ablence;
now isl can bring her to speak of that again, I will tell her ^hatValeno hath told
me of the Srench Marquis; so that isssie ssiall happen to bc curious to see her abseni
Loverbythescience of this man, ssie ssiall likewiie see that hc is not aiNaples-^ that
he is still at &lt;7sw«^; that hc loves another, and by these meanes I ssiall destroy her
assestion to hira, and it raay be raake ray profit of this diforder. This resolution ta¬
ken, he goes to Aurelia, who aster ssie had given hira her letter , sayled not to speak
ofthe absence of her Sriend, to ask of hira whether he thought it would notbe
long ere he would return ? Whither he had not taken this separation heavily ? and
whither he had not already a longing to see him again, though it were but lately
since he went away 1 Yea so great a one, answered Leander, who would by no
meanes lofe so sair an occasion, as I ara almoft resolved to try the sciencc ofa gr^ac
and excellent man , that is not sar ofs. Aurelia straitway would needes know of
him what he meant by that which he said, whereupon he recounted unto her all
that Valerio had told him, and a great deal more; that I raade the dead to speak, and
thofe that were absent toreturn again , but in such a raanner, that one saw the per¬
sons , whom one desired to see, as is they had been essestuaJly in the place where
diey seenied to be; and that this was done without inchantment, and by naturall
Causes, but hidden from moft part ofthe w^orld; that one must be very skilsull inthe
knowledge of ideas and simpathies for the comprehending of aliy part ofthese
niervclous essests; but in sine, how he was certain, that what hc said was true. v^«-
relia hearkned to this discourse with much attension; at sirst, she seemed to doubtof
that which Leander told her, but it was doubtless to make her sels the more alTn-
red ofit. For aster he had consirmed the matter unto her, as ssi.e desired it; andthat
hehad told her my name, siie demanded dexterously of him where I lay, andby
what way one durst propound such things unto rae, seeing I was a raan of quality)
and that raade no publick profession thereof. He answered her, how it was tobe
done by request, and that isssie desired any thing ofme, he had a sriend that wast¬
ry intimate with me. She thanked him, andsocivilly gave him to understandthat
ssie would be well contented vvith his cleparture. He was no sooner gone, butslic
calledC&lt;«w///rs, vvho was the consident of her secrets (for ssie recounted asl this to
me asterwards) and reported saithsully unto her all that Leander had told her.And
for a conclusion, ssie (hewed her that ssic was absolutely resolved to speak vvith me,
and to intreat rae to let her see her dear Hortenslo , of vvhom ssic had not taken her
leave. They rcasbned a while upon this subjest, but at last lovc prevailed vvith her
above &lt;^ood raanners. Camilla told her Mistress, that ssic knew a raan by sight vvhich
served mc; sothat without surther delay stie chofe rather to write to rae, aslhave
declared u'nto you, and to raake use of this vvench,than to accept ofthe ofser which
Leander had made her. In the mean tirae, the bovver of assignation being come&gt; i

discourse as much as pofsibly I could; but ssic, that came not thither to makeconi-
pkmentssaid with a low voycc, as though ssiehad been asraid to be over-heard,
though there was no body there but Camilla, that kept Sentincll at t.ie Cabinet-
dore   the Wonders which have been recounted tO nic of your Science, perswades
mc that it would be easie for you, isyou will, to spare rae the labour to   tell
you that Which I desire of you, since without qnestion you know it already.
It is certain that this discourk surprised rae aster a strange fort; audi beleeved,
in the consusion wherein I was, that I ssiould sind nothing to answer her with; but
at length, aster a great contest with ray sels, it is for the same reason, said I, that
your raodesty ought not to keep you from spciking; for seeing it is a secret which
I am not ignorant of, what you ssiall say of it ought not to add any thing to your
consusion.    It is true, said ssie, but I ssiould be glaclder to hear it from you, than
tohave it delivered by me; be not therefore so lieorous, andis itbep6ssible, doe
that which 1 desire without my telling it you.    This pbstinky made rae almoft
mad, and 1 vow to you, that the modesty of the severest Missress that ever I had,
troubkd menotforauch, as that ofthis Muid;    And seeing this consusion still
dugraenring, Isaid unto her with the tone of a more serious voice ; Sair Aure-
ita, 1 ssiould be willing enough not to oblige you to the doing bs a thing that
seeras unprofitable to you, is Iliad not a secret reason which consTraincs me there¬
unto; and since I raust let you understand it, know, that by the force ofmy art,
I can tell not onely that which you desire ofme, but whatsoever hath arrived unto
you,that which you think at this prescnt,and that which ssial besall you hereastcr;buc
is by a plain and saithsull relation, jou doe not ssiew the consent you bring to
that which you would have rae doe for you, it will bc irapofsible for me to serve
you; and beware, said I unto her, listing up niy voice, lest that which you call mo¬
desty, bc not an essest of the doubt you have of my Science, in desiring by this
essay to assure your sels of it.    There raust be considence in this mystery, continu¬
ed I, for I doe not work onely by thcordinary Wayes of Astrology, but I think I
have gotten some extraordinary knowledges which go beyond thern:And to testisy
it unto you, 1 will presently tell you, is you desire it, all the moft secret thoughts
of your heart, but aster that look for nothing more from me.    Shcsbycd mc thien
with a great deal of precipitation , and said to mc almoft trembling, seeing it is a
tnbtite which I mustrCnder unto you, I am resolved for it; then ssic redounted
unto me that which I knew already without inchantment, Im can, that she loved
Hortenslo; but ssie told rae asterwards that which I knew not, namely, that ssic
would have me ssiew her that Lover, whom ssie beleeved to be at t^aples, but was
sldlX at Genoua.   This propofition put rae into a strange diforder ; I Void her at
sirst, that the matter was not easie; that it behoved her to have a great deal of cou¬
rage to undertake it; thatthe appantion of Spirits, which Were not at that time
many other but a santasticall body, did alwayes bring sear along with it; and
that ssic ssiould think well of that which ssie desired, before ssie undertook it.    Shd
answered me then, that nothing which resembled Hortsnslo could scare her.    When¬

a person of her Sex have a Spirit hardy enough for an enterprik which made til
boldest to tremble.   But to make it succecd, ssie was to write a note, according

sigures upon it, assuring her that I would tear it as soon as the mystery was sinilli^
ed ; and that this amongst the Learned was called, the making of a covenant with
the Ideas.    She made a little dissiculty at it, but having told her how I could doe
nothing without that, ssie consonted thercuntO;and by good hap there was a pen and
ink in the Cabinet, and a Table-book, wherein we sound a white leas.   She besan

<p>Aurelia.
</p>
<p>Whereas her mind was already pre-occupatcd with the opinion of my skill,
these equivocating words, of an Angel of Light, of Darkness, of Conjuration, of
blcssed Spirit, of Heaven, of Apparition, of Vision, and of Sear, sailed not tocon.
sirm her in this belies.    And then too I pronounced all thofe great words widi so
imperious a tone, as I perceived her to be terrisied therewith.    Aster this, ! would
needs see her hand also, and would have her six her looks upon me; I demanded
of her the hour and day of her birth, and made many other observations, which
would be too long to recite.    But at last, all these devices being over , I quitted
Aurelia, aster Ihadprondsed her that within three nights ssie ssiould see her dear
Hortenslo, and so Camilla came to condust rae forth.    In traversing the Garden I
observed that Camilla hid her sace with a great deal of care, for sear lest I ssiould
read the secret of her heart in her eyes; and whenaa I perceived it, I said tohsr,
laughing for the raaking up of the Comedy , in vain, Camilla (for so had I heard
Aurelia call her^ doe you seek to hide your eyes from rae, when as I plainly see your
heart.    Now I besecch you Sir, said this Wench unto rae, raightily surprised, and
that was naturally merry and joviall, is yoti know my secret, doe not tell it unto
my Mistress, for then will the poor Nastagiobe turned out of doors.    I had such a
mind to laugh at this simplicity of Camilla, as I got me out in hast, for sear I sliould
burst out into laughter, or be stisled in the place ; howbeit I told her in going fordi
that I would be discreet.    I sound Valeria in so great an impatience to know what
I had done, as I could not make him resolve to stay till we came to our Lodging
to recount it unto him, for we had not made three steps but we stood still, so tkat
little lacked but we had past all the night in the strcets; bur at length we came dii'
ther, where I recited all this unto him.    Bur the pleasure ofit was, that I had been
so accustomed so speak to Aurelia in a grave tone, as I delivered every thing un¬
to him just as I had said it.    And to make up the matter, there were some instan-
ces, where I was not very certain whether I were not indeed the same which I gave
cut ray sels to be.    When as I ssiewed him Aurelia s Letter, he demanded ot me
what design I had in raaking her to write it ? What design, said I ,  even to have
it to sall into the hands oi Hortenslo, who bclecving that Aurelia knows he lies con¬
cealed at LsW&lt;rr^ house ,   in regard ssie writes unto hira, will not sail to be at the

soaold For Hortelso retyring very late srora Lr^.^ve had had the leasure to attend
for him alrac st an hour bcforl he came forth.Is the passion wherein I had been m for
thisraaid, had been as strong still as it was the day before, Ihad past that timewith
a great deal of unquietness; and I ssiould without doubt have rather given some
marks of my resentment t.i ray Rivall, than have caused a letter to be delivered
•into hira; but 1 never needed sour and twenty howersto cure me of such a ciis-
cak. 1 kit then nothing raore for Uvta, but an extreme desire to trciible her plea-
lure- so that to arrive thereunto, I had as much patience, as was requisite for me to
havcinthis incounter. We set our selves, T^/.m and I, some dofcn pacesfrom the
door,out of which Hortenslo was to come,under the jetting-out portall of an house ,
that was buik aster the and que manner. As for/rsi?or/7^ he approched nearer, yet
not sofar srora us, butthat we raight hear all that he (hould say unto hira. And
whereas it wascxtrcrac dark, and that his way tycd him to pass by th'" place where
we were, ive conceived that we ssiould hear, without being perceived, how he
wt.iuld receive this message. As indeed, he was no sooner come forth but 1 heard my
Agent say unco hira, that Aurelia havhig understood he was in Genoua, had sent
him with a kttcrunto him, which he delivered hira ; and that (he earnessly desired
hini ncato sail the assi&gt;iiation (hc had therein given him, for that ihe would receive
no answer but from his own mouth; in regard whereof, continued la Roche, I may
not stay to hear any thing you would say to me, for so ara I enjoyncd by Aurelia.
J/orrs«/?"o would have laid hold on him, but my Agent was not accustomed to let
hiraiels be taken, when he had no mind to it; Hortenslo then was coiistrayned to be
contented with that which had been said to him. We heard him stamp with his soot
on the ground, chap his hands together, and say with a kind of voycc, which ssiewed
both astonilhment and gries; what dcvill hath discovered to Aurelia that Iwas
here? It raust without doubt be an essest of the secret passion of Lww&lt;^sr, who hath
hoped by ruining mc with her to establissi himsels in my stead. Some three steps from
thence he stood si ill, and whereas we saw that this adventure made him talk like a
man bciidcs himsels, wc resolved to sollow hini. This design wasno sooner taken,
but he began to go on and talk all at an instaut. What said he , hath my sriend be¬
trayed rae ? however i raust see Aurelta, to the end I raay keep Leander from rea¬
ping the sruit ofhis cunning, and that this incensed maid may not revenge her
sels upon Lria. She loves me ,'rand I do not doubt but I shall pacisic her easily
enough. But it may be, said he again, that it is not Aureliacs letter; let us stay , till
wc can bt ckai cd of it, before we resolvc on any thing. Verily, this manner of dis-
courlingby himsels seemed pleasant enough, howbeit that which I sound to be yet
better was, that we perceived ( for we sollowed him very clofe ) how though the
night u as exceeding dark, and that wc were in a very narrow street, where it was
so obsdire, as nothing could be discerned , yet had he broken up the seal of this kt-

slung it a good way from him , without purpofing so to do, for he sought for" ^
pretty while aster. We underssood this accident,  both by the discourse which h*
held, and because he stood still. We got us up, Valerio and I, against the wall • but t
ronsess to you ,  that this adventure was not pleasing to me: I was so assra'idth \
Hortenslo vvould not seek as hc ssiould do for the letter, and so my design IhonM
sail, that I may (ay I was never in more -.inquietncss.  Me thought he vvaittoofar
from it to sind it; that he had forgot the place where he had let it sall; that perad¬
venture it was near to me, though I did not perceive it; in sine, I was even vvij.
.ing to seck for it vvith him; and my imaginadon so troubled mc, as I believed]
sivv it in twenty places, where certainly it was not. And when ray mind was
deceived in this manner,  I was in a pain that cannot be exprest; For whenas 1
ti\oUiiht that I sa'?v it in a place,  I understood by Hortensloes going diathcvveiit
troni it, vvhich so madded aie, as I had like to have loft al! patience. But at length
aster he had sought up and down a great while for it, and that he had said an hun¬
dred things, which would have pleased a man that had no intereis in the assair   1
hcai d hini upon a suddain say with much joy , at last I have got you again, and
have not lols ray labour: Whereupon he went presently away, and  1 retaining V,\lt-
lerio, who would have continued sollow ing him, told him, that is the like (hould
besall me again, J should go wild; that this adventure was both too pleasing, arid
too ofsensive, for mc to be once more expokd unto it; and that withall wehadno*
thing else to do with him. Wc got us away then to our lodging, where we sound my
Agent, howbeit we went not to bed before we had laughed sussiciently at the a:d-
dent ofthe letter, and at all thatwhich Hortenslo had said in seeking for it.    Inthe
mean time he was come to Leanders house, where aster he had read the letter, whicli
he knew to be written with her own hand, he was consirmed,  as we understood il-
ter, in the design of seeing her. Hc beleeved, that all thofe words, of blcssed Spirit,
Angcll of light, and darkness, which Aurelia had taken for markes of inchantiueDt,
•w^ere termes of galantry, that could not part srora a spirit that was ranch incensed,
He sirmly resolved then to see her the night ensuing; and thereby to conserve her

ivhonvlie waspcrswaded had betrayed him; for he could not conceive hov? Ame¬
lia could come to knovj any thin^ of h\m other vtaies.    But at length day came,
which I past away with an impatience that holds mc still; forthough I had thesanic
very day two very pleasant coiiversations with tvvo men, whereofthe one niocktat
Astrology, to oblige mc thereby to speak of it,  and the other said that it was the
cxcellenteli: of all Sciences, to carry me to the same things yet will I not speak there¬
of; for even as I am now talking, I am in hast to tell you, that assoonas the time of
Hortensloes alsignation approched, I went and put my scls in ambuscado,   with arc*
solution to see the end ofmy inchantment. Now it hapned, thatthe weatherbeinj
extreme hot, Aurelia lay in a low room,   whofe grated windowes were upon the
street, and where Hortenslo had often talked with her. But, Madam , to give youth:
sull pleasure ofthis adventure , I am to tell you, not onely that which I saw, ana
that which I heard, but thatwhich past between AureliaandCamilla,\shovcc(m-

prehend, that this Science was above her understanding;  and told her moreover,
how it would not be esscstively Hortenslo vthich ssic ssiould see, but something that

Camilla,Win you not be assraid &gt; Never a whit, answered ^/^rs//.t. J ust as ssie was

1 had sollowed pretty clofc,knocked loftly,accoi ding to his custom, at the windovy,
Whkh Aurclia'hcarwi^ began to change colour. Itmay be you believe, saici Camil¬
la unto her, that it is Hortenslo w hich makes this noite, or to say better his phaii-
tasnie ? 1 do notbelc:ve it, anivvered Aurelia, howsoever open the window, and
pull up the iii-ate. This wench had no sooner obeyed, but perceiving Hortenslo, they
both of them gave a sreat ssirick ; Camilla sinding her selt as very a coward , as ssic
bdieved ssie v\as; and Aurelia being nothing sb consident, as ssie had thought ssie had
been. Hortenslo expounded this astonisliment aster another manner, and believed
that the choler she was in against him , put her into that case vyherein he saw her,
nameiy vvith a countenance extremely changed,and her spirit so consounded, as
stic could neither sit still, run away, nor behold him. And whereas he was corac
thither onely to appease her, he said unto her that at laii: this Angell ofdar|^ness
Was come by her conjurations to see an Angell of light. O rae, siid Aurelia, it is
the voice of Hortenslo ! but I am not able to ansvver him ; nor is it to speak to him
that I have vvilhedto see hira. In saying so, her exceeding searso reaniraated her
forces, as stie was able to get away into a Cabinet, whereof the door was open.
Asfor r^/w///^, ssie vvould sain have soflowed aster her Mistress, but her astonissi¬
ment kept her from is. Not being able then to do more, or to say better, not know¬
ing what ssie did, ssie hid hersels under the table. Hortenslo was so amazed at that
vvhich hc saw, as Aurelia could hardly be more. In the mean time , that he might
get her to come back again , and knowing, that ssie could hear him well enough
trom the Cabinet where ssie was, belaid unto her with a languilhing voice to
move her the more; Am I come sb sar then, Aurelia, onely to see you, and will not
you voiichsase to look on me V Alas! CryedC/iw)//^ toher Mistress, that which wc
think is but too sare, for he saies hc is come onely to see you. Aurelia, that was
ready to dy \nheArin2,Hortcnslo rpieak,whom ssie believed tobe a phantasme, cryed
tohim out of the Cabinet to be gone; and that slie made a vow how ssie would never
see Hortenslo more; unless it were Hortcr,slo indeed. He who believed that ssie meant
he V, as no longer Hortenslo, by realbn tA his change, called to Camilla , with an in¬
tent to desire b.er ihat ssie would get Aurelta to come forth to hini again; but scarce¬
ly had he named her, when as this wench, who had marked on which side the door
of theC.ibinet was, moved hersels with such vioknce to get from under the table,
for to eic.;pe away, as ssie overthrew it, together with the^light that stood upon it,
which in turning down was cxtinguissied; The noise which the table made, the
cries of C..vw/7/.i, the voice of Hortensio, and the darkness , so srighted Amelia ( for
ssic believed that al! this diforder was caused by the phantasme') as ssie sell into a
Iwoon: So tsiat akhough Hortensio continued laying many things, yet heard ssie no¬
thing cs It, no more than Camilla, who was sallen to her prayers. Hortenslo seein^ no
bodyanhvcr him, and having heard some noiso which I made wkh going tolscp
back a little, that I might have the liberty to laugh, he retired away in soch a choler,
and sury, as -avc so great a blow with the pummel! of his sword against the grate

<p>as it were better I ssiould want good manners,  then deprive you ofthe pleasure of
hearing it. I wil! tell you then, Madam,since your silence seemes to permits me so
doe, that Valerio hid a setvant, called Vespa, whofe inclinations were proportiona
ble to his condition, being of somewhat a dull spirit;  he never came a nights into
the chamber where we vvere,  but to help to make his Master unready, and then
went presently to lye with la Roche in a room which was soparated from ours one
ly with thin bords and tapestry hangings, so that speaking never so little lowd one"
niight hear from the one place what was said in the other.   When la Roche and Ses.
pa were a bed, this last demanded ofthe other, whether it were true that I knew all
that was done in the world, as he had been lately told&gt;L^ Rache,who meant to make
himselsmerry with him,   assured him that it was sofar true,   as that I persestly
knew what any body did, is I did butjinowthe name of the person. Alas, said Sel
pa then,   I would not be bound to scrve with such a Master! For how ssiould one
spend his lise with a man,   to whom one durst never tell a lye ? It is somewhat an
hard case, said my Agent, speaking a little lowd,  to theend wc might hear him;
howsoever it must be so. I liad as Iccse dy, said the other, as have my Master know
all the lies that 1 tell him, when as I   return from some place, where I have stayed
longer than I ssiould: for, as you know, we want not excuses for the stcaling of an
hower to bestow in our pleasures;   Mounsicur was not at hobic; I waited for hima
long time; he stayed me with a purpofe to have written to you ; I soughtforhini
in divers places; your clothes were not done;  I was to see as I went along whither
your Gittern were strung or no ; and so ,   according to the diversity of occasions,
diversity of pretexts are alwaies sound : But as for you, I do not see hovv you can
live j you durst not, I assure my sels,    entertain tvvo three of your companions
whilst he is at the Comedy, and pass away an asternoon in making good cheat. I
durst not indeed, answered my Agent, unless it were at such a time, as I know hc
had great assairs in hand, and so had no leisure to think of me.   Neither could you
have the pleasure, said ?^(r/p&lt;?, to recount his secrcts; to say he is in lovc vvith such
a one ; he goes often to such a place ; he writes to such a person; and that which ij
the worst, ishe hath ill intreated you; whether it bc in revyling you ; or in threat¬
ning you with the bastinado; or is occasion serves,   in giving you a whirret on the
car; you durst not complain to your sriends of it: Whereas to me, it would bcthe
depriving rae of a great consolation, isl could not say to one;   he is raore santasti'
call than aMulc; more extravagant than a Hobgoblin; and togivehim toalldie
devills in hell when he is untoward. For when I have said all this, I return home,
as isl vvere well revenged, and had said so much to him himsels. As for me, said
la Roche,   mine is none of the worst, and I am seldom in the case you speak of I
wissi it may bcso, replyed the other , hovv ever you muss needs consess, thathe
vvould very much incommodate me   in one thing; for hovv could one serve hitn
well, or be well clothed, is a man ssiould not make forae profit to hirasels of the
money that passes through his hands; I ssiould bevery forry to steal ought si'om
any body, but in that case I must be excused. It is not to hord it up, that I take any
thing, but to do him credit vvith it ;  and then the recompences vvhich Masters
make us is not so great, but that we raay vvith forae justice recompence our selves.
For that, said la Roche, you have reason; and there I lofe a sair oportunity, vvhich
you enjoy.    You are so unhappy too,  continued Vespa, that as I perceive you dare
not think of quitting him, ancl of looking out for a Maslcr secretly, as we common¬
ly do, when wc sind not our selves well vvith him vvhom we serve : and to con¬

<p>dcjiie he would also know what you have sayd unto me; for otherwise his soi-
ence'would be very consused. Then am I undone, sayd Vespa, but howsoever, ishe
must kn. -vv all that I have 'sayd unto you, let him know also that I never took much
srora my Master^t a time, to the end that he may be contented with making me to

no loneer doubt but that we had heard him widiout inchantment. And where -
iis there wasa back-door that opened out of their room upon the staires , he
rofe in hast, and got him away , so that wc never heard of him aster. The
rest cs the night was spent in sleeping, but the next day I had employment
eiioi+gh ; for I was scarcely out of bed , when as 1 received a Note from
Aurelta, whereby ssie prayed me that ssie might speak but one Word with me at the
Garden door, where I hadformerly been, out of which ssie would come forth, and
seem as though ssie had met nic by chance. I raade some dissiculty of going to her »
but at length Valeria constrained me thereunto. As soon as I came at her, being stili
pale,and amazed with her last nights adventurc,ssie said unto me,that having been ad¬
vertised since morning, how Hortenslo was esscstively at Genoua, and had never been
absent from thence, ssie sound that ssie had great cause to complain of me, for that

</p>
<p>this reason is so forcible, as I cannot destroy it; but since it is true, that nothing
can resist you, do rae the savour that Hortenslo, who as I have been told, lyes secretly
at Leanders house, that he raay go a nights to see a mayd whom he loves, may no
longer love her; or is it be pofsible, thathe may dcspile and hatcher. Thispropofi¬
tion began to put me into such choller against Astrology, that little lacked but that
I had lest Aurelia without an answer ; howbeit my wit served rae yet this once again
dextrously enough : For I assured her ssic was il! informed of the matter, and that
Hortensio dad not lye concealed for any new love, but that being grown kalous of
her, he had seigned a voyage to Naples, the more cxastly to observe her astions; and
that without doubt sile was beloved of//'i9rs&lt;r«/(S', asmuch as ever ssie had been. This
poor Gentlewoman was so satissied with thatwhich I told her, as ssie verily belee¬
ved it; and so I lest herewith a great deal of joy. As I was returning home I was
mightily surprised, to see how the people began to note mc, and point at me; some
saying, that I was a learned man ; others, that I was hals a Prophet; theseVame
that I was an Inchanter; thofe, that I wasa Forcerer. There were some too than
not sar srora the truth, took me for an impoftor, and scofsed at me ; at leastwise I
interpreted their looks and their astions so. I went then in a rage to'sind out Vale¬
rie, whom I met withall some three or sour steps from my lodging. I did not re¬
count unto him what had hapned to me, but I quarrelled with him for that he was
the cause ofall the consulson Iwas in. He, that was ready to burst with lauehter.
asked me whether I had not given hira order to publissi ray kicnce &gt; Yes sayd I un¬
to him, but not to make nic pass for a Magician. You know, sayd he unSo me, still
laughing, tkit Same atignients every thing ; and then what is it you complain of &gt;
all the world is satissicd with your skill, andthat which ssiould more content you.
you are revenged both o your Rivall and of your Mistress, by giving them so much

to come to us; I would have declined his encounter by entring into my lodging,
but r.r/.r/. told me thathe had promised him raya cquaintancc,and that he was too
near then for me to avoyd it. sodeed he was so near as I could not answer Valerio so
that 1 was constrained to receive the civilities of Leartder, who aster a great and Ions
complement, recounted unto rae all his love to Aurelta, who loved HarteTo thas
loved noc her, because hewa. ingaged elswherc ; and therefore he conjSmc as

<p>Hortenslo, but accept of his service. 1 was so consounded with all these adventure^:
aslscarceknew which way to turnme; howbeit sccmingtoconsiderof all thathe'
had told me, at length I assured him, that is he continued loving and serving he
he ssiould be beloved of her, provided he acquainted her with his passion.   He went
away very well satissicd, and Valeria demanded of me, how I hoped to keep niv
word?I answered him,that at lasi Aurelia would be weary of Hortensloes despising her-
that Leander by continuing to scrve her would touch her heart, and so would think
thatheobtainedthatby the power of my art, which was due to his own industry.
But, sayd I untohim, no\y that we have a little rest. Ictus so into our lodt^in/*
howbeit we were scarcely in the middle ofthe Hall, when turning my headab'out 1
perceived Leonardo the sather of Ltvia, comming to me with an open countenance
vvhich made me conceive that he had something to demand ofme.    I received him
with a forced civility,which might have made him know,is hehad heeded it,th at the
light of him had put me to a non-p'us. And to give him yet more liberty to perse¬
cute mc, Sii/sm, who took great pleasure in all these things, made ssiew of taking
his leave of mc, and went and stayed for me in my chamber.   Then began Leomrdo
to tell nie in a serious manner, which vexed rae exceedingly, how he was a(h.inied
that his sirss visit was to request a savour srora nie, rather than to let nieknow that
he was in love with the reputation which I had gotten in so ssiort a time; but in sine,
that he niight oblige me by his sreedom to use the same to him, he besought me that
1 would cast a Sigure to discover who it was that had got an Emerauld Ring which
was loft QUtof his house.   I raust consess, that I sound my sels then inso strange
a case, as is by wissiing 1 could have become a Magician indeed, to get out of this
crofs adventure, I verily think that I ssiould have wissied it.    What ssiall I do, sayd I
to my sels ? What counsell am I totake? And what can I ansvver tofo predinga
discourse ? It concerns not now the beguiling of an amorous mayd, or an ignorant
Lover; it is an old man that sayes hc knows Astrology, that will discover my igno¬
rance as soon as I ssiall speak ;   For to tell hira a lye about this Ring, it vvsllde-
stroy it sels :  It vvere better for me to deal sreely vvith him ; he will be obliged to
me for undeceiving him ; and then all things well considered,  I had rather spoil all
ray desigii.s than put a trick upon a raan of this age. Aster I had determined to doe
so,   I took   a more serious look upon me for to tell hira, how it was true, that
heretofore I had understood forae principles of Astrology (for I could not resolve to
consess my sels to be direstly an impoftor ) how upon that ground my sriends had
given me the reputation of knowing somewhat ; but that none ofthcra had ever
any experience of it; how it was true also, that I had many times delivered my (els
to be more knowing than I was, in some occasions jwherc seigning was rather a gal¬
lantry than a crime; but as for hira, I desired it (hould appear, that the reputation
which Ihad gained was not sodear unto rae, as his sriendlhip ,  seeing I con¬
sessed ingeniously unto him, that I did not know enough either in Astrology, of in
the other sciences depending thereupon, for to be able to tell him that whichhe
desired of me.    This discourse sb clear and true had nor the essest I expested from
it; for very sar from being believed, Iheard Leonardo say unto rae souling, HadI
not known by the report of others, that you are a learned man, your humility
would sussicc'to perswadenie that you knowniuch. Iswcar unto you,sayd Ilaugh-
ing ( for I could not poflibly forbear ) that I know nothing. Even this which you
say, ansvvcred he, is that which consirms me in ray belies of you ; and thus niodest
and djkrc t&gt;continucd he, ought they-to be who know much ;  for their science
makes ihem to be known well enough, without any intermixture oftheir vanity-
Is I were what you think me to be,sayd I interrupting him, I would acknowledge
it to you; but it is certain that I do not merit the honour youdonie. Ihavealrea-
dy told you, anivvered he, that this humility is the greatest sciencc of asl; it b^"
ing moft lure, ihatcvery man vvhich sayes hc knows a tiling well, is ignorant of is)
smcc he is arrived at the point to think that he knows it persestly, But at lengdi let
us return to our purpofe, and permit nie totell you, that this Emerauld isgraveOj

as though he had loft a letter, ;^hich a brother of his had written him from Nap/esi
that aster he was gone, Livik seeraing very sad,  and her sather having demanded

niade'rac wondersull glad; I took the paper from la Roche the better to dissemble the
raatter, .tnd uling a great deal of civility to i eanardo,   I delired him to cxcuse the
libei tv which 1 had taken. He answered mc, that with him J was justisied ,   provi¬
ded I would not resuse him. I conkss that the occasion of gulling him Was so sair^ as
I ssiould have had much adoe too forbear; and Leonardo too had such a mind to be so,
ashewouldhave beendisobliged more in not being gulled ,  than in being gtslled;
besides, it was in vain for rae to tell him the tristh again, which he would not un¬
derstand, do wh.it I could. He began again to press me; I resilled yet a while; but at
last, when 1 saw that hc would needes have me devine,! spake to him with more cer-
taincy than an Astrologer, and more clearly thin aOr-acle, is he would have under-
iloc d me rightly.  Aster I had made a turn in the room vvithout speaking a wordj
I ni.ide a stop just before him, and said unto him; hitherto I have done what I could
todilkniblc the little knowledge I have,   that I might not do any thing which
■would clispleasc you; but since you will needes know it, I will consess sreely unto
you ,   that i have already cass a sigure for it upon the intrcaty ofa kinswoman of
Liviaes;   so that disguising th^ truth no longer, I ara obliged to tell you, thata
man, whom ytiu saw this morning in a riding suit,   is he which hath the ring you
speak of Who w^uld ever have believed it, said Leonardo, that a raan of his sassiion
and qualitic, had been capable of so strange an  astion^   But young people that
have covetous sathers, are many times carried to ill habits by neceslity;-howsoever
1 miisl knd ou^this ring, and isit be pofsible demand it of him thathath taken it a-
Way Without charging him that he stole it. Aster this discourse he gave me thanks,
and raade rae promise to come to supper tohim. An hower aster he was gone,
came an old sellow, who had served Leonardo about thirty yeares,   presented to mc
by la Roche, that told mcwith a simplicity which made meto laugh, how being re¬¬
solved to return into his Colmtry,  and carry With him the little money which hc
had gotten, he besought me that I would cause him and his treasure to be transpor¬

said my Agent then, Without ray Masters medling in it;  and when I hadconsirmed

<p>resembled that ofa thies, as he was somewhat assraid to speak to him. Hortensio an¬
swered thereunto, that hc would think himsels happy,  isit were to command hini
any thing. How curtcous he is? ( thoussit Leonardo yyith himselsas he delivered to
mc asterward } and what a pitty it is, that so handsom a man ssiould haveso bad
an inclination? Then taking courage, belaid untohim ,  that having understood
there was a ring in his hands, vvhich had been loft out of his house, hc desired he
might see it. And wh ereas Hortenslo was surprised vvith this discourse, he seenied
to be sb consounded, as Leonardo no longer doubted but that he was guilty. 0 nie!
cryed Hortenslo, what is this I hear ? I do not say, replyed Leonardo,   that you are
saulty, but the party from whom you had it. How unhappy am I,   said Hortensi
interrupting him ? Asslist not your sels, replyed Leonardo, forthe hand which &lt;iavc
ityoUjliath alone committed this sault, andso you are justisied with me,   Whilst
I cofi.ir do did what he could to conceal from siini the bad opinion hehad ofhim
he was perswaded, that this man knew the truth ofthe matter; andto justitie Li-
z-i.i as much as pofsibly he could, he assured him that he alone was culpable; that
healoiK had deceived him ; that he denyed notbut that this ring was in hishandj-
and therefore he acknowledged he had just cause to complain ofhim,    Thisis
ssrangc, said Leonardo to hiraiels-, that the more I would cxcuse him , the more he
accuses himsels !  I say it to you again , continued the other, that I alone am wor¬
thy of puniihment. No Hartenslo,sayd Leonardo, you (hall not perswade me to it; sur
I am well informed ofthe truth ofthe business. VVhy then it is b:st forme, answered
Hortenslo, not to make any surther denial!,  but in restoring you the ring to con¬
sess ingenuously that I was constrained by an inevitable neccssity,   to do you this
wrong. I know well enough, rc'plyed\Leo;iard.-'. what youth is capable of, and what
neccssity will make  one doc. Hortensio,   seeing Leonardo speak sb gently unto him,
and believing,so ill did they undcrstand one another , that he knew all which had
past between L«i'/^ and hira, believed alio that he was to make his profit ofthis oc¬
casion, and to (peak plainly unto him. Since you know, said he to hira,how to ex-
cuse my errors,    will  you bc pleased to render them legitimate ,  in giving
me   leave to marry Livia'i   you know ray birth, and you raay know my estate
when you please. Marry my daughter J cryed Leonardo, this propofition isso plea¬
sant, as ou.^ conversation (hall end there , for I do not think that yon have reason to
continue it any longer, aster I have assured you nevertheless that I ssiasl be discreet.
Saying so, the old man went a\ray,and lest Hortenslo more amazed, than ever he was
in hislise,forheno way apprehended that Leonardowould accusehim of thcst;andto
perplex him yet surther, J?«rs//.j appeared , vvho believing, according as I had told
her, that/forss^j/o had not concealed himsels but because he was   jealous, vvould
#« pajsant have laid (brae raanner of gallanterie untohim. But he, vvho was not in a
case to dissemblc,   and that saw well enough hovv his lovc to L/w^ was upon
breaking   forth ,    said   unto her somewhat    rudely ;  you drove  me  zway
at such time as by your direstion I came to wait upon you,  think it not strangc
then is aster that I never do see you more; and to recompence the lovc vvhich
you have borne me with sbmesrccness, know, that 1 am ingaged in an assestion,

try is he could see/.»t/&gt;W , to the end they might advisc together .about what they
were to do in so crofs an adventure. In the mean time, Aurelia so rcolycd upon my
words, as ssie had much adoe to believe but that Hortensloes despisali was a mark ot
lovc. As slic was returning home inthisirresoludon, she incountred XrW^r, vvli^
had i'een Hortcnso enter into Liviaes house, and Leonardo presently sollowing in al¬

the truth of the History : He informed her how it was by his raeanes ssie was ad¬

but tu let her Know that her sather had demanded the Ring ofhim, vvhich (he had
ijivcn him, and that he had used all his endeavour to draw thccrime wholly upon
him(els;for as soon as Lucretia perceived Leo&gt;iardo,(he advertised them of it; where¬
upon Hortenslo was constrained to hide himsels in a corner of the Garden where
they were, it being impollible for him to i:et forth without being seen. When (up¬
per time approached, I went thither; fori was not lorry to seck foraii occasiou
of seeing in what case Ltvia was in as cr so many odd adventures; as I was going

ment for the nun who was asraid of robbing by the way ; that aster a thousand
devices, he had madehim get a ss ride upon a pale, as it were upon an horse ; and
there having bound up  his eyes, and tyed both his hands and his seet, he lest him
talking themaddels things inthe world,outofa conceit hehad that he was slying in

commanded him to sollow me, I entered intoLeonardoes house, just as hc was go¬
ing to accoft his daughter, who seeing me, would have pulled down her Vail over
her sace, but he not permitting her so to do,told her, that a man, to whom ssie was
ingaged for therecovery of a Ring which was sodear unto her, well dcserved to
have the pleasure of beholding her. We were both of us then very much abassied,
for I knew nothing of that which had p.ist betwixt him and Hortenpo ; and ssie seared
that her sather would give her some cruel check or other.    Howbeit I was not sa
taken up, but that I heard, in regard I was advertised of it before,  hovv the poor

he was hidden was hard by it, resolved to ssiew hirasels^ rather than tobe takra

the revenge which you will take of me for it.This is not amiss, sayd Leonardo tome,
I seek for my daughters Lover, and I sind a Thies.    You  think peradventure,sayil
he unto hira, to steal another Ring from mc, but 1 will keep you well enough from

tenslo for a thies; Leander and Livia beleeved the same thing; Hortensio himselskncS
not what hc meant by it; and I alone was he that could clear this Enigma.   And»!
Iwas preparing to ("peak, Hortenslofaid to Leonardo, that he had loved his daUEh-
ter two years ; that he had had the Ring from her; that he was no thies; and that
he might know of her whether hc told the truth or no.   Aurelia-would hayci^o-
ken, but choler would not susser her ; Livia indeed had love enough to have ton-
sirmed thatwhich Hortensio sayd, but ssie was retained by ssiame, howbeit ssie iinj
sain to surmount it, when her Sather asked ofher, whither that which he hcird
was true? for slie answered, how hoping that this mariage would notdilpU'ils
him, it was true that slie had given him that Ring for the sirst obligation thereof.
Leonardo had no sooner received his daughters answer, but taking nie asidene
consulted with me about what he ought to do in this encounter; for he did "^'^''
•pest me as yet, Iconsess, that thcni took pitty of all the displeasurcs I had don?

consirmed it unto hira with generofity enough.    But the best in this generall icjoy-
cinswac that Ltvi.tjxn a gallantcry,carae,and srailing sayd unto me,l counsel you a-
nother time to rely more on your racrit than on your kicnce,since though you have
wholly employed it forthe interrupting of ray raariagc, yet you see that your Arc
is deceitsull.    And continued ^«rs/;4, in somewhat a sliarpcr raanner, you alUired
me that! was beloved of Hortensio, whereas I no sooner encountred him, but I see
hira maryed to another, whkh (hews that your Astrology is salse. As for me, said
Leander, you perswaded methat Aurelia did not love Hortenslo, in the mean time
the proof ssie hath rendred of the contrary, testisyes the untruth of your books. And
for my part, sayd the Traveller, hc promised to send rae into ray country wirli ut
any danger of robbing, and lo I ara still at Genoua.    All this was spoken to rae so
precipitously as I was Vurprikd with it ; nevertheless being sully resolved to con¬
tinue no longer an Astrologer, I made use ofthis occasson; for causing Lucretia to
approach, that (he might witness thatwhich I meant to say, I besought Leonardo to
pardon mc for that I was going to consess unto hira, seeing ray gullcrie had had sb
happy an end for hira; and that hc would call to raind how it was not long of me,
that he did not believe rae to bc no Astrologer.   I recounted unto them my love to
Ltvia; in what manner I knew her secret, and consequently all that I have told you.
And aster I had obtained Lncretiaes pardon as well as mine own, I made it appear
that I had satissied thera without Astrology : For, sayd I to Leonardo, you asked rae
for your Ring, and I have made you to sind it ; to Livia, Ihave told you the raoft
concealed particnlais of your adventure ; to Ls&lt;«»^«', I raade you hope for the pof¬
session of Aurelia, vvhich (hc proraises to you her sels; to Aurelia, I have undeceived
you srora Hortenslo,and made you acknowledge the sidelity of Leander; to the travel¬
ler, I promised you that you sliould not bc robbed by the way, and I have kept my
word with you ; for I am sure  you are not in case so to be,   la Roche havsog pro¬
vided for that by taking away your raony, which I coraraand him to restore unco
you presently; sothat you see I have not sailed in my promise to every one: for
touching my sels, siiyd I laughing, you perceive I am he alone for whora I have
done nothing; sb that to recorapcnce nic in some fort for so many unprofitable pains,
savant me Valertoes pardon, vvhich especially I demand of Leander, as of the moft
ofsended, but withall the raoft obliged to his sriends gullery, since without him hc
durst never have thought of the happiness which he pofsesscth.   In conclusion, said
I to them Isill laughing, whereas you know that I am a dangerous enemy, I counsell
you, as persons whom I esteem, to receive rae for your sriend. They burst out then
into so great a laughter, as they thought they ssiould never have been quiet again
to hear the compkiiient, which Leonardo made me,who assured me that the pleafore
I had given hira by my relation, wasso great, as hc ssiould alwaks remember it,
as an iraportant service which Ihad rendred him, and thathe would not for any
thing but that this gullery had been, it was so diverting : Ltviatold me next, that
ssie was ofher sathers mind, and though ssie had denyed me her love,yet did ssie pro-
mikmehersriendihip; Hortensio added thereunto, that he was so much oblLed
unto me tor drawing hira out of prison, as hc could not chuk but swear an invio¬
lable assestion to rae;  and Leander, vvho was engaged to raes or the pofsession of
his Mjstrcs s, gave himkls wholly unto me;   for Aurelta, as ssie was least satissied so

siardo to send for Cinthto her Uncle, and also for Valeno, to theend they (hould i/'
part asunder till all things were peaceably concsoded. This was almoft as soon exe¬
cuted as i had mentioned it;  in the mean time Livia and Aurelta, having talked a
pretty while together alone, called Hortenslo and Leander to them, and suchthins"!
passed between them, as they sound themselves all sour extremely contented. CimI}'
and s^j/sr/o being come, anda sair conclusion made on all sides, thewhole compa¬
ny supped with Leonardo, though none but I was invited. Howbeit thac I may not
Madam, surther extend a relation, which is already but too long, I sliasl tell you'
that within a while aster I was bidden to their wedding, whither I came with more
lovc than all thesesour together had ; fori had enough for every woman of the as¬
sembly.    But at length,night being come, I lest them maryed and contented; 1 sjy
contented, because I ara not an  Historian but forthe sirst day of theirNuptialj
which orciinarily is sull of joy and gladness. Nevertheless that which troubled iiie
asterwards was, how not able to keep thj nutter from being   divulged, the
same people who had pointed at me before as at a Magician, looked upon me then
as on an impoftor, and jeered mc in soch fort as I durst not peep out of doors. Eiic
it is also true, that the same adventure was the cause of a greater good unto me;
forby the Count of Lauagnes curiofity I got the honour of his acquaintance and
sriendssiip, which hath likewise produced yours too, Madara, and hath also given
me the noblest passion that ever I had in ray lise. I must consess, sayd thePrincels,
that you are incomparable, and chat in regard of what I have heard, there is non:
but will say how you are a dangerous enemy, and a pleasing sriend.    Ah, Madam,
sayd the Marquis, do not ruin me with zAmilia ! no, no, sayd this mayd, for I pro¬
mise you not to judge of you but by your sels^ who, as I bekeve, will perswadenie
that, which her Excellency speaks of,  better than ssie can , as eloquent as (he is. I
would sain know, sayd Dona, speaking to theMarquis, whether they from whom
you take your love, may pretend still to your sriendstiip.    Yes, answered hc, pro¬
vided they have been savourable tome; for as for the rest, they areso indisserent
unto mc, as it would bemorc advantageousfor them, that I ssiould hate them. This
is a pretty discourse indeed, sayd Jusliniano,since that by this reason,thc sair ty£milii
ought not to be cruell unto you, to the end ssie may by receiving your lovc savour¬
ably pretend one day to your sriendssiip, I consess, said the Count, that the Marquis
his opinion teaches me a new tenet, which I did not belecve could be pofsible; I have
always heard it sayd, that sriendssiip is many times a way to love, but that lov;
stould bc the way to sriendssiip, is a thing whichhath but sew examples, and no
reason at all. This dispute would be a little too long, sayd the Princess, b5tn forthe
time and the place, and I think it were sitter forus to return unto i^/'^-zco before
the ending ofthe day, which will not permit us to walk; but this agreeable dis¬
course hath given us sb much satissastion, as we have no reason to regret it.   TIk
whole company then arofe;thc Count led Isabella;the Marquis&lt;i/£milia;Jusliniano and
Doria went together; and the Princesses women, together with other of her servants,
sollowed aster without order.   All this sair troop went aboord ofthe Galley whicli
brought them thither, whereofthe Princess never made use, but when ssic went to this
place.   The rest ofthe evening was wholly imployed in talking of theMarquis his
adventures, each one repeating in particular that which had seemcd moft pkasant
to them thciein.    Ijabella likewise caused her kinswoman, who had an excellent
voyce, to sing; the Marquis plaid on the Lute, and sung also with the beautisul i/s-
milia; so that concluding this day with Musick, they bid the Princess good nighr,
and retired to their lodgings.

' Count to return unto Genoua, not daring to stay longer ma
place whither hc had been sent. Hc took his leave then of the
Princess , who desired hira toassure the Senate ofher acknow¬
ledgement, and that ere long ssie would be at Genoua her scls to
rei/der thera thanks in particular for the honor they had done
her; The Marquis also kissed her robe ; ssie caressed him very

to write unto her. 1 ssiall be glad of that, said the Princess, and will enjoyn c/£-
?»/7/Vi to receive your letters. In the mean time Der/Vi, who was in lovc vvith the
Counts sister-in-law, named Sophronia, began to be in forae unquietness for that he
did not return unto Geuoua; yyhich being observed by Jusliniano, he conjured him
to abide no longer at Monaco, and to go along vvith the Count. Doria withstood it
a while, but at sengih hc sussred himselsto be perswaded to that vvhich he desired,
TheMarquis wasso dextrous, as he took the opportunity, whilst the rest were
conipknicnting with the Princess, to approch unto tAmilia, for toassurehcra
little more seriously than hc had used to do, that he had such thoughts for her , as
he had never before but onely for two or three cs all that great multitude ofvvo-
mcn vvhich hehad loved inhis time ; it is likely he vvould have said more unto
her, had net the Count gone away. They departed out ofthe Princesses chamber-j,
accompanied by y«/?«ww3 who condusted them to the Port, where they imbra¬
cedonc another with a great deal of kindness, and also renewed their sriendssiip

vour sirst adventures;   ssic ssiewed me your letter.^, and the verses which you had
made for her; and by the praiks which I gave thera,   I quickly got more eskem,
and love, from her than I had before. She sofsered rae also sometimes to sing an  ayr
unto her;  and whereas ssie called to mind the passion which you had ever had for
musick, 1 dare say, how it was raore forthe love of you, than for the love of mc,
that stie retained one of your Rivalis in her service,  ^/£mtlia, perceiving that this
dikourse had made Justtniano change colour, could not forbear laughing at it; and
desiring to draw him out ofthe pain whereinto ssie had put him;Be patient, said ssie
unto him, and judjrenot precipitously of a matter, for which you will asterwards
without doubt repent you. I know, answcrcd Jusliniano,   that I ssiould be unjust in
dcsirim; to be a judge oilsabella ; but I know withall that sear is inseparable from
love, and that inthis occasi'.in I ought to give you forae marks of it.    I will soon
make it ceak, continued cjLmilia, but prepare your sels to undcrstand the moft san-
talsick adventure, and the strangcst incounter,   that ever you heard ofs: You are to
know then, said ssie going on, howthat great reputation of beauty which the Prin¬¬
cess had all over/t&lt;«/y,bep;ot a curiofity at one and the same time m the mindes of the
younz^Vxinceoi Salern(y,andDonT emando de lAendoz^a,   who for a long time had
been in the War of Milan under the Marquis of Guasl; and albeit they knew not
one another ; thoup'i the one was of Italy, and the other of Spain; though the sirst
was at Naples, aiir', the other at Milan; yet took they both of them the same resolu¬
tion. The Princ&lt;! of Salerno was handsom , of a good mine,   and sull of spirit; and
whereas in studying the Mathematicks, he had learned to design, hc had asterwards
applyed hi^iiscls to painting, and was become so excellent in that art, as sew Master*
in Italy had done braver things than hc.   This young Prince being resolved to see
whether same did not slatter the Princess , and knowing by the example of others,
th« it would be no boot for him to present hirasels at jiso^^iro with an equipage
proportionable to his condition, he concluded to go thither disguised ;  and that
he might the casilier sind out the raeanes to approch unto the Princess,he purpofed t&lt;#
say that he was a Painter. Don Sernando de Mendei&amp;d, as I have already declared, ha¬
ving a like desire,  and a like curiofity, used also the same meanes to content it:
For as the Prince of Salerno Would pass for a Pairtt'cr, so Would Don SersiofiAo, wh^
understood musick persestly,   pass for a Musician. They disguised thtmsolve^ then
aster the manncrtheyhad resolved On, andwithotit knowing ought of oweano^
thcr, they came to Monaco at the time which 1 have noted; and when as the. hope of
seeing you again, and the Princesses compliance for me, had rendred her mekncho"-
ly more sociable. The sirst that arrived at Monaco was Don S^YMndo,   wkb retained
this name onely, leaving that of Mendoz^a, as too illustrious for hirtiA^oiii hc pre¬
tended to bc. And whereas the Princess had ordained a long timt before,  that no
strangcr ssiould enter into the Town, without sirst advertising her ofit, they came
prekntly and told her, that a man, which gave himsels out to be a Musidanj desired
to enter. At sirst ssie thought not to have seen hira, but as forme, Who had ho other

<p>ter, tothe end wc might see whether he were skillsull enough to keenn   s
forgetting that which I had alre.vdy learned in Musick; and to oblige her n TrT
nyme, I caused her to remember the passion which ssie had told me you^d^
had for this excellent art; and it was without doubt that in this fort the sole ^^^'^
lidcration of you introduced Don Sernando into the Castle ,   although the PrinT
had the goodness to tell me, that ssic sliould be very glad there could any thine b
met withall, which could keep me from being weary of Monaco. But in theed
Don Sernando appeared, and albeit both the Princess and my scls sound somethin'
that was great in his countenance, yet suspested we nothing of the truth, attnbn^
ting that softv ayr to the Nation, whereof he said he was; for he did not conceal
himsels from being a Spaniard, in regard, though he spake Italian  well enough
he would yet have been known by his pronunciation.    The Princess demanded of
him, of whence he was, whether he was going, what he could doe ; and to all thole
particulars he answered exastly. As for^his science, he desired the Princess that st-
would be the judge of it,   and hear him sing. She would sain have reserred hersels
to mc, but giving her no leisure to command rae unct) it, I sent foraVioflanda
Lute, to theend hemight ssiew us what he could doc. 1 well observed, how he he-
held the Princess with a great deal of attention ,   and also how hc blussied two or
three times. But whereas the greatest beauties strike everyone with admiration 1
took his blussiing for a mark ofhis respest, and his attention for an ordinary elsest
of Isabellaes beauty. When that was brought which I had sent for, he took a Lute
and truly touched it reasonably well; but when he had plaid on it, and that toim
he had taken a Violl in his hand, he perswaded us yet better by his play, that he was
A Spaniard,than he had done by his pronunciation,lt being raoft certain that it is im¬
pollible to play better:   Hc sung alsb with a very good grace, and with much art;
As for me, I consess unto you that I was ravissied vvith rr.    And whereas the Prin¬
cess perceived the satissastion that 1 received by it,   and was resolved to please mc
as much as ssic could, ssie demanded of Don Sernando, whether he would abide with
her for some time to be my Master ?  He very well contetJted vvith this propofition,
told her, that ssie did hira too ranch honor, and though his purpofe was not toraake
any stay at Monaco, yet ssiould he esteem hirasels insinitely happy,   is hc could bea-
ble to render her any service. Thus see you Don Sernando lodged in the Castle, and
in the rank of the Princesses domcsticall servants, but more yet, of that of her le¬
vers. For as we know asterwards, hc became so despcratcly in love with her, ashc
resolved to do all that he might for to gain her to himsels, by any way whatsoever.
Certain dayes aster, the Prince of Salerno, vvho gave hirasels the name ofLucilio, ar¬
rived also at Monaco,  and according to order it was told the Princess, hovv there
was a young Painter, vvho said, be came from Rome, that desired to ssiew hcrsome
small pieces ofhis own drawing.   She who, as I have already declared, sought to
delight me, commanded him to be brought to her ;   Don Sernando was at that time
in the Princesses chamber,  vvhom I had caused to corac thitherto hear a Spanisc
ayr, vvhich had extremely plcdsed me. The Prince of Salerno being come tothe
Castle, entred into the room, where we were ,  with a profound respest , wd
stiewed the Princess two small pieces   of his drawing, admirably wesl done
In the sirst was seen a Sea represented, whofe waves seemed to be very much moved,

himsels to the sury ofthe Se;^,  ssiewing them with one hand the point of a Rock,

and   Painting ;   and so did  (Ix^   locl.c   the  two   Rivals together,   that   is to
say, twofncniies,   without her knowing of  it,  and   without   their know-
in- of  it c'llo.    For is Son Sernando w.\s become amorous at the  hr(t light ot
the Princess, the Prince of SJcrnt&gt; was charmed ai ith it.   I very well pciccivecl, as
wcW a?.Von Sernando, how He beheld her with an cxtiaoidinary attention; but 1
niarvailed yet less at that than at the c soer, ima-inin- that as he was a (hunter, su
bcinc well ken in beauties, he vvould conseree lome Idea of that of the Priiicds_,
to make nic thereof in his Pictures. Von Ser?ia;,do and he complemented very kind¬
ly one with anofsier, and were as great sriends u sirst", as they were soes asterwards.
They thought inthemean while, e^ach of them in particular, ofthe dehgn theyhad
in hand, a^nd dextrously informing themselves of thePriiicelses mind, they learnt
how (helcvcd you still, and that although the greatest part of the Worid bdieved
you to be dead,  yet was ihe ab(blutely resolved never to engage that saith unto ano¬
ther, wiiich ssie had given you :  Whereupon they conceived it would be to no pur¬
pofe su-them to discover themselves as yet to the Princess ; but contrarily, that it
would bcthe means of ruining all their designs, and depriving  them of her|sight
for ever.    Wherefore they i-elblvcd to continue with her as long as they could;
caresully to observe her dispofition ; to please her as much as polsibly they could ;
and to work according to occasion. ■   For asterwards we underssood both all their
de/igns, and all their realbnings, which in this encounter were aim oft the very same.
Behold them then in the determination to render themselves agreeable tothcPrin-
es'',and to me also,because thty perceived that I was gracious with her.Von Sernanda
aught me Musick with a great deal ot care, and concealed none of the secrets of
this Art from me ; yet sometimes he was vext for that I learned so sast ; for, said he
to himsels, as wc imderstocd asterwards, as loon as ssie knows as much as I know ,
I ssiall bc discharged ; and is I doe not teach her as Isijould, they will turn me away.
Howsi ever he made choice of the sirst, and indeed was one ofthe best Masters in the
World. The Painter on the other side drew out shedcsignsof his Pistures, where
I think hepiitall the disguisements of Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury, and of all theo-
ther Gods ofthe Sistion.    But the best was,that what he did to continue the longer
at ^c«^c(7, had like to have driven hira from thence; for searing lest he ssiould be
dilcarded when the painting of this Cabinet came once to bc sinissied, he wrought
lo siowly, as cne might say it was Penelopes Web,and how he undid that in the night
whichhe had doneintheday.Nevertheless,wherasthe littk vvhich he did wa* yery

<p>Master ofhis Horse, who came into'theTown in the habit of a PiQ,
know is he wanted anything, gave order to have a vessell of War broughr^"' ^'^
Monaco, for the design which he premeditated: And Don Sernando, ^siho\ne^T^i
enough that the S paniards do not disapprove ofthofe who augment their do
by any way whatsoever, sent a Gendeman, whom he had drawn disguised i"*"?
town, to s tch him mony, and some troops of the Mtlanese, by the perniiSi     (
the Marquis of Guasl, to whom he wrote about it, for the executing of that whit
he thought on.    During thcsc preparations, the Painter and the Musician contimt
ed their endeavours still about the Princess ; the one always madcmystedou
Pistures, and the other always sung Songs, wherein he spake of sovc without be'
ing understood, so that they came to bc somev/hat suspitious one of another- and'
that which began to make them so, was, for that P^w s^r^^W^ not seeing the'Prin-
cess cnoligh to content the extreme passion wherein he was for her, had intreated the
Painter in private to draw her pisture for him , and kt no body know of it.   The
manner of Don Sernandoes raaking this   propofition begot some sofpition in the
Prince of Salerno; and the manner also of his excusing himsels from embracingit
made Doal'ernando observe him with the more care;so that passing over again in tiieir
memory how they had lived together before, they sound wherewith to augment
their s iispitions, but not wherewith to doubt of that vvhich they thought. Asterthis
they never lived wel together;thcy traduced one anothers profession;the Painter said
that he had heard better singing at Rome ; and the other assirmed that all the designs
ofthe Prince of Salernoes Pistures were slolnfrom antient Painters.One dayasthey
were inthe Princesses chamber, they entred into a dispute before her, andby diat
liberty forgot the personage which they represented ; yet was not ssie ofsended atit,
but contrarily took pleasure inhearing them.   ThePainter would have his Artcar-
ry it from Musick; he sayd thatit was the imitator of Nature; he vaunted thathe
could beguile the eyes, and deceive reason by theillusionsof perspestive; hesayi
moreover, that it was Painting which made men live aster their death; that it was
ssie which erested Trophcis for the vistorious; that by her we see battels which w
had not seen; that by her we know Alexander and all the Heroes of Antiquity ;thit
by her we make voyages without stirring out of our Cabinets; that by her V7ese:
our sriends though they be absent; that ssic was a visiblc Hisfory,   a mute Poesie;
and to say all, that ssi^was so excellent, as a good Painter miglit almoft boast hira¬
sels to be the creator ofthe things which hc represents.    The Musician, who would
not give place to the Painter, maintained, that there was thesame disserence be¬
tween Painting and Musick, as betw een the body and the soul ; that this sirst was
wholly materiall andgrofs incomparilbn of the other, which wasakogetherspi-
rituall; that   is Painting erested Trophcis tothe vistorious, Musick sung dieir
vistoryes; that the one touched nought but the eys, whereas the other, asl celclli-
all and divine, wrought upon the very soul vvith somuch power, as ssieexdted
or appeased the passions as she pleased ; and by this sweet tyranny rendred her scls
absolute mistris of all reasonable persons. Hcsayd sarther, that to judge rightly of
the advantage which ssiehad over Painting, we were but to consider, tliat the best
illusions ssie can make, do alwaies work a greater essest upon the rude vulgarthan
on Worthy people; that indeed ssie raight ssrike these vvith admiration, but ncvct
utterly deceive them, so that ssie operates raore powersully upon the ignorant than
on the able.    He added, that it was notso vvith Musick, which did not predomi¬
nate ablblutely but over reasonable person : that to have wit is not enough forusto
become her subicsts, and bc charmed by her; but we raust also have, not only sou"!
knowledge of this Art, but likewise a great and noble soul; sothat quite contra¬
ry to Painting, the more able   we are, the more we susser our selves to be vanquilh'
ed by her charms: That the other was but a deceiver, vvhich pays us vvith nothing
but apparcnces, and sb impotent, that ssic can do nothing of her sels, or to say bet¬
ter, that slie is nothing without the help of cloth, pencils, and colours; Thatthe
beauties of Mulick were essestive beauties, and to (hew her independency we arept
toconsider, that slie is no^ other than apureessec's of the imagination, guided by

<p>judgement; sothat having no need of forraign things, it ^^nothard to judge, what
advantage (he hath over Painting.   It is certain,  diat the dispute of these two
men secmed too trankendent to me for persons oftheir profeision, and I began to
look on the Princess in a raanner, whkh testisyed unto her how ranch I was amazed
thereat, when as DonSernando, perceiving it,  took prekntly upon him the humor,
vvhich is ordinarily attributed toMusicians; and witha caprichiousoess,whercin no
seigning appcarcd,he gave an hundred geeringquipps tothe Princeot5^/^r«^, who
played his part as well as the other; sothat returning out ofthe amazement which 1
had been in, I reslested no surther upon it, but heard the rest oftheir dispute with
great delight; for they raade sb pleasant a Satyre against each others profession, as
the Princess herkls, spight of her raelancoholy, could not forbear  laughing.
Howbeit ssic would have them become sriends before they departed; and having de¬
manded of them why they bore such a splecn one to an other ,   for ssic had been ad-
vertiicd of it, they were much troubled how to answer her.    DonSernando,  being
ever the bolder, spake sirst in this incounter, and told her, that on his pare ssie was
the true cause ofit. ThePainter, exceedingly surprised with this discourse, knew
not what to think thereof; when as Don Sernando profecuting it ,   gave them to un¬
derstand, how that which made hira so avcrse unto hira ,   was the thought he had,
that when he ssiould be ^oni from Manaco, the Princess could not chuse but remem¬
ber him, because ssie ssiould alwaies see his Pistures,   whereas is it were his ill for¬
tune to depart from thence, ssic would presently forget him, nothing remaining of
him that might make him be remcrabred of her.   Is this jcalousie did not ssicw as
much malice as assestion, replyed the Painter, 1 (hould sear the Princess might take
it well at your hands,  but as 1 believe her to be very equitable, so I think ssie will
sind the coldness which is betwixt us better grounded, when as I ssiall tell her, thac
our dislension proceeds from our not knowing one anodier. Or it may be, said Don
Sernando interrupting hira, srora our knowing one another too weil. Never a whit
replyed the Painter, for you are as unskilsull in painting, as I am in musick, and so
wc are but bad judges of each other; and it is the Princess alone, which will one day
put a disserence between us, when as ssic ssiall know me b.ttei: and that the designes
which I am about (hall bc wholly sinissied.   The Princess, who thought he spake of
thcddignes ofhis Pistures, told hira, that ssieknew hira enough already to admire
all that he did. And whereas Don Sernando would have replyed,   ssie forbad him,
and commanded them both to live better together asterwards, than they had done.
They answered, that they would obey her as much as they could, and so retyrccl
with a great deal of unquietness. The Prince of Salerno sound Don Sernando too har¬
dy for a MuUcian, and sound also, that ail his songs were too passionate,   too amo¬
rous, and suiting too much with the Princess, for to bc sung without design. In sine
bethought, that ashc was capable of disguising himsels like a Painter , sb might a-
nodierbe of disguising himsels like a Muikian. Nevertheless this likely sofpidon
continued not long with him; and considering how much raen ofthis profession arc
caressed by great persons, he no longer racrvaiied at his boldness;   hesound like¬
wiie that his observations upon his songs vvere ridiculous ; for, said he, as we un¬
derstood since, upon what subjest would Ihave them raade,    that they ssiould nor

a man of quality could understand this Art so persestly. These divers thoughts
never for all that so well setled in their minds,  but that they past often from th^
one to the other, and so were alwaies ready to* quarrell one with another. Som -
times the interest of their Nations was the (Kcasion of their disputcs;  andisth*
Princess authority, joyned to the sear which theyhad of venturing themselves un^
seasonably, and dcstroying their designes, had not kept them from it, they hacl
without doubt sought more than once.   In the mean time the Princess and I Hved
without suspesting any thing ofthe truth;  Howbeit I remember, that onedayi:
came into my thought, that there was something extraordinary in Don SerMiwdo-k\:
teaching me an ayr which I sound to be cxtreme.'ly passionate, and of his own m-
king, I demanded of him laughing,   whether it  were [pofsible for him to speak
sb oflove, without being ;in love. He answcrcd me thereunto,  that   he could
not , for thatit was impofsible for him  to sp^ak against his heart.   But, said
I unto him, may not I bc your  consident, and may not I know the person
for   whom you make such excellent things ?   You would no sooner be niy con¬
sident, ansvvcred he, but you would be mine enemy , vshcrcfore I will not tell you
anything, nor ssiall you know it but when I can no longer conceal it.  I consessmj
simplicity unto you, sbr my sirst apprehension being over, I believed that I had some
ssiare in this discourse;   and searing  I ssiould bc obliged to intreat   the Prin¬
cess to turn Don Sernando away , is became to lofe the   respest which he owed
me, I pressed.him  no surther,  contenting my sels with being his scholer , and
not his consident.And I was so assraid to part with him ,  as I never spakeof
this matter to the Princess, who past a good part css her time in seeing the Prince
of Salerno paint.
In the mean spacC these two disguised Lovers sinding no reason for them to disco¬
ver themselves, were even in dispair with it. They saw the Princess every day more
sirm in the resolution ssic had taken; for whereas they were dextrous and interessedy
they had so gained some ofthe Princesses Ofsker.'j,   as by them they knew allthat
did pass, and all that had past.  1 have told you already, that the Princess imployed
a good part ofthe day in seeing him paint, this entertainment agreeing better with
her melancholy, than Musick; It was then impolsible, but that, being good as (ke is,
the Prince of Salerno should often have occasion to talk with her;   and in thofe in¬
counters ,  ssie had sound so ranch spirit and civility in hini, as one day ssie preikd
him to let her know where he had led his lise.   And whereas hc had taken a resolii'
tion, which you ssiall undcrstand by and by, he answered her, that he had neverhid
any other Master but the Prince of Salerno, who was one of the moft considerable,
both for his birth and riches, that was in allthe Kingdom of iV4^/&lt;ri; that it had
been in his late sathers house where he had learn'd to know the sassiions ofthe world
better, than ordinarily Painters do ; and that not long before, through a miscbastcr,
which he could not avoid, he was come away from the Prince of Salernoes service;
But, Madam, continued hc, though I bc from him,  I cannot chuse but say, thathiJ
inclinations are great; that hc loveS glory and vertue, for touching his wit, id'
not for me to judge ofit.   I mervail ,   said   the Princess unto hira, is hc be (uch as
you say, that you would leave him ; for being great in birth, mighty in riches, and
so vertuous as you paint him forth to be, he must also without doubt be liberall, (^^
that I do not see any reason for your abandoning   him.     That  is it,    Madjm)
inswered he, wherein I can not satissie you; howsoever I can assure you ,   that uc^t
to you, there is no body in the world whom I would serve vvith raore assestion. k
Was in this fort that the Prince of Salerno began to give good iraprcslions of himseli
to the Princess,that he might prepare her the better to his desire; and divers tim«'
the Princess and he had such like conversation*.  At length that Master ofhis hor(e,
whom he had sent to Naples, returned unto the Town disguised as he used tobe,
and acquainted him, that hc had lest at Villa-sranco, which as you knowisiicir

out raaking ssiow of knowing hira,  salutcd the Princess v^ith agreat deal of re¬
spest and the Prince of Salertioes old Governor delivered her a letter written to hor
from'hisMastenssie read it with blussiing, and though I perceived a great deal ot
unquietnels in the Painters sace ,  yet was I perswaded that only the intcidt which
he secmed to have in the Prince of .S^/^rw, or the sear he was in lest he should be
forced to quit the Princesses krvice, was the cause of it.  Aster the reading of this
letter I knew by her discourse that it was a propofirion of mariage, and a declara¬
tion of love. She said to the Princes Messenger, that his Master did her an honor
which she was unworthy of And whereas this Governor would have inlarged him¬
sels upon the prayscs ofhis Masser, I know his vertue and his merit, replyed ssie,
and here you see one by me, said the Princess, ssiewing him the Prince of Salerno,
who hath drawn rae his pisture, and I doubt not but it is very like him^sincel
can assure you that he is one of the best Painters ofthe world. This gallanterie gave
great hope to the Prince of Salerno,  and silled the mind of Dan Seruimdtt\nth diC-
pair. In the mean time the Princess told the Princes Messenger, thathe ssiould have
her answer the next day, and then commanded her Ofsicers to have a care of hira ,
and CO condust hira to the lodgings where stranger&amp; were entertained.  They were
no sooner gone, but the Prince of 5;«/(sr»o making use of the liberty which the
Princesses goodness gave to all her krvants  when she was in private. I rightly fore¬
saw, Madara,   said hc unto her, that the Prince of Salerno would not make me
change ray Mistress.    For my part, said Don Sernando interrupting him, and ad-
dresling his speech to the Princess, with an intention to use a trick for the dcstroy¬
ing of the Prince of Salernoes designes (whom he did not imagine was so near
him ) I think I ssiould betray my duty, and be Wisnting to the sidelity which I owe
you, is seeing your happiness, or unhappiness concerned, 1 ssioold not tell you, that
■ this Prince of 54/(?r»(j is nothing less than what you are toW'he is.  Do you knov*

\ would have had me live with him, aster I had taught him some Spanissi Aires, but
, having been acquainted with the samasticallness ofhis humor,   I would not serve
' him. Besides, Madam, this Prince is neither rich, nor powersull in his Country ,
in such raanner as one would raake you believe ;  and I wonder how he ssiould be
so hardy, as to extend his ambkion so for as to you.  Permit me. Madam, said the
Painter interrupting him, to ckar my sels of the doubt wherein I am, and to ask
ofthis enemy to the Prince of Salerno, whether he be young ■, or old , and in what
place they grew acquainted together &gt; for as he talkes,  1 dare say he knows him

vvhich I have will not end so soon, replyed the Painter, for is I had undert k "^"

Never doubt ofit. Madam, said he unto her. Isyou draw that of the Prince of'?'

But tell rae yet, who served him at that time ? This old Governor which you saw

was his imploynient? IthinkI didnotseethat man about hira, answered D()«/sr.
w.i«^(?, and for his Master, I sound himso little worthy of esteem, that I did not ob¬
serve him; howsoever I am very sure thathe is not considerable at all, either in the
Court of Spam, or vvith the ^»(rs-.Scy. I see nolikelyhoood,  replyed the Painter'
for one to believe that the Emperor and the Vice-Roy haye entertained you with
these matters, whilst you were playing on the Violl.   There is yet less, skid the Mu¬
sician, that they ssiould tell you the contrary of that which I assirm, whilst you were
besmcaring of walls. Ah ! Madara, said the Painter interrupting him,  permit me
to punissi the lying and malice ofthis impoftor, who dares traduce a man so inso-
Icntly, whom certainly he does not know, and a Prince too , who cannot be abso¬
lutely without merit ,  since he is capable of the design to scrve you; He hath been
my Master, and is now your servant, pardon mc then is for your sake I lofe the r^
spest which is due unto you. Do not you sear , said the   Princess unto him that
D(7«s/r«4Wss&lt;sr speeches ssiall ever hurt the Prince of Salerno; neither doubt you,
that this noble ardor which you ssiow in maintaining his party ssiall displease
Hie, but contrarily I sliall esteem of you the more for it; and I forbid Don Sermh
srora ever speaking of that Prince but with respest; but withall I charge you not to
renicrabcr what he hath said, and coraraand both of you once raore to livelovinely
together. ThePainterwholly silled with hope, rendred thanks to the Princess; and
the Musician not able to doc   otherwise, got him away assoon as the Princess
was entred into her Cabinet, vvith a purpofe to ansvver the letter vvhich (he had
received srora the Prince of 54/sr»(? ; Who being withdrawn in private, and rc-
slcsting on Don Sernandoes boldnes&lt;; in maintaining ofa lie, and on all that had past
betwixt them, hc no longer doubted but that he was a man of quality, whom, the
sarae reason which had made him a Painter, had made a Musician.    Coming then
to look on Don Sernando, as on his Rivall, hc had an hundred times a mind todis-
cover himsels unto him, that hc might oblige him to sight vvith him ; but this sirst

restin-in her power, but the esteem of him and hissoiendlhip ,  ssi. alliircd hini
both of the one and the other, and of an acknowk^dgemeiit that ssiould last as song
as her lise. Thisobliging resofall asswaged not the Prince of Salernoes gries.   Who
hirasels heard his own sentencc pronounced; nevertheless he had reason enough
lek to uk his uttcrmoft indeavour to conceal it,  for kar he ssioiild be suspested ot
the Princess. As for Don Sernando, the joy which he testisied for this adventure was
so great, as the Painter was the raore consirraed in the opinion which he jid. Aster
th? Prince of Salernoes Messenger was gone,&amp; thatuhe Princess had given him a di¬
amond of great value, and that ssie had commanded him to bc condusted io the
Barque,vvhich wasto carry him back to his Vessell, thePainter craved  leave of
her that he might accompany him widi the rest, for he durst not speak to him, said
he, unless it pleased her to permit hira. You are discreet, said the Princess, and this
respest merits more dian this which you demand ofme.  The Painter having ob¬
tained thispermidion, went and overtook his Governor, to salute bra ;  this raan ,
who was inlsrusted as he ought, used him like a Painter, and dexterously giving
hira the commodity to talk with him,this Prince willed hira to return unto Villa-
Sranco,  under pretext of racnding something about his vessell, and t©send the
Master ofhis Horse the next raarning disguised unto him , with as much money as
as he could bring. Now you arc to ^ understand ,   that  the day before he hapned
to meet and know an old Souldier, which foractime had born arraes under his Sa¬
ther, and whofe lise he had saved, being at that tirae Sergeant of one ofthe Com¬
panies of the Garrison. The Prince of Salerno coraeing to know him , sound the
raeanes to speak with him in private, and aster he had given him three hundred
pistolets,hc made hirasels known unto hira  This man ravissied to see the Son ofhis
old Master, but raore yet with his liberality , testisied aster his manner,both his
acknowledgement, and his joy. In the mean time thePrince of Salern0,whohid
not raade himsels known unto hira only to inrich him,told him how hc was to serve
hira in a busincs that concern'd all his happines. This man told hira,that he was his
subjest, and his obligee, so that consequently he raight expest any thing from him.
Then the Prince asked him, whether he lived alone in his house, and having learnt
that he did, he asked of him surther, whether he could not suboi n a Sisher-man
with mony; thisSouldier having answcrcd hira, that the poverty of thofe kind
of peopk did not permit him to doubt but that he ssiould sind out an hundred in
stead of one, hc gave him wherewithall to gain him, without discovcring any pare
of his design untohim, assuring him only that this Sissier-man ssiould be expofed
to no perill, nor have ought els to do, than to carry his nets: Thatwhich made
the Prmceot Salerno do dius, was, for that he had observed how just at ten of the
clock m the forenoon the ordinary Guard still used to rise, and thereby had con¬
ceived, that they whichsawaSissier-raan go forth laden with his nets about nine,
would not be there at sive in the evening, andso consequently hc might come in
again accompanied with two men attired like Sissiermen, and laden with nets as
he was, without any nodce taken of thera. Aster he had reasoned thus with him-
icst, he resolved to execute that which he had premeditated song before, judgina

<p>but violence could put him in pofsession ofher.    This design being absolut 1
concluded, he sought for the means to execute it.  This Sergeant brought him
b i(her-man into a place apart, whom he instrusted with that which he would ha *
hini to do ; and thenextday this man went out ofthe Town about eight of t^
clock in the morning lacslcn with nets, and (as I have already said) before the Gua d
wasriitn; but when it was towards evening, hegave over sissiing, and went t
meet with two Souldiers disguised like Sissiermen, who carae by Land from th
Prince ot Salerno's Vessell, which was at VtUa-Sranco, and waited for hini at a cer¬
tain Reiidezvouz which had been appointed hira : Having ssiarcd his nets amonesi
them, he re-cntred into the Town, and incountring none of thofe souldiers at
the Gate which had seen hira in the morning, nonotice was taken of them, andso
they went along with him home ; where they stayed till it was night, and then
these two men having lest their nets there, were condusted by him to the Sergeants
house, in which they abode concealed untill the Prince of Salerno had need of
iheiii. By this device there entred everyday two souldiers into the Town, who
carryed two Pistolls and two ssiort swords hidden in the nets, wherewith they were
laden.    But whereas there wasto be thirty days before the threescore souldiers
which he had destined forhis entcrpri2e,could enter, he was in an extreme impa¬
tience; howbeit he concealed it so well, as we could never perceive it. Inthe
mean time he had gotten him a ladder of cords, wherewith he purpofed to bring
a dozen souldiers into the Castle thorough the windows ofhis chamber, vvhich o.
pened upon a place where no body usually passed, and where no body could trou-
ble his design ; for upon thediforder which had been between him and the Muli-
cian, theyhad been lodged assundcr. For the rest ofhis Souldiers, hehad resol¬
ved to send thera under the condust of the Master of his house, and that Sergeant,
to the gate of the Town, for to render themselves Masters of it, whilst he (liould
carry the Princess away by force, for which essest his X'essell was to be at the
Port.    But whilst he attended for the entrance of all his souldiers, and that dm
Sernando also attended the return of hira from whora he hoped for succour in hi?
enterprize, they lived better together than ever they had done, and in ssicw they
loved  one another cxtreracly,  though indeed they hated and observed one an¬
other as two encraies. Asfor Don Sernando,he had (during the design which lie
kept clofe} sallen into a strist league of sriendssiip witdi one ofthe principall Inha¬
bitants of Asonaca, whora the Princess had made Captain of the Gate.   His M
admittance into this mans house, was to teach his only daughter^o sing,  aster*
wards his conversation grew so pleasing unto hira, as he srequented thither very
often, and so they carae to love one another exceedingly.     Don Sernando, in&amp;i
thought which hewasin, turned his eyes upon this Captain,   and having heard
him say divers times, that the people began to murmur against the Princeis, for
that it seemcd ssie had resolved all her lise-time to make a desert of is/o»«&lt;r»j and
Utterly to ruine the trade thereof, by the dissiculty which there was of entringinto
it, he resolved to conside in him, as he hid,   aster he had blinded hira sirst with i
great suni cs money, vvhich hegave him. Andthat which made him not doubt but
that the Gentleman, whom he had sent, would bring him Troopes, was, because
he knew the Armies of Spain were very powersull in Italj,   and that is he couU
tiicc render himsels Masser of this place, ssie ssiould not only be justisied, but quia-
ly succoured; the Counccll of .&lt;i;&gt;4/«never wanting pretexts to invade the territo¬

the Princess had'had her unqu etness, as well as her Lovers; for thatLicutenantot
her Guard, whom ssie had sent to seck you , scemed too long to her in returning:
and whereas ssie had made it a secret, I was she alone to whom she complayned oii^&gt;

continued even unto the end. For when hc had learned thek Aires, aster they had
been repeated unto hini above twenty times, yet did he not sing thera very vvell .
NcverthelelsthePrincess would hear no other thing,   howsoever I intreated hei
to the contrary; so that Don I ernando was thereby rec uced to that point, as he could
not see the Princess unless he would sing his Rivalls songs: Which he did vyithso
much constraint, as he raade rae to laugh at him ; For still I was perswaded that he
did k out of caprichiousness and pride,  though indeed it was out of jcalouhc.
As for the Prince of 5^/mw, another adventure besell hira.   When as there lacked
but two dayes of the time wherdn all his Souldiers were toconie in, the Princess
reraembrcd how ssie had heard hira say, that he could draw the pisture of one that
was abknt, that ssiould be like hira,and thereupon believed that by the instrustions
which ssie could give hira he raight peradventure draw a pisture that would re-
kmbk you, though hehad neverleen you. She propoundes the matter unto him,
assures him that hc ssiall insinitely oblige her is he can do it;   and though ssic told
him not precisely who ssie person wassoat (he desired the pisture of,  yet he knev7
that undoubtedly it was yours which ssie would have. At sirst hc said ,   that hc be¬
leeved hc could not do it;but aster he had thought on it a little, I will endeavour.
Madam, said he unto her laughing ,   to content you, provided you will have the
goodness not to intreat rae as an ordinary Painter, and that you will acknowledge
unto me, aster you have seen it,  that it is the pist are ofthe man, who of all the
world honors you with moft respest, and loves you with mott passion. You know
too much fora Painter, said the Princess unto hira blussiing, howsoever I will
pardon you this boldness, and will acknowledge that unto you vvhich you say,
provided you presently go in hand vvith your work. The Painter having for an¬
swer made a love obeisance, went to setch a cloth and colours for him to work
in her chamber.   When he was arrived there the Princess vvould have had a great
glass taken away,  which hung right oppofite to the place where he had seated
himsels,for sear the Sun vvhich gave sull upon it, ssiould mar it; But he prayed her
that it might not be removed, because as he l^aid,   it served to ease his sight.    The
Princess then began to describe you as you are, and particidarising unto him all
the seatures of your sace as vvell as pofsibly ssie could, ssie thought ssie had instrust¬
ed him sussiciently. Whereupon hc began to design this pisture, and pausing at eve¬
ry draught that hc made, as it vvere to recolkst his memory,  at length he traced
out all the rest. And aster the Princess had caukd him to alter something,   ssie pro -
sest that it was very near to the sarae which ssie desired ;   but for sear hc had for¬
gotten what ssie had already told him,   ssie reprekntcd unto him again the colour
of your hair, of your eyes, and of your complexion. Then he took his palet, and
his pencills, and tricked the pisture, vvhich certainly resembled you a little,   but
less tl an when it was only traced out with the cole. The Princess mervcllcd here-
at; and knew not whereunto ssie raight attribute the cauk ofit;   for considering
every seature in particular, ssie saw that little lacked but they vvere just as ssiehad
ttguivd them, and yet for all that the whok put together soarce resembled you at
all. Bui the Painter nothing abaihed at it, told her that it was but a trickine   and

licr, that tojudge vvell of a picture ,   one was net to look uponit whilss itwasa
doing, andto discern the saults the better of that which he was about,  (he w.isto
let him work an hower upon it without look'ng on him. The Princess believed
him, and taking me away with her to the other end of the chamber, we lest him
alone; but we were much amazed, when he liad advertised us that his work was
done,   and that hehad brought it into the light for us to judge the better ofit,
tofee that it was his own pistnre v.hich  he had drawen, and not yours.   Tk-
Princess then perceived plainly, that this was not a matter of chance, and in an in¬
stant calling to mind somany things,  as ssie had seen withoutthmking of theni,
ssie made no doubt but that there was somewiiat, vvhich was mysterious enough in
this adventure; Yet had ssie sussicient conssancy of mind not to ssiew all hei araa2e-
ment, and to take from the Painter the meanes of discoveringhimselssurther; 1

of your Loversjl with all my heart renounce the profession which IraakcTakeheed,

l!Mlether this Painter were the Prince of Salerno, or forae one of his servants
l\;tl   had s^^^it to be "bout the Princess,   howbeit wc believed hira to be rather
diesirst than the other: And aster we had exarained thematter ,   it wasiesolved
that this   Painter ssiould the next day bc turned out of ^ci«^c.,without letting him
know that he was sofpested to be a Prince , and also without any other ill usage ,
than banissiinghim. With this intention the Princess went to bed, and would have
rae lye with her that night, it being irapclTible for her, as st^^^^^^^J'^o have any hope
oftleepinc, as long as you ssiould have a Rivall in ;i/o«&lt;tc^. Whilst the Princess and
1 were ag'itating in thisfort, the Prince of Salerno, who had sound that all his hope
conliised wholly inforce, resolved to deser his design no longer, and to execute it
the night ensuing;he went then to seek out that Sergeant with whom he held in¬
telligence, and to speak with the Master ofhis horse,   to the end his vessell might
not sail to be at the Port just at the bower which hehad appointed, andthathe
sliould deal in such fort, as all raightbe ready against need ssiould be. He gave them
the tirae and the signall ofthe enterprise,   and thinking that hc had well dispofed
of every thing, he retyred into the Castle as he used to do,  taking but two pistolls
and a sword along with him, which he caryed secretly into his chamber, in case
any violence ssiould be ofsered him before his design could be executed.   Is the
Prince of Salerno was busied, no less was Den Sernando; For hc had understood some
dayes before, by the return of hira whom he had sent into the Mtlanese, that accor¬
ding to his? and the Marquis of Guasls direstions , he had brought him store of
mony and Jewells, together with sive hundred men, which were come thither not
in a body, but two and two in a co.upany, and so were lodged in all the Villages
about ^(?K/ss«», with express order to render thcnilelves all upon a certain night&gt;
whereof they should bc advertised , within a mile of thcTowu; Sothat PslslS^r-
wWoftaydfor nothingbut the return of the Captain of the Gate,   who was gone
to Genoua, and whofe saith he had corrupted. This m.an , for our ill fortune, or to
say better for our good fortune, came back as hc desired, so that the next morning,
which was the very same day wherein this Painter sinissied the pisture that re¬
sembled you so ill, he went and sound him out,   and having given him to the va-
Icw often thousand crownes in jcwells, hc consirmed him by this liberality in the
design he had undertaken. But not to prolong ray dikourse, it sussiceth that I tell
you, how aster he had discovered hirasels to this man to be that-hc was a good
whik before; aster he had perswaded hira,that the retiredness wherein the Princess
lived, would in the end undo Monaco; because, said he,  it was impofsiblc, havine
no Prniceto deknd it,   but that some one or other would seize upon it; aster he
had told him, that this place was too important, for to be lest undesended under
the Government  of a mayd ;  and that soeing it was to pass into the hands of
.trangers, he was todchre that it raight sall into the power ofa man, who would

things, I say, this man charmed with the present benesit, with the hope of T^

of this incounter was, that the very same night wherein thePrince of Salernoyjn

assairs, no longer to deser his interprizc, purpofing to die, or to render himsels

into her chamber sollowed by ten souldiers, having lest two at the Castle-gatc, wb
had stabbcd the Porter upon his awaking.   I leave you to think what the Princess
became in this occasion, when as maugre her resistance and mine,maugrc her tears,
and maugre her cryes, ssie saw her sels carryed away forcibly, by these souldiers,
and led outof the Castle.    I can indure no more, said Jusliniano, wissi as much
gries, and almoft as much choler as is hchadseen his Mistress carryed away bj
force. Have patience, said ^yEmilia, for yet you do not see all our Enemies. VVhen
as the Prince of Salerno had forcibly carryed away the Princess, I sollowed her all
in tears, and catching sast hold of one of the corners of her gown, we went in this
fort even to the Gate of the Town, neither thcPrincess nor I having the powerio
cry out, so much were  we seized with sear, and our judgements troubled
The Prince of Salerno sound not the matter so easie as he had believed it; for the
Sergeant, who had gotten the Ward, and that was toraake use of it for the sur*
prizing of the Court of Guard, and cutting them in pieces , arrived just at the
gate, as the Captain that served Don Sernando, was delivering it up to his men, wkss
were come thither under the condust of the Gentleman which belonged unto
him, aster they had seen the Signall on the Tower.   And whereas he had oiderto
dye, or to render himsels Master of it, what resistance soever he met withall, ht
had already begun a ssiarp and bloody sight, when as the Prince of Salerno, ana
thofg that kept the Princess, arrived at that place. And being a Prince of a grCJt
courage, aster he had commanded his ten souldiers to look well to the Princesi, W
went with his sword in his hand to see what the matter was. Never was there any
thing more drcadsull than that same night; Don Sernandt, who lay not in the Ca¬
stle that night, who was ready at the gate to receive in his men, and who was in
the head of them, when as the Sergeant arrived there, thought hc was discovcred,

when hc perceived by the abundance of people , vvhich came running from all
parts, that it would bc impoflible for him to siniih his enterprize , he came once
morcuntoher.    I will dye,  Madara,   saidhe  unto her, seeing 1 cannot pofsess

that aster I have sought to carry youav/ay, 1 goe now to sight for to keep you
srora being carryed away by Don Sernando,  and the Prince of 5^/sr«o being un¬
able to live for you , will dye at  leastwise in desending you.    This discouiso
luiprising the Princess; What siid ssie, have we raore Enemies than one? Thi:;
while the  Prince of Salerno, vvho notwithstanding the darkness of the night,
having observed that Don Sernando was   in the Head   of the Troopes which he
sought withall, called himso often by his name,  that at length they met to¬
gether, and entred so suriously into a particular combat, as lofing the care ut
their men, itwas the easier for thera of the Garrison , and the peopk, wlio were
all up in amies, to deseat thera.    The treacherous Captain laboured in vain to
put Don Sernandoes people into order ;  and the Prince of Salerndes Master of
his Horse,   and the Sergeant, whora he made use of, oppofed themselves also
in vain to the dilbrder of theirs.   The consusioVi increased with the number; The
Princesses Troopes augmented still  ;   thofe of the Enemies diminissied every
moment; And whereas her voyce was heard at last by foraeof her servants not¬
withstanding the searsull noise that was raade,   they   which  guarded us ha¬
ving marked it, and seeing above an hundred men come from divers parts up¬
on them,   they abandoned us aster some small resistance ,   and that they  had
ssiewed agreat deal of care of not expofing thePrincess to any danger, as the
Prince had expresly charged thera.   They had no sooner lest us the liberty which
they had taken srora us,   but the Princess, seeing hersels in the hands ofher own
People, got into the nearest house , and appointing Souldiers for the guard of
It,   ssie  coramanded they ssiould send her word how things stood,   and thac

hiniconsusedlythatthe Princess was carryed away. This discourso equally for-

ble, considering what I have said, that seeing himsels in that estate, and pcrceivin?
that the Prince of Salerno, sollowed by some of his men, niade towards the port
he with his Souldiers mingled amongst them, and entred into his Vessell with hini'
the darkness of the night savouring the design,   which doubtless hc  had to kill
the Prince of S alerne, and tomakehiraselsmaster of his Vessell.   For when theday
began to break there was a great noise heard on the Port side,   which made every
one to get up on the walls for to see what thematter was. The Princess andlwent
upto the top of the lodgings where we were, which looked upon the Sea, and
whereas it was grown very light, we saw a Vessell, that was making from the Port
and on the hatches a great number of men sighting together, whereof some tumbled
alive into the Sea, and others sell down dead at their enemies seet. In the midst of
this diforder-we knew the Prince of Salerno and Don Sernando by thek apparell,who
combated with such violence, as moved thePrincess to compassicJh, but at length,
the Vcssell stiil getting surther of,we saw that aster a long combat these two Rivalls
remained sighting almoft alone, and presently aster both of them tumble downup-
on the hatches; and so on an instant the Vessel vanilhing, wc could no longer dis¬
cern thofe two couragious LoverSjWho more happy inthis sad adv£nture,than they
were aware of, made the Princess ssied teares of pitty; but ssie ssied them abundant-
ly,whcn as in her return unto the Castle ssie beheld so great a number of dead bodies
as the strcets were even   covered with thcni. The Prince of 5/2/(sr«of/Master of his
horse was sound living still, as well as hc whom Don Sernando had stntirXQtVt
Mtlanese; and it was by their meanes that we came to learn the particularities ofthis
History, which without them I could not have told you; for the Princess understan-
ding who they were, caused them to be very caresully looked unto, thas ssie might
iearn that which I have related. The Captain ofthe Gate , and the traiterous Ser¬
geant were sound amongst the number ofthe dead, and as is the Prince of Sdcr-
noes yiasker of hi%horse, and Don Sernandoes h^ent, had prolonged theitllvesbut
only to tell the Princess what ssie desired to know, they dyed within a sew dayesof
their hurts. As for their Masters we heard asterward,   that being sallen dovyn ask
were dead,in the manner as I have toli you,ch£ remainder of the Prince of Sakrmii
men having made an end of killing thofe which  had sollowed Don Sermmiolt
Mendoz^a; andbe\ieyin2, their Master to be dead, three or sour of them took up
the body of Don Sernando for to cast it into the Sea, when as the Prince of Sde/sn
coming out ofhis svvoon,   and seeing what they were going to do, recovercdso
much strength as to forbid them from it; generofity being greater in him than hi-
tred, or revenge.     This   commandement of the Prince was executed , andthit
too ofsering whether hc had any lise remaining in him; and when it was reported
untohim that he still breathed, he charged them to have as much care of him is
of himsels; as, indeed he was looked unto and treated in the same raanner. I vvilnot
declare the conversations ofthese tvvo Rivall unto you,but in bries it sussicethtoW
you know, that the Prince of Salernoes generofity so nearly touched the heart ofJ|**
Sernando, as he ceased to hate him,and would needs land with hira at Naplesto'^
throughly cured thcre.And as is on the healing oftheir wounds that of their minds
had depended,they surmounted the love which they bare to the Princess,the tirst out
of rea(bn,and the other out ofhis pride.And each ofthcra sollowing bis own sim
they sent to the Princcss,&amp; wrote unto her, the last with rhodomontadcs, according
to the humor of his Nation, and the other with a great deal of civility; beseeching
her to remember that ssie had promised her sriendssiip tothe?rince of Saltr^i
and praying her also to attribute allthat had past to the passion of thePainter i*'
cilio, and not to him ,   who vowed alwaies to seek occasions to serve her, andto
publissi every where,   that ssic was the admirablcst creature on the whole earth.

<p>^H E N as Jusliniano was retired to his lodging , and that hehad
coramanded his servants to leave him alone, aster they had
gothimtobed, his iraagination represenred untohimmore
lively, than ever it had done before,  the inconsiderationofhis
voyage; the promise hehad made to Soltman tot awn mo
hira;the neccssity, cither of breakinghis word with a prince
who hadso much obliged him, or to quit his Mistress: Alas/
saidssie, how unhappy ara I, andhow iraprudent havelbsen^
what ssiall I do in so deplorable an estate ? What ssiall I say to the Princess ? Where¬
fore came I to Monaco s Had I the design to betray her , in coming to marry her,
and then to steal away from her the very next day ?  Or have I past ray word for to
salsisie it? No, no, that was not ray design ; I desired to see Isabella, mylovear-
ried me unto it, and doubtless it ought to carry mc unto it; and were I to dispofe
of ray sols again, I ssiould still do the sarae thing. And could I, said he alowd,re-
suseto see Isabella &gt;Thcn turning himsels about with precipitation, he recommen¬
ced his complaints. What, continued he,   did Iconic to thePrincess, only to ac¬
quaint her that I was Grand Visier; that I was the chies of all the Orient; that I
was the Savorite of a great Prince; and asterwards to abandon her to gries and
dispair,  and so return again to enjoy all thofe greatnesscs ? Ah no, Justimamhwi
base;   he  will not  quit a Princess, who is not unhappy  but for the love oi
him;   he will not sacrisise her so cruelly to the pleasure of a Prince, who
raay sind raen  enough in his Empite ,   that will take the place whichhekW
there;    For in   sine,   is Soliman loy es us,    this princess loves us too ; n"'
is  1 have   sriendssiip   for  this Prince,  I have love for Isabella.   Let us not
balance thematter any longer, let us injoy the good we liave, and let us not
destroy   our selves:   Whereupon   he thought that he had sound some rest) M'
on a sudden a sense of honor comming again into his minde, he went onp3|"'
onately; Why, thou base man (said he) canst thou resolve to cover thy sels withm'

thathaththemoft sensibly obliged thee? And doest thou believe that this gen^'
rous Princess vvhom thou servest, would think thee worthy ofher assestion aw^

to fortune : let her intreat thcc ill, let her persecute thee, let her pursue thee every
where, it imports not, so as thou doft nothing contrary to that which thou owest
to Isabella. It wasinthismanntv that Jasliniano agitated in his mind so dishcult
a thine to resolve on ; and honor and love tyrannized him so crUelly, as his rea¬
son was almoft loft therewith. But at length, aster he had past the greatest part of
the night without sleeping, hc generously resolved to speak plainly to dicPnnces?,
and in this design prest with weariness and thought, sleep surprized him whether
he would or no, or to say better, a dull and melancholy vapor brought a scnsolcs-
nes3 upon him, which yet could not keep his iraagination from representing still
unto him the deplorable condition wherein he was.  Day being come, he sounci
himkls so altered, as one would hardly havcbclccvcd,that the miseries ofthe mind
coidd inso little a time have brought such a notable change to the sace. As soon
as the Princess was in an estate to be seen, she sent him a complement to advertise
him ofit, whereupon he came straightway to her Cabinet, but with acountenancc
so pale, and eyes wherein gries was so vilible, as Isabella was suj-prised with it; But
whereas ssic did notbelieve thathe had any cause to be asslisted, ssie thought he was
skk, told hira thathe (hould nothavecomeout of his lodging in the case hc was
in, asked him what hc ailed ? whether hc had a seaver ? whether it were still on him?
and sinally propounded very many questions unto hira, whereto Jnsltmano answe¬
red not a word. For upon the point of executing that which hc had resolved hc
selt so cxtraordmaric a trouble in his raind, as he suddenly past from palcncssto
redncss; hc was taken at sirst with an universall ssiivcring which made him to trem¬
ble , and then with so great a burning, that hc seemed all on sire. The Princess see¬
ing him in this case, conjured him again with more earnestness to acquaint her
with the cause of all these alterations in hira, thatthey might labor to give some
renicdy unto it. Alas! Madam, (saidhe unto her with somewhat a low voice, that
he might not be heard by one of the Princesses Woraen, who was at the other end
of the Cabinet) the knowledge Which I ssiall give you of my disease will not make
you sind a remedy for it; for it is of a nature not to be cured,  but by death.   Yet
is I ssiould susser it my kls alone, 1 would not complain of it; but I am asraid that
k would be contagious for you; that the knowledge which you ssiould have of ic
would incrcak my gries by causing yours ; that I ssiould be more infortunate in
your person, than in mine own ; and that in conclusion you would be yet more to
bckmented than I, who descrves the miseries which oppress mc, since I am the
cauie of all yours.   The Princess judging rightly by thisdiscourse, that there
was (ome great matter to be known, commanded her woman that was still in the
Cabina, to go and stand at the door for to keep any from coming to interrupt her

<p>speaking, neither durst heiikewise open hii lips; but aster ssic had rccoUcstcd her

<p>spirits, and knew thatit concerned not the sickness of the body, having a ereit
and generous soul, ssie said unto him with a sirm and assured voice; What mark
have you had, my dear Juslmiano, of my little assestion, or of kiy weakness, that
you sear so much to give me a part in your griess ? No, no, cast ofs this sear, and
permit mc to tell you, before you acquaint me with that which I can neither di.
Tinc,norcomprehcnd, that besides the lofs of your assestion, there is no mijsof.
tune wherein I ssiall not receive some comfort, partaking it with you. Ah! Madam
said Juslmiano interrupting her, cease to be unjust in being too good to mC) and be.
lieve that when you ssiall know the p^int where at this present wc are, you will
sinde that 1 have reason to be greatly troubled in resolving to acquaintyouwithit,
Why, said the Princess, exceedingly impatient, concerns it lise, liberty, or honori
is it bc the sirst, provided I may die before you, 1 have selt forrows (harper than
death; isit be tne second, and that I may be a slave with yoa, I will accustom my
sels to wear irons; but isit concerns honor, I consess that wc have reason to despair,
and that to conserve it, any thing is to be done : you see, said ssic unto him, tbatl
am prepared for the greatest misfortunes, and for such as seem to bc the ssirthestofs
sronimc ; hold mc no longer then in pain, isit be true that I have any powerovcr
you. J»j?/'»/&lt;»w seeing he could not avoid it, went on with his History from the
point where he had lest it, he recounted unto her his pains, his un-quictncss,and
his joys, when as he knew that ssic was not inconstant; that not knowing whatds
to do, he had been constrained to acquaint Soliman with his whole lise; and conse¬
quently, that the permission which hehad obtained toconie and see her was but for
six months only, having ingaged his word to that Prince to return unto hira pre-
cisely within that time. Judge (aster this,Madam, saidhe with sighs thatWellneer
sussocated hira, and that scarcely sussered hira to speak} whether my complaints
be not just&gt; whether I am worthy of your savour, and whether death alone benot
the remedy which I can sind for my miseries. For consider (I besecch you) the pi¬
tisull estate whereunto I am reduced; vsssiich way socvcr I turn rae I see you ilill
infortunate, but unhappy and infortunate only forthe love of mc.  Ah Madam!
is you knew how touching this objest is, how sensible and grievous it is, you
would easily apprehend the evill that I susser; it is so great, as there is no expres-
sion strong enough to represent it well : You have believed me to bc dead, and I
have thought that you were inconstant; your vertue hath been tryed by a long ab¬
sence, and my crime hath been pimissicd with slavciy; but when as fortune seenied
to be weary of persecuting us, vvhen as your constancy was sussiciently known, and
when as my crime was punissied enough, ssie made some truce vvith us: I knew? tba:
you lived for nic, and you were not ignorant that I always lived for you. I am
returned Mac^am, but must I repeat it once again ? I am returned a Slave, fortune
hath but Icngrlicned my chain, and not broken ofs my irons. You seem. Madam,
continued he, by your silence to tell me that I had done better for your rest, not lo
have returned, and to have lest you in die belies of my death, than to conic forw
assure you that I do live, but that 1 do not live for you. I think,Madam, that realon
is on your side, but it is a reason which I cannot sollow. My voyage i.s not an eP
of my reason, nor of my will; I never stuck at the taking of this resolution, W'
lowed my sense and my lovc, and my passion so raightily blinded ray reason,asmy
soul abandoned it sols wholly to joy. 1 no longer thought that I was to return i'
gain to Conslantinople, but only that I was going to Monaco, that 1 ssiould have t e
pleafore to soe you there, and that asterwards I could not be unhappy. In sine,Ma

<p>you, and crucll to ray sols; and to say all, I am so unhappy as death alone can suc¬
cor me: But for all that Madam, it is you that must pronounce my sentencc,   and
dispofe ofmy 1 ik. Juslmiano then kit himkls so prest with gries,   as he could say
no niorc.The Priiicel^s, vvho had heard him with a great deal of attention,   also-
ni(hmcnt, and forrow, was also a good while without answering him ;   agitating
in her scls so dissicult a thing to be resolved. She was then leaning with one arm
on a littk table of ebony, looking on Justiniano , who durst not list up bis eyes for
sear of incountring thofe ofthe Princels, which were sull of teares;   But at length
this generous person, who had a great and noble soul, brak ofs her silence, and said
unto hira with a constancy, which hath scarce any exaraple; I consess, ray dearest
Jusliniano, that our raiscries are so great, as 1 could not foresee them; and one had
nectl ofa mi 111 I, that is sirm indeed , not to He abandoned wholly   to   gries,   in
an occasion where it is so hard to satissie together, both honor and love: I consess,
continued (he, that thcsc two padions reign both at once in ray heart; but I consess
also, that the last cannot bc satissied without the other; and that in conclusion , to
express ray thought unto you, had I not sound a raeanes to satissie them both, I
(hould die, and let you goe. For know, that I am too generous to susser you to
testisie your lovc unto me in an unworthy way ;  and lam ravished to see you love
glory, as much as me.No,Justiniano,you rauis not break your word with a Prince,
who h.ith so much obliged you; forso ssiould you be both ingratesull and persidi¬
ous; neither must you too abandon a Princess, who loves you so dearly;   forso
(hould you be both crucll and unsaithsull; and isyou love her persestly, you can ne¬
ver doe it. 1 know sull well, answered justtniano vvith a deep ligh, that death alone
can acquit me of that which I ought to doe. That is not ray meaning, replyed the
Princess, and to clear it unto you ,   you raust return again to that generous Prince
who hath loved you so ranch;  I am no less obliged to hira than you, since I ow
your lise unto him; and for this reason , together with that of honor, I will not
hinder you from it:but withall you raust perrait nic to sollow you.Oh.'Madara,said
jHstmiano , do you think well of that you say ? yes, answered ssie, I have thought
well upon it,   and    am resolved for it. But whereas lovc can never vanquissi ho¬
nor in mysoul, Iwill not sollow you as a vagabond, and scrsak en one, you ssiall
mary mc here  ,   and  that   done , I will sollow your  fortune over all   the
earth. You have told me already, that SeUman permits you the exercise of your Re-
li2ioii,l mayenjoy the same gracc,either as passing for your slave,or for your vviso.
And then again, 1 have not forgotcen that you have told rae , how this Prince hadi
made you hope,  that is he could support ,your abknce during the tirae ofthe six
riionthes vvhich he hath given you, hc would grant you your sull liberty: Let us co
then, my dear Justtniano, and demand k of silm with teares; Do not stain your slo-
rv, in breaking your vvord withso excellent a Prince; and ofsend not your love
m resodng a reqiiest which I makcto you with so much earnestness. The generous
dilcourk oi the Princess had wrought strangely on Justiniano, during the time that
ihelpake to hini, though he lest not harkensog unto her;   and this pi?,pofi^i^ngave
hini a great deal of joy though hcnieant not to accept ofit.   And as inthadbeea

<p>before.   Must you, Madam said he unto her, surmount me in love, as well   •
greatness of courage ? No, it would not be just. Leave mc the onely thsog whe ^^'"
to I can pretend, and pofsesse all the other vcrtucs., wherein 1 can have no n'^""'
must in this occasion, Madam, ssiew you, that Justtniano knowes how to lovc    J
by the hardcst tryall that can bc desired of a Lover, I will niake you see that
love considers nothing but you alone; that it is wholly disintcressed ; that I rcea^I
not my scls; that in sine I am as persest a Lover, as you arc generous. But this q^
all,ah how cruell it is! And how hard a matter it is to rcsisse that which oned"
sires! Yet it must be, and nothing can distra&lt;^ me from it.   To testisie my love unt'
you then,Madam, at that height which speak I of,I must not accept ofthe ofseryo!
make me; I must resuse to raary you; I must abandon you; I must deprive my sju
all my selicity; I must sight with all my desires; I must destroy my sels;  and I must
become the moft wretched ofall men: Behold, Madam, all thac I can, and allthat
I ought to do for you; for to expofe you to tempests, to the sury of Pyrats, andto
consent that yoi; ssiould mary a slave, is a sacrilegiousnhought, which would render
me the moft criminall person in the world, and which ssiallinever arrive unto me.
It would be enough indeed for fortune to make me seel my own miseries, during
so satall a voyage,   without inforcing mcto resent thofe which ssiould happcnto
you. Let me depart then. Madam, or to to say better, let me dye. I will doe ncidier
the one, nor the other, said the Princess, and in this occasiou you ssiall not dispofe
ofyour sels. Nevertheless it is needsul! that you should giveme a publiquc asl of
your will, before I can execute mine. Resist mc not, Jusliniano, unkss you desire to
ofsend me; sofser me to sollow yon with honor,  and put me not in the conduion
of increasing the number ofthofe indiscrcet ones, who many times have solkwctl
their Lovers, without being their wives. Think of my glory, I conjure you; and
think too, that isyou abandon me, I may peradventure be capable of forgetting k.
Do not expofo me, I beseech you, to chat perill, since it is greater for me, according
to my apprehensions, than the drcadsuUest tempest that you can describe unto me.
And sear not I pray you, continued ssie, either ssiipwrack, or Pirats; is weperilB
together, wc ssiall dye almoft vrithout gries; is we oe made slaves,  you willhelp
me to bear my chaines; or is wc be soparated , the fory of thofe barbarians (hall do
no more, than what you would now do.   Cease, Madam, from adding to myfor-
row, said J*5/?&lt;»*&lt;»» interrupting her,   complain of my misfortune, but complain
not ofme in this crnell adventiire.   When I parted from Constant iuople to come hi¬
ther,   I blindly sollowed my passion; but at this present. Madam, Ivvillblmdly
sollow reason: She will not have you sollow   a wretch, and an infortunate nun;
Do you not conl5der, how is it should happen that I ssiould dye,  in what ancslatc
you would remain ? Ah! my dear Princess (is Imay be permitted to call yoa
so ) give over so wofull a design: Live in tranquility , whilst I go and combatmy
evill fortune at Constantinople; with a promise, isl cannot overcome it, not tofr
vive her vistory very long. But itmay be we ssiall not be somiserablc; SoUmtinb.^
a great and vertuous soul;   that which I am going to doe may please him l&lt;
may bc moved with my teares and pray ers;   he may break that invisible chain
which tyes mc unto him ;  and being no longer a slave, you mighc then widiont
shamc accord me the honor, which now I resisse.     This hope is too weak, saidthc
Princess, to make me change the resolution I have taken: No, Justiniano, to sp«^
to mc thus,  is not to lovc as you ssiould; this is to blind me withanartilicejto
doubt ofmy assestion and courage, and to say all, this is to ofsend me sensibly.?^!
teares shall not hinder yours from having their essest,  but contrarily I am of»
stx accustomed to vanquissi even cruelty it sels with such like amies:   Susser ™^
then to ssiare this vistory with you, isyou are to carry it;   or that I may be van¬
quissicd with you, is you are to be so. You do not consider. Madam, saidjustim0'^
that is Soliman should see you at Constaittinople,   it would be the meanes of neve&gt;
obtaining my liberty, because I should then have all there th.it could rendering
happy. The Princes? stood a whiles to answer so pressing a reason ; But whereas n^s

No, ray Justtm.ino, I would not ha^e that, said ssie unto him, but onely I would

whereof the beginning was so violent, foreseeing well that fortune was not yet
weary of persecuting her. But Justiniano without answering her, opens the Cabinet
door, calls her women, who srighted to see her in that case advertise &lt;'v(£j»^^.« of

<p>sicians where already come, for being incountred by good hap inth: Castleth-
had been advertised ofthis accident by one ofthe Princesses women. They beheld
her, seel her pulse, ask her questions, to come to the   knowledge of her disease
and not able to sind out the cause of it, they testisie by their astions,  and by their'
unquietness, that n^t knowing it persestly, they are troubled how to reiblve oa the
choice ofthe remedies that they would apply thereunto;   At length they ordain
her to be laid in her bed ,  that still they might gain time to think of that which
they had to doc. J«/?/w/?w out of respest retired all in dispair, and vvithoutbeins
able so much as to reason about his misfortune, his forrow became so strong, as hj
selt it but consusedly. The Princess was not long in her weakness , and Nature do¬
ing her uttermoft, gave her spiritsthe liberty again which gries had arested; But
thereupon, thci e was so great and Itiddain a revolution ci all her humors, as (he
sell into a violent seaver, so that the Physicians knowing then the Princess disease,
albeitthey were ignorant ofthe cause ofit, they began to treat her according to
the precepts of tlicir Art.    Justiniano was also desired by order from the Princess
to repair unto her; hc obeyed, and came into her chamber, vvith a sace wherein the
gries ofthe raind so nearly resembled that of the body ,   as he seemed to bs sicker
than the Princess. He approches, every one withdrawcs,  and when the Physicians
told her, that aster such an accident as this which had besallen her,   ic was (it (he
ssiould not speak much, ssie assured them that their conversation ssiould notbe long;
as indeed all that ssie said to Jnsltniano was,   comfort your iels for the love ofme,
is you will have mc live for the love of you ,   and be raindsuU not to speak ofour
misfortunes, no not to Doria hirasels isi he coraes hither. And whereas ssie saw that
J«/?i»;4«(? could not answer her   without discovcring'his   gries,  shewrunghim
gently by the hand, and calling e./£w;7/^ ,  ssie commanded her to haveacareof
Juslmiano, untill her sickness was abated.    This infortunate Lover, not daring to
speak, for sear of augmenting the Princesses disteraper, and making too much (how
of his dispair, which ssie would not have him to do, retired away without saying
any raore, than, AhlMadara, isyou will have rae comfort my sels^ you nrast then re¬
cover ofthis sickness, which I have been the cause of.    Aster that, thePrincess
grew extremely worse and worso ; the seaver held her ten daies with so much vio¬
lence, and weakness together, as the Physicians durst  not warrant her lise: Butk
was nothing in comparison ofthe eleventh day , for then Jusliniano, who scarctlj
had abandoned her all that time,  absolutely beleeved that she was adeadbody.
The seaver was very ranch increased , her strength diminilhed, the remedies unpro¬
sitable; Nature scemed to want power, and to be so oppressed, as it was impolsible
to hope that ssie Ihould cscape.   But in the midst of all thofe raiscries,  and inso
great an extreraity, the conssancy of the Princess was admirable; who,   notwith¬
standing &lt;!y£miliaes teares, the cryes of her woraen,   and Juslinianoes dispair, who
was no longer in the tcrmes to susser himsels tobe constrained by reason, cxpreiTed
such a tranquillity of mind, as it might well be judged, that lise was not very dear
unto her: Yet could ssic not for all that indurc Justmianoes lookes, nor see his teares
trickle down his checkes without resentracnt, and besides that deplorable objest)
slie was inscnsible to all things.   But whilst they were in these tcrmes at yls«»'««')
there was nothing but rejoycing at Genoua, where it was not known that the Prin¬
cess was so sick as ssic was;   for from her sirst time of being ill, (he hadgivcnin
charge that it (hould not be publhhed, to the end(hc niight recover vvithoutmo-
lestation, or at leastwise dye quietly.   It was onely then knowen at Genona thatlK
was not well, but that kept them not, from meeting almoft every day ;  according
to the order which the Marquis had establissied, either at the Couius, or atDorii&gt;[h
who aster his return had taken an onely sister, that he had , to govern his houlc;
and who was alsociated with this sair Troop ,   vvhich had no other thoughtbuto

wit^and beauty, sothat the Marquis being joyned to so many excelknt persons,
k niight have been said, that this Asserably had been persest indeed, had Justtnia-
nt and the Princess of Monaco been there. The next day aster that the Couns,D&lt;jrM,
and the Marquis were returned to Genoua, this illustrious company sailed not to
meet at the Counts Palace; and whereas it was forbidden to speak in these occa¬
sions either of war, or of generall assairs; and that Verses, Painting, Musick, Love,
Vertue, and all other things that depend ot an excellent wit, were thofe onely,
Wherew'ith one niight entertain hirasels inthis encounter; the constancy  of Isa¬

beauty of the place also added something to the beauty of the Assembly ; for the
more magnisicence, and making of the better and raore glorious ssioW of their
Jewells, thofe dayes wherein the woraen decked awd set forth themselves all the
wiiuk/vvs were ssiut up,and torches served to light the room, which this day Leonora
caused to be sumptuonsly surni(hed,becausc the company was to be more than ordi¬
nary. The hangings were of Carnation Velvet, imbroidered all over with tears and
spangks of gold and silver ; the bed, chairs, and stools were of the same ; and in-
{sead\ sa Persian Carpet, the sloor was covered with agreat piece of Gold, Silver,
and Carnation Silk tinselh This charaber was lighted with thirty Candlesticks,
whereof the one hals wereof gilt Vei million set with Stones, and the others of
ChrilT:all ingraven, and garnissied with gold.    Round about this Chamber huBg
at an equall distance, great Plates of Gold-sraiths work all set with precious stoncs,
and upon a Cabinet of Nacre and Corall, a great vase of Agate, and two baskets
of Gold ingraven sull of artisiciall Slowers. There were also between these Plates
greatniyrrors, with the Pistures of all the Ladies of thecorapany; and the same
placed in kich fort, as oppofite t&lt;p every myrror hung the Pisture ofa Lady, drawn
in the habit of a Nymph, or a Goddess.   The beauty and magnisicence of^so many
agreeableobjests, did without doubt excite some more than ordinary joy in all
the Assembly ; and in so charming a place it had been very dissicult for one not to
have been wounded with love, which presents not it sels but in the raiddest of plea¬
sures and delights: And indeed Pm^ was more powersully touched therewith
than before ; Heratlofch new slames for HispoUta; Alphonso be^an to look on Lm-

ny u itli whom he had not been already as much in love as was pofsible for him to

for all tuatlb strong in him, as to keep hira srora complaining of this adventure-

not, continued he, because it is an essest of ty£mtlia's chatms, or ofthe change of
my humor; but it is because I seeing never a woman here, for whom I-bave not
already been in passion, I am inforced to conserve that for her still. And certainly

For ray part, said Leonida with her joviall huraour, I will forget is you will, that
ever you were in love with rae, to the end, you may not give any occasion of sad¬
ness to our Assembly: and I assure you that is you could resolve to make a new
declaration of love unto me, I ara deceived is you would not love me more the
second time than the sirst. I have known since, continued ssic, that I was to indul¬
gent to you ; Iconiracndcd the sirst Verses that you raade for rae; I took too
much care in learning a song which you gavcrac ; I danced better with you thin
withall others, and I know not any testimony of estecra and good will which I
did not render you ; in the racan tirae you quitted rae cruelly, to lovc ssic severc
Sophronia, whofe coldness could not keep you srora serving her six days longer than
nic; and Iconsess that I ssiould not be forry to know for what reason her rigors
have chaniied you raore, than ray complyanccs and savors; to the end, that is e-
ver we have such another adventure, I raay govern my sels therein with address.
But I pray you, added ssie, do not content your sels with telling me, that the same
thing arrives almoft to all the world, that dissiculties and obstacles augment Love,
since custom passes not fora good reason with rae, and that all which I can do, is
to sollow it only in apparell. It is certain, beautisull Is&lt;?w^(*, answered the Mar¬
quis, that this matter is a little too delicate to be disputed vrith. you ; but lincc
you have denounced war against rae, it ssiall not be to ofsend you that 1 do answer
you; bear then, is not a satissastion to your coraplaints, at leastwise a resolution
to your doubts. I think, is I understand well that which you marvell at, and that
whichyoucannotcomprchend, itisbut toknow by what reason rigors and neg-
lest do augment love, rather than caresses and savours : but is I deceive not my
sels, it will not be hard for me to demonstrate it unto you. No man is ignorant
but that beauty ingenders love, and so love is no other thing but a desire to podels
beauty, in such fort, that is love bc a desire, it will be so much the greater, by how
much the thing desired ssiall be dissicult in acquiring ; since being once poflestjthc
cause ofthe desire utterly ceases : wherefore it isnot an improper astion for Love,
but soiced and necessary, to be more vive and earness in rigors than savors, seeing
they excite and entertain it.    But to explain my sels raore cleaily, 1 say, that de¬
sire cannot be at rest, because at the sarae inssantthat it arrives at its end, itcealei
to be desire : So that is love bc a desire, as I have already said, what strong^
proof can one have to ssiow that it ceases to be love, than to see it arrived at its
end? But is (sair Leomda) you ssiould not agree that love is a desire,I think atleal''
wise that you will not deny but that it is a sire, since so many have told you, tM'
they burned for you, as you cannot be ignorant of this truth.    But it you conlp^
the essests of it, you will see that I ara not altogether out of reason; sire is» ^
nature so astivc, as it consuraes allthat oppofes it ; is any thing resists it, is^'
stop its paslage, sar from the end which we had propounded, that which scem^
should have served for oppofition, serves it for nourissiment; for in conclusionjhs
is quick and ardent as long as it sinds resistance ; but as soon as it hath vanquilh' &gt;
andthat it hath nothing lest to consonie, it consumes it sels^ndccasesablolutty
to besire, when it hath nothing more to vanquissi.   Is it be then true that love is
sire, it is true that it kindles by dissiculties; that rigors scrve to soment it) 2"
when it happens that it hath nothing lest to surraouiit, it lofes its being ^r V
sire, and ceaits absolutely to be love.   Let us not marvell then any longer, is it" '

ble ever to hope for any but sacile things, mlofingrayhopcllofe the love too
which 1 had stir the cruell one ; and changing of objest, I arrive still at my end,
which is to lovc eternally. Butis this reason which is particular to me, doth not
saussieyou, 1 have no raore to say than this, that as we see Arabsr and the Ada¬
mant, and so many other wonders which are in Nature, working by reasons that
are hidden srora the knowledge of raen, so am I inconstant m that manner, by a

1 will not resist it, and I will indeed acquaint you with one. But whereas the
anger he was in, for that he could not bc amorous in this place, had taken up his
thoughts,hcacquited hirasels of it aster an extraordinary way; yet was it not
without musing attentively on that which he had to say, never regarding Whether
allthecompany were in casetohearhiraorno; and aster he had performed all
the ceremonies of a man that prepares himselsfor a long Narration, he began to
speak in this fort.

Behold the end of my History. The whole company then broke out into such a

brought to the hearing of a long adventure, had been paid with so ssiort a Narra¬

<p>sull nicmories of their Heroes, who make narrations,   which cause them to pass
whele daies without eating, and nights without sleeping.  For my part, said the
Marquis, I sound my sels so ill with such another adventure at Asow^co, where I
recounted my sollies ofGenoua to the Princess,  as 1 am sully resolved never to sall
into the like again ;  and I ssiould rather chuse to talk to the beautisull sAmdm
whom I did lovc, and still doe love whether I will or no, than play the Astrologer
a second time. In the mean while Dorta, who was insinitely desirous to speak to 5«.
phrottia of his growing passion, thought there was po better way to make ssiegenj-
rail cpnversation cease, and bring on a more particular one, than to propound the
Musick, for the charming of the Marquis his bad humor.   To which essest then he
told the Count,  that is harmony had at othertimes had the power to appde
the sury of some J   it might easily allay the melancholv ofa man that was not
accustomed to have any, TheMarquis, who could notbe deceived with such like
things, presently perceived Pisr/^s/design; and to vex him a little hc told hini,tliJt
the remedy which hc propounded unto him could not work but upon the melanclic-
lick, andso by consequence , it would be unprofitable for him. But asterhehad
waggissily caused the conversation to endure a little longer,he was the sirst thatprtst
Leonora to impofe silence on the company by a confort of lutes, which ssie hadmade
them hope for. The Count then arofe, and pussiing open the door ofa Cabinet, k
ordained the Musicians to begin. In the mean time the Marquis, who was willing
to oblige Deria, said, that the Ladies were sirst to be placed, where they mightbdi
hear; thereupon he made a dcmy-circlc of chaires some sour or sive paces sroniilis
Cabinet door, wherein he placed all the women, and behind every Lady, he seated
a man, playing the Master of the ceremonies so dextrously, as without any (hew of
assestation in his choice, hc placed Herat 10 behind Hjpolita, and Doria clofmSt-
phronia, who sailed not to muke use of so savourable an occasion :  For aster they
had barkened a long time to an excellent confort of Lutes,  with a silence wortbj
of so charming an harmony, and that he saw how in the assembly each one in pat*
ticular began softly to commend that which seemed to be the moft agreeable indie
Musick, he took thcliberty to say unto Sophronia with a low voice; 1 may not ven¬
ture to deliver my opinion of thofe exquisite lessons I have heard; because the (inill
attention that I have lent unto them , would not permit me to be an equall judgt
thereof. Doubtless the thought which hath diverted you from it,   replyed Soijh
ma turning her head about towards him, was cither very pleasing, or very iiieliii«
cholick.lt was both together, answered Deria, and isl raight presumctoinait
you the consident ofa matter that imports as much as my lise, you ssiould seewidi'

him, whether this secret, is it may bc told me, would be advantagious to you for
mc to know it; and on the contrary, I being of a sex that is accused of being mu*
ble to conceal any thing, whether you are to sear the expofing ofyour scls totlw

<p>these last words, and turning her sels to Leomda ,   who Luc next heron the righi
hand, for to demand ofher how ssie liked the Musick ,  it sell out that in going to
avoid one dikourse of love, ssie interrupted another; For Alphonso , who began al¬
ready to be in a strong passion for Leonida,  had laboured to shevv it her with the
raoft addi el - that poflibly he could. But whereas (he was ofa wily huraor,and would
contrary to that of Sophronia, cunningly conceal things which were near her heart,
by seigning to discover thera ;  in (sead of answering to Sophromaes question ,   ssie
, (aid unto her smiling, and pointing to Alphonjo; this Cavalier hath talked (o much
to rae oflove, as I had no leisure to raind the Musick.  Alphonso was somewhat a-
mazed at this discourse, but seeing that ssic did not bt hold him , either with cho¬
ler, or contempt, he said unto her with address ;   there appeared so much ofit in
your eyes, a.s it would be as dissicult for one not to be taken with it, as it would be
impofsiblc for you to bemoan the evills which you are the cause of   Whilst these a-
miable persons entertained themselves in this (bit, Horatio v/as not sb happy,   for
whatsoever care he took about it, he could not obtain one savourable look from
Hypolita , whuse jealous humor had made her bekeve that hehad beheld Z/sd&gt;«/(i.^
with too much attention, whether it were that he had observed Atphonso,who spake
softly unto her, or had without design cast his eyes that way; but in conclusion all
that (he answered to tvhatsoever he could say unto her ,   was to pray him witha
quipping geer not to be Alphonjoes Rivall,vvho was her brothers sricnd,'for sear lest
the (hare which ssie was to have in all his interests, raight oblige her to break vvith
him. At the sarae instant die confort ceased , and the Count desired the company
to renew their attention forthe hearing of a Dialogue, sung by two moft excel¬
lent voyces; aster which the Marquis, who had set himsels down by Leonora, conti¬
nued the conversation still for some time v/irh his ordinary address;   and then all
this (air Troop departed away,   but with disserent dioughts. PorA« selt hirasels so
cased, for having raadc his sirst declaration of lovc to his^Mistress,   that he was as
much satissied therewith, as ishe had received a great savour from her. But though
■Sophrorna esteemed very ranch of Dona, though he was ofan illustrious race, though
he was beloved of her brother-law,   and that according to  apparent reason she
could not make a sitter choise, yet was there a particular one, and that was hidden
to all the worid, but not unknown to her ,   which raade her sear the sequclof this
padioii. For (he was not ignorant that the Count,   albeit he esteemed of Dorta in
particular,  yet bore an   irreconcilable   hatred to the whok samily in generall
though in his astions and words he testisied the clean contrary. It was in this for?
that this beautisull and prudent maid reasoned with her scls, not doubting but that
Doriaes dikourse was unseigned, because ssie was sofsiciently perswaded that he
would not easily venture to say soch like things unto her, having alwaies made
piofdlion ofa vertue austei^c enough.  On the oth?r side,   Leomda was not  fory

<p>me,  without recounting my adventure particularly unto you, because I alvva"°^
thought that discourses ofthis nature did not please you :   But albeit youhaved!^

are for the moft part all alike amongst worthy persons. and whe rcas time prclse!
me, I will onely give you an accompt of all that hath arrived to me since, but 14
ssiall be in sew words. I served her then vvith assiduitie enough, as you might well
observe; and even to that point as ssie was no longer able to doubt ofit. I perceived
by her lookes, that my person did not displcase her; that my witandmyhumji.
contented hers, and then when i expested some testimony of assestiofiforarccom.
pence of my paines, guess, my dear sister, what it was that ssic gave me, and the
onely one that I received ? Horatio stayed a while, in expestation of Sophroniaet an¬
swer, who presently said untohim laughing, I think, brother, that I cannot with-
out trespasling against good manners ssiewmy sels very spirituall, in gucsling at the
savors which may be done to a Lover ; wherefore it were sitter that you (houldlet
.meknow what this savour was, thanto trouble me to tell it you.  Harkcntomc
more seriously, I conjure you, replyed Horatio,   and know that this testimony cs
assestion, which I have so often received from Hypolita , was not the gi vine me oc¬
casions to see her, or to speak to her in particular; it was not an obliging letter;
it was not a bracelet of her hair; it was not a pisture; it was not assuring me with
her own mouth that ssie did not hate me; but it was telling me, that I did not love
her, and that I loved another. In sine ,  the sirst proof which I had ofher assestion,
was a mark of her choler; and to express my selt more clearly, jealousie alone hath
ssiewed her love tome.  You cannot receive a more undoubted proof thereof, said
5ts^&lt;ww interrupting him: Nor a more grievous one too, replyed .Wor^r/o. For
you must know (continued he) that aster  I haddoneanhunclredincivilitiesto
satissie her, whereof you have many times demanded the cause of me, though I ne¬
ver told it you; yet could I not cure her mind ofthis sancy; And ofall the women
of quality ofGenoua, 1 do not know one, that hath sair hair, which ssic hath notbe-
lievcd that I have been in love withall, Leonida onely rcmaines, who at this present
ssicks in herstomack, and for whom ssic hath ill intreated me to day. Isit be so,
iaad Sophronia, you are to take comfort, and bc caresoll to justisie your sels unio
her; for when her jealousie ssiall want an objest, ssie will questionless be constrayned
to give yoa another mark ofher assestion. Ah, sister, replyed Horatio, you anh.
little acquainted with this passion ! it formes phancasmes, it deceives the sense, it
illudesrcason, and without any ground, or subjest, it leaves not to work in thofe
whom it pofsesscth; it makes them to see that which is not; makes them believe to*
pofsible things; and utterly perverts the understanding. At leastwise, sofar as Ihavt
observed it in others, for I have never tryed it otherwaies,  which certainly tiii
been crueller to mc, than isl had been jealous my sels Bemoan then, my dear siikr&gt;

not know   how   to ease you.   I am easssd already, answered Htratio,hy tscon^'

tase H7P5/;M heard hira witha great deal ofattention, but for allthat he could
not perswade her, for with a piecipkous voycc ssic sad unto him; Suppofo that your
indcavours and services have been powersull   enough to obtain my assestion,   yet
have they not been powersull enough to conserve it; and thereof I could bring you
a thousand testimonks; but whereas they are matters wherein your excuses might
give mc satissastion, and not desiring to receive any from you , I will pot surnissi
you with meanes to doe it; but to convince you, I will onely say one thing, which
admits no reply, and which all your cunning cannot destroy.   Have you not seen
me, continued ssic,  receive the civilities of the youngcst ofthe Sregofes, ofthe el¬
dest of the Adornes, and of some others, without regarding yours ? Have you not
been in some assemblys where that last hath alwaies taken me out to dance,  whilst
I have scarce so much as turned my look towards you ?   Have I omitted any occa¬
sion of testisying unto him, when you past with himbefore my window,   or in all
©ther places where I might have you for a witness,   that his love did not displcase
rae ? No, Horatio, I have omitted none, and the assestion which I bore you,  made
me have recoursc to this artisice, hoping I ssiould know, by giving you some cause
of jealousie, the force ofyour palsion; but I have not seen, though you have seen all
thcsc things, that you had any sense ofthcra ;  and albeit I knew that by this unto¬
ward experience I ssiould be in danger of lofing you, is you were sensible, yet chofe
I lather to resolvc upon it, and to assure my sels of your love, thanto conserve you
with a luke-warm and indisserent assestion. I have ever heard, that jealousie is the
daughter of lovc, yet do I not say that lovc cannot be without jealousie. Question¬
less you will tell me, that by ray own reasons I am unjust in complaining of you,
since it is pofsible, that you may have love without having jealousie. But alas I this
discourse hath not so much as an apparent reason,  neither can I susser my sels to
be perswaded to that which! desire so passionately. And to ssicw you that 1 can¬
not  force  ray raind to deceive my sels, hear a thing,  which hath made me to
think upon this matter. I have been perswaded then, that love alone cannot pro¬
duce jealoulie; and how it is necessary that jealousie ssiould have a mother which
may contribute to her birth; this mother, is I be not deceived, is occasion ;  and as
love without her cannot produce  jealousie, so ssie without love  canot beget
jcalouiie.   This reasoning seemes so powersull to me, as you cannot make any
objestion which it destroyes not; for in sine, you may well have lovewithouc
jcalouhe, when as you have no occasion for it; but I having given it you and
you not having taken it, is to say absolutely, that  you have had no love 'Ah I

<p>more have you establissied my selicity.   You say then, amiable Hjpolita (continued
Horatio^ that   there can   be  no   love   without jealousie, and because Ihave
not been jealous, 1 have had no love ; you ssiall pardon rae is you plcak, is with-
out lofing the respest which I ow }ou, I dare take the libertic to contradict: you"
in maintaining with reason, that the perscstest and sincerest reason is that which
admits of no jealousie.    It is athing known of all reasonable and dis-intcressed
personsj that he who loves truly, loves only to love, and not to be beloved, or ro
expest any recompence ; for that thought is  too base and abjest forso noble a pas.
sion.  Now is the loveof beauty, which is that whereof we speak , springs from
an objest that is pleasing to the sight,  it sollowes, that sb long as this ob¬
jest  seems   amiable   unto   us ,  so long will our love continue ;   and whe-
t'ler the  person beloved answers our assestion ,   or answers it not, this love
shall be still the same  love.    Butthat I may make use of a comparison as well
as  you, a man sees a sair Lady, and  love arises in his heart, is it necessary
for him to examine whether this Lady be ingaged to another in assestion? it is
certain that it is not; and it is everyday seen that love doth subjest us to them
whofe love is ingaged othcrwherc:so that one may wel judg from thenr:,thataman
ought to persevere in his love, though some cause be given hira of jealousie, (ince
when he was not beloved, andthathe was induced to love by the only sight of
beauty, he lest not to be insinitely amorous.    And is I may be permitted to maie
use of History inthis encounter, what syrapathy, or what assestion could that
young Athenian expest,who becarae so desperately in lovc with a beautisull Statue,
and whofe passion was so extreme, as the like was never heard of? It is very cer¬
tain, that he loved only to love, seeing the objest of his passion was absolutely in¬
capable of any correspondence. Now then is it bc true, that a Lover is satislied in
knowing that he loves, hc is raoft assured that jealousie is not of power enough to
destroy his lovc, and that this jealousie is rather an essest of a desestive, than ofa
persest love.    And to speak sreely unto you, tell rae, 1 pray you , who can be so
hardy, aster a worthy person hath had the goodness to receive our servicessavoura*
bly, andto testisie forae assestion unto us, as to suspest ssie (hould have the same
thoughts for another? kh,sair Hjipolita, thegallantry and civility vvhich you
have used to the eldest of the Adornes, could not oblige mc to draw so bad a conse¬
quence against you. And tocomprehendall the rest of ray reasons in one alone,!
am but to say, that he who by his discourse gives some marks ofhis  jealoulie to
his Mistress, names her inconstant, sacile, and almoft insamous:  Judge now,sair
Hypolita, whether thesebe words agreeing with a Lady.    In the raean time kis
moft undoubted, that in what tcarms soever jealousie is exprvssed, it cannot be ex¬
pressed but in this manner: whereas quite contrary,thisconnaence which wehavc
in the person beloved, which makes us to approve of all her astions, is the true
mark of persest lovc,  and indeed merits the moft acknowledgement, is I maybe
permittecl tofay so. 1 havenot suspested you then, beautisull Hypolita, of incon¬
stancy, because 1 have esteemed you very much;  and is I had had as good a place
in your heart, as you have had in mine, you would questionless have done me jo-
sticc, in not accusing rae of insidelity. Hypolita was not forry to sind Horatio"') rea¬
sons stronger than hers, but whereas she was high-inindcd,ssic would not let himssc
that ssie began to repent hcr;but contrarily making ssicw as isssie thought u strang'
her brother (hould leave her so long entertaining Horatio, (he called him, fortii'
ssiessi.oiild be constrained to say something that would bc too obliging unto hii''
And whereas Pslr/'i could not satissie himsels, he came out of his Sisters Cabinet,
and went down to wait on Horatio, whom she could not let part, without behol-
dinuhim in such a fort, as he raight easily  perceive, that he was in better terms
with her than when he came thither ; for it is the custom of thofe that are em]
angry, to be as easily pacisied; to accuse, that one may justisie himsels; and to com¬
plain, that they ULiy be satissicd. Jrttlk mean time Dona had no sooner lek B^^r*-

<p>I must consess, said Dm&gt;, that I never saw a Love-Letter ofthe stik of this
sarae • and how pressing socvcr it be for you to send it away to Monaco, I am resol¬
ved not to kt you have it again, till all our srknds have seen it.    The Marquis re¬
sisted it a while, but at length consented thereunto; and in regard the Assera.bly
met not very soon, the Marquis sent not away his Letter till just the day before
they thought the Princess would have died : So that when La Ra'che was arrived at
Monaco, and entred into the Castle, he was much amazed to see them all in tears.
And whereas in this occasion the Ofsicers had no care of any thing, he went even
tothe Princesses chamber without any impediment; where hc saw Justiniano, hc
notsecing hira, for gries so absolutely pofsessed him, as he was incapable ofall
knowledge, but of that of his own raisfortune.    He could not incUire the sight of
the Princess, neither could hc also keep srora her, sothat hc was in a continuall a-
gitation.    In the mean tirae the Physicians desiring to do their uttermoft endea¬
vour, still caresully observe the estate ssie i$ in, they consult with their books, and
inso desperate a disease they resolvc to have recourl'e unto extreme remedies; sa
that abandoning ordinary Physick, one amongst them, who was an excellent Empi-
rick, raade her take so wondersull an essence, that aster it had caused her to sleep
eight hours, it restisied the blood,' diminissied her Sever, restored her strength, and
put her quite out of danger.   The indisserency ssic had ssiewed at the approaches
of death, scemed the same,whcn as the Physicians assured her that ssie ssiould not die
of thislkkncsa; and ssie gave them greater thanks for their assestion to her, than
for their saving her lise. Howbeit they were not without thank? for this resurre-
tT:ion; for J«y?/«&lt;&lt;«»o received so great a satissastion from it, as he could not give
thera thanks enough of his acknowledgement. His joy nevertheless was mingled
vvith a great deal of bitterness, and his soul was not in an estate of rasting a quiet
plcaliiic.    This while L-&lt;i?(7c*s, whom the Marquis had sent, hearing that the
PiMiceis wasoutof danqer, went to J«/««m«»'s lodging, for to rcndcT him the ci¬

<p>With a great deal of joy. For the Princesses amendment had put hermind into s
savourable a pofturefor him, as ssie told la Roche that ssie would return an answ

<p>JEmilias Letter to the Marquis.
</p>
<p>IT vould be too much vanity in me to pretend unto the obtaining of that from m
which so great a ttumber of sair persons could not oblige you to render unto them, dl
not believe then that I regardyou as a conquest, which I may never lofe, bnt ctntrxtd)
I am resolved to do in this occasion, as great Captains use to do, who, aster they !uve tA-
ken a place which they thinks they cannot hold, set tt on sire, and deslroy it themselves, ts
get some advantage siill by this lofs. And whereas there was never place so hard to k
kept, as your heart, I purpofe, in order to that you have written me, to bring new pmts
unto it, rather than to resolve to lofe you altogether: There will he (hort ly at Genoua 4
sair ktnswoman of mine, whom I conjure you to love, when at you jhall no longer judse mi
■worthy of that honor, to theend that in loftngy-sur love, I may at leastwise comfort mj
sels with your sight, with your conversation, and with your srteidjhip.
</p>
<p>.Emilia.
</p>
<p>This Letter being sealed, ssie gave to la Roche, who presently departed for to re¬
turn unto G(s«o»/s, without speaking to thePrincess; for ever since ssie was out
of danger, the Physicians had absolutely forbidden any one from talking to her,
no not so much as Justiniano, who /aw himsels very soon kept from it by a stronger
reason. For whether he had been too long without eating or sleeping, or diat
gries alone had been the cause of his indispofition, hc sound hirasels within a
short time, in a sickness as desperate as that of the Princess, who not seeing hira a-
bout her, was very inquisitivc to know where he was. The Physicians and c/swi-
lia, who seared ssie would asslist her sels too much is ssie knew the truth , told her,
that J«/?/«/Ww having seen her quite out of danger, and being prest by an impor¬
tant assair which had besallen him at Getoua, was gone thither with an intent to
have returned back again before ssie ssiould have taken notice of his departure,
But when they saw Justiniano's sickness grow dangerous, and that the Princess
was as much troubled with hearing no news of him, as ssie could have been is
ssic had known the condition wherein hc was, they conceived it was sit, searing
the sad event of Justiniano's malady, to acijuaint her with that which they had con¬
cealed from her,    sy£milia was ssie that charged her sels with this heavy Commis*
sion, ssie carried the matter so dextrously, as ssie ingaged the Princess to speak of
Justtniano, and to marvell at his unexpested absence, and so unthought-of a silence.
It would not bc hard for me, answcrcd Emilia, with a sad countenance, totake
you out of this unquietness,   is I di(i not sear to give you another greater than
that.    Whereupon the Princess, leaning with her right arm on the pislow, anj
with her lest hand also drawing the curtain, sixed her look  on «Amilia,m
aster ssie  had been a pretty while without speaking , as it were to divine
of that which she   ssiould  be acquainted   with, ssic said unto her in such»
sassiion,  as ssiewed that ssie would bee obeyed ;   disguise  not the truth unto
me,  let  me know  my   niiserie as   great  as  it  is ,    and tell mc whether
Juslmiano be dead or unsaithsull;   for provided he be neither the one nor the
other, I stiall receive all other misfortunes with a great deal of indisscrencisc
The last cannot be, answcrcd ^y£milia,  and heaven will not permit that the other
ssiould arrive unto you.   But not to disguise the truth unto you , Justmano neve

longer than we thought it would,! held it ray dutv to advertise you ofit.  You ar^
a cruell creature, replyed the Princess, to conceal a diing from me,   which con¬
cernes my lise. And what will Justiniano lay ofthe little care 1 had ofhim ? h is by
his order, answered i/smilia,  that we have caried the business in this fort.    Isyou
will have me pardon you this sault, said the Princess, so order the matter, that
Justiniano may not be surprised when he ssiall see mc.   t/^milta did what she could
then to keep her from getting out ofher bed, but neither her intreatics,   nor the
counseU ofthe Physicians, could alter her resolution. She calls her women, gets on
a night-gown, ancl causing her sels to be held up by the armes, ssic goes to Justini-
«of; lodging, whom ssie sound so changed, as he could hardly be known.   Assoon as
he saw her enter he indeavoured to salute her, but being unable to list up his head,
he was constrained tobe contented onely with turning his eys towards her,aHd say¬
ing to her with a seeble andjlanguisting voice,vvhich could not be heard by any but
her lels, for her women were a pretty way distant from thcni; At length , Madara,
fortune ssiall not separate us, and death is going to doe that, which I expested from
the cruelty ofthe forraer: Nevertheless 1 shall die contentedly, since I have still the
pleasure to see you, provided you will proraise to live for the love of rae, and that
ray raeraory ssiall be dear unto you; For I sind this advantage in death, that it keeps
me srora being unsaithsull to you;It sinissies the combat oflove &amp; honorwhich could
not be vanquished in ray soul; it raakcs nie satissie thera both; and to say all, it sepa-
rates us, but I do not forsake you;and I doe nothing in this occasion,but what I can¬
not chusc b'lt doiThe Princess having her chcekes all bedewed with tears, answered
him sighing,! am not yctso str from the grave,butthat Imay enter into it with yoUsl
is death should carry you thither ;   but isyou doe love me, you will strive to live.
Think not ofconserving your sels,since you have no will to it,but ofconserving me,
and believe not that you can die without mc.    I shave kt you see what gries
can do upon me; and I ssic uld have no need,     either of poison,orpoignard,to
quit me of this lise, for the lofs of you alone woidd sussice for it.   Think not for
all thiii that I speak to you thus out ofthe sear to dk, it is an apprchension which
IS not my soul, and I doe not sind death drcadsull but in the person beloved ; let me
not make tryall then ofso ssiarp a gries;   live,  is k be pofsible, and contribute at

that Pjn^ having understood ()s his Sriends sikness, was arived at the Castle, and

<p>melancholy too; and their conversations, which weie wont to be sull of nothi
but love and gallantery, were wholly now of the inconstancie of things; ofthen ^
cessity of dying, and of the little lastingness of the moft assured pleasures.   Thev
could not mervail enough, that aster so long an absence; aster the escaping fromso
many misfortunes; aster the drying up ofso many teares; and when it seemcd that
nothing could oppofe J«/'«/&lt;?w(?sj and Is.tbellaes content, they ssiould sind them-
selves more unhappy than before: they knew not for all that how sar their unhappj.
ness extended, for their secret misfortunes were without doubt the greatestand
moft sensible. And when as Juslinianoes sickness wac no longer dangerous, andthat
he had recovered hisjstrcngth, then it was that he was the moft asslisted. For com-
ing to consider the little time he had remaining to  make good hij word whichhe
had given Soliman; and that he  was to quit Isabella, his gries became so great, as
had not his soul been already long accustometi to melancholy, he could not with'
out dyirighavc supported so grievous an apprchension. But a little while aster he
had begun to goe out ofhis chamber,for to repair to that ofthe Princess, beingstill
very seeble and languissiing, hc said unto her withagrcat dcalofpain;Now, Ma.
dara,  is the time wherein you are to dispofe of me,and to let meknow, whedier
I am to be wanting, cither to my love, or to my honor; live with insamy, ordic
with glory; satissie Soltman, or oblige hira by the breaking ofmy word to ruine
ROt onely allthe Christians that are inhis Erapire, not onely all Europe, butyott

ready told your exccllencic, what \ ought to doc in such a grievous case, ad-
vise thenwhatyou will have me to doe; But 1 beseech you,  make me no more
such   propofitions, as an excess of gencrofitic would render unjust; hearken to
nothing but reason inthis incounter; do not sollow that which your alSestion
inspires you with; and remerabcr how I ought not to do any thing that is unwor¬
thy of the honor which I have to be beloved ofyou. Ihave told you already,re-
plyed the Princess, what power I have over my scls in this occasion; and my pro¬
pofition seemes so just unto me,  as I can sind nothing that can destroy it; Forio
sine, you will satissie Soliman, and you will satissie mc also; I will doc nothinga-
gainst ray honor, and I will satissie that which I ow to our assestion: Resolvc tb
to raary nie and to part away,   and   never hope that I will change my deiign.
When you were at Censtantinople, did you believe that I had so little assestion, las
I could easily resolve to receive a visit srora you, for to be deprived astcrwardiof
your sight, it raay be for as long as live ? Ah / Madam, said justiniano interrupting
her, I had no other intent in parting from Consrantinople, than that of seeing you,
and of coming hither time enough to keep you from ssiuttingyourselsupina
Cloister. For understanding the resolution you  had taken for it, upon the belies
you were in of my death, nothing could have been able to retain nic. What, saiJ
I, the incomparable IsabeUa ssiall make her sels an eternall prisoner for thee, andit
fortune ever restores thee thy liberty, thou ssialt sind her without hers! Ah! nOjnO)
rather doe any thing  to hinder it. It was in thisfort. Madam, that 1 reasoned
with my scls; and that,togcther with the hope of seeing you, raade me, withouirt"
amining the raatter, take my resolution.  And I believe! have acconiplilhedtbit
which I propoundetl to my sels;  I have seen you,   Madam ,  and having let^*i
know that I am living, it is no longer in your power to dispofe of your sels, seeing
your word keepes you from it;   And for me, I proraise you is I cannot break my
chaines at Censtantinople, the newes ofmy death shall soon set you at liberty:  so^

reed The conversation ofthese two Lovers sinissied in teares andhgh s; and
each of thera esting in their sirst detcrraination , Juslmiano retired to his chamber
but in such dispair, as never man was in more. At length aster he 1^/^ '-onssiated

the Princess would never permit him to part without her; neither would have lum
break his word with Soliman ; and which too he could not indure to do; ne con-
clucled ro "o away without bidding her sarewell : And to savour his intention,

<p>store hn- to her health; That whereas he was resolved to perform this pilgrimage
unknown,and that this voyage could not be but long, he conjured him to take care
ofthe Princess and her assairs in his absence;   That in the mean time he ssiould not
speak ofthis design, till he was gone;   and that then he (hould deliver his com-
t.k'ments to all hisSriends.   He told hira moreover that he was obliged to steal a-
way from the Princess,   who would not have him make this voyage without her;
but beine loth (he ssiould be expofed to the incomraoditles ofso painsull a pilgri¬
mage, he had concluded to part without saying any thing to her, but onely leaving
her a letter. Dona was strangely surprised with this discou rse; but seeing that Justi-
matio spoke seriously, he ofseied( how araorous soever hewas of Sophronia ) to ac¬
company hira in this voyage ;   and the contestation which they had upon this sub-
iec^ had not ended sofoon, had not Justiniano told hira thatthe neccssity ofhis as-
sai I cs required it to bcso; and that to render him a proof of his assestion it would
sofsice he (hould suinilh him with raeanes to get from Monaco secretly.  That will
not be hard for you to do, answered Doria, for yesterday,when 1 arrived at the Port,
Iheard by chance ofa Srench barque, that is hound for Venice, which parts away
to morrow morning by the break of day, and no doubt will receive you, assoon as
you (hall present your (els; so that you ssiall have no raore to doe,   but to get abord
her, and i will stay here to deliver your letter to the Princess. You will be but un¬
welcome to her for it, replyed Justiniano ,   who was not willing thac Dona ssiould
be present at Isabellaes receiving of a newes , which would so much asslist her,  for
sear lest the constraint (he would be in, ssiould raore augment her gries.  He prayed
him then not to see her, till hehad her permilsion for it. And whereas he deman¬
ded ofhim, who ssiould wait on him in this voyage ? Justiniano answered him, that
one ofthe conditions ofhis vow was, to goe alone and unknown.   Dona oppofed
this as much as pollibly he could ,  but vain was it for him to give any counsell to
his Sriend; andj Hiliniano,taWm^ a part of the money which he had at Monaco, de¬
sired/o/-r.no kt him goe and write, and to get him to bed.   Aster that Vmahad
obeyed him, and that a\lJ:*stinianoes people were gone out ofhis chamber, except
it were oir,  whom heh.id commanded to tarry in a withdrawing room till hc
called him, he leaned on a table, and looking on the paper whichhe sound there ,
but without marking that which he looked on, hc palsed up and down in his mind
all his past misfortunes, all thofe which then he resented ,   and all thofe which he

<p>NOt having been able to surmount your gtnorofity, either with my tears, or ^ah

to absent my sels from you , without having so much as the consolation to bid you ^jss^
and to let you see by my tears what the gries is which I sujser.    It  is so great, M.ulm
that la sing the use bath of sight and reason together, I am compelled to shut it up in js.

</p>
<p>Aster that y«/?/&gt;i/Vr«o had made an end of writing, and sealed his Letter, hecal.
led that servant, which he had stayed to wait on him, and willed hira to deliver it
the Princess three hours aster his departure.    And when this man demanded of
him whether he would not go to bed, Justiniano made a sign to him to be gone,
seigning as though hc had somewhat els to write ; but it was indeed because his
gries was so great, as not being able to sleep, he thought that the agitation ofhis
body would ease that of his mind.    He past the rest of the  night in walking up
and down, with so great an unquietness, as one is not able to describe that which
he resented.    Hc oftentimes opened the window to see whether it were day; and
though his greatest raisfortune was to part from Monaco, yet one would havesaid,
that he was impatient to be gone from thence; so much was his soul troubled,aiii
so much was his reason consounded.    In the raean ti:ne Doria, who had not (lept
all the night, hearing Justiniano walk, (for his chamber joyned to his) caused hira¬
sels to be made ready, and entred into his sriends, just as the day began to break.
He would yet have disswaded him from this voyage, and once more desired him
to let him accompany hini,but Justtniano would by no means accept of so obliging
an ofser; so that Dorm seeing his sriends resolution, was constrained to sollowhis
pleasure.    And whereas thessiadows of the night were almoft quite dispersed by
the approach ofthe Sun, Doria went and treated with  the Master of the Srtuh
Barque for Justiniano'^ passage,who sollowed him to the Port, his sace covered wiib
his cloak.   The Guards of the Town and Castle, who saw him go forssisoearlj,
marvelled not at it, for during the little time wherein he had been well at Mmio,
he had used to walk out at such hours to entertain his thoughts at the Sea-side. The
separation of these two sriends had been with more tcnderness, is Justtniano bad
been less asslisted; but love so strongly pofsessed bis heart, as there was no more
room lest there for sriendssiip: so that when he came to imbrace Doria, all that be
could say tohim, was to conjure him to have a care of the Princess.   He would
sain have disclofed the truth unto him, but/y^^s//4 having forbidden hiniluw
do, he durst not disobey her.   He got aboard then being scarce able to speak, and
sussering himselsto bcclispofed of by them that receiveil him, he abandoned him¬
sels not so much to the Sea, as to his gries   The Pilot having order given him to
part, stcered his coursc for r^wc-s, and Justiniano standing up beheld Monaca,'^\^
his arms acrofe, and his eys sull of tears, never marking Dorta, who still niadeligns
of sarev;ell to him from the Port, whereunto he leturned no ssiew of answer at all.

<p>But when Tm^ had loft the sight of him, hcwent back unto the Castle, with a

<p>ing) Ought not I to have had him watched &gt; Had 1 not made sussicient tryall ofthe
stedsastness of his resolution &gt; hehad resisted ray intreatics, he was not moved Widi
my tears, he would not hearken to ray sighs: With what stronger arms could I
hope to vanquilh hira? but now is no time to reason of things done ; Justmiarof
is-(jne,andhow strong soever ray love is, I may not forget mine honor; I can¬
not resolve to sollow hira as a forsaken one ; he separated hirasels srora rae that hc
might be generous; and that I may not swerve from vertue, I will not sollow him.
But what say I, unfortunate as I am? is 1 know not where he is, how can I sollovr
hira? Then suddenly holding her peace, and turning her sels on the other side,
ssie sighed with so much violence, as it was impofliLle for her to speak.    A little
aster for all that (he sell to speaking again in this fort.    Ah, Justintana, (said stie)
what a sensible outrage to ray assestion was this excess of love, that hath torn thcs
from rae ! the tempess whereunto thou expofest thy sels, is to be less seared, no
doubt, than thatwhich is raised in ray soul.    Is it pofsible (continued ssie) thac
thou couldst resolvc to resuse the having of rae fora companion of thy miseries ?
Certainly thou didst not believe that ray soul was strong enough ;  and thou
thcughtcst peradventure that I did not intreat thee, but tobe denyed.    But 1  ara$
crucll Csaid(he)tomakcso ilaconstrustion ofthe meaning of the moft generous
of men ; who deprives not himsels of me, but for the love of me; who consider
none but my intei esls, and who loves not even his own honor, but for my proper
I'Jory.    Let us think better of Justiniano ; let us live to obey him ; and let us not
give tortune that advantage, to have more cruelty, than we have constancy: Let
us force her by our rescjlution to be weary of hurting us, since indeed there is no¬
thing Jest us but that to do. Aster ssich;d been a pretty while without speaking,
andthat (hehad hidden his Letter, ssic sent for Doria to consirm that unto hini
vvhich had been told hira by his sriend. And whereas (he had a great and generous
loul, stie compofed her countenance so well, and so throughly restrained her tears
.IS no more forrow appeared in her sace, than that which the absence of Jttsliniana
alone might well be the cause of Is not your sriend crucjl indeed (said ssic to DonA

<p>sess. Madam, when I knew that his voyage was absolutely necessary, seeing hc had
promised it, and that he did not steal away from you but to keep you from sollow¬
ing him , I sound that hc had reason for it, and I served hira in his design; Yet was
it not till I had sirst ofsered to accorapany him, with allthe tcstimonies of assestion
I could render him; and I hid added force to intrcaty, had hc not assured methat
he ssiould not acconiplissi his vow, is hc went not alone and unknown.    But is it
pofsible that he is gone, said the Princess ? disguise not the truth unto nic, is he not
concealed in some place, totake order for his assairs? No, Madam, answered D,;.
rta, for he hath given me the charge ofthcra. Is that beso,   said thePrincess, who
wotdd sain have been at 1 iberty to ssied teares, I hold it sit that you ssiould goe and
publilhatCsTw^.i the true cause ofhis absense, for sear lest so unexpested a depar¬
ture ihould cause bruites to run about, either to his disadvantage, orminc. But be¬
fore you go, tell me I pray you, whether Justiniano were asslisted indeed to quit me?
whether he said any thing to you to tell me ? and what were his last words ? They
were all for you, replyed Dona; for aster he had imbraced me, all that he could ob¬
tain ofhis gries was no other than force enough to injoyn rae to take care of you;
so that Madam, you may dispofe of me as you please , and believe that never any
cloignment begot so great anasslistion,as that which I saw in Justiniano: And knew
1 not that he loves you more ardently,than ever person did love, I ssiould hardly be¬
lieve that absence alone could cause so great a displcasure in his soul.  The Princess
selt her sels then so pressed with gries, as it was impofsible for her to retain her
teare.s, and seeing that ssic could not hide them from Doria,ihe said untohim wiping
her eyes; You may not think it strangc, that I am not more constant than y»/?/w,«,
since 1 am as unhappy as he; and that I yeeld not to hira in assestion.This weakness
justisics his, said Doria, and I profess he were unworthy of the honor which you do
him, ishe did not resent, ashc doth,   an absence that separates him from the onely
person which can make hira happy .The princess and Doria had forae more such like
discourses, but at last ssic prayed hira once again to return with all speed to Cww;
and for that essest ssie coramanded a Vessell ssiould be made ready to part away pre¬
sently aster dinner. The thing was executed accordingly, Doria departed from her,
and by her direstion carried back with hira a part of Justtniano''s train, the Princess
retaining the other in her service till the return of their Master. The next day V'-
ria arrived at Genoua, where he delivered the departure of Justintana to all his ac¬
quaintance. Every one received this luwes with mervail,but amongst others &gt; ibs
Count, jllphonso, the Marquis, and all the rest ofhis Sriends,   were not ct)ntciwd
with merveling, they were extremely asslisted at it.   And being all met togctherat
Leonora's:, they talked a long tirae of this adventure;  nowthopgh they doubtednot
bi t that it was in the manneras Doria recounted it, yet was not their reason forall
that satissied. They sound somthing that was strangc inthis voyage ; and condcm*
ned Por/rs tor sussering him to ^o. Leonora and Sophronia were not of that opinioH)
and maintained that he had done well, in not hindring him from accomplil"!"?
that which he had promised. For ray part, said the Marquis, I do not condemnP«-
ria, for it may be isl had been in his place, I ssiould have done the same thing; but'J
I had been in Jnstinianoes, whenas the Princess was sick, 1 am very sure that! (honW
not have sought for remedies sofar of;   and I would have chofen a pilgr'"'^S''
where ssie niight have easily sollowed me, to the end I might not have bceus^P^^^'

<p>Hat wc may not aggravate the gries of Justiniano, since it is not the last
that hc is to endure, let us land him at Venice, without describing his
unquietncs!,his forrows, and his transports. As soon as hc was arrived
thcrc,he had no other design but of thinking of his departure from
thence: And whereas there was a great commerce from Venice to all the
Hands of the Archi-pelago, &amp; to Censtantinople it sels, it was not long before he met
with a ssiip that was ready to set sayl for the Isle of Chio, so that it was not hard for
him to get passage in her upon pretext of forae iraportant assairs, which hc said
he had with certain Jew/JI? Merchants of Pera. He irabarqued hirasels then with¬
out beinc' known, and too profperous in his Navigation, by reason of his cloign¬
ment srora Isabella, he arrived at this Hand; where he was not long before he
soundaVesiellthat was bound for jP^r^, and ssiipping hirasels in her, he lest the
He of Mtttlene on the right hand, and on the lest that of Lemnof, now called Stali-
ntena.    From thence he entred into the Strcight of Cj^/Z/^o//, where stand the two
Castlcs of Sestof and Abydus, which the Turki name the Dardamlli, and so came to
the Profantis , calkd Marmora, where he entred into the Bofphorus of Thrace, and
arrived at Pera, where he would not go on land till it was night, because of the
habit which he wore. As soon then as he came thither, he went to the Christian
Religious men that lived there,who were insinitely glad to see him again, for he
wasa mighty support unto thera. Aster their sirst conipleraents, they told him
that his absence had occasioned forae raischiesi in the Ottoman Samily; but though
he pressed thcni much to express therasclvcs more clearly, they would not do it,
knowing hill well the extreme assestion which Jusliniano had always born to Mus¬
tapha, and tht e^cntv ous danger. And then a^ain Justiniano had his mind so silled
with his own misfortunes, asheinsisted not much upon thofe of others.    From
thence he lent secretly to an Italian Slave, whora he had lest at horac , to bring
him a Turkish Uahh: Which was done accordingly, and the next day in the even¬
ing hc entred into Constant mople, but so altered from that which he was wont to be,
ashc was hardly to be known.   As soon ashc was at his Palace, and that he had
received the complements ofall his Ofsicers, of whora hc was exceedingly beloved,
hcwcnt tothe .9^r^^//o, although it was not the custom to enter there at soch
like hours: but Justtniano, whom henceforward we call Ibrahim , reraembrcd his
old privileges still.   ThzCapigis, which kept the gate, repulsed him somewhat
rudely,but as soon as they heard his voice, they craved pardon of him, and a Capi-

<p>him, could not have made him answer him that spake to him ; But the name of I
Bassa was not so (oon come to his ear ,    as approching to this blcssed Messcnp^'
which brought him so pleasing a newes, he demanded of him, is it were u-
that hc was returned,   why he did not come in as he was wont to doc   with'
out   advertising   him   ofit? This demand   was a commandment  to the C ^
pigibajst, who presently caused/^r^/j/'w to enter.    Assoon as he appeared Soltmi
charged everyone to withdraw, so that seeing himsels at liberty, he inibraccdhim
with so much tenderness, that though his mind was wholly taken up with love and
his miseries, yet sound he himsels sensible ofso great an amity. Is it poUiblc   sajj
Soliman untohim,  that I ssiould receive this consolation in my misfortune? but
am I not to blame, continued he, to doubt that thou couldst not be generous e-
nough to come back again ? This doubt would questionless bc an injurie, replyed
Ibrahim, had it not proceeded from the impatience of ray return, rather than from
a distrurt ofthe promise I had raade to thy Highness. It is not without reason, siid
Soliman  interrupting hini',  that thou thinkest I have desired it, for assoon as thou
hadst abandoned rae, vistory, fortune, and vertu^abandoned rae to.   I became at
once, both the moft infortunate,   andthe raoft saulty of all raen; and by the malice
of another I loft all that thy sriendssiip had acquired rae. I am no raore the Solimn,
whora thou thoughtest worthy of thy esteem, and to let thee know the deplorable
estate wherein thou sindest me, I have no more to say to thcc,but that thou (halt never
understand from my mouth the milhaps that have besallen rat, or to say better, tbe
crimes which I have comraitted. However! will impart unto thcc,   that all dijt
which my armes had conquered in Persia, by thy valor andcondust, is revolted)
that Assyria and Mesopotamia are no longer under my power ;   that Ulama having
been wounded, his Troops have been deseated; that my whole army hath beenrou-
ted; that Tauris is loft; and that there is no more lest rae of all thy conquests, than
thebarercraerabranccofthv vistories. But, ah, how happy ssiould Ibc,  is Ihad
also loft the nioity of mine Empire, and hadnot made ray scls unworthy of reign¬
ing over the other ! 5^Aw^» stayed he re to setch a great sigh; and when as Imim
would have answered him, he would not susser it, but conjured hira nottofpeak
at all to hira, save onely to proraise that he would never hate him ,   whatsocvcrse
understood ofhis violences. Ibrahim was so surprised to hear Soltman speak in diis
fort, as he scarce knew what to answer him. For whereas he had not reslested niudi
on that which the Religious men of Pera had told hira,  imagining it bi
been some dissension-,   which the artisices of Roxelana had  sown in die Of-
toman samily ,    and none of his Ofsicers having dared  to acquaint himwitli
that which had past,   hc could not conceive how Soliman ssiould bcso huhs.
He  an( wercd him then, that he would give his own eyes the lye, even when they
ssiould report unto him that he had committed a crime; that he was too well alTu'
red ofhis just ce and vertue to doubt of it;  that great Princes raight sometira«
appear culpable to the eyes of their subjests,   and yet be innocent in their own
soules; and that   in sine, hc gave him the same word,which he had so exastly obser¬
ved, that he would alwaies have the sarae thoughts for hira, as hc had formerly bad.
He besought him withall not to conceal his   misfortunes srora hira; but ^&lt;'/'»*'
halscorafortcd with the promise he madehim,   desired him not to press him W
it, and surther obliged him by oath, not to speak of his crimes whenhedioP
come to know thein;  and should onely believe that Roxelana was the causeoti"
his disasters. Ibrahim, seeing how sensibly  Soliman was touched, and perceiving
V. cli by his teares that this ssiould be forae lamentable adventure, durst not speal^}^
hira more ofit; and though  he had resolved to cast himsels at his seet, wbenu™
he came before him, to demand his libcrtie of hira, hoping he  had thenw^"
in some fort accustomed to his absense ;  yet held he not thata (easonablcunis)
a.id that he wasto   wait for another occasion.  This thought redoubled his gs'"^^
yet .noie,so as that joyned to the melancholy    which  his displea-sures and nil"*

was Axiamira, though he had beleeved her to be dead ; and having named ber

learn no more, got him to bed with somuch asslistion, as he could notsleepall
that night.    Assoonasit was day his Palace vvas sull  ofvisitants;  the M^r-
hei of Romania , that of Amasia, the Boftangibasti, and all such as were of any
rank in this Empire, presented themselves at Ibrahims rising.   Aster the sirst com¬

Neither durst Ibrahim speak to them of it,  having perceived vvell enough,
by  the  consused  relations vvhich  had  been made  him ,  that Solimm vv«

This conversation then vvas spent vvith constraint enough; and the hour of tis

1 have told yol heretofore, I know this History very well. For besides the prin¬
cipall things, whichnoraanis ignorant of, I am privy to some particularities,
that are not known to allthe World, and that by the informationof a Slave,
who wa^ Sa.x-elanaes savouriteduring that time, but was asterwards turned out ot
the Seraglio by her hersels, in a phantasticall humour, which makes her that ttjc
never loves any one thing long , and hath ever since lived with me. You ssiall

and some others who were well acquainted therewith : But in regard you have
time enough to spare, I will intermix the History of her Sather, which will not
beunusesull forthe intelligence of hers. Axiamira consenting to it caused Se¬
lixana to sit down by her, and Halima began to speak in these terms.
</p>
<p>Ihe History of Bajazet dnd Roxelana.
</p>
<p>THey which know the biith, breeding, and sirst inclinations of Roxelana, cin^^
not marvail at the last things which ssie hath done ;  but contrarily they
would have reason to sind it strange, is ssic had not undertaken any thing to sa¬
tissie her ambition, which is the onely passion that reigns in her soul, and for
which ssie sctsall therest on work; never making use of lovc,hatred, envy,and
jcalousie, but to satissie that.   Now to ssiew you that ssie hath drawn this inclina¬
tion from her Sather, who brought, her up, and consirmed her in the opinion,
that greatness was the soveraign good of this lise; and that to attain unto it,
vertue and honor were to be despised.    You arc to know, that In times past Roxe-
i/»&gt;»4« Sather was in reasonable good savour with the Emperor Selini, Sather to
Soliman; and that aster the death of Selim, Soliman also had agreat care of his
fortune: And certainly he had rendred hira oneof the inoft considerable ofthis
Empire, had he had as much sidelity for his Master, as he had address for to please
him, cunning to conserve hirasels^ and dissimulation tocoilccal his vices from a
Prince vvho never had any, and who was never carried to any violence, but by
that of lovc.    But withall it raust be acknowledged, that this passion hath often
pcrvcrtedall his inclinations;   or at leastwise hath forced him to do things quite
contrary  to the sense of hissoill, when as it is peaceable.    But to come again
to Bajazet (so was the Sather of Roxelana called) aster he had by an hundred ar¬
tisices, which would bc too long to recite, arrived at that height about Soliman,
which 1 have told you;  and that there was not any charge whereunto he might
not have raised his hopes: It hapned for his ill fortune, that Soliman senthini
to cany his direstions to Scutary, y\here the Beglierbei of NatoUa, who was
there at that time, coramkted to his condust the sairest Slare th*t ever was sccn,

<p>worthy to be of the number of thofe that are destined to be his wortich   he ssiould
receive her into his Seragli9.    Bajaz,et accepted of this iriiployrtlent with lo?
without any other design at that time, than to do athing v?hi?h he'thought would
notbe disagrceable to Soliman, who was then in the prime slovsrct* of his age   and
one of the goodliest Princes of the World.    But vyneri the day of his departure
was come, and that the Beglierbei- of Natolia^ had put the Slave into his hinds
who, asccording tb the custom of thofe which are to be presented to the grand Sie-'
nior, was moft gorgeously set forth, he was so miglitily taken with the sparkling
ofher eys, as is the Beglierbei, who was named Amurath, had nottdliiscarriaet he
might wel have known that he vvas too sensible ofthe attrasts of beauty,to be made
the condustor of a slave,that was able to subjest the whole world; for a's 1 have heard
say,ssie wras as sair as Roxelana,vihoml have foraerimes seen on the terrace ofthe 5s-
raglto,which looks on theSea,where ordinarily ssie is, when publike rcjoycine's are
celebrated.But certes it niust be acknowledged, that Soltman is excusabk forlovin?
hcr,maugre her artisices,for indeed ssie is the greatest beauty that imagination it sels
is able to conceive.    This Slave, of whom I speak, being then as sair asl describe
her to yoii, and being remitted unto the condust of Baja-tet for so long a journey
he became so desperately in love with her, as notwithstanding the respest whidi
he owed to Soliman, and without sear of the chastisements ofan ofsended Prince,
he resolved to pofsess her, and not to render her unto him; howbeit he resisted so
dangerous a temptation for some time; but hi s wit^ that was but too sertile in in¬
ventions, having fornissied himsels with one, which he believed was good enough
to make his design seicceed without danger, hc thought of nothing els but of ex¬
ecuting it;  and behold the way which hc took to bring hirasels to it.   This Slave
destined to the grand Signior, had been sold to Amurath, the Beglierbeiof Nidtk,
a little before 54i&lt;?x.ss's arrivall, by ccitain Pirats, who not so much as knew of
whence ssie was, though by her pronunciation- it was gathered that ssie was! of
Persia: but whereas her language was not understood of any one, and that it ap¬
peared also how ssie understood nothing that was said to her, he judged that (lie
Knew not they were carrying her to the grand Signior. So that using her with a
great deal of kindness during all the voyage, andtestysying much assestion unto
her, ssie seemed to be comforted in her misery, at leastwise ssie ssiewed a more aiiid
countenance. He took exceeding care then, that ssie raight not understand by (ignsj
that vvhich ssie could not undcri^and otherways;and whereas he had been sent u^it
a secret exped'ition,he was but little accompanied, which served very much coolscs
the surthering of his design.    When as they approached to ConstantiuopUjhe took
his nieafores so right, that arriving too late, he sectned to be constrained to lie at
.in house that he had some sour or sive miles from the City, where out of jealoulie
he ha:dcaused a young woman to be kept, whom he had exceedingly loved; i«t
indeed his intent was, not to enter into Coftstantinople, for a secret reason wMetH
.ini g&lt;!)ing to acqi&gt;aint you with.    He arrived then at this Countrcy-house, where¬
in nohe lived but that woman, an old Eunuch that looked to her, and two sli'"
that waited on her, alibis retinue being at his house in CanstantiMple, whereaceor'
ding to the permission of our Religion he had also two wives, with whom the iis
ptvioui Alicola(so was ssie named that abode thQsin the Country}couId never agi&lt;s'
She was beautisull, and ofa great spirit, but had such a disdainsull look, andso
ambitious an inclination, that there Was need of Ba]a^ets humour for one ta b*^'

that produce a reciprocall assestion ; for howsoever he had endeavoured to mw^

hands, yet could he never do it: vvhethcr it were that ssic had a naturall ajreriioj

from Mat olia, they cannot so much as suspest that you arc not the Slave whom thev

which she never takes ofs but when ssic is alone 5 so that according to this order'
they will not wonder to see you goe out in the same fort; and  whereas I purpofe
to have you wear the same  habk   which &gt;^w»r/ir/» gave to that Slave,  they will
doubtless take you for her. And for language, you need not but seem as though you

thisSlavcs is.lt was in this sassiion thatBaiaz^t made an end of consirming ./^//«/4
in the hope of her good fortune. And to say truth,   it must be acknowledged that
thisdesignwas not ill imagined; for he was vcrv sure that vs//co/4 was not known
at all to the great men ofthe Port, so that isit should happen that ajiy oncofthem
ssiould be present with Soltman, when he ssiould present her unto him, that would
not discover him: Neither was he ignorant,  that thofe which give Slaves to the
grand Signior, never see them again aster they arc once entred into the Seraglio,
sothat is Amurath ssiould chance to return unto Censtantinople within eight daies
aster, he could not sind out the  truth;  since the grand Signior thankinghim
for his sair Slave, would not describe her untohim. But hear the success of thii ad¬
venture; The resolution which I have told you of, being taken, 5/ij4-wscallcshis
old Eunuch; recommends sidelity and silence unto him ;  and aster he had charged
him  never to speak ofthe change which he was going to see, he bids him present
Alicoles richest habit to the sair Slave, with all her jcwells, thereby to oblige lier
to part with that which ssie had brought from Natalia,  giving her to undcrstard
by signcs,   that Ba]az,etwould pray her towear that which he then gave her die
next day. The matter was executed as hc desired ,   the Eunuch pcrformeshiscoDi-
million; and as soon as the day begins to break, Altcola attired hersels with care
in the sair Slaves roab,  forgot nothing ofwhat ssic thought would be advantagi¬
ous to her;and covering her sace with a very thick vaH,vvhich reached down toher
wast, ssie sjssred not her sels to bc sccn again, till ssie carae before the grand Sig¬
nior. In the mean time Bajaz,et, before he parted, goes to the sair Slaves chamber,
labours to make her undcrstand, that he will see her again ssiortly,  and that inthe
mean space, ssie may command all things there:   He calls the Slaves whichsened
Alicola, charges them to have the sarae care of the person whom he leaves in their
hands, as they had had of her whom he carries away,  and never to discover thts
which they had seen. He adds promises of recompence to his command, and threat-
nings of punissimcnt, is they were so inconsiderate as to reveal the secret whcrewiiii
they were trustcd. Aster this he causcth Alicola to mount into his chariot, where
for the more respest hc leaves her alone, and sollowes her on horseback, accomju*
nied by thofe which had made the voyage ofKatoUa with him, who never perceived
but that it was the Salve,  for as I have already declared,  seeing her ofthe same

Slave. But behold here, great Princess, the caprichiousoess of fortune,  ^ho mock-
ins at our prudence, raakcs it oftentiraes serve for our ruine.    At ^s &gt; ™r^.*?.^7
liman hath alwaies been very civill,   espccially with women,   he t&gt;cheld^/'r./^
with an attention that gave her hope ofthe vistory: and whereas ssie underssood all
that 5*//&gt;»4«said, although ssie made ssiew that ssie tmderstood not the langiiage ,
stie was ravissied to hear Soliman testisie that he was much obliged to the Beg^erbet
of Natalia, for having tendred hira a present of that importance.     And when as
this Prince gave over speaking, to consider her the better,   ssie imagined that tsof
silence was already an essest oflove.Sothat glorious ofthis conquest, and notable
to retain all her joy in her heart, ssie could not forbear looking on Bajaz&gt;et,as it were
to tell him that her vistory was assured.    This hope proved forall that but ill
grounded, for though Alicola was sair, though ssie was very young,  and that Soli^
man was so too, this Prince, which could never be vanquissicd, either in war, or in
sovc, but onely by gcntleness, selt not hirasels sensible of Alicolaes attrasts. He con¬
siders her, demands out ofwhat country ssic carae into the hands of Amurath, com¬
mends her beauty, professeth that sew desests cotdd bc sound in it, but at length for
conclusion, he tells Ba}az,et, that stoutness did never please hira but in war; and that
there was something in his heart which  did so raightily resist ail the attrasts of
this Slave, as he could not be raoved with her. Alicola,  surprised with this dis^
courscjcould not choofc but strokcher hand over her eyes to assure her countenance.
Baiaz,et on the other side, who had never thought that Soliman could have resuscd a

zed, as he could hardly spesk. Howbcithe had a spirit, that lest him not long in
unquietness; so that striving with himsels, aster he had answered to all the
questions which Soliman had asked hira, hc assured hira that the journey had made
this Slave lofe something of her beauty, and that is it pleased his Highness to see
her again a sew days aster, it may be he would be better satissied ofher.  Never a
whit, replyed Soliman, who thinking that Alicola understood not what he said, dis¬
guised none of his thoughts.    But, continued Baiaz^et, raay I dare, without lofing
the respest which I ow to thy Highness, demand of thcc what I ssiall write to Amw
y&lt;rt^, to let him know what the desests of her are whom he had chofen for thce^
Thou ssialt tell hira, answered Solimm smiling, that ssie looks more like a souldier,
than a woman ; that ssie would bc sitter to condust Amaz,ones to the wars, than to
live in a Seraglio 5 that I ssiould sear her valour would equall mine; that when
I ssiould give her marks of my lovc, ssie would give me some of her courage j that
I hold her more capable to raake prisoners of war, than prisoners oflove', and that
in conchssion, sinding something redoubtable in her eys, ssie hath pofsessed mc
with more sear than desire.    1 leave you to imagine what anguissi the arabitious
Alicola was in, it vvas such, as forgetting all things, ssic purpofed twice or thrice to
have spoken; and had ssie not been retained by the thought,   that her undoing
would have been annexed to that of Baiaz,ets, is ssie disoovered the trick which
they played 5o/;w4», it is certain that ssie had given some marks of her resent¬
ment. And to raake an end of enraging her,  aud Ba]az,et too, the grand Signior
told him,  that to doe an ast of justicc in this incounter,    he would put him in
"^Mhon of Alicola, willing him to hold this present dear; for , continued he    in
this fort I testisie the esteem I raake   of Amuraths liberality; I recompence the care

<p>py as ssie descrves to be, since I bestow her on a man whom I love very much and
that without doubt hath some conformity of humour with her, is her physio'an ,

you may easily conceive, but though this adventure grieved him extremely
was it nothing in comparison of Alicolaes rage, who by the changing of her
colour ssiewed but too much, that ssie had understood what the grand Signior had
sayd, is hehad marked it.    Ba]az.et having perceived her unquietness, beingdcx.
trous, cast himsels at his seet to keep him from seeing her, under pretence of reni
dring hini thanks, and testisicd  a great deal of joy fora thing that troubled him
exceedingly. But searing that inthe end ^//W^s/gries would break forthjhe with-
drew as soon as pofsibly he could.  Scarcely vvas he outof the Sultans chamber
but ssie would have   begun to cry out, and give some marks of her choler'
He speaks very gently to her, represents to her, that ssie would undo her sds jj
well as hira, is by her imprudence ssic ssiould give any notice of their impofture.
She holds her peace, but not so much to obey him, nor to conserve her sels, ashc-
cause ssie was so sussocated with choler and rage, that ssie thought ssie ssiould have
burst with  it.    .P/»j^^&lt;?s re-mounts her into his Chariot, and without goin" to
his house at Conslantinople, he carries her back tothe same place from whence
ssie came.    And whereas hc rightly judged that ssic would not much care to con¬
ceal her sels upon the way, he would take no body with him but he that drove
the Chariot.   As long as the  journey lasted ssie was constrained to hold her
peace, because Ba]az.et, who foresaw that ssic would say strange things unto him,
rode thirty or forty paces behind her ; but when ssie was arrived at her chamber,
and that Ba]ax.et had sollowed her, with an intent to pacisic her, what did (he
not say against him ! against the sair Slave ! and against 5&lt;7//&gt;w^«! I might well
thinkCsayd ssie beholding him with contempt} that a Prince unjust enoughto
lovc thee, would be yet more not to love me; but I take heaven to witness, tnatl
will cease to be Alicola, or I will be revenged cither on him, or on thcc that is
sodear to him. Bajazjet seeing her in this sury, did what he could to appease her;
made as though he had an assestion still toher, and would have perswaded her,
seeing Heaven would not let her ambition be satissicd, to live better with hira
for the suture, than formerly ssie had done.    But ssie, that was not in an estate to
be wrought upon, answered him with somuch pride and insolcncc, as judging
it not sase for him to leave her at liberty in his house, hc quitted her in choler,
and comraanded his old Eunuch  to ssiut her up, and not to let her go out ofher
charaber, what crying or violence socvcr ssic ssiould use.    This order given, he
went to see the sair Slave, whom the Jewels which he had caused to be presented
unto her,   had rendred   more trastable.   The kind entertainment which Ihe
gave him was a comfort to him against all Alicolaes sury j and comraing at M to
consider, that in the manner as the matter had sallen out, he might pofsesse this
slave without concealing her, as he had purpofed to have done ; and that AmnrAii
returning, he raight also see her in hishands without ofsence, since he could (ay,
that the grand Signior had bestowed her upon him, he was more contentedthan
can be expressed unto you.    But to abridge thisdiscourse as much aspodibH
may, you ssiall understand, that Ba]az,ets submissions put him quickly in pofe''

the grand Signior had given him   ab )Ut a year before^ pofsessed him in such

a sair Garden which opened into a Meadow, that had a little Rivcrrunnini^ tho¬
rough it.   This Meadow was inclofed with a wall, as well as the Garden, and the
River went in and out of the Meadow by certain grates, expresly made for that

<p>she was   with BajoAiP ,   he could not tell what to think of this adventure. At h«
iamc instant Ba}az,et'.zppeared, and the siibborned Slave re-cntred into the hous
o assure Alicola thac her note was received. Amurath, salutcs Ba]aut,awdt\\s{-'
Slave lists up her vail, as her husband and ssie had before-hand agreed; for theyhad
been a good while advising as they, came along whether it were sit ssiat Amuth
should see her, or no. Bajaz^et, aster such time as the sair Slavp had learned ^ur hn,
guage, had recounted unto her the artisice he hadused to pofsess her, the better, to
testisichis assestion unto her. Accprding to the resolution they had taken,tlicn (he
pulled up her vail,and said unto hini,that ssie reraembred well he had redeemed her
from the Piratcsjthat ssie owed all her selicity to hira;and that although ssie heldher
sels thehapicst creature  inthe world,  yet  was ssie grieved for his sake, that
her   desests   had   kept   her  from   being agieeable  to   the   grand   Sianioc.
This woman spoke thus with an apparent sincerity , lb well counterseited, 45 it
h.ad been hard not to have been deceived with it.    And that which rendred her(o
dextrous vvas, for that ssie really loved Bajaz.et, vvho on his part made an hundred
complements to Amurath, assuring him that he vvas more   obliged to him, than
to Soltman, for the pofsession of aperson  vvhich vvas insinitely deartohim; iinK
is he had not had the goodness to conside in hira, by giving him the condust ofthij
Slave, he had never been master ofthe happiness which now he injoyed.   Amttrm
answered to all these civilities with more liberty of mind,  than he couldhavc
done, is hc had not seen the sair Slave : For sinding her somewhat altered, byw.
son of her sickness and being with  child,  his renewing slames extinguillicd in a
moment, and tranquility re-cstablissied it sels in his soul.   Howbeit he marvelkd
with himsels,  that Soliman ssiould sind this woman to have a proud and haughty
look; forthough ssiehada great deal of majesty, yet was jt quite contrary to tijit
of-^//«//i; having very much sweetness and modestie in the air ofher sace. Butajh?
knew 5  that one and the same thing is diversly judged of by the raoft part of tk
world, so he made no great reslexion thereupon;  and the sole unquietness about
the note} which had been cast him, could then trouble him. And whereas he had no
more to do in that place,   seeing the sair Slave touched his heart no longer, he
shortned his visit, and aster he had been two hourcs in the haU , talking of therca-
sons which had brought him back to the Port, he took leave of the sair Slave; for
as for Bajaz,ets whereas he had purpofed to return that day to the City, he thought
he ssiould bcuncivill in not going along mith Amurath,  who did his iittcrmoftto
keep hira from it; judging rightly that is they went together,  he ssiould qetreid
his note till he came to Censtantinople; but at length hc was sain to give \vay toiit-
jaz.ets importunate civility.  As they were in the Court ready to depart, ^^t^W
stept in a litlc to say somthing to the sair Slave ,   during the which Armrath stood
looking on the window, from whence the note had beenthrowen hira. And vl«s''
as Alicola was not gone from it, ssic changed her sirst resolution, listed up thegnw,
and ssiewing her sels openly, ssie joyned the charmes of her beauty to her rcqucsts;
for isyou have observed it, all our houses are so low, that slic was not sar d'st^"'
from him. Aster ssie had let hersels been sccn a while, (he salutcd Amurath nitinU
sassiion of the Country;   and with a suppliant behaviour seemcd to demand suc¬
cour ofhim in some misfortune that was besallen her.    Amt:rath sinding htntst
beautisull, made sign to her, that he would do what ssie would have him, notbeiog
able for all that to comprehend ought in this adventure.  But at last Bai]az.tt caiBSj
and going away together, they arrived atConstantinople just as it was night, sc-**
z,et waited on Amuraththome, where having lest him,   he gave hira the libeityw

which in sew woids recounted to him all Bajaz^ets impoAure ;  his lovc tothe
sair Slave; the suppofition he had made to Soliman; his treachery to hira ; aiidnis

ly contented with this coraraission,part3 speedily srora the Beraglio to do things ne¬
cessary for the execution ofhis design; whkh could not be so secret, but ^^-^^ss was
advertised, that hewas preparing of a chariot to return to his house.   l»elirlt
thought that came into his raind was, that Amurath was become inaraoured ot the
sair Slavc,and that he would take her away by force. He departed then m all polhble
hast, with an intent to remove the sair Slave from the house, and it raay beto rid
himselt of Altcola, not knowing in so crofs an adventure,iu what place to put her
for his own security.Novv though he vvas more diligent than Amurath, and that by
a ncaier and a by-way he arrived there a little before hira , yet could he not exect'te
all that he thought to have done; for Amurath, who had not stayed for his chariot,
was gone away with twelve armed raen, sothat he arrived at Ba]az,ets house, a lit¬
tle aster he was entred into the sair Slaves charaber, whom he sound still in her
bed: so that prclsing her to make her sels ready with all speed,   and recounting un¬
to her in sew words the occasion of his sear, hc thought of nothing but of geting
her from thence, and earring her to Conslantinople, where he believed Amurath durst
not enterprise such a like violence.   But he  was very much surprised, when as
his Eunuch carae and told hira that Amurath, who knew not that 54i&lt;!j*sr was
there, required to enter in the behals ofthe grand Signior; that hc   cspyed
through a chink of the door that he was  accompanied with armed men;  and
that to have meanesto advertise hira ofit, hehad told him thathe went to setch
the kcies to open him the gate.    Ba]at.et began then to  change his opinion ■,
for he was sure that Amurath durst not make use of the Sultans name, is hehad
not been authorised for it.Bchold him then in the belies that he was discovered;&amp;
the better to clear himsels therein,  he would have entred into Alicolaes cham¬
ber, whom peradventure he would have killed , but he sound that ssie had ssiut it.
For when she saw thesright the old Eunuch was in, and that she doubted not but
her note  would produce some violence, ssic and her suborned slave had barrica-
doed their door as much as pofsibly they could; foreseeing Well that Bajaz,et would
turn all his sury upon her ; as indeed, he did what hc could to have broken up
the door; but seeing hc could not prevail, and searing lest Amurath (hould enter,
he took the sair Slave, who had made her scls ready in hast, croft thorough the
Garden, to get out at a back Gate, without knowing as then which way to sly;

<p>and the better t^p amuse Amurath is he ssiould sollow them, they shut bofsi h
^ate of the garden, and that of the meadow aster thera.   On the other side V
murath who would   attend no longer, caused the outward gicc to be broke'n o"
pen; and scarcely had Bajaxjet ssiut that of the Garden, when as he was in the house'
Never was there a greater diforder seen ; the sair Slave was all in tears, and sciring
(he ssiould not be able to go, by reason of her .great belly and her mdispofitio„
ssie besought Ba^a^^et to abandon her, and to think of nothing but saving himselt'
But unwilling so to do, he laboured to give her some hope, and to go as sast
as ssie could, untill they might get up both on a horse, which the Have that was
saithsull untohim, was bringing them.   In the mean time ^*«/^ cryed out that
they would murther her, tothe end that Amurath hearing her cryes, raightthc
quicklier enter into the house, and more easily sollow them that were sled.   But
at lask Amurath being got in, and Altcola having opened him her chamber door
acquainted him, how from her window that opened upon the Garden, ssic had seen
Baiaz^t cscape out of a back-gate; and that it were good  he ssiould bc pursued
with all speed. Amurath presently enjoyns some of his men to do sc^; and charts
them, is they met with him, not to kill him, howsoever he desended himsels They
do asthey are commanded, but sinding the gates ssiut, they were a long time be¬
fore they could break them open; so that when they were without any obshcle
they were not in case so easily to sind that which they sought for. They separated
themselves, outof the hope to meet with him the sooner, and omitted nothing
of whatsoever they beleeved might be of usefor this search. Two of them indeed
incountred the slave which had sollowed them, and that was resolved not to re
enter into her Masters house ; howbeit ssie served but to turn them out ofthe way,
which undoubtedly had brought them to thofe sugitives. For not knowing that
ssie belonged to 'Baiaz.et, they asked of her isssie had n^t seen a raan carrying; away
a woman t She nothing daunted told them, that they had past by her a little be*
fore; that leaving the ordinary road they had taken on the right hand over the
sields.    This slave said thus unto them in such an ingenuous manner, as theybt-
leevcdher ; so that abandoning a way which would have made them incounter
what they sought for, they took another which led thera sar srora it.   Aster so
vain a labor, seeing the night approach, without having any hope to perform that
which had been commanded thera, they returned to Amurath, who in giving li¬
berty to the arabitious yl//W4, was constrained to lofe his own, such power had
the charms of this woman over his soul.    For whereas ssie had rcmembrcdhow
disadvantageous her proud humour had been toher, at such time as ssie appeared
before Soliman, ssie constrained her inclination, and adding artisice to her beauty,
ssie wasso pleas\n^to Amurath, as hc could not resist her.   She related to him at
length all that ssic had written to him in bries, and calling him her Deliverer, with
her eyes sull of tears, ssie aggravated all the rigors which Sajaz,et had used towards
her, aster that the sair Slave was in his hands.   She was caresul! to let him know,
that Baiaz,et could never surmount her, either with submissions or menaces; and
casting her sels at Amuraths seet, to implore his protestion to Soliman, lest he
(hould punissi herfor being an astor in the suppofition that was made him, Ihe
moved his heart to pitty; and he hinisels beleeving that this was nothins; but
compassion, sound it asterwards to be love.    But at last Amurath seeing by the re¬
turn of his people that hehad no more to do in that place, and that his Chariot
was arrived a good while before, he placed jilicoU in it, together with the slave
that had been saithsull unto her ; and though it was exceeding late, yet they set
forth on their way towards Constatttinople. Amurath caused also the old Eunch tobe
brought along, that hc might be made to consirm Alicolaes discourse.   When they
had marched a pretty while, the night surprised them ,  which was so obkurc and
dark (for neither Moon nor starrcs were to be seen ) as he that drove the chariot,
having never been at this place before, loft his way in such fort, as aster he had tra¬
velled hals the night in hope to sind it again, he was constrained to send one to his
Master to advertise hiin ofthe sault he had committed. Amurath seeing the Cha¬

raoft past the whole night in this unpleasing stay, and the break of day began al¬
ready to whiten the clouds a littk on the Sun-risin2 side, when they heard the
11 ampling of an horse, and suddenly aster the cry and sall of a woman.    Amurath
being inssantly advertised thereof, thought it mightbe the sair Slave ; they went
then asoot to that part where they had heard this voyce, with as little noisc as
poflibly they could make; it was not long before they heard a man speak, without
distinstly understanding what hc said.    But at length approaching ncerer to th«n,
they heard how that woman conjured hira to abandon her, and to think of nothing
but his own sasety; how he saw well that it was heavens pleasure ssie Ihould bc cast
away, andthat it was irapofsible for him to save her.    At the same instant that
mans horse having got loofe came amongst thofe of the Chariot, who thereupon
made sb great a noise, that ^wxr^sA, who thought it was not sit to give Bajaz^et
(whom he knew by his voice) any leasure to put himsels in desence, advanced for¬
moft vs all to (hat place where he had heard hira speak; but he had not gone sar^
belorc he sound the sair Slave at his seet, though he could not well discern her in
1 cL-ard it was not yet light enough for it; Ba']az.et did what he could to resist them
vliat prest him to yeeld hirasels: And whereas hc knew not certainly whether
ihesc were ^w*ir4s/»jnicnor no,hetold thera that they did not know hira, and
that assiiredly they were raistaken.   But when he heard AmtvMh bid the sair Slave
notbe asraid, for that ssie ssiould have no harm, his despair was then so extreme,
as leaving thofe srora whora he desended himsels, he made direstly towards Amu*
rath; but before he could arrive at him, hewas seized upon behind by thofe three
against whora he had sought, who presently took his Scymitarfrom him.   Behold
him then in the power of hisenemie, as well as the sair Slave : for thinking to
do the hest for their sasety, they hadhid therasclvcs moft part of the day in a wood,
with a resolution to travell all night; but their horse chancing to stumble, the sair
Slave sell, Ai I have declared, and by her crying out discovered where Ihe was. A-^
murath (ccing how li:!cky the lofing of his way had proved unto him, and that itbc-
?an to be light enough to discern where they were, sound he was not so stir from
Constant mop ti as he thought he had been, so that considering hoW he might best con*
ycy his prisoners to the City, he desired Altcola that ssie would make the rest of the
journey on horse-back, to the end he might for his own securitie put Ba]az.et jjnd
the sair Slave into the Chariot.   To tell you, Madam, in what a taking Ba]az.tt

he commanded these ofsendors to be brought before him, which immcdiatdvu'is'

Bajax^et was in a great deal of consusion to appear before his Masier whom he had
betrayed; before a sriend whom he had deceived ; before a woman vvhom hehad
Joved, and that was going to convince him of persidiousness; but that vvhich unit
asslisted him was the gries of the sair Slave    Altcola  was exceedingly vexed
appear before a Prince that had despised her ; yet did ssiecomforther (lls with
the thought that ssie deprived hira of a man whora he loved,    ^wwr.rr/ihadhis
heart silled with his new slames, which made him to bc not without unqiiietnds,
for he seared that Soliman punissiing Bajaz^et would also punissi Alicola, (Ince she had
helped to deceive him.    As for the sair Slave, the sear alone of lolmg Ba\iii:t
made her ssied tears: But at length, they arrived all before Soltman.   And where¬
as none of them durst somuch as list up their eys, it was the Sultans pleasure they
ssiould speak separately; and sirst he commanded Eajax,et to render an account of
his doings. Whereupon salling down on his knees, he spake much aster this man¬
ner ; for I think that I have heard bim repeat it over above an hundred times. As
love only hath been the cause of my crime, so love only must also be my desence;
for, my Lord(said he unto hira) I know but too well, that reason and justice are ab¬
solutely against me. I have contemned the counsell of the sirst, and I have not been
asraid of the second j I have betrayed a Prince, who is not only ray lawsull Prince;
who is not only the greatest Prince of the World ; but who, for the greater ag¬
gravating of ray sault, is a Prince which hath alwaies loved me, and whofe good¬
ness hath beenso great towards me, as it hath scarce set any bounds to my hopes.
Now is aster sogrcat a crime, it is requisite to consider therest which I have com¬
mitted,   I have betrayed a man that consided in me; Ihave abandoned a woman
whom  I had loved long, and have made her pay very dearly for the testimonics
ofmy assestion, with unheard-of rigour ; aud to say all, 1 have abused the sim¬
plicity of a Slave which was destined to thee, and depriving her by my auiEceJ
of the honour of being thine, I have wronged her raore than all the rest.   In sine,
my Lord, which way soever I turnme, I see the  marks of my crime; butisnot?
withstanding it would please thy Highness to consider by what violence my rea¬
son hath been forced to carry me to (uch strange things, thou wouldst doubtless
have some pitty of my misfortune. For is it bc true that we have some conipassi'
onof a man whofe imagination hath been troubled with melancholy, why Ml
we not have it of a man whom loVe hath bereaved of his understanding? What
imports it whether the cause of his solly be interior, or whether it proceeds from
without ^ so it is, that 1 have not sailed, till love had seduced my reason; till! W
loft my judgement, till my will was no longer in mine own power; tillaUmy
desires perswaded me to the crime which I have comraitted 5 till all ray senseiW*
trayed me, till occasion savored my design; and till nothing appofing my selijity»
I had not strength enough to despise it, as I was obliged to doe, seeing I couldnoc

will permit it, all my crimes ssiall be comprised in one alone word, I have loved-
I doe not for all that resuse the chastisement which I merit, and to that end Hay'"J

Amurath put me into his hands,  I knew not that I was destined to thy Highness;
he condusted rae to his house, and retained nie there without ever sussering me to
understand so much;   and having rendred rae all the testiraonies oflove and re¬
spest 3  which I could have desired from a man that had not had me in his power ,
\ acknowledge that his assestion moved me; that I gave him mine; and that inthe
wretched condition, whereunto fortune hath reduced me , I esteem my sels happy,
tobehis wise, I acknowledge also, my Lord, thathe hath consessed his crime unco
me since; but whereas this crime was a testimony of the assestion he bore me, and
that our mariage had made me unworthy of being able to repair his sault , by
restoring me into thy hands, would not thy Highness have blamed me for coming
to accuse ray husband ofa seult, which he hath not committed but out ofan exce^
of love ? Aster this, my Lord,  I do not think thy Highness can doubt of mine in¬
nocencie; and not doubting of it,   I dare hope that thou wilt not punissi me more
cruelly than Ba]az.et, by letting rae live, and putting him to death ;   and that con¬
trarily thou will have the goodness to grant me his pardon. For, my Lord, what
reason would there be, that I who am absolutely innocent,  ssiould have the same
destiny that the guilty have &gt; Is k not enough'that fortune hath forcibly carried
me from out ofthe armes ofmy parents, to put me into the hands of Pirats? that

But to carry presumption as sar as it can goe, or to say better/he considence whidi'

red so much, so thou wilt likewise in consideration ofme pardon hira. But is neve -
theless thy Highness is otherwise resolved, grant rae at leastwise the grace that'll
may die with Baiaz.et.The sair Slave mollisied the heart of Soliman-.and as hee wic
about to have spoken, Amurath made hast to say to him; I know very well that 1 am
the accuser of these ofsenders, and that in some fort too I am a party with them • so
that, my Lord, I am to be their descndor also in this occasion , and doe moft hiim-
bly beseech thy Highness to pardon them : It is an ast worthy of .Se/iw^zw not tobe
revenged on them that arc in his power; and the true selicity  of Kings is with.
out doubt to raake up that oftheir subjests. It will be long of none but thy scls then
is thou be not satissied, in rendering us all sour happy. For, ray Lord, isthoiih'
vest the pofsession ofthe sair Slave to Bajaz^et, he will certainly esteem himselshap-
py, as well as ssie. As for me, my Lord, is the purpofe which I had to tender !thee
a presentjthati thought would be agreeable to thee, merits any recompence, asthy
highness hath bceiie pleased to assure rae, I beg the pardon and pofsession of Alicoht
who by whati have noted in her discourse, is raore sensible of ambition than love;
so that injoyingrby thy bounty, a rank considerable enough about thee, (be will
have means to be satissied, and I too ; seeing I am constrained to acknowkd-e^that
my opinion is not like unto thine, for the beauty of Altcola ; and that I have been
a whole day the moft amorous ofall men.    Salman seeing him about to proceed,
would not permit him, and reaching his hand to him smiling, I am glad ( saidhe.
unto hira) that we are not ofthe sarae opinion for beauty, since thereby I am en¬
abled to satissie thee.    And for thee, said he to Ba]az.et, I rerait the ofsence thou halt
comraitted against nie; but know, that is Love combatted for thee in thy dis¬
course, the goodwill which I have alwaies born   thee hath sar better dciended
thee in my heart.Then turning him to the sair Slave, hc commended her genero(ity,
and the assestion which ssiee caxriedto Ba]ar..ct, alsuring her that he vvould never
trouble her rest.    As for Altcola, he told her, that to render the conquest,which (he
had obtained,  raore wohhy ofher, and more capable of contenting her, he would
make Amurath sy:and visier.    Aster this ihe said to Baiaz,et, hee was forry thatfor
the preservation ofhis authority, and for example sake, hee could not lethirallve
at Constantinople; but in regard it was impoflible the matter ssiould not be divulged
by thofe who had accompanied Amurath, he must needs resolve to absent himlels
from the Port, for  sear least this importunity ssiould give others the boldnessto
commit the like, or greater saults than this.    That he did not condemn himto^o
out ofthe territories ofhis Dominion, but he would have him abide in one ofthe
Islands ofthe Achipelago, and there lead   a private and particular lise.    To rqw-
sent unto you the joy ofthese sour persons, would be an impofsiblc thing, however
so it was,that aster they had rendered a thousand thanks to Solman,andt\\at hehad
made them all recount the severall thoughts  which they had had during t'l-
time   wherein he had   been deceived by them, they departed away.   A0'
rath condusted ^//co//* home to his house, where he married her the next Jjy
and Baiaz,et went to give order for his assaires.    Behold, Madam, hoW thi

of mind that never   abandoned  hira ;  for the raore he sought how to re¬
establissi hirasels, the   kss likelyhood he saw for  it.    In the  raean time the
littk Raxelana  grew   up stisl,  and  ssiee raight bee about  sour  yeares old,
when as Bajaz^et considering her upon a day, in the raidst of a great asserably,
where every one admired her springing beauty, and took pleasure in beholding
her; he heard one ask her what ssic would raoft desire in the world? ssie straight an¬
swcrcd without sticking at it, that it ssiould be to raake her sather rich and power-
sull.    This was no sooner spoken by her, but Bajaz^et coraniing as It were out ofa
dead sleep, took a resolution, which I will relate unto you.    And consider I pray
you, how a weak beginning hath many times a long and dangerous consequence s
the little Roxelana was not more beautisull that day than at other tiraes, howbeit
her sathers anguissi had been so great, as one would have thought he had never
taken notice that ssie was the sairest and wittiest child that ever had been seen; for
as soon as he had opened his eyes, and ssiat the acclamations which were given to
Roxelana had raade him perceive ssie was aMaster-piece of Nature, his heaviness
diniinissicd,and al his industry and care was no onger,but to endeavour to make her
wit as dextrous as her beauty wascharming.    Andtruly it was not hard to bring
her to what he desired; for as ssie had all the beauty ofher raother, sohad ssic
all the inclinations of her sather.   And whereas they are persestly discerncd in
that innocent age, ssie that acquainted rae with all these things, and that lived
with her both at thattirae, and asterwards in the Seraglio, hathtoldme, that in
her  tcndrest insancy, ssie had an imperious spirit, which could not endure to be
controlled by any body. Sae would alwaies be mistris of all the other little girles
that played with her; and her very play was dextrous still, andmalitious.    She
told rae surdicr, that ssic was never sccn to weep, nor ask for pardon, neither did
ever person tesl a lye with raore considence.   She was curious to know all things,
and one of her greatest delights was to see beasts sight together.    This cruesl hu¬
mour vvas for all thatso well concealed, by the gcntleness of her look, as ssie
seeraed to be the raoft amiable child that ever was beheld.    I leave you to judge,

<p>onr, did not make up an accomplissicd work.   He did notteach her to be vem
but onely to bc caresull to seem so.    In her youngcst years he l^oured to sra"^^
her toagracesull behaviour, and to entertain her alwaies with great hopes-   ^
promise her that one day ssic ssiould be rich,and that ssie ssiould have stately Pala'ce*^
to the end that he might insinuate into her betimes, that Greatness was thesev ^*
raign good : and that so desiring it with passion,ssie might be the more easily carded*
asterwards  to do all things necessary for the acquiring of it.    WScn ssiehad at
tained to the age of eleven or twelve years, and that ssie had a forward wit, able to
apprehend his maxims, he began to speak more plainly to her, and to tell her that
being born with no common beauty, ssie was to make hersels an extraordinary
fortune.    But as it was the ofsice of the eyes to obtain conquests, so it was the ofl
sice of the wit to conserve them. That all things which are gained by violence, arc
to be retained by  address.   That it was time for her to learn to kno\^ her
scis, and to know others; to the end that being accustomed to apply her mind to the
divers humors ofthofe ssic convcrsed with, ssic raight one day be capable oV the.
roughly disguising her though t8:that ssie was not to live so out of abase compliance
and with no other design than to please ; but only to attain to forae thing that was
great. With such like discourses as these did Bajaz^et instrust Ro.xelana, whofe incli-
nations were but too much carried todissimuIation.Neverthelessitistrue,thatthese
dangerous lessons, whichssie willingly learned, were combated by the wildom of
her mother, whora I have alwayes called the sair Slave, because my nicmoiy could
not give you her name.    This woman was good and vertuous, and did all that
she could to make Roxelana reserable her, as well in the qualities of the soul, as in
the seatures of the sace : which Ba]az,et perceiving, and having in vain forbidden
her to reprehend her daughter for her bad conditions, besell into such a hatred of
her, as he could not indure her; and having looked upon her in former times
as the objest of his love, heconsideredher no longer but as an obstacle of his am¬
bition. But to keep her from dcstroying that whichhe had establistied in the young
heart of Roxelana, he thought it would be requisite to make her hate her.   And
to that end, he dextrously perswaded her, that her raother standing yet upon her
beauty, was jealous of seeing hers surpass it; that her reproving her, was an clsest
rather of hatred than assestion, and that therefore ssie ssiould beware of hearkning
to her Remonstrances; there needed no more to stisle all the motions of Nature in
so depraved a spirit, and to carry her to insolency.    Roxelana, to obey her sather,
was to do no more than sollow her own humour, but to content her mother, die
was to sight with all her inclinations.    The sirst was the easier, and made her hope
ihatit would produce great things;   andthe other being harder, and withouto-
ther recompence , than that which gives us the satissastion to d-o what we ought;
slie had not much adoe to resolvc upon the despising of vertue, and inibracing of
vice.    Behold her then abandoned toheV own sense, and to the evill counsells of
Ba]az.et, and the sair Slave almoft reduced to be a Slave to her daughter, who with¬

a tryall of what ssie could do in dissimulation, as long as there was any company
with her mother, ssie secmed respestsull, asscstionate, and obedient; but as soonn
they were gone, she mock .d openly at her goodness, and with an hundred bittct
jeers, struck a dagger into the heart of her that had given her lise.    This prudj"

Te was but to explane his intention unto her, and then he ssiould be siire to have it

understood well before, and aster that elevating his voice , and taking hereby the
hand,Thou seest then, ray dear child, said he unto her, that love did heretofore un¬
do my fortune, and that a Slave which 1 took from the grand Signior, took from
me all ray hopes, and banissied rae srora my Country.    But to hnd out ray rc-esta-
blissimcnt by the same way that caused ray undoing, lovc, and a voluntary Slave
stiall restore n^c into grace vvith Soliman.    And not to conceal my thoughts from
thee, I purpofe to present and give thee to the Grand Signior, leaving the rest to
fortune, and thy addrck.    Ik\iow that this Prince being advanced in age, is be¬
come yet raore senlible of lovc,th.inhe was sisteen years ago, when ashc was but

here, K&lt;7.vs/rs«&lt;«an[wered him according to his desire, and assured him, that isssie
could be received into the Seraglio, slic would raake no doubt of the rest: and for
a conclusion, (heso prest hira to part away, that in a little aster having sound out a
Vessell which was bound for Constantinople, he irabarqued hirasels in her with his
daughter, and the slave to whom her mother had rccoranicnded her ; who had so
insinuated her sels into her assestion, as ssie had often believed her in things which
Gontraried her inclinations. At length they arrived at Constantinople, and went to
the house of one of ^rsj^^irr/antient sriend?, where the day being come, in which
he purpofed to prelent Boxelana, her slave helped to dress and set her forth, being
glad to see her going out ofthe hands of Ba]az,et, forthat ssie was perswaded there
coald be no place in the world where (he would not be better than with him.    But
whereas the habit of the woraen of the Isle of Chto is raore advantagious than ours,
it was in this sassiion that (he was attired ; and I have heard it said, that one could

also an apron of cloath of gold, a little ssiorter than her petticoat, and which wa

upon her ssioulder?, as it were to sasten on the sleeves ofher wastcoat, a ercac
many of ribbands of divers colours, and athwart her neck a scars of Tissany hang¬
ing baudrikewise, and clofed together with Diamonds, in such fort as all her neck
was seen, aboutthe which ssie had a chain of Pearl, with a little jewell of Eme¬
raulds.    The attire of her head was of cloath of silver, plaited with a great dealof
address, and inriched all over with Pearls and Diamonds; This head-tire was of
a round form, and standing up very high behind; and to hold it on the better,
ssie had according to the use of the Countrey a little gold sillet with which it was
made sast behind on her neck, where hung two tassclls of the same in the midst of
a great number of knots of severall colours, which sell carelesly updn her (houl-
ders. And on the cop of her forehead, descending a little into a peak, stie had a
dressing of Cobweb Lawn streaked with gold,which also was sastned behind,leavine
her hair hanging down in curls on either side of her cheeks.   In this manner was
Roxelana attired; but before hc led her to the Seraglio, Bojazjet would give her his
last instrustions; wherefore he took her asidc, and willing her to hearken attentive¬
ly unto him, he spake to her much aster this fort; for the slave, who hath toldmc
asl thcsc things, over-heard him without his perceiving it.   It is time, my daugh¬
ter, for me to discover unto you the means whereby you may arrive at the point
which I desire.   I have indeed said something unto you at severall times, but now
I am resolved to hide no part of a Science sirom you, on which I have a long while
meditated.    Before I ssiew you then the ways you are to hold, I raust propound un¬
to you the term of your pretensions, which ought not to be only to please the
Grand Signior; to make him in love with you; to bc a Sultana , as many othersj
but indeed to become his wise.   For although none of the Of Aww/iw Emperors since
5&lt;ijitaiss the sirst hath been maryed, because they would not ssiare their power; yet
ought not this obstacle smother your desires, but contrarily it ought to inslame
them the more.    You perceive then, continued he, that in so great a design, diere
is need of a great deal of prudence to carry one well unto it.   The gencrall pre¬
cept which I will givreyou upon your entring into the Seraglio, is, never to do,
nor to say any thing, which tends not to this design, either direstly, or indircstljr,
and to remember, that all the ways which may condust us whither we wouldgo,
are permitted us by true reason.    Never amuse your sels then in consulting, whe¬
ther that which you do bc just; but indeed whether it be advantagious for you.
Consider not, whether you hurt any, but whether that which you do may serve
your turn.   For in sine, you go to a place where you will meet with cnvyers, and
enemies, and no sooner shall Soliman be striken in love with your beauty, but you
will be hated of all the Sultanaes.    Prepare your sels then to know how to make
a right use of all these things; andso do, that the hate which is born you may
destroy them, who would destroy you. Never undertake to be revenged, but when
you can absolutely do it; yea, and is it be pofsible, revenge your sels so as you
may not bee  suspested for it.    Moreover, Alicolaes adventure makes niers*
membdr, that Sobmau is pleased with modesty, wherefore so carry your iss)
as it may be very much seen in all your astions; and beware of trusting a"?
body.  Regard every one as your enemy, caress all your sellows, and love non«
of them ; make not their desests known to Solimn, but in seeraing to cxcuse theni;
be caresull   to let him   understand by   some   other   the malice   which tti^
bear   you ;    bee liberall to  them that  are about the Grand Signior ; d«
very submissive and pleasing to him, untill you know that you ^rc ab(o u
Mistris of his heart; for in sine, you must serve, that you may reign; but then,
you must change yoursiile, and by some artisice, whkh you may invent accorams

sear he ssiould be named to Salman.   The matter sell out ashc desired ; and the
crand Signior, very luckily for his design, hapned tobe in the bell humour ofthe
world, by reason hehad received newsof a great Vistory which he had obtained
over the Christians.   Wherefore he presently comraanded, that this slave, and he
■which brought her, ssiould enter. V^hen Ba]az,et sirst appeared, SoUmanknewhxrrx.
not   whether k were for that tirae had altered hira, or that his eyes and heart
were so sixed on the beauty of Roxelana, ashc did not consider hira. But as soon
as Ba^a^et had cast himsess at his seet, and that he had begun to speak, the tone of
his voyce made hira call himtomind: He did not interrupt him for all that, but
looking still on Roxelana, hchcarkncdto Bajaz^et,  without turning his head to¬
wards him.    Roxelana on her side appcancd with so modest a Majesty, andso
charming a sweetness, asit had been very hard to discern the motions of her soul
in her eyes, and not to bc strucken in loVe with such powersull attrasts.    But
whilst Soliman takes in so sweet and so deadly poyson, ^^j^sces spake to him in these
terms; I know very wcll,ray Lord, saidhe untohim, thatit is a crime in rae to
present niy sels before thee, aster I have been banissied; and that is thou bcestnot
the moft indulgent Prince of the World, thou wilt not permit mcto give thee
reasons for it, which may cxcuse mc.    But since thy silence seems to accord me
so much, I ssiall let thee know, my Lord, that this young Slave whom thou seest
here, and whom Ipresenttothy Highness as a thing chat appertains unto thee,
is the daughter of that sair Slave whom I presumed to retain for my sels, though
ssie were destined to thee. Rejest her not, ray Lord, since though she be the daugh¬
ter ofan ofsendor,yet is ssie so too of a woraan that belonged'unto thee,and whofe
vertue hath passed into her as well as her beauty.    In sine, it is a sacrisice, which
I ofser up unto thee, to expiate the crirae which heretofore I committed, and that
also which at this present I commit. Consider, I beseech thee, that having robbed
thee of one slave, it is but just that I ssiould render thee another ; but with this
disserence, that the former was thy slave by violence, and that this same isavo-

hath been alwaies conserved as an ofsering, whereof the purity ought to desace
the blackiiess of my saults.  But is nevertheless thoujudgest her unworthy of this
honour, 1 am mofi ready to give thee both her lise and nrlnc own, rather than re¬

<p>z,et had made qn end of speaking , he cryed out, reaching forth his hand to him
O happy was that thest of thine, since it was the cause of thy now rendring mc
an inestimable treasure! For I profess unto thee, that I never saw any thine so
beautisull as thy present. Then turning him to Roxelana ; and for thee, sair maid
sayd he unto her, be assured that in lofing a sather, thou sindest a lover; andthat
in consideration of thee alone, I will give Bajaz^et his liberty again, and restore
him to all his former charges and honours.    Roxelana made no other answer
thereunto, than  with a profound respest ; but Bajaz^et was sb over-joyed with
so happy a beginning, as hc thought he ssiould never have done rendring thanksto
Soliman.    At last, aster some other speeches, the grand Signior caused one of the
Governesscsof the women of the Seraglio to come to hira, and remitted her into
her hands, with order to lodge her alone, and in one of the sairest lodgings in
the womens quarter.    And outof a particular grace, he commanded to be given
unto her the very same day, great store of jewek, apparell, sumptuous houshold-
stuss, and mony, with six slaves to serve her.    And whereas ssie seemed to regret
one which ssie had, the Grand Signior caused her to be instantly brought in unto
her.   But I had forgot to tell you, that when ssic was separated from her sather,
ssie assested to seem good and sensible; the tears carae into her eyes, ssie lookedas-
ter hira as sar as ssie could see him ; and with this seigned testimony of naturall .is-
sestion, ssie touched the heart of Soliman yet more ; for whereas her tears were
withoHt bitterness, they did but make her (hew the sairer.    But consider, I pray
you, how deceitsull and ill-assured humane prudence is, especially when it works
against reason and equity.   Bajaz,et had all his lise-time been mastered by two
mighty paslions, love, and ambition ; the sirst raade hira lofe his fortune, when as
he betrayed Soliman, and the other raade hira lofe his lise ;   as is the divine Justice
.would not let hira enjoy a good, which he had acquired by a crirae :  For he had
not been eight days rc-cstablissicd in his charges, and Roxelana in the Seraglio,
when as being gone to visit the Basla of the sea, vvho was then at Pera, where the
Arsenall and Magazine of ail Maritime things were, he arrived there just as they
were ready to try sisty Cast-pieces, which were to be used in some ssiipping that
was ssiortly to be set forth.    And whereas the Bassa would bc present in person at
this tryall, it was in this employment that Ba]az.et sound him.    Aster the sird
complcments,the Bassa told him, how that which he was going to do, vvas as niucli
to congratulate his happy return to the Port, as to acquithirasels of the dutyof
his charge ; whereupon he commanded sire to be given : But to ssiew that the ju¬
stice of heaven would punissi Ba]az.et, the sirst piece buiso asunder, and in the midK
of two thousand persons, and some sour paces from the Bassa of the sea, a (hiverof
that Cannon picked him out, and carried him away, with such violence, as he
was almoft reduced into powder, so strangely were his limbs dispersed. Andthat
which  is yet remarkable also in what I deliver, is, that he was the sole man,l£lo
not say of them that were killed, but of them that were hurt, and hovv that ss a'
the  onely piece that burst in sunder.    Behold, generous ./^Ar/rsw/r^, in what man¬
ner Ba]az,et enjoyed his hopes, and the recompense which hc had for ali his crimKj
The news ofhis death was soon carried to the Seraglio ^Roxelana ssiewed a great deal
of forrow for it ;   and out of a sense of interest ssie was really grieved thereat.
But in a sew daies, the markes which the Grand Signior rendred her ofhis assestioj
comforted her. For whereas ssic did not regret him ,   but because ssie had htsm
him to be usesuU for her greatness, when as ssie hoped that ssie might attain there¬
unto without hira, ssie quite forgot hini; Yeaand was glad that Oie was discbar^t'i
ofthe care of his fortune, and to have nothing to think of but her own.   Roxom
had not been sisteen daies in the Seraglio, but she so absolutely pofsessid the Grand
Sii-ni. ir,  as none ofthe rest of the Sultanaes could pretend to a savourable regard
fromhim,   but by speaking well to him of her ;   or that he knew they had bee"
somewhat gratious with her; which pofsessed thera with nolittk jealousie, and no

PI ay you, in what manner ssic oppofed this storra vvhich vvas rysing up against her
snd I am fore you will acknowkdge, that ssie was then as ingenious, as ssie h^th
been wicked lincc. This conspiracy nothing daunted her; ssie seemed neither more
unquiet,nor raorcpenlive; and asl the change vvhich ssie brought to her lise was,
that she never saw Solimait, without speaking some good of one or other of the Sul¬
tanaes She piaised the beauty ofonc,the huraor of another, the gracesulness ofthis,
and the stature of that; but particularly ssic seeraed very much to esteem of the rao¬
ther of Mustapha; and so caressed that young Prince , as it had been impofsible at
that tirae to have forcseen by the apparcnces that which hath since sallen out. And
whereas ssie knew that the raother ofthe Sultan had a great power over bun, ssie
wonne her wholly to her scls. Now i?o.vs/^m design was, to destroy by this arti¬
sice all the ill which the Sultanaes could say ofher to Solman. For said ssie, when
he ssiall see that they, for whora I do so many good ofsices to him, would hurt me,
he wil have thera in horrorjand think the better of me.The matter sailed not to suc¬
cecd as ssie had imagined it. For one ofthe Sultanaes, whom Roxelana had the moft
commended, having understood that ssie had sent a little cofser soil of jcwells out
ofthe Seraglio, which is not perraitted in that place, ssie advertised 5&lt;?//iw&lt;a» of it,
who scarcely hearkning to what ssie said,called her ingratesull and disacknowledg-
ledgine; and without obHging^o.ve/4«4 to the justisying of hersels, he sent her a
presentofiraportance. Aster this, none of the Sultanaes durst venture upon any
such like adventure. But Roxelana, who was not contented with keeping them from
doing her hurt, and that placed her suprcniest selicity in doing hurt to others
absolutely gained to her three Slaves, two Eunuchs , and suborned also two of the'
Sultanaes; who went jointly together and advertised Soliman ofthis secret counsell*
which was held against Roxelana, without raaking ssiew for all that of her know¬
ing any thing of it, 5o/w&lt;e« recorapences thera for this advice, commands them

<p>never thought of any thing but maintaining her sols; but when ssie canieto consider
that Mustapha would reign one day, and that according to the custom of the Em¬
pire, her son ssiould be strangled; this awaked her former ambition, and aU herded
iigns tended no longer but to be speedily the wise of a Prince, of whom ssie was the
absolute Mistress; to the end that in this illustrious estate, she might the more ea-
sily destroy Mustapha, for her son to reign.   And mark a little whereunto ambitj]
on carried this woman, who thought already of setting the Crown on the head of
a child, who knew not as yet that he was living ! howsoever, it was not out ofthe
absolute power that ssie had over the mind of Soliman, that ssic attained to herde-
sircjbutbyanartisice which I am going to relate unto you.    She knew that in
one of the books of our Religion the Soveraign is forbidden the pofsesling ofa sret
woman ; and ssie knew also that in another, a Slave is not permitted to busld cither
Mofqiie or Hofpitall, or to doany other thing that may be available for the other
lise.    Upon this soundation ssie built her design; and  knowing that theMuski
carried a great stroke vvith the Grand Signior ,   ssie  won him vvith pre¬
sents, vvhich   ssie   sent  him  secretly ;  and so being   sure of his  ailistance
when  ssiee  ssiould have   need of it, behold  hovv   ssiee   proceeded therein.
She sent to the Muphti, who is the man that takes cognizance ofall matters of Re¬
ligion, to let him understand that ssie had an extreme desire to build a Mofqucjand
an Hofpitall, where all poor Pilgrims might be lodged and sed; but before (he
would undertake it, ssie would sain know whether this would be pleasing to the
Prophet.   The Muphti answers according to her desire, and as ssie knew that he
would answer; that the thing would be pleasing to the Prophet, but absolutely
unprofitable for the second lise of her soul, because ssie was the Grand Signiors
Slave, and that whatsoever ssie hadbein^ Solimans, and not hers, all that ssie(houlJ
do in this estate would bc to the advantage of the Grand Signior, and not of her.
This answer received, ssie seigns to be exceeding melancholick, ssie deprives her
sels of all her ordinary delights; and when the Grand Signior visits her, slie lets
hersels be surprised still in some muse, whereat ssie seeras asterwards to bc some¬
what grieved, and to strive to break her sels from it.    At last ssie playes her part
so dextrously, as the Grand Signior began to bc troubled upon his observing this
change of her humour. At sirst he was contented to ask ofher what it wasthat
made her so sad ? but ssie answering that it was an essest of her temperature, it put
him into surther pain. He inquires of the slaves that serve her, whether any one
hath given her cause to complain ? they answer, that they know of none; but
how it is true, that their Mistress had been for a good while so melancholick, as
they did not think ssie could live long in that fort.   For indeed when Roxilm
was alone with them, ssie always seemed exceeding sad, to the end that being the
sirst deceived, they might the more ealily deceive others, fore-seeing rightly, that
Soliman would inquire of them that served her, what she ailed.  But because (he
would not be always in constraint, ssic ssiut hersels up the moft part of the day in
her Cabinet ; and this unaccustomcd retirement served yet very much to make it
be credited that ssie had some hidden gries. Soliman being advertised then of ill
these things, began to sall into extreme unquietness: he conjured Roxelana toac"
quaint him with the cause of her sadness, and not to conceal the secrcts of her
heart from a Prince, who had given his so absolutely to her; he told her, that is
anyone had wronged her, he would revenge her for it; and in conclusion, thi^
there was nothing which ssie might not obtain from him. Hereunto ssie anlVeredj
that the respest alone which ssie bore him, kept her from obeying him, and that(n^
had always rather die than displease him.  So pressing a discourse sailed not to
work the essest which she attended from it; Soliman was mightily moved with'tj
and beholding her with eyes, which ssiaredwith her in her gries, he svvore that he
would not part from her till he knew what it was that troubled his selicity.  ^^'
resists yet a while, he presses her the more, and speaks to her with such earncstnei^
as ssie thinks it was high time to discover her scls.   She sells then at his seet, be-
seechcs him to pardon her, and at Ust srames a discourse silled with artisice, where-

<p>tissied Religion, and reason of State, vvhich ordained him so to do &gt; Ah, no,no he
cannot live without Roxelana, and whatsoever comes of it we must be insepa'rablc •
and without ofsending Heaven, I must render her happy in contenting my sels. \[
my Subjests murmure at it, I ssiall tell well enough how to bring them to their
duty again, and teach them to submit unto the pleasure of him, to whom they arc
but Slaves.   This resolution being taken, he imparted it to Roxelana, who, as you
may judge, rejoyced excessively at it.    Howbeit ssie in appearance received this
news with a great deal of moderation, saying, that ssie thought hersels unworthy
of so great an honor.    But within a sew days aster Soliman mary id her publick-
ly with a solemn pomp.    She sent presents to all the Sultanaes, but the Mother of
Mustapha, to decline the seeing of jber that day, seigned her scls sick.   Now to do
her the more honour, and to declare her more absolutely Queen,  and Mistris of
all the Sultanaes, he caused agreat Hall to be moft sumptuously surnissied, where
at the one end he made a Throne of sour steps  to be erested, covered all with
cloth of Gold,   and two Cussiions of the same stuss,   upon vvhich sate hee
and Roxelana, who  had a Crown on her head, and her Gown set all over
vvith Diamonds.    Upon the second degree of the Throne vvas the Mother of
Soliman, wholoyed Roxelana as her sels; and upon the two lowermoft, sate the
sisters and daughters of the grand Signior, for he had three by two of his slaves.
Things being in this estate, all the Sultanaes came one aster another richlyap-
paialled, to do obeysance to Roxelana with an high respest; and fora mark of
their dependance, they all brought magnisicent presents,and placed thera some sour
paces from the Throne where Roxelana sate.    Divers of them brought Maunds of
Gold sull  of Slowers; others, Vases of Emeraulds rcplenissied with Essences;
some, little Cofsers, garnissied with precious Stones, and silled with Persumes; and
aster they had lest their presents at the soot of the Throne, they went and placed
themselves in order on both sides ofthe Hall upon their knees, as it were to doe
homage to the new Queen.    All these Sultanaes having remained so awhile, an
hundred young children, which are brought up about the grand Signior, carae
out of a particular grace to the womens Seraglio, where this ceremony was per¬
formed ; and being arrived in the Hall, they beganto dance, and to sing somewhat
to the glory of Roxelana ; and being retired, all the Sultanaes went to kiss her
Robe, and then her hand, which ssic held out unto them.   And for a mark oftheir
slavery, and her liberty, she gave to each of them a chain of Diamonds; and so re¬
turned in the same order as they came, carrying in their hearts as much envy and
jealousie, as Roxelana had joy. Asfor the mother, the sisters,and daughters om*/'-
w&lt;i«,they condusted Roxelana tothe Grand Signiors lodging, where they Icsthcr
in the height of her selicities, and retired to the old Seraglio thorough a door that
opened near upon Solimans chamber.    Untill then sraud and artisice were tHe on¬
ly things which she had employed to arrive unto the point ssie had desired; but
alass, how well did ssie in this estate remember the bad lessons which hersather
had given her! when as he had told her, how that which was gotten by addrest,
ought to bc conserved by violence.   For ssie no sooner saw her sels the Wise of ^♦Z'"
man, but ssie would needs ssiare with him in his power, and be acquainted with all
the assairs of the Empire; ssie banissied from the Port such as weienotplea%
to her; and for sear lest the Muphti, whom ssie could not make greater than hc WJ,
should reveal to some one, that her good fortune was not so much an essest ofher
devotion, according to her own saying, as of her artisice ; it was thought tli«
ssie suborned one of his slaves, aivd caused hira tobe poysonedj for he dyed sud¬
dainly; and some have conceived that he himsels was aware of it, because that ha¬
ving been sick   not above an hour aster supper, when as he could scarce speak for
the violent pains that he selt, with much adoe yet htsayd,that Roxelanaes Oofi^
coft him his Mse, whereupon he presently dyed.   Aster ssie had secured her scls oti
that side, ssie turned her eyes to Mustaplyi.    I think I have told you, that in tW
sirst year of her being inthe Seraglio ssic brought forth Soliman asonnc, namca
Mahomet ,but lam to let you understand surther, that in tha sour sollowing, Ine

we c prq)Zred so him, helittk dreaming of any such thing._ The poor assliacd
MotU linking it a crime to resuse her sonne, takes the sruit whichhe present,
her with, and to content him, eats It with her eyes all batihed in t^ar';  ^ut "e
infortunate Mtsstapha knew not that hc gave death to her who had given hint
lise'and that this crime vvhich he committed so innocently should be one aay
scvcW punissied in his person, though he were never accused for it: Having been
in this occasion, like thofe innocent ofserings, upon whom in times past amongtt
certain Nations the crimes of asl the people were charged.   The pcjyson whicti
Roxelana had caused to be prepared was sloWj to the end U ssiould make no noise;
and that when Muslapha ssiould bc out of the Seraglio, and Soliman ssiould be told
thathe was sick, ssie raight make him bcleeve, that change of air had caused this
malady.   But destiny would not have the matter go so ; for in sine, not to pro¬
long this discourse any surther, yl/«/?/tp/j4 went out ofthe Seraglio in good health,
with no little gries to Roxelana, vvho had been advertised that he had not eaten
of the impoisoned sruit. As for the mother, that never troubled her; forthough
ssie sesl sick the very same day, and dyed a moneth aster, no body beleeved there
was any thing extraordinary in her death ;   because Roxelana had caused it to be
bruited, how the forrow for ^/«/?/e;iA4(sj cloignment was the catsse ofit, and how
since that day ssie had never been well ; as inciced ssie lyed not : snd this was so
generally beleeved, as the sick Sultana her sels sayd so much to them that came to
visit her, ssic never suspesting any wickedness.   Behold, Madam, Roxelanaes sirli
pcrsccution of the Prince Mustapha: Indeed it is true, that he was not sensible of
'it, for he never knew any thing of that which   I have told you.    l^ow you must
not imagine, that this violent desire which ssie hath alwayes had to destroy Musta^
pha, whereby her children may reign, is a sense of assestion for them ; ssie hath
not so legitimate a design, and the only thought which s^hath, is tip remain the
mother of an Emperor asoer the death of 5o//&gt;»4« ; because ssie knows very well,
that this quality gives alwaies a great credit to thofe which pofsess it i and brings
them into veneration amongst us.   I ssiould never have done, is I would relate all
her wickednesses unto you.    But at length M«y?&lt;s/&gt;/?4 in spight of all her artisices
lived, was brought up with great care, raaryed an excellent Princess ofthe bloud
of the antient Kings of Capadocia,whom he loved passionately, and proved, as you
know, as excellent a Prince as ever was. And the hate which ssie bore him could not
keep the Prince (7/Vz«^sr from having as much good wisl for him,as ssie had aversion.
But to strengthen her sels still the raore, as soon as her daughter had attained the
age of thirteen yeares, ssie got Soliman to raary her to the traitor Rustan; who for all
that hath not forborn often betraying her sels, for he seekes his own greatness and
not hers. Behold, Madam, wh.it the sirst wickednesses of Roxelana have been for as
for ssie rest, you know them but too well. And it may sussice,that I have onely stiew¬

violences, but the grand Visier Ibrahim , who ever since he hath beenamonest
hath had sb much power with Solman, as ssie could never, he being the moft vc"^'
ous of men, make any ofher wicked devices succeed,   either against him    noT'^
Mustapha, or danger ( for he loved them both dearly ) untill siich time a's for ou
ill fortune, he went away, some six monthes agoe, upon a secret expedition vvhere^
ofall the world t.ilks diversly; for seeing the mischieses which have arrivedbyh'
absencc, it is seared lest ssie hath caused him to be" murthered by the way. h bein!!
very certain, that ishe had been here,   the rage which ssiehad long ssiut up in her
heart, had not broken out so deadly as it hath done.   Alas !   said Axiamira inter.
rupting her, how much hath he whom you speak of been wissied for in vain ofthe
Vrince danger !   And how often hath he spoken to me of him with a world of
praise! B ut mother,   continued ssie, you have recounted so many things unto me
as Soliman me thinks ssiould be above an hundred yeares of age, and yet he seemed
not io old unto me on that unhappy day wherein I saw hira.   It is, answered HMi.
7na, because I having enchained two Histories in one, and begun to speak of Solmm
at the age seaventcen yeares, your mind, by the length of my narration,  andthe
number of things which 1 recounted, hath thought that which you say. But isyou
please, I will let you see th:   contrary: Soliman was seaventcen yeares old, v^hen h-
jaz,et put the suppofition of the Slave upon him; at the end of sixteen yeares, when
Roxelana was presented unto him, he was thirty and three, ssic sisteen, and Mnslntk
scaven: So that isyou are ignorant of all these thing?, you will sind, that'Roxelm
is not above scaven and thirty yeares of age, Mustapha was nine and twenty, Gm-
ger eighteen, and Soliman is sisty and sour, though he seem not to bc more than for¬
ty. And that which is strange in this Prince is, that hc is at this present of a more
amorous humor, than he was in his younger yeares. I ssiall not have much ado, an¬
swered Selixana,who had not spoken yet, to believe that which you say; and 1 kjiow
but tco well by mine  own experience,   that there are men in whom age doth ra¬
ther stir up passions, than appease them. With such like discources, /s&lt;«/w;-« indea¬
voured to divert thePrincesses melancholy; but rcmembring that ssie had notea-
ten any thing ofall that day, ssie went to give order forthe serving up of dinner,
On the other side Ibrahim, who had not forgot the design which he had, and the re¬
quest of Ulama, aster he had sjpent part of the morning at the Dtvano , which was
held that day, and the rest of^it with the Grand Signior, without speaking of any
other thing than the war of Persia, he returned to his Palacc, there to take along
with him the Slave which Ulama had sent to him ,  that he might carry him tothe
Castle of the scaven Towers, whither he went with an intention to case the mise¬
ries of others, since fortune would not let him sind a remedy for his own.

and Selixana were prisoners,he commanded the gate to be opened to him,
as they used in times past to do, when he came to visit Prisoners of State.
But whereas the Governor of that place had not understood of the grand
Visiers return, there had been no order taken for his entrance; howbeit
his people had no sooner advertised him of his being there, but he came to
let him in himsels, and to crave pardon for making him stay so. Ibrahim,
having accepted his excuses, sent him to advertise Axiamira of his arrival, and to know of
her, whether he might have the permilsion to see her. This man sailed not to obey the com¬
mandment he had received, but this news so surprized Axiamira, and the imagination, that
soe was ready to see a man, whom Prince (j/&lt;««^sr had loved somuch, troubled her in such
fort, as being but in a weak and languishing state of health, the vioknt motion ofher thoughts
h;d like to have made her sall into a swoon. Not sinding her sels then in case to entertain
Ibrahim^ ssie sent her dear Selixana to cxcuse her unto him, and to desire him to pardon her,
issoe were constrained to retard a thing, which slie desired so passionately. Selixana acquit¬
ed her sels of this commission with a great deal of address, and entertained Ibrahim at Itali-
ma's lodging. But aster the illustrious Ba^a had received Axiamira s civilities, and had
told Selixana, that oming but to ofser her his service, he (hould have been very forry to in¬
commodate her, he perceived the unquietness, which appeared in the sace of SAlxana. For
whereas he had commanded i;/&lt;«7w«'i Slave to sollow him, soe had no sooner saluted Ibra¬

hich so obstinacely persecuted me, that you are to pardon me the doubt I am in of iny happi-
ness; since it is in me rather an ested ofmy sense, then of my reason. Whereupon ssie open¬
ed the Letter, which Israightvvay sbe knew to be V lama's hand; ?nd having read it over

to approach, who casting himselsac Silix.. na's seet, would have kist her robe, but ssie readi¬

would have gone outof thechamber, but StlixanapttctWm^xt, called her back again. It
isbut just, said she unso her, that as you have been the onely consolation which 1 havesound

</p>
<p>THat which you desire to know of mc, generous Ibrahim, hath coft me so many tear?,
andsiehs, that is I did not strive to turn away my thought from the last adventures ot
this History, it were impofsiblcfor me to relate the beginning, where you will sinde nothing
but the hopes of an extream selicity for me.   But to take things from their sirst source, and
to render my discourse more intelligible, I am to tell you, that Scach Tachmas, whom we
call the Sophi, otherways Kingot the Persians, remained a widower almoft as soon as his
wise (who, as I have heard say, was an excellent Princess) had brought him two sons, Ismael^
and Mahamcd, whereof the last is blinde j and two daughters, of which the one is the.
Princess v^A-J-&lt;wiV^, or to say better, the wonder of her age; andthe youngest, named Psr-
ca, is of an indisserent beauty, of a malicious humor, and of a minde uncapable of anykinde
of sriendstiip. As for Ismael, it might be said, that as he hath no great virtues, so he hath no
great deseds, and that he is in the rank of thofe persons, who do almoft pass away their lives
so, as they can hardly be known to live, is their quality did not make it appear that they are
in the number of the living.   Now for Mahamed, the same cannot be said of him, but con¬
trarily ic seems, that Nature hath deprived him of thelight of theday, to make itshinethe
more in his minde: For whether it be that this privation of sighc is the cause of its better re-
colleding it sels, and operacing with the more adivity; or thac his memory, which is so mar¬
velous in him, as ic miy be thought he hath never forgotten any thing, doth surnith him wich
that which renders him agreeable; so it is that his conversation is so charming, as one an ne¬
ver be weary of it.  But thac which is moft excellent in him is, that he is exceeding virtuous,
and thac his passions, chough violent, have never surmounced his reason.   Behold, my Lord,
what the royal Samily was, whenl was brought to the Court, which was at thac time in
the City of Tauris. My Sacher had always been considerable enough in chis Monarchy,and the
Sophi, to testisie che esteem he had of him, had made him Governor of Strabat and Maz.an.
dtron, two very sair Towns,which are scituated on the bank of the Calsian Sea. But where¬
as my Sather had marryed the sister of the Governor of Tauris, it was by his means that I
was put to Axiamira, with a many other maids of a condition equal Co mine, which were
divided between thofe two Princesses; and were wich ihem, as one might say, rather to
help them co pass away the time, then to do them any service.   Axiamira mighc be about
sourteen years of age, and I sisceen; and whereas she was younger then the Pnncs her Bro¬
thers, Mahamed, as I think, was not sar from sixccen.   But to let you sirss know all t he per¬
sons of whom I am to speak in chis History, I stiall tell you, that there was at the same time
m the Court, one named Deliment, whofe birth was not very noble; but who hsd, by raeans
of hishighspirir, and excream riches, sowroughc himsels into the Court, and good grace
ot t\^tSopht, as there was nonebut wasasraid tobe in iUterms wichhim: I say asraid, be-
caulc It IS certain chat no man desired his sriendship, but for sear least his hatred should be pre¬
judicial untohim; and truly it is not tobe marvelled is one could have no other opinion of
^™;. °V^'was ^^^olent, Moni, undertaking, beleevit^g there was scarce any thing

<p>VlamayN^^ oppofite to him in all things, for his birth is noble, as being the chies mannsr
ramaniai his courage is without brutishness; and whereas you have not seen him bur s"
hc was infortunate, I conceive I may be permitted to tell youwhathe wasdurln^hiss?
ty. When I arrived at the Court nothing was spoken of but the valor of Vkma •''for i «-
a httle aster the War of the A^emites, where having done wonderS, and to say ail beenT
cause of the Sophies carrying away the vidory ; to recompence him for this greac astion h
made him Satrap of Canamania ac two and twenty years of age, and gave him hissider'^
marriage, whom Vlama espoused rather out of obedience, then out of indination • Ith?
ing certain that this Princess, as the incomparable Axiamira bath oftentimes told me y"
nothing recoinmendable in her but her birth. And indeed, as is Heaven had sound thislur
riage unjust, a month aster it was accomplislied slie dyed of a burning Seaver: And whticis
it is the custom of the Kings of Ter(ta to have all the royal Samily lodged in one and thesame
Palace, Vlama, "as brother-in-law to the Sophi, was lodged there too; sochat thoughtlie
women hve very straitly kept all over Persia, yet lest we noc for all thac co have a great deal
of liberty, and to lead a lise happy and pleasant enough; having in the same Palace, thetwo
Princes and Vlama, whom we saw as much as they pleased: for che Sopht had ordained that
the Princesses lodgings sliould be open to them when they would, I and that all the Sitm
young sons mighc see and speak to us when as they accompanyed the Princes.   Things bcJDg
in these terms at such time as Vlamaes wise dyed, tsie Princesses went by the commandment
of the Sophi, a litde aster the Suneral, togivcavisic to Vlama, whom I had scarcely ever
seen, because I had noc been above a month ac the Court, and thac during the same the Prin¬
cess bis wise had still been very sick. I have already cold you, my Lord, thac VUmhi
not loved her, and I put you in minde of it, to the end you may not think ic strange is in tliis
occasion Love took his beginning in the time of a mourning, which had not drawn any tears.
iiysxiamira and Perca made th\syisit with ceremony, the young Princes conduced them,
or to say better, Ismael held up Axiamira, andPerca led Mahamed, who, as I have told
you, was blindc from his birth,though he had the sairest eyes to see to in the world; buthelct
himsels be guided with so much addrcss,and went along with so considenc a pace,as therewJS
no body but would have been deceived in him. All the maids of honor sollowed aster,as also
six Ladies of quality, reasonably well stept in years, which had been placed abouc the PrincelTs,
to have a care of their behavior, and ours.   And truly it must be acknowledged, chat Seadiof
rejoycing do scldom shew any thing more goodly to behold, then the mournir^ whxiiiiin
this Court; for whereas black is not in use there but when one mourns, is any of it bestssl
about ones apparel, it sussiceth; nor is it exempted from magnisicence.   We were sll then it-
tired much aster one; and to excuse Vlama so much che more, for letting himsds be toocli-
ed wich thofe sew charms which you see in my sace, I will describe Axiamiraes habit unto
you, thac you may know what mine was; for she had already taken so great a liking toK,
as slie would have no other disserence between her apparel and thac I wore, but great sloreof
Diatnonds which she caused tobe added thereunto whensoever she pleased; and wichall,ta
that satal day did beget love in sour such disserent hearts, it will not be amiss for roe co rtcooot
unto you all the particularicies of it. A.viamira chtn had on a pstticoac and wastcoat of cW
of silvcr very gliccering, and over that a gown of black Tissany exceeding sine, vvherccjs tM
body was plaited, so thac it shewed the stiape very perscdly ; and the boctom of the skitii
which was cut in peaks, made way for the cloth of silvcr to be seen athwart ir. The (l«sti
were indisserenc wide, but to give more libcrcyto the arm, they were sastencd uponi'^
slioulder with clasps of Diamonds, leaving almoft to open view che cloth of silver se)'^
that were under.   Her Girdle was of great Pearls cnchaced amongst Diamonds: Anil dc-
hinde at her back were moreover two hanging sleeves reaching to the ground, borderedwi'^^
large borders of silver Embroidery, as well as the lower pare of the Gown.  Her neck w
hals hid wich moft delicate black cobwebdawn, which was tyed on her stiouldsrwitni '
ver siring.   And whereas our dresling is very high, there hung from che top of h r head ■■
hinde a great vail, trailing to the very ground, of silver Tissany, streaked with black, anaca
hsly plaited ; which certainly gave a great deal of grace to the beauty of Aximira,
also sopplyed that little which I had.                                                                     cptrsu,

abT  kemgchac every time civilicy would permit him, he sattened his eyes so on my sace, as I
was'constrained co tu'n away mine; which made me observe how Delment took more then
ordinary care co encercain Axiamirit; for this man of blood and sire had not till  hen looKed
upon any woman, bur to despise her. And as is this chamber had had some satalness to en¬
chant the mindes o^ thofe that were in it, the Sophi himsels came to y\sn Vlama, whilst
we were there, and for my ill fortune, hc beheld me so savorably, as I past wich him for the
sairels ching chac ever he had seen. But whereas the time was not proper for gallantry, all
these springing passions were no ocherwise made known then by looks, except in Deliment
who when che Princess hapned Co go away, and that Tachmas was recired, advanced to lead
Axiamira, whil'st Ismael wss yet Calking wich Vlama.  She, that thought the Prince her
Brother would tarry behinde, received him with her ordinary civility, akhough slie was ex-
treamly avetse to him. On the other side, Ismael having sinislied bis complement, gave his
hand Co Tcrc.i, who, without thinking howtheblinde Prince had not brought his ordinary
guide along with him, sust'red him to lead her; and whereas Mahamed perceived it, and was
very dextrous, he made his discourse endure as long as he could out of hope thac some cne ot
other would lend him their hand to condud him. I consess that having marked the pain ha
was in,and moved with pity to see so goodly a Prince,so handsom,so sprightly,and so amiable,
in che unquiecness wherein I saw him, J stept to him, wichout demanding permission for it
of the Govcrnesses. My Lord, said I unto hira, the Princesses are gone, will not you be pleased
to sollow them ? He chac knew me by my voyce, Yes gladly, discreet Selixana, said he unto
mL% is yon will have che goodness to lead one that isblinde, whonorwichstandinghisblind-
ness cannot buc know your meric. I observed by Vlamaes countenance, thac he had a desire
to have spoken a gallantry Co me chereupon; as indeed he hach since assured me, thac civility
onely kept bim trom ic; buc in sine I led Mahamed to the Princesses Lodging, for che which
he was so obliged unto me, as thac which the eyes of Axiamira had wrought in the heart of
"Deliment, and mine in chac of the Sophi and Vlama, my courtesie esseded in Mahameds;
who from thence forward began to have an inclination for me, which mighc well be cermed
blinde, since is I had had any thing thac was agreeable in my sace, yec could he noc have been
touched with it, being not able to see it; and as for wit, I was in an age, which ordinarily is
not capable of making greac conquests.   Indeed it is true, that my complying with him mighc
render me pleasing to him; for whereas all my sellows were not of my humor, they, when
Mahamed was wich Axiamira, declined his conversation, or ac least« wise applyed not chem-
slvescoit, and this, ouc of the thought, thac being incapable of seeing their beaucy, they
beleeved him co be also incapable of love, and for this reason, they would not lofe thac ?imc
wich hira, which they thought mighc be better employed in the entertaining of all thofe
young persons of quality, which accompanyed the Princes Co Axiamira.   As t?jr me, who
cired noc as yec,either for loving,or for being loved, I gave my sels onely co things that pleased
me; and whereas I was insinitely taken with che conversation of Prince Mahamed, and chac
generoiity ic sels carryed me chereunto, I set my sels as often as I could to talk wich him   buc
that which engaged me yet sarther to this compliance, was, chat the Princess Axilmira
loved him dearly; for whereas Ismael and Tcrca wtxe unworthy of her ass'cdion.the sirst for
thedetedsof hisspirir, and the other for her malice, stie had placed all ber liking on Mah-'
iu\    that when the Princess could not encertain him her sels, slie comraanded me to stav

withstanding any greater mark of his assedion, then to behold and commend me more then
the rest, when occasion was presented for it; for whereas I was very young at that cime he
durst not, as I understood ascerwards, speak plainly to me of his paslion, searing Ishoald'not
be discreet enough to conceal it srcm others. But whil'st he attended che improvement ol my
reason, the time, vjhereunro the ceremony of mourning had consined I^/dwrs, being quite ex¬

ber, and by a second view consirmed himsels in the advantageous opinion he had conceived
of me; and so strorgly resolved to love me, as searing he sliould be obliged to dinodgsroni
the Palace, because the Princess his wise being dead without children, he was scarcely any
longer of rhe royal Samily; he purpofed co endevor all he could to discover his alsedion unto
me, for sear he should be deprived of the commodity of doing it so easily, is he were con¬
strained to be gone from thence.  As for mc, I consess to you blusliing, thac in this visit
which he gave CO the Princess, I selt a desire arise in my heart that I mighc be pleasing unto
him; and wichout making any reslexion on this thought, I remember well, thac although it
had been a greac Courc thac day, I never thought of heeding my apparel; butassoonas
Vlama was entred, I observed my sels wich care, and withouc knowing any reason sotir,
1 would have been glad chat I had been better drest chen I was.    Buc in sine, my Lord, two
or three hours aster, Fortune was so savorable to'L'/^iw^'j design, as having sound me alone
in the Princesses Chamber, who was shut up in her Cabinet, he spake to me of bis assestion
wich so much passion, as I knew not what to answer him, having never met with such like
encounters.   And whereas his speech had ever since remained in my memory, and that it
hath been the beginning and cause of all my pleasure, and of all my misery, I cannot forbr
repeating it unto you. He no sooner entred inco the chamber, but I advanced towards him,
to let him know thac I was very forry for chac he could not see che Princess as yet; and thit
having forbidden me incerrupting her, I durst noc adsercise her of his being there. Do iKs
asslid you sels, sair Selixana, said he unto me, for a thing which is insinitely pleasing tonis;
and is you will render me persedly happy, trouble not my good fortune in doubting of tiis
trucb.   Whar, said I unto him exceedingly surprized, do you come to see che Princess, ml
yet are glad that you cannoc mcecwich her.? truly this seems so strange tome, as I cannot
comprehend tbe reason of it. Ic is noc for all thac very dissicnlc to sinde out, answered henie,
for I come to see the Princess .^.vj&lt;?»?t&gt;(« out of duty, andthe beautisul Selixammid's'

Princess, asappercainngcoyou; and beleeve that lam ravislied with sinding you chusibs,
whereby I have had the opportunity to make this Declaration unto you.   This discourse sm-
prized me in such manner, as I should have been much perplexed to have answered it, is ^*

that in six months space Vlama gave me so many marks of his love and discretion, as I ^^^^
have been ingratesul and inscnsible, not to have rendred him seme testimony of my P'

be, then my discourse; seeing I know yon Coo generous, and Selix.ma roo wise, and too
assedionate to my service, to conceal my misfortunes from you. It is cercain thac i was very
much surprized Co hear che Princess speak in chis fort; for though sli:- had been a prcccy wh'le
past somewhacsadder chen she used robe, yet perceiving no apparant cause for ir, I had at¬
tributed ic co one of thofe melancholies without a cause, which seizes upon all the World at
one time or other, and proceeds srora ones temperature; buc when as going on in her sp-tch
she acquainted us, that ever since the visit which she had given to Vlama aster the lofs of the
Princels h;s wise, and that Deliment had presented her his hand to lead her to her lodging, as
I remcrabred very well, he had been so audacious as Co speak divers times ro her of love, al¬
though she had at the very sitst very severely forbidden him; my amazement ceased, knowing
well enough the excream aversion which slie had for Deliment, and how much her great heart
ought Co be incen{ed,that a man of a birth so unequal to hers sliould be so diring,as co lofe the
resped which he owed unto her. As for Mahamed, who knew buc tco well j by the report
ot some of bis servancs, thac 'Deliment slighced him, he was so neded, as he could not for¬
bear saying aloud: How, sister, hach this Insolenc loft the resped which heowstoyou? Yes,
replyed the Princess, and in such a manner, as even to day, when as the Sophi brought him a-

did noc sinde was very necessary for me to know, he stayd there behinde him, and had the
insoknce to lee mc understand by his obscure discourses, chat che greatest happiness could ar-

<p>held by some body; that Ismael and "Strca are of his party; that they bate Vhmahitx^[^
he is of ours; that the J'o/)^/our Sather is not sensible of love to his children; and thatthe
passions, which predominate in him, prevail with him over all things. Just hereupon wesj^
Ismael, 'T&gt;erca,vr\d all her women appear asar ofs, so thac to slicw there was no mystery in out
talk she went to meet them, and going away prayed us, that wc would sever out selves sar
from all others, to think of that slie had said to us, and that in the Evening I stionld tell her
the resolution we had taken.   I led Prince Mahamedt\\tn into another alley, where we wete
still for all thac in the sighc of the Princesses; and there, aster we had well considered the mat¬
ter, we resolved, that ic was needsul, before it sliould break forcb, to discover, whetherthc
Sophi authorized the love of Deliment • whether Ismael and Perca had any intelligence with
him, or any interest in this love; thatfor this essedZ^/^jw^j was to be made use of lot so
much as regarded tbe Sophi; and that I on my part sliould endevor to know the secretsof
Perca, by the means of a maid whom (he had loved very much, and who did noc hate me-
and that when we knew the truth of the business, it would be sar more easie for us to remedy
the same; for in sine, said I, is the Sophi doth not proted Deliment, he will be loft assoon
as be understands of his insolence; and is Percahenot interesled in chis astair, the discourse
which he hath used to the Princess will quickly make her change party, wben she knowsit:
buc is th^ Sophi, asit is very likely,  hach given some secret hopes to Deliment; andthit
Tercaontheoihetside hath any share in this adventure, it would be to no purpofe to com¬
plain precipitously Co them of the insolence of this man, seeing they are the cause of it; and
other remedies are to be sought out.  But Prince Mahamed said unto me, Is it poflibletht
the Sophi (who heretofore, as I have understood, hach beenso rigorous an observer of the
Laws ofthis Empire, thac hc banished the Sacrap Arsalon, for marrying a maid that wasnot
noble) should so shamesully insringe them for him. In authorizing the love oi Deliment! This
is a thing, my Lord, said I unto him, whereof we must be cleared by the way which! be
sliewed.   This discourse being sinished, and our resolution taken, I perceived that we were
a great way distant from the Princeslles, so that turning the Prince about, hc observed that I
would recondud him to a place, where he would not have the liberty Co speak unlome;
wherefore standing still, and wringing me a lictle by the hand; go not sofast, said heunto
me, itniabk Selixana, and be pleased, that as y^Arwwjri* hach to day judged you worthyof
communicacing all her secrets unto you, so I may acquaint you wich one of mine thac concsiK
my lise; to theend thac our interests being so well joyned together, cur party miybetk
morestronger, and our enemy the weaker.  And whenl had answeredhim, cbat it waseasie
for him to judg by my past adions of the desire I had to serve him; you may well think, hid
he unto me, according to the discourse which my sister used Co me, that I should lack reason,
in making protestations of love unto yco, were I not constrained thereunto by the forceof
truchand my passion.   Protestations of love tome, my Lord, said I? Yts, dearmaid,ic-
plyed he; and though I know very well, how it is an bard thing to beleeve, and hard to per¬
swade, thac a blinde man, who cannot truly sigure unco himsels what Beauty is, sliould he
despcracely in love with you; yet is it certain that none hath ever been somuch as IJW |
hear all thofe that come neer you, talk to you of the attrads of your eyes, of the bcautjo
your complexion, of your stature, and ofyour neck ; buc I hear none tell you, that youtsoul
is sair, that your spirit is great and generous, that your goodness is excream, and that in o"-
clusion you are the mofi virtuous person that is in the world; yet is it with these beauties tto
my soul is touched; and chey are they which doubtless render my love more strong and wre
pure, then all thofe, which, as I have heard say, are destroyed by the lofs of tbac beautyi«
i^ unknown to me.   But that which I have for you stiall certainly last as long as my h'Ji '°J
the beauty, discreet Selixana, which I adore in you, cannot be destroyed by cime. I' s
be rigorous to me, continued he, Isliallexcuseyourrigorby theknowledglbaveof my J-
seds; and is you be notso tome, I will set no bounds to your hopes, no more t'l^^^'^J
assedion.    Buc in the nit an time, said he unco me, do me the grace co kc me know,'" ^^^^^
manner you will have rae live with you.   It is not for me, my Lord, answered I, to s^^^
your lise; but it is for me to rule my minde so, as to bcleeve no more then I ought, ar
to lofe the resped, which I have always rendred you.   But, my Lord, added I. tw   ,^

Lrest you have therein, you may employ your sels with che more care   I received th., d.s-

this Prince pleased me, as because 1 knew he loved, and very much Sjctn^d Vlama and Axt-
timira-, but in such fore howsoever, as I engaged my scls to nothing.   In the mean time
we came CO the Princesses, and with them we iouni'Delment, whom Ismael had sent for
bytheperswasionof P^rc^. As (oon as he saw me neer to my sellows, he came to quarrel
with mefor having walked so long with thePrince, and separating mc fromhim   without
an.' incivility, because tbe Gentleman, thac used to lead Mahamed, had lenc him his tiand a-
gain, I quickly discerned by hisdiseourse, chat chere was a greac intelligence between the
Sophi and bim: For as soon as be saw me alone, he bs gan to tell me, that I was the happiest
person of my sex, isl knew well how to manage che assedion which the Sopht bore me j
that be gave me chis advice as ray servanc; and thac is I pleased, he would serve me in it
with all his power.  I thanked bim coldly enough for chis ofser, and told bim, howl knew
very well, that all my happiness came from the Sophi, seeing the beautisul Axiamira made
up all my selicity; and saying so, I returned Co my sellows, which already were going aster
the Princes, and Princesses, who recired with very disscrenc choughts.   For Axiamira had het
minde silled wich choller and hace; Mahamed added Co all thofe things the love he bore to
me&gt; Perca thoughc to work soby ber artisices, as we understood asterwards, that a man,
who was of no greac birch, should marry her sister, Co che end she might make use of ic when
time Ihould scrve: Deliment imagined how he might deceive all the world for the sacissying
of his love and his ambition; and Ismael alone knew noc very well what he was thinking on.
As for me,I was so surprized wich the insolency of Deliment towards the Princess,of the arti¬
sice of Perca,of che love of Mahamed,^nd of chac of the Sephi,as I could scarcely speak. But in
sine,my Lord,tbac I may noc amuse my scls Coo long about peccy things, having such great ones
to tell you, you shall understand that we learned a little aster, by the address of Vlama, by the
intelligence which I goe stora Perca's consident, and by the innocency &amp; simplicity of Ismael,
all che seyeral designs ofthese interessed persons. As for the Sophi, the greatest interest that be
had in this assair,was only in ray person; for though he durst not speak to me of his passion,for
the reason I have alledgedj yet was ic so strong,as he was constrain'd to discover it to Deliment,
who prorpised bim co speak to rae of ie; and in case I sliould not be discreet enough to con¬
ceal this secrec from others, be would be so consident as to disavow all that he had said to me.
Vor Ddlimegt, he had a long time before won an old Satrap, in whom the Sophi very much
consided for tbe assairs of che Empire, and who had ofcentimes perswaded him by Deliment's
diredion, thac tbe Law, which had caused Arsalon to be banistied, was very judiciously
made for his subjeds, but noc for him; perswading him, that Kings, which did not marry
their daughters CO forraign Princes, were never Co admit the noblest andthe greatest of their
subjedsinco their alharce; because ebac moft commonly was to take Tucors, in taking sons
in law of an high birth; and chac for the good of the Prince, of the State, and of the Prin¬
cesses. It would be better to do ocherwise.  For, said he unto him one day, comin-topar-
ticulars, is by example, cbe Princess Axiamira had marryed Deliment, what a selicicy would

<p>of State, which wereadvantageous to DJ;»«s«s, for him to beso : and indeed sar siotnlv
ing displeased with it, he embraced, and told him, that bis hop«s might go so hieh, as that il"
permitted him to list up bis eyes, even to the Princess Axiamira. For, said be unto him li
Nature hath not given me children, which can govern chis Empire, I would be willing tb
love and fortune would give me such a one as Deliment, who may, is not be Sophi asia ni
at least-wise counsel him that sliall be.   Deliment, cunning and dextrous as he was, made as
though he did noc beleeve thac which che Sophi said co him, and out of a seigned tespest not
seeming to acknowledg chac to be bis passion, che Suphi said unco him, to oblige bim thtteun-
to, thatit being noc so Sar from him to che ?r'mctss Axiamira, as from me to tbe J'eoii of
Persiia, he was not to sear thac he would thence forward oppo(e an unequal assedion, seeing
he had discovered his unto him.   Buc when as Deliment continued saying, thac resp'est wa
slronger in him chen all ocher things, the Sophi, thac he mighc know whether ic were Ax'n.
w/rrt indeed whom be was in love withall, cirryed him co her lodging ^ and ic was then that
tb*; rasli man was so audacious, as to speak with such insolency Co che Princess.  For where¬
as he had tryed thac love could noc move her, he beleeved that ambieion might; and that the
hope of reigning over Tersia would move her more, then the certainty wherein slie was oi
reigning over his heart.  As for the Princess Perca, they bad a long time before created toge¬
ther, and he had perswaded ber, thac che Crown of Persia was co be shared between her
and her sister; and for that essed sb- was Co be kepc from marrying any man, whofegeneto.
sity (for so ic was char he spake) should carry him co let stupid/y«»&lt;2s/, or blinde .^(jiMwd
reign.  And when he made a shew of seeking ouc, who in che Coure mightbe Ax umiLis
husband, he play'd bis part so well, thac he led her, as cunning as she was, to the point hede-
sired.  For aster she had rauscd awhile, as well as h;, what need have we, said stie untohim,
Co seekso sar oft for chac, which we may sinde in the person of Delment.? He, seeming to
have no other interest in this assair then the good of the Princesses,hcld ofs a good while,thsthsl
might be the more prest unco it. But ac length, being come to agreement abouc cheir conditi¬
ons, they judged, that albeit Ismael was noc capabk of rendering a party much stronger then is
he were not of it, yet ic would be advancageous for them to seize upon bis spirie; and Tiru
took the care to do it.   As indeed, slie easily perswaded him, that ic was requisite Aximn
should be marryed to a man chat depended on him, and not on Mahamed, who aster tlie
death of the Sbphi might trouble him, in demanding a greac porcion, as is he were not bliiiil;
so that to weaken his party, ic would be good to marry Axiamira to Deliment, who would
tye himsels wholly to his interests.   Behold, my Lord, themocives and the causes of M
ment's insolency to Axiamira; of the discourses which he mide to me touching the loveof
the Sophi; of the perswasions of Perca and Ismael; and of the unquiecness, which thisim-
pleasing entanglement gave us.   For being advercised of pare of these things, which weDn-
derstood much better asrtrwards, ?mce AlahameJ, ylxiamira,^ Vlama, and I, whowo
also ofthe counsel, resolved, that thePrincess sliould always treat JD&lt;r//»?s»rwithagre«
deal of coldness and indisserency; wichouc giving him for all chac any nocable cause of cofsl-
plaining: That the best would be caresully co avoyd all occasions wherein the Sophi ssliglit
speak of this man; it being more expedient, that the miccer should noc break forth but upon
extremityjbecause it might arrive thac ic would noc have a st quel so grievous as we foresawit:
That in the mean time wc sliould labor to kiPerca know.chac Deliment did noc intend to ust
hixbmet, then Ismael and Mahamed: Thac for me, I sliould receive the discourse, whij
he sliould make me concerning the Sopht's love, as a thing I did noc beleeve, and chad wo»
not have to be true; and tbac I sliould give him as little occasion as I could to speak torn
it. I ofsered the Princess to retire to my sacher under precexc of a suppofed sickness, buiiitis
good-will which slie bore me oppofed ir, Vance Mahameds love hindred ic absolutds-"|
regard whereof they represenred nnco me, that is I sliould do so, it would be the ^^^^^^^
all, because is the Sophi did love me, he would be so incensed thereby, as he mighc peradven¬
ture be carryed to a violence, which otherwise he would not be capable of.   As for ^m* »
hehad secrec apprehensions which inceslancly cormenced him; the power of ''J.^'^^"".||j
him asraid, neither was heso assured of my constancy, buc that he seared ambition wo
move me more then his love. Buc whereas it was not long before I perceived his unqui«   '
I wrote unco him, for his betcer asl"urance, thac nothing but death could keep me from p^^^^

<p>To as be mi2hc marry rae.   For whereas he was a widower by the d^ath of the Sopht's siijcr,
St would not permic him co chink so soon of a second marriage e'p cally wuh a person,
whofe birch, though noble and illusinous enough, came not nee. forall that to the former,
things being in these terms, we were a go.d wh.le without having any great occasion to  n-
crease our unqaiecness; because the Sophi and Delim^^ hav-ng consn ted a second cimMo-
eether. and resolved to seek to gain me by gentkness, bJore they would come to -rce, there
tis nothing buc sports and entettainments.  And whereas accord.ng to che order I had for ic
so ofcen as Dehmcnt spake co me of rhe Sophi's love, 1 made as though I did not bthevc there
was any truth in his wotds; Tachma. being thereof advertised.ind desiring to give me a proof
of the esteem he made of that they called beauty in may sace, he did a thing, which bath since
been the cause of a greac deal of mischies; for, generous Ibrahim, it happened tor our ill tor-
eunc, tbac there arrived abouc chat time at this Courc a Painter of £«re/»^ whom chance, or
the desire of cravelling had broughc thither, and thac drew pidures in lietle, so admirable re¬
sembling che lise, as che like had never been hear of.   And ae the same time certain Merchants
came thither also, who, amongst other rarities, which they had, made sliew of a number of
the pidures of the sairest women of such several Nations, as they had pasied through.   These
two chings joyned cogecher, caused the Sophi, ouc of the design he bad ro oblige rae, to give
command thac all the maidens of qualicy, which were at che Courc, sliould presenc themselves
ac his Palace on a cercain day, appoinced for it, cogether wich the Princesles and their maids,
sumpruoully apparelled.  This ceremony, whereof we knew noc thecau(e(for they made a
secret ot it) somewhat troubled us, butae lengch that day bei.^g arrived, and all this sair As¬
sembly compleated, che Sophi sollowed by Ismael, Mahamed, Vlama, Deliment, and the
Paincer, of whom I have spoken to you, enrred into the room, where we were all see in or¬
der, buc wichouc che Princesses holding the rank, which they ought Co have had, for so had
rhe Sophi ordained ic; and that which also redoubled the impatience we were in, to know
for what reason chey had caused us Co be accired so richly, was, co see the Sophi hold in his
righc hand ewo Crowns of gold set with Diamonds, and caking the Paincer wich his lest hand,
whom neither the Princesses, nor any of their maidens knew as yet, to say unro him, thac
he cstablislied him che judg of che beaucy of all chofe which compofed this sair Asserably; as
knowing beceer, then therest of the world, che just proporcion of thsseacures of the sace;
that which made up che delicacy, s resliness, and vivacicy of the complexion; and what the
disserence wasbecween an animaced beauty, and another tbac hach no lise nor grace in ir.
And chac to make bim give a more equicable senccnce, hehad so ordered it, as he could not
discern the condition of the sair ones,ot whora he was che judg; buc howsoever that he never¬
theless reserved co himsels the righc of crowning chem, whom he sliould judg co be wor-
rhy of that honor. This said, be led him all over the room, and making an cxad stand at each
of chem, thatso none mighc be disobliged, he sinissied his sirst turn, none being able Co judg
thac he had given advantage to any; nevertheless I perceived, when the Painrer made a stand
before me, thac the Sophi, seeing me cast down my eyes, as pretending co no pare in this vido¬
ry, had said softly, thac I had not so much as need of their sparkling, to merit the Crown
having beauty enough ocher-where. Ic is certain chat I bluslic ac chis discourse  and chac list¬
ing up my eyes again, lencouncredt^/^w^V, wherein I marked somuch unquiecness  asit

sliussled in my sels amongss my sellows, wich as niuchdi''pleasure for my vidory as th
had vexacion for thac chey had noc carryed ir.   Buc in conclusion, my Lord, Axiamira and'^'
were painted inthehabicof Amazons, which, as he said who drew our pidures, wasobs
ing to all Nations: When they were done, the Sophi caused him co make six copies ot ach
of us, whichhe put into Cases of Gold, enriched with Diamonds, and gave them to thof
Merchants, whohadsliew'd him so many forraign beauties; but with an oath, thatthe
sliould never sell them to any but Princes, and thac they should always reserve one of each J
them in their own keeping, to publish ^Arww/r«'j beauty and mine overall the Countries
through which chey cravelled.   These Merchants promised all thac he required, and lor out
ill fortune kepc cheir word but too well, as you sliall understand hereascer.   Srora that same
d^y Deliment persecuted me more then ordinary, ic seeming unto him tbac IwasnoWei
to doubt of the Sopht's love, ascer thac which he had said unco me.   And whereas I desirej
ta decline his encounter, ss much as I could, I stood ofcentimes talking with Prince yls^.
med; because chough he concemned him, yec his qualicy'made him chac he durst not separate
me from him, when we were in discourse rogetber.  And I remember thac one day, as this
poor Prince was entertaining me, and chac Deliment was come Co che Princesses with IJmul
ouc of a design Co say something to me from che Sophi, chis insolenc man did so tar lofe the
resped which he owed to Mahamed, as I hated him for ic more chen I did before. Ihavt
already told you blustiing, generous Ibrahim, that this Prince was in lovewich me; and
though I had noching but good-will for him, and that Vlama absolutely pofsessed my heart,
yec did I in some fore comply wich MahameJ, for his discourse was so virtuous, and so ob¬
liging, though paslionace, as is Vlama hid heird ic, I verily think he could noc haveiattii
this illustrious Rival.  I was also willing to conserve the good-will of the son, out of thein-
tent I had to resuse thejove of the sather.   It was then with his paslion that Mahmd en¬
tertained me that day, when as 'Deliment had sogrcat a desire to speak with me, and thit
sinding himsels hindred from it by the Princes presence, bethought good to observe both te
adions and mine. And whereas ic is hard for the motions of the sace not to give forae mills
of thofe of the heart, especially when love pofsesscth it; Deliment perceived somethiij
which was extraordinary in that of the Prince; for Mahamed, albeit he was blinde, yc:
came up clofe Co me, as is he could have seen me; and because his eyes could noc adveiiisc
him when there was any one neer us that could hear him, and that ic would have but putra:
in remembrance of his desed is he should have said any thing Co me of ic, he always uied to
speak softly unto me; which chac day,amongst ochers,gave no hede unquiecness to I)dm*i\
for having marked chat I had blusht twice ot thrice, and ic seeming to him to be without
anger, hcsuspeded somewhat of the truth.  And whereas he was insolent, and accustoaid
to a biccer jeering, which made hira to be yet more haced of everyone, he said, speakingol
me, to P trots Consident, who was hard by him (for thofe two Princesses were retired into
Axiamira's Cik'met, accompanyed by Ismael,) doch noc this so long and soparticulin
conversation pofsess yeu wich curiofiey ? for as for me, continued he, I profess unto youthit
I cannot comprehend it.   Is ic be of indisserenc chings, I am cercain, chac he cannot taM
her of che rarities which he hach seen in his voyages; is ic be of War, he cannot reoderto
any ocher accounc buc of the noise of the Canons; and is ic be of Love, I am well iW^
that he doth not encercain her, either wich the whiteness of her skin, or che sweetness ot h«
look; so thac I conclude he cannoc talk CO her but of his dreams, which sliould not W
pleasing, since che objeds he hath seen conduce not much to the sumisliing him wit"''''
idea's. Deliment spake so softly, as I could noc hear him; but whereas che privation ot'ig"
seemed co have rcdoubkd in Mahamed the delicacy of hearing, he loft noc one wordot m
which I have delivered.   I perceived very well, chat upon a sudden he had held his peace, i
he had bluslied, and that wichout barkening ro me he had lent an ear to Velment; buti ^.^

ante bim, and consider that your hand is too noble to punisli his arrogance; and that in Itead
of doing him an assront, you will do him an honor, whereof he is not worthy.   At this
noise the Princesses opened che C'abinee, and Axiamira asking what thematter was, saw
Ptince^/^i'^'^ws^ exceedingly moved; Icis, answered he, an insolency of Ds/jw*»s/, which
I may not tell you so suddenly; for,my dear sister, chofe of his party are yec too strong here.
Ptrca secming not Co understand chat chis discourse was addressed to her, I assure my sels, said
this subtle Princess, chat chis was one of Deliment's merrimencs, which the Prince hath mis-
understood ; hue lest chis diforder, concinued slie,sliould oblige che Sophi to forbid the Princes
from bringini? any body Co our lodging, I will go and endevor to appease this tempest. Spare
thac pain, replyed Mahamed; for cercainly, on my pare, ic sliall never be appeased but with
the death of 'Deliment.  But Terca, without answering this discourse, took Ismael by the
hand, and all amazed as he was, carryed him away whither slie pleased. We were no sooner
ac liberty Co talk, but Mahamed recounccd to the Princess Axiamira all Deliment's insolen¬
cy, and ehae withso much choller, and marks of rcsencment, as made me much to pity this
poor Prince. Will you endure, dear sister, said he unto her, that the Enemy of Mahamed
sliall become che husband of Axiamira .? That a man, which hach made use of your cham¬
ber, as of a sanduary, co assrone me wich impunity, sliall be yet so audacious as to pretend
to the pofsession of your person ? Ah 1 no, you are too generous to have such base thoughts:
and I hope, though my eyes are not able to guide my hand soasicmay give this Insolent an
hundred stabs, yec char yours will ac che least cake all che revenge of him you can, in shew¬
ing him so mmy marks of your rigor and disdain, as the love and ambition, which reign in
his heart, wanting saeissadion, he may howsoever have two domestical Enemies, which will
persecute him inccdantly, or to say betcer, until such time as I havesound out a man generous
enough to guide my zxm, or to lend rae his.   Vlama enered into the chamber just at that in¬
stant, and having heard thofe last words, wichout giving che Princess leasure to answer, he
vtent to Mahomed, and assured bim, thac excepc it were against the person of the Jop/j*, he
might dispofe of him in any thing, and employ him in such revenge as he pleased.   Maha¬
med having quickly known Vlama by his voyce: Ah 1 generous Vlama, said he unto him,
that I am not in a condition to acknowledg thy virtue, racher then to have need of thy cou¬
rage against an insamous sellow, who cannot pretend to any other part of valor, but that
which thole cruel beasts may have, who are noc valianc, buc because they are strong, and
of a bloody dispofition.  The Princess, who perceived thac in stead of being appeased, Ma¬
hamed gxevj che more incensed wich talking, made him enter into her Cabinet with Vlama,
and me; where we no sooner were, buc slie beginning co speak, assured Mahamed, that slic
was no ess sensible of Delimenis insolency then he ; that stie promised never to marry him
not, said slie, because I would have you obliged to me for ic, or chat you stiould think I do
iC tor che ove of you buc concrarily, I desire you would belecve, chac when Deliment sltie^edi
the moft love and resped CO me, I would still have made choyce of death, rather then be his
wise; tor »»yi«., bis birch, his humor, his wickedness, and his arrogance, have pofsessed me
with so much hatred against him, as there is no extremity, wherennco I will 00^5  arry °^^^

them to employ ehe time in cor/idering, whethex Mahamed stiould complain wik Soph^
or whether he should stay, to see in what manner Deliment would live with him for thcs'
ture, ascer he had forbidden him his preience.    This advice Iteming just unto thtm, they be
gan to examine the matter. As sox Mahamed, he would neicher comphin, nor stay, but
onely revenge himsels.   Vlama, who foresaw cbat no good could come of this rcvenee ei¬
ther for the Prince, or for the Princess, or for himsels, stay'd rill v^x/^w»/rrs had ddivered'hct
opinion, pretending chac he was noc to speak his, inregard, saidhe, thatit bdongcdondy

it would be, that Vlama would be constrained to abscne himsels, and leave me in the power
of the Sophi.   Asfor che Princess, she was of che opinion, thac a gendeman stiould be lent
from Mahamed co complain co the Sophi of Deliments insolency; and chat withall great
care stiould bs; caken to publisli ic, because, said she to Mahamed, it will be requisite to make
him be contemned and haced of every one,as much as pofsibly we can,chae we make use of that
hatred and contempc when time shall serve; for, continued she, the world is not acquainted
with his remericy and audaciousness; and whereas he is rich and liberal, he hach parcitans and
servancs, who durst not declare chemselves to be so, is they knew chat you and I did lute
him.   Why, sister, replyed Mahamed, would you have me publish, thac I have receivedin

of Deliment, seeing you may do ic withouc ofsence to your reputacion.   Consider, added
slic, chac is the generoficy of Vlama should carry him co sighc wich DAiment, your revenge

considerations; leeing my fortune, my blood, and my lise, could rioc be employed more

leaning on DJ/ws«r, and sollowed by Ismael ^ndTerca, who noc having seen "Delirnent

which he had to Deliment, his virtues, his merit, the assedion he bare to the Princes and
Princesses; and/»^»ts, continued he, the greatest mark that can be given me of the passion
one is in for my service, is, to render the same honors to Delment, as is he were my son;
and as for you, said he, leaning on yI^&lt;iiS'4&gt;»/r&lt;i'.r slioulder, I command you to love Deliment,
and to live well with him. It would be methinks more just, replyed ihePdnce, that you
would ordain him not to assront me, since he cannot do (o without qstending you.  I dp ex¬
cuse, answered the Sophi, the ill opinion you have of Z)*//w««», seeing it isnot occasioned
buc by the litde knowledg yoa have ofhis intentions.  But howsoever Iwill be obeyed;
and wichouc examining whecher my pleasure be unjust or equitable, I command you to jre-
ceive his submissions and his sriendship.   Hereupon Deliment began to speak, and disguising
the malice of his soul, he said so many obliging things to Mahamed, as is he had not persest¬
ly known bis wickedness, he might have beleeved that he was cjpable of repenting.   So it
was, that Mahamed was constrained to make sliew of no longer resenting the ofsence he had
received. This peace brought great joy to "Psrr*?; but/^^Arwwira'i coldness made it appa-
rane enough thae chey were noc boch of one party.   The Sophi continued yet some time in
talking of indisserent things, during the which he slill sixed his eyes on my sace: And where¬
as out of a sense of compassion, and to avoyd his looks, I turned my head all that while to¬
wards Mahamed, he began to chink that there might be some verity in Deliments sqspicion.
He was no sooner returned to his lodging, but thinking of the means to be cleared therein,
he conceived that the gentleman, who served to guide Mahamed, might peradventure be he
from whom he mighe learn something.  He had no sooner communicated this design to Deli¬
ment, bue that having apprwed of it, he thought of nothing else then execucing it.   And to
that purpofe he waiced, chat he might give no suspicion to ^&lt;*/)4Wts«/, till he was retired in
the Evening, for at thae time che Prince not using to stir forth any more, always lest his guide
at liberty; Deliment, who had caused him to be watched, was no sooner advertised that he
was come out of the Princes chamber, but he made him be secretly told, that the Sophi would
'peak with him.   This man, who had not been accustomed to receive such like savor«, pre-
leneiyobeyed; and the Sophi, joyning che hope of agreat fortune, presents, and entreaties,
to his commands, had quickly suborned his sidelity. Aster then that he was well assured of
nim, both by reason of ehe things I have spoken of, and of the sear of punistiment is be saU-
CQ in his promise, he commanded him exadly to observe all Prince AT^A^w.^V adions to

me, he answered him, that he knew no more thereof, but that the Prince spake ofteners

was not without unquietness; The spight to be so ill entreated by the Sophi, and so unwcr
thily assronted by Deliment, without having an assured mean to be revenged of it put h m
into no litde pain: And then again, when he came to think, that the next day he should en
counter with Deliment again ac Axiamira's lodging, his great heare could noc so soon re"
solve upon so grievous a thing ; he purpofed chen, for ehe declining of ie, to make a (hewof

ed for it, assuring her, that the greatest remedy he had need of was her conversation
or to be alone.  The Princess understood well enough what the Prince desired of her'
so that as (oon as she had met wich occasion sit for ie, she went to see Mahamed, carry'
ing none with her bat an old Governess, one of ray sellows, and mc. Buc Terca, havirg
understood chat Axiamira was gone to see Prince Mahamed, who was noC well, perswaded
Ismael and Deliment to go thiehet too; so that we were hardly arrived ac M^ihmeis
chamber, but we were advercised, that this Enemy troop was coming to trouble our rtll,
The Prirce was so enraged ae it, as Axiamira, searing he sliould be carryed to some violence,
made haste tobe gone, so chat meeting rhem in the anei-chamber, where she stay'dchen),Ihe
told them that the Prince being asleep, slie would not sussr tiim tobe awaked, and thereby
obliged them to return.   In the me^n timt Mahamed, who could &gt;iul forbear giving me to
understand, that he hved still forme, called to him his guide, nm)edAmariel, whoolten-
times served him also for a Secretary. He recommends secrecy and discretion to him, and
aster he had made him swear an hundred salse oaths,he didaces a leccer unto him for me, whicd
he wrote very saichsully; And having caused him to read ic over more chen once unto hiu,
he gives him order to go che next morning for to know how the Princess does, and then to de¬
liver me that letter as secretly as he could.   Amariel promises to acquie himsels thereof ashe
ought; and very glad of his adventure, he retires from the Prince, and goes wich all speed to
do an ad of sideliey to ehe Sophi, and of treachery to Mahamed. The Sophievit^t% himex-
traordinarily, and aking the leccer with very much impatience, he sees that it wasextreamlji
passionaee, and ihu Deliment's suspicions were not ill grounded.   He senc immediately for
hiri), shewed him the letter which he had, and exceedingly moved with choller, demanded
what counsel he stiould take ? T&gt;eliment, as more cunning, and less preoccupaced, told hm,
how by this letter well considered one might easily see, thit Mahamed was passionately in
love wich me, bue that one could not judg, whether I answered his passion or no; sothstto
be cleared therein, Amariel was Co deliver this letter to mc, and crave an answer of it. Tha:
for his part, he beleeved thac I did not hate him, because oneof Perca's maids had heard m
say somewhat, as stic went out of Axiamira's chamber, that made him chink so. This reso¬
lution being taken, Amariel according to his direstions came unco me, rendred me Mahmi
letter, and gave me the commodity to answer it. For whereas he was come very early, tne
Princess was not yet awake, and I was still in my chamber, wichouc any ocher company in^n
a maid that waited on me. Uncil then,I had beleeved, that I was not obliged toletW&lt;i»'

it; and in the mean time so to live with Mahamed, as he stiould have no cause to oeottc "

him with a great deal of respest, and turning the sence of his words as dextrously as lco«.

Iconsess thac many eimes I marvelled at ehe questions, wherewich thole Letcers, which i
beleevcd'were Mahamed's, were silled : and consronting the sirst I received from him with
therest  I sound so greac a disserence bee ween chem, were ie for the gracesulness ot ttieltilc,
or for the things he said Co me, as I knew noc whac Co chink of it.   Ncverchcless, seeing le was
always che same hand, and receiving chem ehe same way, all I could conclude up-nic was,
Thac che blindness of chis poor Prince pofsessed him wich such thoughts for love, as ncvci
any body had the like buc he.   For whereas che Sopht's and Deliment's design was, Co render
Mahamed concemptible co me, ehey made him wrice strange chings by Amariel.   Some¬
times chey made chis blinde Prince say, thac he was grieved he did noc see me; thac ehe beau¬
ty of my eyes was always presenc before him ; in another Leccer, thac for che more confor¬
mity he would willingly cbat I had been blinde as he was, and cbe rather for thac chen s slr-i:!&gt;t
noc see the Sophi, whom he knew Co be his Rival.  Inanocher, he conjured me co lee him
have my pidure, and co send him word whether I were sair or brown.   I leave you Co chi.'^k,
since I could noc despise Mahamed, because I esteemed him very much ocher-ways, whecher
these Leccers did noe move me to compassion ; and chough Deliment's cunning did always
intermix someehing of the Sophi among, yec I had always so much discrecion, or good hap,
as not to make any answer co chat particular.   Buc is Deliment drew up such sensless Letters
for Mahamed, thofe which he made for me, as I understood asterwards, were noc much
more reasonable.   And tbe Prince hath told me, ehae when Amariel read them to him, he
could noe chuse buc make him read them over again and again.  Ie was not because Deliment,
who ordinarily didated chem, had made them very obliging, but because the Prince, sinding
them so badly pen'd, was perswaded that ie was/^w^nV/'j saulc, who read them ill; forbe
could noe imagine, that a person, whofe wic seemed worthy of his eslicem, should express
her thoughts with so bad a grace; and to thac essed,he made him read chem over many times,
that he mighc be able c i discetn che saults of che Reader, from thofe which chey mide Co pass
for mine.

<p>Buc whil'st ehe malice of Deliment criumphed over the Saphi'^ sacility, and our innocency,
yj/rs^rsws^being well amended, caused himsels to be led to thePrincesses lodging, co render
her his sirst visir, or ro say betcer, Co have a precexC eo give me one. For he hach told rae since,
how he was noc withou; impatience Co hear mc talk, to che end he mighe know, whecher I
had still che same wic, which hc had so much prized in me. He did not marvel, thac I had
always answered him with rigor enough, because he mighe well chink that mine own vertue,
and che sear of committing my sels Co the disaecion ofhim thac was to read my Letecrs, would
carry m^ chereunto; buc to say things from ehe purpofe to him,was that which he could not
comprehend. As long as his sickness had lasted, the Princess Axiamira had been often enough
to visie him, buc Perca had moft commonly been in her company, so that we spake not toge¬
ther, uncil thae coming, as I have said, one morning to visit Axiamira, with a purpofe, is he
sound her aIone,co declare co her tbe paslion which he was in for me;not sinding her yec awake,
and making as chough he would accend cill stie was, he caused himsds to be led to my cham-
Der; when he came thieher, I had almoft done reading a Letcer from Vlama, who, provoked
Dythetorccof hispaslion, and ehe sear he was in lest the ^o^A^s love sliould prevail wich me
more chen his, conjured me co remember che promises which I had made him; never to love

rendred him, that so he mighc oblige me not eo deprive him of it.

alitjiesuspicious, though out of discretion hemakesaslicrle sliew of icas maybe, hearing
the noisc which the Letter made in turning ie from che one side to tbe other, (s, r it was indis¬

In so grievous a thoughc, this so wise and so moderate a Prince could not resist tbe ttmptati!

as I never dream'd of it, and chac I was solding up Vlama s Leccer again, and deeply muling

draw that Paper ouc ofhis hands was chac which provoked his curiofity che more; and thoDgh
he did insinitely sear to displease me, yet did he sear much more to be over-reached. And
then again, beleeving Amariel to be very saichlul, he thought he should hazard nothing, in
resolving to let him read it.   In this opinion the .more I importuned him, ehe more did hc
desend himsels fromaccording chat which I required; and I verily beleeve chac in sogreati
trouble I should have told him the truch of the matter, and consided in his generofity, \[dt-
liment, who had been advertised that Prince i^&lt;i^4Wir^ was m my chamber, had notcoiw

For he seared that so particular an incerview would discover che crick chey bad playd us j and

had not one come and advertised them, that Axiamira was awake, and chac chey mightlw

Vlama's Leccer, which be knew as soon as he had opened u ; for he bad seen many of his

cess Axiamira, whom he had sound yec more rebellious chen slie used to be. As soon as he
appeared / "^Hl no longer seek , |»icl he unco him, for that which ts the cause of Selixana s
riqor and that which makss her despise my presents, my love, and even the hope of my
O-owH ■ for ic was crue, chac Deliment entertained me dayly wich such like matcers. Ithmk,
mv Lord, answered Deliment, how that Vehtch renders Selixana inslexible ts. That the know,
ledg of your greatness permits her not to beleeve, that you Wil I forget it for her advantage ;
and the resttsals Vehichst^e makes, are nothing doubtless but that she maj be the more strong-
ly assured of that which she desires it may be more then you. No such matter, replyed Che
Sophi, and thti which I have here Veill certainly make you change your opinion; in saying
so, he sliewed him Vlamp's Leccer, whereby chey knew but too well the good-will that was
becwixe us, and how much he was informed ot chac which the Sophi bore me. Ac sitst,
all r^c/!)W.M thoughts ran into violence; he would commie me Co prison; he would destroy
Vlama ; and his gentlest resolueions were ac least Co banish him.
</p>
<p>^m Deliment, who always joyned cunning to wickedness, told him, that che sirst ching
he should do, was, eo banish Selixana from ehe heare of Vlama, and Vlama from cbe heart
of Selixana; tbac Co begin by che easiest, Vlama was to be dextrously acquainced, that!
had a particular commerce wich Mahamed; and chac Co perswade him the beceer thereunco,
he was to be shewed some of the letters which I had written Co ehe Prince,and which ehey had
recained; leting him know,in giving them to hirn,tbat they were che sirst he had received from
me; ehae Co disquiet him surther, his own Letter was eo be sliewed him, wich an assurance
ihat I had pue ie inco bis hands, tor to give him an undoubced mark of my assedion; and thac
ac the very same cime, whtn as chis crick had exciced crouble in his soul, he was co be com¬
manded Co gee instantly ouc of ehe Palace, and the next day from the Court, with order to
retire co the Province, whereof he was Governor; co the end he mighc noe have leasure co
clear himsels Co me; and chac beleeving he was becrayed, he might have the less care to let me
hear from bim. Thac things being in chesc terms, ic would be the easier to vanquisli me, be¬
cause not knowing tbe occasion which Vlama had to be incensed against me, I would take it
ill chac he did neither write to me, nor see me before his departure. That the moft important
pc)inc of chis sst'air was, to be so well assured of all chofe which came neer me, as I mighc re¬
ceive no Leteers from Vlama; and thac m sine, the absence of a Lover was a greac advantage
for a Rival.
</p>
<p>The Sophi sound this advice to be very good, and thinking on nothing buc how to exe¬
cute ic, chey turned their eyes upon one of Mahamed's Ofsicers, thac had before rimes served
VUma, who had rid himsels of him by reason of his bad inclinations. They caused him
tobcsoughcouc, and having immediately sound and suborned him, he without surcber de¬
lay (ascer he had been instrudcd by Delment whac to say, and had Vlama's Letter, and ehree
ot thofe which I h^d mitten to Mahamed, pue into his hands) wencdiredly lo Vlama

<p>too much notice of his thoughts; and therefore to keep him from it, he made as thn^oi, J
were exceedingly busied about the assairs of Caramania, vihexe the Sophi intended 3 l

to you, and you have brought to me.                                                       '            ^'
</p>
<p>This Agent of the Sephi'% sound him then in such an estate as they desired for the surprizjnp
of hirn; became to him, and sinding him alone, makes him'a long discourse of the inclinits
on which he had always had to his service; protesting untohim that he would never rdin-
quisli it; that he acknowledged him still for his Matter, and chat to render him a prod of
his assedion, he came, without considering Prince i^*^(i»)s&lt;:s'/ interests, to advertise him of
a Treason which I committed against him. Vlama upon chis occasion had a secret spspi.
cion of this mans malice; and imagined thac he was sent unco him to discover whethct there
were any intelligence beewixt us; so that nothing moved with chis discourse, / than\ tkti
laid he untohim, for thy z^eal andaseClion; but k»ow, my sriend, that Selixana W4;M
disoblige me, but cannot betray me, having had no commerce Vpith her, nor havino tvtr
trusied any thing to her discretion. I perceive very ^ell, my Lord, answered this man
that you do not trust in mine ; but it may be this Letter,Vc'hich I present you Voith,willi)tttcr
perswade my sidelity unto you. In saying so, he gave him chat which he had written to me.
You may judg now whecher Vlama were astonislied when he came toknow it; Howbeit
this sirst motion being over, he imagined surther, that I peradventure mighc have loft it, and
some one have sound it. But che cunning of this man lest him noc long in chis opinion; for see¬
ing Vlama moved, and capable of being perswaded, he told him. That Prince AUhmd had
loved me a great while, andthat I also loved him; Thatso long ashc beleeved, that there
could no other harm arrive to him, chen to bc deceived by me, he durst noc betray Mik-
med; buc having seen by the Letter, which he had written to me, andwhich, hesaid, 1 bad
put inco the Princes hands, thac he spake in such fort, as is it came to the Sophi'% knowledg,
his fortune would be utterly ruined ; he was resolved to make use of the Princes blindnessto
draw it with address from out of his hands j and, my Lord, continued he, tofhev ytittk
I ssseak, truth, I have taken also three of tbe Letters ^hich Selixana hath Written utk
Prince in the beginning of their aseSlion; str as for the resl, I durll not meddle ^ith thtm,
because as they are more obliging, so the 'Prince makes them to be read unto him almofiitp
ty by Amariel, '^ho is the Consident of this love.
</p>
<p>Vlama barkened to t.his discourse, looked on her Letters and his, knew the hands, mi
no longer doubting of myinsidelicy, he thanked chis wicked man, and asked him an hundred
questions about the love that was between ehe Prince and me. But the other searing thithe
would demand so many things of him, as in the end he might coneradid himsds in some one
or other, he besought him he would be pleased to let him depart, for sear lest is any ot Prince
Mahamed's Ofsicers should see him go out of his lodging so long ascer he was entred ino
it, ihey might susped the truth. Vlama deceived by chis artisice, dismissed him, promised
to recompence him, and prays him to continue advertising what should pass betwixt PrWK
Mahamed and me.
</p>
<p>He was hardly out of Vlama's chamber, when, according to Deliment's advice, that ow
Satrap, whom as I have told you he had corrupted, came and commanded him from the
Sophi to go itistantly out of the Palace, and che next day to depart to his Government, until
he received surther order.   And whereas 'L'irtiw^ importuned hira to tell him, whyhewij
entreated aster that manner ? The .J^i/rrs;? answered him, That the Soiphi onely k"'^''''"^
that he had charged him not to leave him tilh he "Hoas out of the Palace.   Seeing then»**"
thittgmore re sling forme, in(wered Vlama, but to give markj of my obedience, h0*i
given enough already of my sidelity and courage in other occasions, let us obey withont'^^'^-
muring. He had no sooner said so, but he prepared to be gone; howbeit suddenly rerr.jj_
Bering, that he lest all the Letters which I had written him in his Cabinet, JiewentDoi J
thither to take them away; and without knowing whether it were out of a sense ot en
or love, either to teeror preserve them, he took a lictle China cofser, wherein they w i
the old Satrap, who walked sairly and softly before, never perceiving it.               , ,r ^

J JOU have .ranted me the pardon ofthese two things, you muii also, to keep your ^ordmth

well satissied ofher, andthat it is rather choller then love, which carries me to the entertatn-
ino of JOU ttponthissub]ea,yet I cannot resolve for all that to hurt4,er. You acquaint me With
somany strange things at once, said the Princess unco him, asl doubt whecher I should be¬
leeve them; for to cell me chat you are in love with the beauty of Seltxana^nd thit Seltxatta,
in whora I conside in all chings, stiould make your assedion a secret unto me, is thai which!
cannot comprehend, and chac which I stiall not beleeve, unless you give ms stronger proots ot
it. I didnotsaj t0yoM,xep\yeithe?xince,That lam in love With the beauty 0/Selixana,

taken, though it wounds not tbe heart through the eyes,yet leaves not touching it very power¬
sully J but in conclusion I am not come hither to tell you what hath made me in love, but onely
that lamso. Asfor Sdixana, that Which hath kept her,as I conceive,from speaking to joh of
thatasseClionwhichIhadfor her, is, that she hath none for me.  Ani would to heaven I
cryed he. That she had not concealed a thingfromyou, Which without doubt touches her more
sensibly at the heart. Whereupon be recounted unco her the discourses which he had used to
me; ehe answers which I bad made thereunto; the leccers which he had written to me, the
returns I had made bim; ar^d ac last acquainced her how he had snatched away a letter from
me, whereae I had shewed a great deal of unquietness; and that having caused eAmariel to
read it to him, he had sound ic co be a Lovedeeter, and had thereby understood that I had been
a long cime engaged in assedion Co him tbac wrote it unto me, and who questionless (as might
be judged by chac which he said )ougheeo be a man of great qualicy; That his misfortune
not permiting him co know the hand, he requested her to read ic, that he might at leastwise be
assured ofthe name of his Rival. Saying so, he presented her wich that soistcd paper, which
Amarielhii given bim in stead of Vlama's lecter, and the Princess having taken and opened
is, wichout sinding any thing wriccen therein, could not chuse bussigh, and lament the mis-
fortunc of this poor Prince.
</p>
<p>Surely, said she unto bim, you have deceived your scls in taking one paper for another, for
1 see nothing in this same. 0 Sister I said che Prince, who litde suspeded the wickedness
thac had been done him, /^w^r^s truth ; you know the hand ofthis letter, but out of discre¬
tion you will not tel it me,and by this adress you would draw it out of my hands. No (uch mat¬
ter replyed the Princess, and I assure you chac 1 have spoken seriously: Why did you sigh then,
continued he, in unsolding this letter ? Ic was, answered che Princess, because I saw it was

leevc that which I am going to say to you; buc I am assured thac Selixana never wrote the
letters which you have sliewed me. Certainly, answered the Prince, is l could doubt cs mr

treat JOH to read them aloud, that Imay know whither by any imhamm(r,t the seHctUil,

The Princess,to satissie him, read two ofthofe leccers, which che Prince acknowledged tobe
the same he had heard before. I sliould beleeve, said the Princess chen to him, that Schxur.i,
knowing you could not see but wich ehe eyes of another,batb counterseited her hand, or it may
be hath caused chese letters eo be wriccen wich an unknown one, for sear It st some of them
should be seen, or loft; but thac which perswades me chere is something in che matter which
we cannot comprehend, is, Thac they are noching like eo Selixana's side, which I know very
well; for I saw almoft every leccer thac slie sent co Mazanderon when as stie wrote to her
Sather. I cannot for all that C6mprehcnd,rt^\yed che Prince,:r^rtr trick_there Jhould be intlis-
for surely Amzxklis saithsul to me, andyet the letters which Ihave stiewed yeu are not jt
obliging as ¥ehxindi's discourse ujeu to be, when I entertained her. Ac length aster they had
reasoned well Cogecher abouc ic, withouc being able co comprehend oughc therein, and had
sent a saithsul person to che Princes chamber to search for Vlama'skttex, chey resolved to
send for me,ae thac very cime when as having striven to banish shame and tear trom my minde,
I had resolved co go and cast my sels at che Princesses seec, and to rely more upon her assedion
then on mine own innocence.   I arrived then ac her chamber just as she commanded oneto
go for me; which I had no sooner heard, as I was coming in, buc seeing tbe Prince with her,
and a many of Leccers on the Table, wich a paper made up in che same manner as I/'/^jw/j
was, which the Prince had taken from me, I no longer doubced buc thac ehe Princess knew
the cruth of everything, for I could not be ignorane thac she was well acquainced with l'-
lama's hand; So ehae salling on my knees before her, I perceive very well, Aladam, said I
unto her, that all my saults are known to you, andthat coming with a purpofe to accnsent]
sels, there is nothing mere lest for me to do, then to beg your pardon for them, aster I l:d
tryed nevertheless to render them more excusable then the incensed Jpirit of Prince Mi-
med would make them appear to you.   ^omplain not of the Prince, answered Aximiu,
since is he be culpable of any thing, it ts of being too little sensible of ycur sault; wW
yet I ought not to condemn in him, since notwithstanding the ii'.jury you have done m, I
have indulgence enough sttll to hear your reasons, or rather your excuses,   AsterlsisJ
thanked ehe Princess for this grace, I began to recounc unco her all chac had pist betwixt "'-
lama and me; for whereas I beleeved chac I saw his Leccer lie by che Princess, and that 1 was
sure slie knew his charadcr, I disguised noching unco her: Buc for so much as regarded ths
Prince, I could noc tell very well how to speak of it; for noc knowing whac he had said to

thePrincess, having marked my unquiecness; Sear not, said slie, to speak ofthedjst^"'^

<p>thac Vlama made no exception but of her alone, would be an impoflible thing, as well as
to recounc unto you thac which I said in this occasion; the lamencacion chac Pnnce Mdmd
made; tbe pardons chac he begged of me; and che forrow A.viamira was in, co see hersels
deprived of the en.ly man, in whom slic consided; and withall, ie would be toolon.^and
toowcarisom a discourse; buc in sine, ehe Princess, having caused chat Slave to relate unto
her in whac manner Vlama wenc ouc of ehe Palace, told hira, That is he had any s^(«
say to me from his Master, he might do it Without sear ; and I having consirmed that which
the Princess said to him, he gave me a Note, which I sliall never forget,and whofe veiy words
were thtse.

<p>Ulama's Note to Selixana.
</p>
<p>IS you had not betrayed me, I should have dyed with gries, rather then havedsentci
my sels sris^ you ; but aster your insidelity, my bani/hment is a grace; stnce I ^uittii
i^^t Selixana, till Selixana abandoned me. 1 cannot for all thatr^olveto part, Ssithmt
telling her once for all, that I part the moft infortunate of all men living • and that is k
end of my lise may ast'ure her selicity, she Jhall soon be in the eslate that I desire k
to be irt.
</p>




<p>Theend of the reading hereof was to me the beginning of the sliar pest gries thatevctl
selc: And che alone choughc of being beleeved unsauhs^ul by a man, forwhom Iresusedthe
Crown of 'Persta, was so strange a corment Co me, as my reason is noc strong enough tore-
tain ehe resencmene which I had of ic. Whac I Madam, said I co che Princess, can you live
in a place where such wickednesses are commieeed? and against persons tbac apperninto
you? Was it not enough Co banisli'L'/^iw^, withouc perswading him by some impoOuts,
which is unknown Co me, thac I bad betrayed him? andiemsybc icis I which causes him
to be banished. This arcisice doubtless hides some greacerdesign,chen ches paratingof us;
and I greatly sear chat this violence will quickly be sollowed by anocher; and chac aster thcj/
have taken from you che onely desender which you had here, you will know by your exp-T-
ence, that you have as much incerest, as Selixana, in cbe conservaeion of Vlama. For sure¬
ly Deliment thinks not so much of concencing che Sephis passion, as of sacissying that whiclj
he hath for you: And this Insolenc regards you withouc doubc, as a reward chac was destinw
to him for the conquest which he preeends to make of me; buc s am righc certain thatdeatlj
sliall deny me her succor,or he sliall never triumph in chis fore. The Princess seeing a great de^
of probabilicy in thae which I said, could noc chuse buc accompany my cears with hers; ana
vW^i^rsWsi/was soasslided, as achwarc my forrow I saw his resentment.

<p>Butatlasi, for ehe becter clearing of ehe maecer, ic was demanded of chac Slave, wni
V lama h^d done all theday, and what hehad seen? Then herelaced, how oneof Pnnce
Mahamed's Ofsicers came unco him; had calked wich bim in secret, and given him some k^^

so many procestacions of mine innocency, as is for thac once his minde was noc sully «tished,
vet was ic ac che least morequiee, and his despair was curned into a more moderace assiirtion.
Mahamed also Would gladly have been able himsels to have sene some marks of his sriend¬
stiip to Vlama, buc he was sain co assure him by the hand of the Princess, thae he would al¬
ways be nis sriend, wichouc ever being his Rival again. These LeeceiS being wntctn, che
sear lest they sliould be incercepced came inco ray minde; so chat eo prcvene ic, che Prmcess
sene for an old Slave, whom slie had proved to bevery saithsul, and having given them to
him, stie commanded him to attend thae of Vlama ac ehae gacc of the Ci;y where be was to
pass- and there to deliver chem to him in such fore, ss no body might perceive ir. This pro¬
vidence was noe in vain, for this Slave of V lamas was no sooner come forth of tbe Princesses
lodging.buc he wasarrested by Deliment'soxdex,2x\d asked for ehe Leteers which he carryed to
Vlama; buc knowing very well chac he had none, he answered wichouc daunting, how he
was ready eo mike ic appear chat they were mistaken; and said surcber, thae his Master having
had no cime to take his leave of the Princesses, and none of his servancs being wich him buc
he, he had sent hira wich a complemenc to them; and whereas he was hard by Perca's lodg¬
ing, he would have gone in there, to give the more colour to this ofsicious lye; howbeit they
would not permit him cill they had throughly searched him all oVer, to see is he had spoken
the cruth: And when chey sound thac he had noe that which they thought he had had, they
let him go, and so he sinished his voyage, asterhehad taken our Letters from him to whom
we had committed them.
</p>
<p>As for us, seeing the matter in these terms, we resolved that the Princess should assure her
scls of them, whom the beleeved were saithsul unto her, by new protestations ofthe assedi¬
on they had promised her. That I should write secretly to my Sacher, to the end chat is we
were enforced to have recoursc to excream remedies, and thae slighe was the onely one that
rested for us, Mazanderon might be in an estate co receive us. Thae in ehe mean cime, to
prevent ehe Sophi, before hehad taken his last resolueions, we sliould publisli the business,
complain to all the world of Deliment's insolency; and thac the nexe morning slie sliould go
and request ehe ^o/&gt;^&lt; to forbid him from ever seeing her again; because it mighe be, thae he
durst n()e so easily then propound a thing to her, whereunto stie sliewed her sels so averse, as
when disguising her ehonghes in the maner slie had always done, he mighe seem eo be ignorant
that stie had so much repugnancy unco ic Thae to perplex him so much the more, slie sliould
send to encreae sive or six persons, thae were well assedcd to her, to be present at the Sophi's

swer he sliould make. That Mahamed sliould by his Governors means do whac he could to
cause ^W4ns/to be caken; that for so much as regarded me I sliould by no means bc absent
from the Princess, and that for sear of some violence I sliould lie in her chamber in the place
ot her that always waiced upon her there. This resolution was execueed,as we had conceived

<p>though the banisttment of UUim had both surprized and assiiUed her, because (he hde
him to be the moft asselied of all hii su bjeCls to the good ofhis Empire, yet the reshell "ll
she bare him Would never permit her to murmur at it: And to tell you what hath br

be agreeable unto you, but onely that you Will forbid Dehment from ever seeing or j|im((«|

from interrupting her, had st) much address, as not to nanje Deliment, but ac the end of het
discourse, which strangely surprized the Sophi.
</p>
<p>Now though he was very much in choller, and that he had resolved to make thismartlage,
yet durst he not before so much company tell het openly what his minde was: Buc to disgi
the matter; I see Well enough, Axiamira, said he unto her, that Deliment's ^rsrs/;/ crim
is your beleeving him to bean enemy to Ulama; howsoever stnce you have recoursc ti«j
justice,I will neither condemn nor absolve him,till I have heard his reasons. Which ptrdm-
ture Will not beso weak as you think: In the mean time be assured,that Delimenc &gt;?&gt;«//w'/j
any thing to you henceforward, but by order from me. The Princess Would sain have rcplytd,
hue the Sophi made her a sign to withdraw, which slie did with a great deal of respest; k»-
ing the Sophi very much displeased, and all them thac had heard her ravislied wich hcrgeneso-
sicy, and excreamly wondering at D&lt;r//&gt;we«t'i insolency, andthehtcle resencmene which *
Sophi had slie wed. At our going from chence we met with 7/w4*/,sollowed by Deliment,viiB,
knowing noching of what the Princess had done, would have obliged the Prince co conduct
her to her lodging : But Axiamira beholding him with contempt, said unto him with an itj
censed voyce; / sar bid thee from the Sophi to sollow or to speak. to me ; and is thou w
know the cause of it, repair to him, and thou stialt learn that at last my patience huth ^.w

I have already Cold you, illustrious Bassa, how he who waited that day at the Sopht 9
Cabinet door, over-heard all that I have recounted unto you; for the passion, wherewith
Deliment was carryed away, permitted him not to have so much prudence as to speak low;
n-itherdid the .yo&gt;^t's love and choller leave him the sike providence. This man having heard
all these things, selc himsels so couched with the mischiets they were preparing for us, ashe
resolved to advertise us of it.  Ic is crue indeed, that his generofity was in this occasion excited
by a particular hacred whichhe bare Deliment, who had many times oppofed the advance¬
ment of his fortune.   At length this man came in the Evening to advertise us of all these
things; aster which we alsolearned that which had past inthe trick that y^?»&lt;«m/had put
upon as.   For Prince Mahamed had caused his anciene Governor so to deal, as he had layd
hold on the Tray cor y^WsirtV/, who out of thesame weakness wherewich he had becrayed
his Master, recounced unto us how Deliment had corrupced him; and how he had carryed all
my leccers Co cbe Sophi, who had always caused ochers to bc wriccen for Co bc sent to Maha¬
med ; from whom likewise they had retained all thofe which he had made to be written to
me, to give me counterscic ones in stead of them.   That asterwards he had carryed Vlama's
Leccer, which he had snatched from me, to the Sophi; who by Deliment's counsel had cau¬
sed ic Co sall inco Vlama's hands, wich three ochers of thofe which I had essedively writeen
to the Prince.   We knew chen chac Evening all the hurt that they had done us, and all that
which they would do us; whereupon we promised to pardon the Tray tor, and to recom¬
pence him thac was saichsul unco us, dismisling chem both, with diredion to eieher ot them co
be vigilanc for ehe good of ehe Princess.  Ascer these sad news our tears redoubled sar more
then before.   The Princess would dye, Iwas sully resoved to sollow her, Mahamed wis
mad because he could not assist us; and in so great a trouble we lamented our misfortunes,
withouc knowing how Co avoyd chem.   "   '   ■       &lt;  •   - ■           •     ^

were certain dangerous moments, which is by prudence avoyded, our enemies can no lono^^'^
execute their bad designs; that they were to give the Sophi leasure to resled on that whicS
was going to undertake; and to that end, when as he stiould come to speak to the Princts
slie sliould have recoursc to tears and to prayers, rather chen to reason, which he would J,'
understand: That is they sliould not be strong enough to divert him from his dcsit^ns, as it«/«
very likely they would not, slie sliould then request him co asford her some time to resolve
to obey him.   And to the end she might not by her sadness give him new occasions of dis
pleasure, she sliould d.^mand permission of him to absent her sels from the Court for can n
months, with a promise no longer to resist hi? pleasure when slie returned thither again; tb
in the mean time it might happen, that che Sophi might repent him; that the love wh'chhc
bare me might be alcered,or allayed by absence; but, conci.iued he, the principal is, Thatso
lixana do not remain here.   / know suU Well, answered I, that Iwill never aludm it
Priacess but to dye.   tAnd for my part, said the Princess, / k,now sull well th^i Sehxsm
siall not dye without me, and that 1 will never abandon her to the violences esmisatkr,
In conclusion, generous Ibrahim, without rchearsing this sad conversacion to you, it m
resolved, that is the King sliould accord Axiamira that which she was to demand of him
and yet would retain me, I sliould then desire him, with all che shew of forrow and tendr-
ness I could pofsibly express,to permit me to sollow the Princess; it being credillc that the.Jt.
phi would not resuse me the sirst thing I should crave of him ; especially not mentioning ttai
my oppofing of his pleasure.   It was not because the Princesses great heart did not resist tk
sollowing this counsel, but because slie being unable to sinde out any other,was forced tocon-
sent unto it.  The next day the Sophi came to the Princess, where aster he had amplisied the
merit, the vercue, and the courage of Deliment, he told her that slic was not to take it ill, is
he had had the boldness to speak to her of love, seeing hc had not done it but by hifordet;
because, having resolved to marry her to him, he would have been glad that he should have
got her good-will.   My Lord, answered the Princess, with a seigned amazement, is 1 kl
known that the boldness, which Deliment hath used injpeakjng te me, had been an ejstHij
his obedience toy oh, I bad received him in another manner, I had not termed him aukc'm,
I had been contented With complaining, and not accusing of him, and had cast mjsstls*t]i»r
seet to cause you to change a design, Whereunto I have such an aversion, as I canmt (imi
of it Without gries.   The Sophi seeing some change, as it seemed to him, of the PrinceKsS
minde, was extream glad of it; and though he saw slie did not render her scls, he betetved
nevertheless, since slie came to' entreaties, that with some pacience he mighc vanquish her.
This hope was that which induced him ehe more easily to grane her rhe request slie madehim,
to give her time to resolve upon ir.   And truly he had been the cruellest of all men, is ht™
not let himsels be moved with the reasons, complaints, supphcacions, and tears of thers
amiable Princess chat ever was. But when he had permicced her to go co Mazanderon^ w^
(he had propounded untohim for the passing away of the time of her exile, as insS
where stie had been before times for her pleasure, he told her that stie was to leave me bchrt
with the Princess Perca, tothe end the Court might not bedesolated, and for searalsow
my sather having mc in his power, stiould not restore me nnto her when slie returned. I ^
in a corner ofthe chamber, where I anderstood all thac they said; but when I h"^'^/,'"^'^

my sels at his seet, and I said so many things, Islied so many tears, and answered hiinio^
vorably to certain questions that he asked of me, and which concerned the design he WT
on me, as atlength I sound, that the tears of a beloved person are very powersul arms;   .
\ne,the Sophi granted me that which I demanded of him, though it were absolutely K
his minde.   But that Deliment might not have leasure to get the permission which m

us no whic pleased him; buc rob: secured iasome fore, as he is thecunningest man in che
world, he did chac which you sliall hear, and which txtreamly surprized us: for when we
m'mditMazanderon, we sound chac my sacher was gone from thence to the Courc by the
commandment of the Sophi, from whom he had received express order to repair thither with
all speed; and thac by cbe counsel of Deliment, who as soon as he knew that wc were gone
to Mazanderon, perswaded the Sophi to send for my sather, before we sliould be arrived
there; ini to ordain him to come another way, for sear of meeting us; to the end, said he to
the Sophi, that ss//'«^«(?, knowing her sather in your hands, may not carry che Princess to
disobey you, nor her sels to resist you, as hitherto she hath done. I leave yoa to judg whe¬
ther rhis adventure did not give us unquietness enough, especially to me. What 1 said I,
must I betray Vlama, or abandon my sather to the Sopht's violence ? Ah, no 1 I had rather
dye; and not able to satissie both ray duty, and ray love to Vlama, I will dye that I may not
be wanting either to the one or the other. But at length we understood by a Letter, which
Prince Mahamed caused his sage Governor to write unto us, and by one thsit my Sa'.i.cs
sent me, how che Sophi entreated him very well, and made him hope for great things.

<p>The sirst sense of gries then being over, we began to breathe, and take some rest; But
alass! how soon was this rest thwarted ? and what a strangc remedy did Fortune make use
ct, to deliver us both from the Sophi's tyranny, and Deliment's violence 1 Th? Princess, ro

<p>Iwill not stand. Madam, to rehearse unto you the transports of joy which I observed la

since not doubting of his asscdion.you cannot doubt of his resentment of it. But indeed I will
tell you, how aster that sirst motion of joy was over, it wasno little unquietness to himso

he beleeved that it was best in this occasion to obey the Sophi's pleasure, seeing it would have

knew hkewise tbac my Masters pirty was not so weak at Court, but that     it came to ex
tream v. inc^  ic might peradventure cause a general revolution of the State, which would
no be ad o'age us to him: So that to provide for all the misfortunes, which t™ght «rive
unto h.m, he had recourse to artisice.   And to that purpofe  just at the time W^jn »s the jJ.-
phi commanded Vlama to repair unto him, &lt;I&gt;enment made hira be several ways advertised
of the bad designs, which were upon his lise, and carryed themattersodextrously, as the
saithsiill. st of tny Masters sriends served to the wickedness tjs this man; who in stead ot
keepine the design of ruining Vlama very secret, caused it to be bruited with address abroad,
two days before he, who was to carry the commandment to Vlama, set forth towards him:
So that when he came eot^/4»»4, he had already received advice spom many not to come to
the Court.  Even Mahamed himsels had caused him to be writeen unco about it, bue with
so many circumstances, as made him see his undoubced ruine, is he obeyed; in so much as it
was impofsible for him Co susped, that there was any artisice in all these things.   Some coun¬
sclled him CO seek out a place of reereat amongst strangers; promising to labor the justisying
of bis slight whil'st he was absent.   Ochers would have had him fortisie himsels in his Go¬
vernment.  But none advised him to trust to his innocency.  I leave you to think. Madam,
whether De/iws«s's wickedness could have had a more savorable success? and whether all
these things were not capable of bringing to pass the design which he had, soto order the
matter, that Vlama sliould not onely not repair to the Sophi, but sliould also render himsels
essedively culpable in the eyes of all the world, who aster this would not be so forward in
undertaking his interests.
</p>
<p>'L'/^iw^ in this crofs con jundure knew not what resolution to take: for is, on theone
side, he considered the peril whereunto he should be expofed, by going to put himsels into
his enemies hands; is he thought, I say, that you not being at Court, his party would thereby
be the weaker, znd'Deliment'sx.heskxongex; on the other side he saw, that in not obcylnr:
be lest his Enemy Master of the Sield; that hesurnished him with Arms to destroy him , 'Cai'-
he sliould behave himsels as is he were guilty; and to say all, that he should abandon you, and
&lt;\mSelixana. This last thought made him resolvc to go couragiously to the Court j how¬
beit he was kept si^om parting so soon, by a sickness wherewith sie was taken: but at length
sinding himsds betcer, he see forth on his way, with a purpofe to oppofe Deliment's malice
as much as he could, and to forget nothing that might conduce thereunto. But scarcely had
we made two days journey (for as you know. Madam, I have never abandoned him) when
as we encountred one of his dearest sriends, who came in all haste to acquaint him, that all
the Courc was silled wich the news of your lofs, 3ind Selixana's. That in the Royal House
ic was said, howgoingasisliing yon were cast away; but chac such, as looked sarther into
raaccers, beleeved chac your lofs was a meer suppofition; and that without doobt youwera
kept sliuc up in some pare. That it was an essed of the Sophi's passion, and of Deliment's
violence; that in the sassiion as the matter was carryed, there was no remedy to be sought for
It; thac going to the Court, he sliould sacrisice himselsnnprofitably for you, and much to the
advanrsge of Deliment; and that in conclusion, the best he could do was to seek a sanduary
with forae Prince, mighty enough to desend him, and just enough to acknowledg bis merit.
Judg, Madam, m what manner my dear Master received this deadly news, and how much he
resented an adventure, whereby tie for ever loft the hope of seeing you again ; andwherebv

him with your lofs, wholly transported with gries, and quite changed in his countenance-
Let us go, siid he,dear sriend; let tu go and dye in some remote place, since I am sep.iratcd for
ever from Selixana.   At this word he sell down dead in my arms,and I beleeved.seeing him in
this pitisul estate, that gries had done that which his despair would have executed.   By good
hap we were not very sar from a Country house, whither having carryed him with thehdpof
his sriend, we brought him oat of his swoon; but it mighe be said that it was some crutlty in
us to bring him to his senses again, because withall we restored him to his forrow and despair.
Oh, said hc, Selixana is in a condition, that the best stie can be for me, is not to be at all!
Oh, i^s/&lt;j;&lt;«»4 is in the arms of death, or in the power of the J'op^&lt;.' Ah! no, no, ktusnot
be so base, as to support this gries.   Is Selixana be dead, let us sollow her generously; and
is slie be anothers, let us not survive our ill forcune.   Then on a sudden beginning again
asterhehad held his peace a hccle; Whac, sliall the Princess y^ArwwVrs, che glory of her stx,'
and of our age, be the wise of a man, unworthy to be her Slave? and shall we live aster
we have so often sworn to her to dye for her service, and to desend her from the insolency of
Deliment I Ab 1 that may in no fort be ; and since I cannot succor her, I know at leastwise
how Co testisie to her by my death, that the sear of lofing my lise hath not kepc me from op-

some strange design upon himsels: But perceiving that his scimitar was gone,which by chance
was sallen trom him, we not being aware of it, as we were carrying him in a swoon to that

Ah I no, no, continued he, I sliall easily sinde Wherewithall to end my lise and my misirits.
Generous Vlama, answered his sriend iinto him, we had no intent to take your scimitar from
you ; since contrarily, in the estate wherein I see things, it would methinks be sitter to seek
for arms to revenge yoa, rather then to destroy you: For is Selixana be dead, you cannot
lofe your sels more nobly, then in revenging her of them, which have been her Enemies du.
ring her lise: and is slie be not, what do you think slie will say, whenas slie stiall know,
thac the generous Vlama, in stead of stirring up the people, of demanding succor of seme
forraign Prince, of marching in the head of an Army to assail her persecutors, weakly aban¬
dons her, in abandoning hirasels to his despair? and cntrcatsher yet more cruelly then For¬
tune doth, sinCe he will deprive her of the onely man that can deliver her, and the onely per¬
son whom stie loves. And how will you have me dehver her, isl know not in what place
of the Earth stie is ? That, my Lord, answered I, must be caresully enquired aster: but is
you stiould not discover any thing, yet must you take up Arms: For is you are igriorant where
Selixana is, you are not ignorant at least-wise who are the Enemies of the Princess Axii-
mira and Selixana.   I sliould never have done. Madam, is I stiould rehearse all Vl*m^
discourses unto you.   Sometimes he would kill T)elim:nt, though we made it apparant to
him, that it would be almoft an impofsiblc thing ; again he would present himsels to M-
phi; then he would go unknown to J/^«Wsro«, to enquire himsels of your lofs: But for
a conclusion of all, he still returned to the resolution of dying.   At leng.h without oppofing
our selves diredly to his gries, we knew so well how to inspire his minde with choller, as isc
sole design of revenging you preserved hislise.   He resolved then to return tohisGovOT-
ment for to think of the raeans he was to use for the same.   As for his sriend, he sent m
back again, and pray'd him still to advertise him of whatsoever stiould pass at thetoflrt,

nitiHra which is within Soliman's dominion, and not above sour days journey from Via-

ten to tbe taithiuUest of his sriends, to entertain some intelligence with them, in case he Ihould
have need ot it, set forch cowards Siri/iA; and committed himsels into the hands of one,
named .S.r.s^^^. unto whom this Town appertained, as Vassal of the 0//jow^« Empire. But

person, by pucting a guard upon him, uncil he heard from Soliman, he caused him co bc seiz¬
ed upon, Co be bo'und, and in chic deplorable estate sent him to Constantinople.
</p>
<p>In the mean tirae I had made my voyage very happily; and having delivered my Letter to
Ibrahim, I well perceived thathe was very joysul of ic; that the reputation of my Master
was come even unto hira ; and that he was not ignorant of his high birch; As truly a little
aster, he obtained for Vlama all that he had demanded ; And as he was preparing to send to
receive him with honor, and was talking with him in the Hipodrome, before his Palace gate,
about my return, I saw my Master arrive bound upon a horse, his hands manacled, and his
sace so changed, as I hardly knew him: but being sure it was he, without thinking of the
resped I owed to the grand Visier, Hest him, and approaching to'L'/^w**; My Lord, said
I to Ibrahim, susser not him whom you mean to proted to be so unworthily entreated; nor
let the valianc Vlama be chained like a Slave.   Vlama I cryed che grand Visier: Yes, gener¬
ous Ibrahim, concinued I, you behold chac Vlama, whofe valor is incomparable ; whofe'
bitch is as noble as any in all Tersia; and who bach demanded protedion of none but you.
I had no sooner said thus, but Ibrahim ran himsels to unloofe my Master; and beholding
them which accompanyed him with sury, he willed me to help him, which I did witha
great deal of joy.  As for Vlama, he was in such a consusion to see himsels in that estate, as
he could almoft have wished that I had not named him: but the thing being done, and hav¬
ing understood that the ^rrs«s/ Sister spike the Persian Tongue; These chains, said heunto
him, generous Ibrahim (for he had observed that I had named him so) are glorious unto me,
seeing they are taken siom me by so illustrious an hand as yours: And owing my liberty to
you at our very sirst encounter, judg whether all tbe rest of my lise I sliall not absolutely de¬
pend on you ? It is true, replyed Ibrahim embracing him, that these chains are not slaamesul,
but for thole that have made you wear them; and by a sate clean contrary to that of all deli¬
verers, I must, ascer the sreeing you of them, crave pardon of you for the ill usage you have
received; yet sofar happy at least-wise herein, as you cannot susped ^o/&lt;w&lt;«» for it, who, is
I be not deceived, will make them seel tbe weight of your chains which have layd them on
you.   Vlama answered thereunto with a great deal of civility, and at length the grand
Visur caused him to enter into bis Palace, which was hard by, charging some of his servants
to se;ze upon them thac accompanyed Vlama, for sear lest any of chem sliould steal away, to
go and advertise Seresbeg how his indiscrcet zeal was not well received.   When these two
illustrious persons were come in, Ibrahim sliewed Vlama the Letter he had written him
the order he bad taken for his reception; and aster he had told him, that he might comand ill
his house, he went to give an account of his arrival to Soliman, who wasso incensed a
gainst Serejbeg, that his anger broke out terribly upon him, as you sliall understand
hereatter.

Eieoiy, as much as pofsibly he could ; but the Sultans pleasure was to be obeyed.
</p>
<p>This Declaration being made, i'tr^/^s^ was advertised of it by some sriends that he had
at Const-antinople; so that, provoked wich anger, he stole away; and pasling inco iheSofhi's
Territories, he went andofs'ered him his service.   In so much as it seemed, that thesetwo
Princes had made an exchange, and given hoftages to each other: Though it is true, that the
matter was not equal for the persons, Seresbeg having nothing recommendable in him, but
a brutish valor, which carryed him into perils without knowing them.   But at last Vlmt
repaired to BitiUsa, whereat his sirst coming hesound sit matter to exercise his generofity
upon ; for Seresbeg's Wise and Children came and cast themselves at his seet, and wholly dis¬
solved into tears, humbly besought him to grant them the grace of her Husband and their
Sather.  "L'/^w** jRiswered them, that had he been in an estate to receive it, hc would havc_
used bis uttermoft endevor to have obtained it of the Sultan: but as things were, it wasa
propofirion which he durst not make.   Then they rcquesled him, at least-wise not to entreat
them ill.   Vlama, who had no such intent, assured them, thae Bitilija exapted, which he
was bound to conserve for the grand Signior, he would not keep any part of their estste
from th' m,though thty had very great riches; and told them moreovcr,that it they would con¬
tinue in BitiUsa, they stiould be respeded there as himsels; or is they would go from thents,
hc would obtain permission of Soliman to have them conduded whithersoever they pleased.
This aslsl:ded and generous woman, see'mgV lamas courtesie, besought him so to deal as
stie might be sussered to sollow the fortune of ber Husband; ^Nh\ch Vlama promised her,
and performed a httle aster.   For having obtained of the Sultan that which he had desired of
him for her and her children, he caused all their wealth to be loaden in Waggons; and having
assured them ofthe restirution of BitiUsa, is peace were concluded, or is Seresbeg re-entred
into savor with the Grand Signior, he sent them with a convoy of sour hundred sHrnurit'
into the Sophi's Territories; for some Troups were already come unto him for his saseguard,
Soliman having given command to all the Sangia's thereabouts to march whithersoever s/«-
ma would lead them.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, whereas you and i='&lt;'/».s:&lt;i«« were the cause of all that he did, hisontiy
care was to discover is any news could be had of you.   He wrote also to Prince Mahnwdi
ancient Governor, desiring him ro entreat his Master, that he would, for his excuse of wh»t ™-'
was going to do, but remember how ic was onely eo revenge the Princess Axiamira and Is-
lixana. Buc hearing noching ofyou, le pue him into such sury,and into so great a despair.tM
his ordinary valor redoubled much more then before, as well appeared in the occasions\«w
were presented a little aster.   For/^r4^/w leading the vant-guardof the Imperial Army,

Hsa wbi.h was accordingly performed with all the ceremony accustomed in such like occasi¬
ons' As long as this War lasted, Vlama did what he could to encounter Delment; but not-
withstanding^sll his endevor for it, fortune would not let him sight wich him.
</p>
<p>Inline, Madam, Wincer approaching, Soliman put part of his Troops mco Garrison, and
retired to Constantinople with Ibrahim; leaving Vlama on the srontire, where he desired to
remain, not being able, as he oftentimes told me, to eloign himsels from a Land, where he
beleeved you were still abiding. Not long aster Vlama being advertised that the Sophi was
gone from Sultania, whither he had retted, and seemed to have some great design in band,
he drew moft ot tbe forces out of the Garisons, and making up a body of an Army, he went
with it to oppofc the Enemy. But the Sophi, who did not desire to sight with Vlama, saw
him no sooner in the sield, but he began to recoy l,contenting himsels oriely with seizing on the
passager, and cutting ofs his viduals, caresully forbearing from descending into the plains, for
sear he she uld be forced to come to a battel. This artisice, which proceeded from ^Deliment,
would tor all that have availed him little, and my Masters valor would have surmounted this
stratagem, is the anger of Heaven had not been joyned to the anger of men, and sought for
tbe Persians. For it happened that Vlama, having had bad intelligence, went and encamp¬
ed in that great plain, which is neer to Sultania, and as you know is invironed with sour
mountains, whofe tops are always coveted withsnow, chiesly thofe of Cassi^ indNipha-
tes. Vlama beleeving then that the J'&lt;?/&gt;/;/was retired behinde thofe mountains,at thesoot
whereof are the goodliest plains in the world, andthe moft proper to sight a battel in, was
there erxamped, as I have already declared; but the Sophi bad taken another way, and
was retired into the Country of the Coraxens, As Vlama then was in this place, there a-
rofe on the rop of thofe mountains so terrible a tempest, as thewindc carrying away thofe
huge heaps of snow, wherewith they were covered, drove them in such abundance, and
with such raging force upon Vlama's Camp, as all the Tents were overthrown by them j
moft ofthe Camels stisled; all the sick Soldiers overwhelmed; some of the others burieda-
live wich them; and all the test in consusion.
</p>
<p>And whereas rhe Snow had extinguislied all the sires in the Army, the darkness joyned
to the roaring of the winds, to the noise which tbe Snow made in overturning the Tents,
totbecdesot the Souldiers in answer tothe Commands ot their Leaders, and to the la¬
mentations of dying men, rendered chis night so dreadsul, as I do not think one can meet
with an occasion able to give more terror then that did: the constancy of Vlama was noc for

the^Mountains.  But at last upon the return of the day, the tempest ended and the S"
us see one of the pitisullest objeds that ever was beheld.  This deadly sight, able to I!!'
courage of any but Vlama, augmented his; and he resolved to be revenged ofhis Enem.!
the lofs he had sustained by the Tempest.   Wherefore he made a speedy review of his 17
and sinding that he had loft but two thousand raen that nighr, he concluded to set upon7'
Enemies.   He sent forth some then to discover, whil'st they were labouring in some fort t ^
repair the diforder of the Tents; and having gotten an advantageous place, be stay'd ther
till he understood that the Sophi came on suriously towards him; for whereas reports increase
at a distance, he had been told that Vlama had loft above sisteen thousand men.   My Maltet
glad of this occasion, albeit his Army was overtoyled and weary, couragiously exhorted them
to sight.   But, Madam, without particularizing a Battel unto you, whereof the event was not
profperous to my dear Master, I will only tell you, that aster he had almoft vanquished hisE-
nemies, sussering himsds to be carried away by his extream valor,he was hemmed in by shove
an hundred men, who knowing him to be the General of their Enemies Army, assailed him
with such sury, ashe was dangerously hurt by them in soUr several places; so as all thathe
could do was to rid himsels from his Enemies, still sighting till hc got to his own men, where
he was no sooner arrived but he sell down dead amongst them. This accident made the vido¬
ry change party, and range her scls wholly on the Ter pans side, who remained Masters ofthe
sreld : In the mean time Vlama's wounds proved great and dangerous; he was carried to the
nearest town, and srora thence to BitiUsa, where he hath always continued, whil'st the So^ln
making profit of his misfortune and absence, regained all that/^r^i!)sw and he bad conquered.
Howbeit Vlama was a long lime wichoat knowing any of thofe things: for his wounds re¬
duced him to so bad an estate, as no assair was communicated to hira. And whereas I was
always about him, so ofcen as the violence of his sickness would permie him to speak, itwas
always of grieving to dye, before he had revenged you; but when an Arabian Pbylician,
which looked unto him, had assured us that he was out of danger, the sirst thing hewas ac¬
quainted with, was the deseat ofhis Army, the lofs of Tauris, your imprisonmcnt, and Ptk-
ana's.   But he understood this last by such consused reports, as he could not comprehend by
what adventure you were here.   His sirst thought in this occasion leaned to joy, and he wk
very glad to hear that you were living, that you were not in the power ofthe Sophi, andthat
at length he might hope to see you again.   But this sirst motion being over, he entered into
another quite contrary.   What, said be, do I sight against my lawsul Prince,to endeavor the
delivery of the Princess Axiamira and Selixana, or to revenge them ? and whil'st I hazard my
lise with this intention, it salls out that I slied my blood for the service of a Prince, who keeps
them prisoners; and Fortnne,that is become ingenuous to persecute me,makes me sight against
thofe which oppofe him who oppresseth and ill-intreateth them I Pardon me, continued he,
great Ptincess,the crime which I have done; pardon me,dear Selixana,the error which I have
committed ;-and knoW,that though I am covered all over with wounds which I have received
in serving thy Enemy, yet have I heart enough still lest me to undertake the deliverance of thee.
I stiould never have done, Madam, is I would recount unto you all that hc said upon this oc¬
casion.                                                                                                           ,,,
But at last, aster he had used his uttermoft endeavor to be carried into a Chariot, againlttK
advice of his Physician, he was constrained to stay two days journey from BitiUsa; soth«
knowing itwas impofsible for him to proceed surther on his way as yet, hessentmetotw
grand Visier, with diredion, is hc were not returned from a secret expedition, upon which
It was said he was gone, to attend for him, and to endeavor by his means to see you, jnJ ^o

<p>My imagination, representing to me all at once whatsoever I am to recount unto you,silleth
my mind with so much consusion and gries, as I doubt whether I sliall be able to deliver things
precisely unto you, as they arrived unto us, and whether I shall not stand in need ofthe Prin¬
cesses goodness, to put me in mind theretrs", is I sliould sail in acquainting you with some cir¬
cumstance of that which you desire to know. But to come to my discourse, I will not stand
then to tell you in what manner we sussered Shipwrack; only 1 will say to you, that wben
we judged by the cries of the Mariners we were in danger of perishing, I approached tothe
Princess, whofe great heart was not shaken inthis occasion, but contrarily seared the Port
more then Shipwrack, and casting my sels at her seet, I demanded of her with tears the
grace that I might dye by her. This generous Princess imbraced me, and taking me by the hand
slie never quitted it, till the Vessel, driven by the wind and the waves with an incredible im-
pecuoficy against cbe point of a Rock, broke all to pieces, and separated us,butii'. what raanner
it was done I am not able to tell you; for I was so troubled, and the horrors of dtath seized
on me in such fort at that dreadsul instant, as I knew not what became of me. Yet was not
tbe Sea altogether unpitisul unto us, for by an extream good fortune in the midst ofour ill for¬
tune, it carried us to the slioar, which was not sar ofs; and not only prescsved our lives, but
made me be sound within thirty paces of the place, where the waves had ast up the divine
Axiamira in a swoon as well as I.

<p>Buc admire, my Lord, that which I am going to tell you I and how weak beginnings have
sometimes long and dangerous conseqaenccs 1 You may well remember how I told you ye-
sterday, that the Sophi gave the Princess Axiamira's and my pidure to a forreign MercJhant,
with order never to sell them to any but Princes: And you have told me, is The noc deceived,

<p>gave him that of the Princess Axtamira for mine. Now, my lord, the hme error productd

</p>
<p>The same day wherein we sussered Shipwrack, Prirxe danger (who as yeu know remain d
by Solimans Order very near to the place where we were cast on slioar) walking that way
came by chance where I lay extended on the sands as a dead person. This accident suipnzid
him; my sex, my age, my habit, which was rich and extraordinary; and more then allthat
the pity whereof this vertuous Prince was capable, caused him to approach unto me, and not
judg me unworthy of his assistancc. And then again, though theestate wherein! was had
insinitely changed me, he conceived that I was not altogether unknown to Iwm, and thatse
had seen something that resembled me. But he had no sooner made the sand, which deavtd
to my sace, to be taken away, but his memory brought back into his imaginatitn my pidure
whichhe had bought of that Merchant, andwhich he believed to be Axi^mir/i. And
whereas by chance he had it about him that same day, he opened tbe case wherein it was, arid
observing there all the seatures of my sace, though the ayr ot it was somewhat charged, he no
longer doubted but that I was the Princess of Psr/i&lt;», consitminghimstls surther inthiscpi-
nion by my apparel, which he saw to be altogether like to that which 1 wore in my p slute.
Vox the Sophi having sound, that the habit of an Amazon, which the Painter badgivenus,
was more advantageous then ours, would needs have the Princess and I wear it ever aster. In
this belies. Prince Cw^^^r redoubled his care; and seeing me setch a sigh, which made him
know that I was still alive, he caused me tobe carried to the next house to the place where I
was; and commanded some of his people to go along by the Sea slioar, to see is thty could
sind any other person that had need of succour, imagining rightly, that I had not susscied Ship¬
wrack alone. But scarcely had he given this Order, wKen one of his servants came and tdJ
him,that some thirty paces from thence there lay a woman attired in the same manner, and
in the same estate that I was,who without doubt was not dead,because he bad discerned stnic
motion of breathing in her.
</p>
<p>The Prince, having lest me to the care of his people, went to see that which this man told
him of; but he did no Iconer cast his eyes on the Vx'mcess Axiamira ( for it was slie whora
this man had sound) but he selt himsels prest with an extraordinary desire to be able to sive
her; and the compassion which he had on her added so many charms to ber beauty, as k
swore unto me asterwards he had never seen her more beautisul then she was in that dtplonblc
estate. He himsels helped to carry her to the place where they had already layd me; and
though he was perswaded that I was the Princess of Tersia, and that Axiamira was oneof
my maids of honor, he took at the least as much care of her as of me, and it might be said ihat
he did not serve me but out of resped and interest, and that he assisted her already out ot incli¬
nation.  At length, my Lord, meeting wich some women in the hcuse whither we had been
carried, they took such a course with us, as they brought us out ofour swoon.  I was thesitlt
that opened my eyes, and to whom reason began to give a sense of our mis-sottunes, by the
astonisliment wherewith I was seized, in seeing my sels in the bands of so many unknownp^t-
sons.   Buc is their saces,their habits,and their language surprized me, their ofsicious endeavors
gave me some hope. This astonisliment being over, my sirst thought was for AxiAimru. A as •
poor Princ'ss, said I aloud, what is thy destiny I Prince danger hearing me speak thus (ts'
he alone understood the "Persian tongue; believed that by thofe sew words I deplored ssj
own mis fortune; so that quitting Axiamira, to render me that which he thought heott'c
to my condition, he came to comfort me, and assured me that I was in a place where the lair.

with his taking me for Axiamira.   Howbeit sinding my sds in the hands of P^oP's/"". ^^,

<p>which the rest do give him. But that which troubles me is, his taking rae for you, and his
</p>
<p>assuring me in our language, that I sliall have the same honor done me here, as in the Court or
</p>
<p>the Sophi my sather.   It may be, said the Princess,! can remember some words of the Turktlk
</p>
<p>tongije, which I learned of an old Slave when I was a child; and then making a sign to one
</p>
<p>of thofe which accompanied us, that slie would say something to him, when as he carae neat
</p>
<p>her, and that slie had studicd a while, slie demanded of him with much ado, and in a language
</p>
<p>that was not very inceliigible,the name ofhim that commanded them. This man apprehended
</p>
<p>noe ac sirst whac slie would say to him, but at length joyning signs to her speech, slie made her
</p>
<p>sels be understood.   He answered her then in his language, that it was the Prince Gianger.
</p>
<p>This name of^/4«^tsr touched the Princess sensibly, and raaking a sign to this man, that slie
</p>
<p>had no more to say to him; I knew sull well, said slie to me, that Fortune did not save me,
</p>
<p>but to undo me; and that she kept me not from perisliing, but to expofe me to new miseries;
</p>
<p>for, said slic, he in whofe power we are is the son of Soliman.   It is not beciuse Same doth
</p>
<p>not speak advantageously of him; but still, hc is the son of a man, which hath caused me to
</p>
<p>bc forcibly carried away.
</p>
<p>Axiamira's discourse seemed so sull of reason to me, as Icould not make any Reply to it;
but in the end canried by the paslion which I had to serve her, I told her, that to avoyd the
mischies she seared. Prince Gianger was not to be disabused of the opinion hc was in, that I
was the Princess of Persta; that in the mean time we stiould labour to know, wherefore he
took me for that which I was not; and that in trying to discover his designs, we should srame
ours according to thac weChould leam of him. The Princess was so asslided, as without ex¬
amining whether that which I told her was reasonable or no, (he consented unto it at the same
instant, when as the Prince, who out of resped had always marched before, came clofe to the
Chtret. This while we arrived at 6'j«i»g^r.s Palace, who kd me to a stately lodging, and
who would also have given another to Axiamira; because, saidhe, (be was not in case to
serve me: But having requested him to leave her with me, he quitted us, and wentout of the

<p>chamber

<p>chamber, as soon as that old Jewisti Physician came in; who, aster he had ministred unto us
that which he thought was necessary for our recovery, lest us at liberty to talk of the estir^
of our fortune.
</p>
<p>I will not declare unto you, my Lord, the cares, the civilities, and the duties, which c,-
anger rendred me stom that very sirst evening in the quality of Axiamira, since it would be
to spend time unprofitably. But you stiall understand, that coming to see me tbe next day I
demanded two things of him; the one was, to tell me how he knew that I was the Prinass
of Persia ? and the other, not to publisla that I was in his hands, till I had time and slrencth
to entertain him with my misfortunes. To the sitst he answered me, in letting me see ?he
Case wherein my pidure was, which as soon as I had beheld I knew it straight. But, my
Lord, said I unto him, who told you that this was Axiamiraes pidure ? The Merchant
said he, that sold it to me; and who long before had also sold another to the Emperor my sa!
ther, which he said was a maids, named Selixana, whom the Sophi very much esteemed •
whom you exceedingly loved; and who withcut doubt ought to have very much merit and
beauty, since, as this Merchant told me, slie was crowned as well as you, as the sairest of all
Persia. This Selixana, answered I coldly, had questionless a beauty extraordinary enoutjh
to oblige Jo//&gt;»&lt;j« to buy her pidure. Now, my Lord, it is certain that this discourse sur.
prized me; for then I knew, that the Merchant, to whom our pidures had been given, was
deceived, and had not understood the Sophi well; the likeness of clothes hiving no doubt
conts ibuted much to the making of this error. So it was, that I plainly perceived how Wi-
man had essedively loved Axiamira by means of her pidure, but under the name of Selixn-
na, which had occasioned her forcible carrying away; and how the saw error, and thesame
change of pidures, was the cause that Prince danger took me for her, as the Emperor had
before taken her for me.
</p>
<p>Touching the second thing, which I had demanded ofthe Prince, he easily granted itme;
for whereas he was become desperately in love with the Vx\x\ce{s Axiamira, bis deiire was
not to be obliged to carry us so soon to Soliman, as maxims of State required: It being un.
likely, that the daughter ol a great King should be inhis hands, and he not remit het into
the Emperor his sathers, as soon as it was known. So to content me, and to satissie himseli,
he forbid thofe, which had had any notice of the quality he gave me, to be known of it: And
still, to gain time, I made my indispofition last as long as pofsibly I could. In tbe mean space
thePrince, who at sirst sight had been mightily taken with the beauty of Axiamira, id\
not forbear giving her some marks of it, but with so much resped, as is slie had appeared
to be that which truly she was, she could not have been ofsended at it. This generous Prince
told us since, that he tryed to withstand this springing passion as much as he was able; and
that against the custom of his Nation, which considers not the nobility of blood, he was so
troubled to think that stie whom he loved was not of Royal birth, as he could not htm
inhis minde. He had yet some intervals, wherein his imagination sliewed him the truth,
and wherein it perswaded him that Axiamira, whom I called Ismaida as long as our plot
lasted, was something more then stie seemcd to be; and in this thought he engaged him¬
sels so deeply in loving her, as he could not forbear giving her testiraonies thereof in my pre¬
sence, though he rendred me nevertheless all the resped, which was due to a Prmcess, ot
whom I borrowed the name.                                                                        u o ■ «
</p>
<p>We lived some time in this fort, with content enough, that is to say, as long as the Princes
visits kept us from thinking seriously of our misfortunes.  For when we were alone, the re¬
membrance of what was past, and the sear of thatwhich was to come, gave us but w»c
rest.   The presence of the Prince was oftentimes also somewhat grievous to me, e'peciJjJ
such time as he pressed me by his entreaties to tell him by what adventure I had sussered in p-
wrack upon that Coast; having much ado to sinde excuses to dispense mc horn it, being nor
yet well resolved on that which we were to tell him. This Princes love i'^^wite Degan'

<p>'Ss^r bad no minde to grant me this request; for besides that reason of ^r^r., and his
own conservation, would not susser him to do so; his love wonld not consent that he stiould
for ever lofe the presence of one, who was so dear to him as Axtamira was.   And the
thought which he had had, to condud mc to Conslantinople, seemed so much the juster un¬
to him, because he sliould thereby retain in his Country the person whom he loved.   I ob¬
served how he looked upon the Princess y^ArwwiV^j when I made this motion unto him, and
• that changing colour he sighed twice or thrice. But at length aster he had endevored to an¬
swer me, be gave me such pressing reasons to let me know the injustice of my request, as not
able to destroy them, latlcast-wisedesiredsometimeof him to resolve my sels for it, which
he granced me very kindly. We were no sooner at liberty, buc the Princess behobing me
wich cears in her eyes, Whac say you now, Selixana, said slie unco me, do you know any
ocher way buc death to avoyd the miseries that are prepared forus? and whofe rigor is so
great, that I have not so much as the satissadion to sinde any whom I can accuse for it, seeing
gianger doth nothing but what he ought to do.   Madam, said I unto her, we must make
use in th.' ocasion of the Princes error; and with the precious stones that are on your
clothes suborn some cne of the Guards that are about us, to let you escape and con¬
dud you away, either here, or during the voyage we are going to make, where you will
not be so observed as I stiall be.  Ah, my dear Gid, said she unto me I in what place of the
Earth sliall I sinde a resuge? Is I go into Ps r^&lt;«, I sliall meet with a cruel and incensed sa¬
ther; an insamous sellow for an husband; and (ball see my sels there without any other pro¬
tedion, then that of a blinde brother, since Vlama is no longer at Court: Is I go to Constan.

shut u^, in a Serraglto like a slave: And isl escape out of the hands of (j/««»^&lt;rr( which I do not
think is very easie) to wander like a vagabond, 'without knowing where to seek out a retreat,
unto what strange adventures do I expofe my sels? And then, do you beleeve that Axiamira,
could slie sinde sasety by her slight, would abandon you, and leave you in the power of a
Prince, who, trsnsported by the assedion that he bears me, would ill entreat you ascerwards.
Ah, no, SelixAna t death hath something sweeter, then all the remedies you present unto
me; as also it is that alone whereunto I will have recourse.   Madam, said I unto her, for
somuch as regards m?, it would be too much glory for me to dye for your service: And isl
saw that slying might be advantageous to yon, I would press you surther nnto it; but since
by your reasons I come to know the greatness of your misfortune, were ic not better for us
to conside absolutely in Prince danger ? and to tell him not only that it is you who are indeed
the Princess of Persia, but also that-Jo/zw^m his sather is in love with you under my name;

<p>But how do you think, said the Princesis onto me, to perswade C7iW.r, thatvnnv.
Axiamtra; that I am verily the daughter of the Sophi; and that it was LlimawT^Z
have me forcibly carryed away? Truth, answered I, hath lights which makes her to be"r°
known; andthesreenessand ingenuity, wherewith I mean to speak to Gianoer will n.
swadehim, is I deceive not my sels, that I am no olhex then Selix ana, and that von j
Axti^mira.  For thenext, itisnot poflible but that this Prince sliould knowi?«/?4«. , J
wben we slial mark him out the time that he came to Mazanderon,he wil remember wlieth
he were at the Port then or no- or is he be ignorant thereof, he may dextrously enquire in
what place he was at that same time: Moreover, is he perissicd when we sussered sliipwrac
his death will justisie my discourse; and is he escaped, it is impofsible but that the brnit of
this accident sliould be spread abroad amongst some; and that at least it stiould be heard
spoken, how he thought he stiould have been drowned, though it be noc known upon what
occasion, or in what voyage.   But, Madam, without searching for somany proofs, to con¬
sirm that which I purpofe tofay, I am consident, how I stiall no sooner tell GiWrr that
you are the Princess of Persia, but he will sinde in your eyes the jnstisication of my discourse •
he will wonder thac he did not know you; and repenting him of his error, he will crave
pardon of you for it.   For, Madam, there is something so majestical in your sace, as I doubt
not but you have had more ado to conceal your sels, then you will have to make your sels be
known.   And then again, the greatest misfortune that can arrive to us by it, is not to be be-
leeved, and that being so, we are in the same estate, as now we are: and inthesamelibeity
to have recourse unto death.
</p>
<p>ThePrincess, perceiving some reason in that which I said, permitted me tofpeak toCi.
anger, provided that she might be in het Cabinet during our conversation. I sent then pre¬
sently to desire the Prince that I might speak with him, whereupon he came forthwith to my
chamber; and when as he would have used the same respeds to me, as he had accustomed;
It is no longer time, said I unto him, my Lord, to abuse your goodness; It was requisite at
sirst, when as yet we knew you not, that we should be unknown to you, for reasons that
you sliall hear; but now that we know your wisdom, your vertue, and your generofity, it
is just chat you also slbould know us; and that the sreedom which we use in acquainting you
with our misfortunes, and in considing absolutely in you, should obtain us that pardon
which we crave for having deceived you. The Prince remained very much surprized with
my discourse, and whereas I perceived ic; I see, my Lord, said I unto him, the impatience
you are in, to understand that which I am to say to you, doth disquiet you; and therefore,
to satissie you in sew words,know, that I am not Axiamira. You are not Axiamira, said the
Prince unto me exceedingly amazed 1 0,Madam, labor not Co perswade me the contrary,rince
it would be in vain. No, my Lord, continued I, I am not the Princess of Persia, and yon see
before your eyes onely that Selixana,of whom you have heard speak too advantageously :yet
think not that I will take the Princess Axiamira out of your power; slie is in it,my Lord,and
she is in it in an estate,that hath need of your protedion : It is you alone on whom her goodot
bad fortune doth depend; or to say better, it is yoo on whom her lise or death doth depend.
And to draw you quite out of the pain wherein I see you, know, my Lord, that the same in¬
comparable person, whom you have so esteemed of under the name of Ismaida, is trdy
Axiamira, and the moft excellent Princess that is in the world. This last amazement of the
Prince was as great as the other; but with this disserence, that amidst the trouble of his (oul
I saw some joy in his look. He beleeved me not for all that at sirst, but I perceived that it
was a matter, whereof he would have gladly been perswaded. Is it pofsible, m^
unto me, that you stiould speak the truth ? and will you not take it ill is I sliould not be¬
leeve you? or is not being able to rely on your words, I request you to tell me some circum¬
stances, that may clear rae in a thing that is so doubtsul.
</p>
<p>Icis just, said I untohim, that you sliould not beleeve me upon the bare report ot my
words, but'that your reason sliould perswade you. And then I recounted unto him, notonj-
ly Rustans arrival at Mazanderon; the slcights which he had used to get a sight of me; t
forcible carrying of us away; the discourse that he had made to Axiamira; "owy
given her to understand that 5o/iw4« was sallen in love with her pidure, which tie naa
his keeping; and howfor that cause hehad brought her a way by force; but also to «»

<p>deron, the Sophi's rigor, and the Princesses avcrtion io Deliment. I made this relation with
somuch sincerity, ^sdanger sound hirasels capable of discerning it; and that wh.ch yet
helped mcto perswade hira that I did not lye, was that he ^^'^^^^^ how he had heard
thlRusian, who was his enemy, as well as his brother .^«y?.;^. s, was gone from the
Port upon a secret expedition; and had embarqued himsels at s.r^ in a vessel laden with
merchandize. This consideration having removed all scruples from his minde, I saw a great
deal of joy in his countenance, andthe questions whichhe asked of me asterwards were no
more then testimonies that he was perswaded.                             ■    r     r    l
</p>
<p>But why (said he unto me aster some silence) do not I see this Princess, of whom I am
to crave pardon for my error ? Is it to punisli me for the sault, which I have ignorandy com¬
mitted, that slie will deprive rae of her sight? My Lord, said I unto him, this great Princess,
to leave you the liberty to doubt of my words, is retired into her Cabiner, whither is you
pkase we will go unto her.   Saying so, slic opened the Cabinet door, and Axiamira advan¬
cing towards them in some consusion, the Prince went and cast himsels at her seet.   Ah I
Madam, said he unto her, howsaulty soever I appear in your eyes, my heart is innocent;
it being moft certain, that it hath advertised me more then once what you were: I have bad
respeds and thoughts of veneration for you, which I durst not make shew of, m the error
wherein I was, both by that cs the Merchant, and your discourse. My Lord, said ihz Prin¬
cess listing him up, your error is so much the more pardonable, because in taking Selixana
forme, you were not much deceived, seeing icis certain, that she is another my sels.   Bur,
ray Lord, continued slie, let not the considence which we have in your vertue be in vain.
Nor let nor, Madam, replyed he, the remembrance of that which is past be disadvantageous
to mc; and tor my parr, beleeve absolutely, that there is nothing which I will not perform
to do you service.  For, Madam, since my good fortune would have you unknown to me,
that I might take upon me the boldness to testisie some part of the passion I am in for you,
which peradventure I durst not have done otherwise, although it be moft pure, and moft in¬
nocent ; be assured, that now, when as I know how this paslsion is worthy of the son of So-
liman, nothing can separate me from your interests.   Command then absolutely, and be
moft consident that you sliall be obeyed.  I had not much ado to be perswaded, continued
he, that a person, whom I judged worthy to be Queen of all the wodd, should be the daugh¬
ter of the Sophi of Tersia; but I marvel much at my blindness^ that I could not discern you
were that indeed, which I haveso often wislied you were.
</p>
<p>Since your generofity permits me to speak, said the Princess interrupting him, Let not the
wicked dcsigns of Rustan, my Lord, be executed by Prince danger; let me not be con¬
duded by your hand to the Serraglio; nor let thePrincess of Persta have the destiny of
Slaves. For, my Lord, not to conceal my thoughts from you, I will dye a thousand times
over, rather then doany thing unworthy of that which I am. You know ray Lord that
Solman having marryed Roxelana, cannot according to his Law have any other lawsul wise •
so that it you put me into his hands, and that I am not generous enough to have recourse un¬

unto her, sound out the means to place you in sasety, and to content my sels also, 1 stiould dye
with gries; but is I be able to ofser you the company of a Princess, whofe vertue is without
stain, whom you may absolutely command, and who is wise to Prince Mustapha my Brother
I think you will have cause to be satissied.   Axiamira was exceeding glad of this propofition,
having oftentimes before heard speak of the vertue d Mustapha's wise, who she bad been
told was descended of the ancient Kings of Cappadocia.   So that addressing her sds toitie
Prince with a great deal of satissadion, may I hope, my Lord, said slie unto hira, diatPrinoj
Mustapha, and his excellent wise, will permit me to live unknown in their Palace, until that
Fortune, weary of perlccuting me, (ball no longer keep me si;om returnkig into my Country s
Your vertue alone will oblige theirs to succor you, butis that were not, t*e strist sriendlh/p
wbidi is bet wixt us will oblige them sussiciently unto it.  All Mnstapha's interests are mine,
even as my Fortune is his.   And truly we are sar from thofe apprehensions of State, which for
so long a time have made the children ot the Othoman samily to tear one another in pieceslilie
enraged Tygers; and I am well assured that \s Mustapha, my eldest Brother, comes tmto
the Empire, he will let me enjoy the selicity of his Raign, and will not send me either xsmw
slaves to strangle me.   I tell you all these things. Madam, to the end you may not doubt but
that the sanduary which I have propounded unto yon, will be inviolable.  Moreover, where¬
as Mustapha is Governor o( Amasia, and that Oty is the Capital of Cappadocia, whidi wc
call Amasia, you may wtll conceive that you will bc sar enough from Constantinople, and not
so sar from Persia, but that you may easily hear from thofe which are asseded to you
there.
</p>
<p>All these particulars having seemed very reasonable unto me,I the more consirmed the Pnn-
cess in the deiign she had to accept of them, both for her interest and mine own; it being moll
certain, that I no less seared the Sophi's love, then stie did Deliments.   This resolution nktn,
nothing was thought on but executing it: G»/w«^sr dispatched a man, who was saitbwlto
him,to let Mustapha understand that which he desirc^of him; but with such pressingteiwj,

werl asseded to her in S.r&gt;., without ever receiving any answer. And whereas tLe saw no
Tnd 0 her mi eries, stie ciuld not be without unquietness; which at length brought her to a
sickness  which it ias thoughc would prove mortal co her. Her Sever was not very violent,
but i warwithouc intcrraission; and Ibougb slie selc no greac pain, yet was slie so weak, and
so low broughc, as wc durst noc hope slie could surmounc che disease wherewith slie was
aE dSgJhewhich ^....^.and I never abandoned her; and the two Pnncessawher
asoften, as cheneceslity of cheir assairs, andcivilicy would permic them.   N^w though .^«-
Ijapka had nothing but sriendsliip for Axiamira, yet seemed he to be as much asslided as G«-
dnger ■ such a sympathy was there in all things between these two excellent Princes.   We
continued three Months in this fort, without knowing what we were to exped concerning
the Princesses lise: for albeit ac lengch the Sever lest her somecimes, yet was it for so little
while, as it did not permit us to hope the recovery of her health.    But whil'st I was sliedding
tears for her, the Princes and Saraida took great care to conceal from the Princess,and me too,
that Soliman had made War in Persia; which was the cause I knew not that Vlama bad
betaken himselsto his party.   And that which kept Mustapha from saying any thing to us of
it, was not only the sear of asssiding Axiamira, but the doubt G«&lt;«»^er was in, that is slie
came once to know ic, slie would be averted from a Prince, whofe sather went about to deso-
late her Country.   We lived then above two Months in this ignorance aster the Princess was
out ot danger: for whereas we saw no body but MuHapha,Saraida,%nd danger that under¬
stood our language, it was easie for them to keep us fromknowingany thing but what they
pleased.   But one day as the Princess and I were alone, Jpeaking of the assedion that danger
bore her, and amplisying his vertues, which I oppofed tothevicesof Z)ts/iws»s, I in some
fort pressed her to acquaint me with the thoughts which slie had for him.   Why I will tell
you now, Selixana, said slic unto me, I esteem of Gianger as much as his vertue doth merit;
I do acknowledg his good Ofsices as much as one can; and I bear as much good-will to him
in my heart, as I do to Prince Mahamed my brother: but for that passion, which diforders
the mind, which destroys Reason, and which troubles the rest of them whom it pofsesscth, I
am not capable of it; and I could wisti ihnGiangercixxied a more quiet assedion to rae.-
That weakness is a blemissi, which I do not desire should be in great Souls: nor is it any thing
but the subtilty of men which hath perswaded us, thac^his paslion is not vicious, since all o-
thers ate, and that every one believes them to be so, though they do not produce such deadly
csseds.   And to know how much more dangerous it is then the rest, we are but to consider
how it commonly stirs up all of them; Hatred, Anger, Envy, and Ambition it scls, are many
times the sollowers of it; yet do not think, that I will be ingratesul to Prince Cww^rr; for
know, how averse soever I am from marriage, I would notwithstanding resolve tobehis
wise, rather then render him unhappy, is the Sophi and Soliman could consent thereunto.
For, continued she, I may indeed oppofe the Sophia pleasure, but I can never be drawn to dis¬
pofe of my sels without his order.  Asl was going to tdke danger's part, he entered into
the Princesses chamber, and approaching to her with all the observance which he was accu¬
stomed CO yield her, he began to talk to her of his assedion; and he represented unto het the
resped wherewith be had served her, thegreamess of his love, the little testimony stie had
given him of accepting it, the deplorabie estate of his Fortune, the small likeUhood there was,
thac astet so many Letters vainly written into Tersta, that the sriends which slie had lest
were still generous enough to scrve her.  That he knew how the Sophi was more asseded to
Delment then eycx, andthathe alone governed the Empire: So that slie could never hope
ether to alter Z)^/t/wm, or to make the .s^/&gt;/;j change his resolucion, but by the neceslity of
resolving on that which they could no longer avoyd.

said the Prince interrupting her, susser me sirst to tell you, thatit yoi^ deprive me of the hooe'
which my extream love hath made me conceive, nothing will be able to preserve my lise, m
Lord, replyed Axiamira, have patience, and do not condemn me withouc bearing me." And
to begin wich the Obligations wherein I am engaged to you; I know that I owe yon niy hse.
that the resped which you have sliewed to me, in a time when you knew me not for that
which I was, hach sensibly obliged me; and that the generofity which you have demonslta-
ted in providing me a sanduary, and preserring my interests beioxe SoUmans and the Em'
pires, merits an eternal acknowledgment.   I have also observed against my custom, that yoii
bear an assedion to me, and I am so powersully perswaded cs it, as you cannot deiire 1
sliould bc more: but, my Lord, is I may be permitted to speak sreely, I must tell you, that
the esteem I make of so many rare qualities, as are in you, joyned to che obligacions wherein
I am engaged eo you, could never for all chat beget an assedion in my heart like unto youts.
Yet do not think I am ingratesul, or insensible; but contrarily, I love you somuch the more
persedly, asl can speak it without blussiing ; I, my Lord, I love you with a sriendstiip, so
solidly establissied, as neither sense nor fortune hath any part in it.   I can pubssli it without
shame, and conserve it wichouc blame, and loving you as is yeu were my brother, 1 donot
see that you have reason to complain.   I know wdl nevertheless that you are not satissied;
buc whac would yon have me do, it love be a passion, whereof I am not capable i" and is
marriage hath always past with me for a captivity, which is to be avoyded as much aspofsibly
may be ? I protest unto you by the holy Prophet, whom we worsbip, that it I could be touch¬
ed wich this passion, it sliould be doubtless for you ; never having bad thac indination for
anyoneas I haveforyou.   But let not this impofsibility, I pray yon, of my being in love,
disquiet you, since the sriendsliip, which I promise you, is incomparably more excellent, and
morepersed. And to testisie unto you, that I do all that I can, is you have not power enough
to contain your sels from desiring to marry me, I do permit you to use the best means you can
to get the Sophi and Soliman to consent unto it; which being obtained, I do here engage my
word to you no longer to oppofe your desires.   Behold, my Lord, allthat I bad to lay to
you; and never hope for any more from me; for Axiamira s vertue can have no surther in¬
dulgence for your passion.
</p>
<p>Moft vertuous Princess, replyed Gianger casting himsels at her seet. What occasions do
you give me all at once, both of gries, and of satissadion 1 with one hand you draw meoiit
of danger, and with the other you put me to death.  You cannot answer my passion, and yet
you love me more then all the wodd bcside; who ever saw an adventure equal to minei' my
Mistress resuses me her love, but in such a manner, as I am not permitred to have the comfort
to term her cruel and unpitisul; but conuanly, I must give her thanks for the vvrong Ihe docs
me, and must admire in her the vertue which oppofes my love, danger, in saying thus, look¬
ed on Axiamira with so much gries, as made mc pity him. And whereas the Princesl"es good¬
ness hath always allowed me a great deal of sreedom with her, I took somuch upon me as
to intermeddlein their discourse; sothat addresling my sels tothe Prince, The permislion,
my Lord, said I untohim, which hath been given you, sliould inspire you, me-thinks, with
other thoughts, then thofe which I perceive you have.  Ah I my Princess, said he unto mt)
( for he had always called me so, ever aster we had put that trick upon him,) that which the
goodness of ^.v&lt;^w»V4 grants, Fortune resuses me; interpofing such obstacles as are not ealie
to be vanquislied : And in the state wherein things are, there needs a supernatural power lo
change my evil destiny, unless you will help me to perswade Axiamira, that stie will peroii
me to marry her; for being then no longer in a condition to be Deliment's wise, or a«/"»J*^
Mistress, tbe knowledg thereof would peradventure make their weapons sall out ot the
hands.   How ! said Axiamira mightily surprized, have the Sophi and Soliman any mterei
to be decided between them ? Is it known thac I am in your hands ? and may I be so untiip-
py as to be the cause of the desolation of my Country ? Gianger was very forry that he
said somuch before he was aware; but seeing the matter past remedy, and that likewae
War could noc be always concealed from Axtamira, he recounted unto her, that a "t»e

that he would be glad to return into his Country, is he met with an occasion for it; heima-
Pined that the Princesse, who had often spoken to him of Vlama s zeal and sidelity, would
quickly give him intelligence of her being there, and then that Vlama to see his Native Soil
again, and to be well received there, would perswade the Princess to return thither. And it
rnay be also, as all Lovers are suspicious, chat he had surmized by Axiamira's discourse, which
he had interpreted amisse, how t;/^w^ was in love with her; at leastwise IcouldnoC con¬
ceive a better reason for it; howsoever he never acquainted her with any ching conccrn-
</p>
<p>1 will not tellyou, my Lord, in what astonisliment the Princesse wasto hear of the desola¬
tion of her Country, by a Prince, whofe Son had so much obliged her, and whom stie could
not wich reason hace. Howbeie (he was so just, as to accuse none but Soliman, and Forturie
for her miseries. It is not enough then, said slic weeping, that J'oAw^w caused mc to be carri¬
ed away by force, but that he must also wast our Empire. And it was noc enough, that che
War stiould have an unjust beginning, buc that I must too be sound on the enemies Party,
and in such a manner, as I am not so much as Co desire Co get from it. And my misforcune is
such, as I cannot make vowes for the Sophi, but I must make them likewise for Deliment,
who sights for him, though I have such cause Co hate him; nor make vowes against So liman ^
without ofsending Mustapha and gianger. In sine, my Lord, said slie, turning her sels to the
Prince, since I am in such a condition, as I am not able to make wisl^es wichouc injustice , I
must resolve to put my selse into such a condition, as I may no longer be able to desire any
thing, isit be true, thac death is powersull enough to deliver rae from so many miseries. Such
were in this incounter Axiamira's expresllions; and as for me, I consesse coo wich consusion,
that the Princes discourse gave me an unquietncsse, which was particular to me.
</p>
<p>For having had no news of Vlama, smce che cime that he deparced from che Court, I*
could not judge what he bad done during so great a diforder; this thoughc troubled me so
much, asl could not forbear demanding of Gianger, whether he knew not whac was become
of I'Lima} and whereas I was asraid, least che Princesse should condemn me for chinking of
r/&lt;4w-«, rather then comforting her, I looked on her at the very same instant, which, as I
think, consirmed danger the more in tbe opinion, that I have told you, I believed hehad. For
aster he bad considered me, and then the Princess, he told me, chac chis War having much
asslided bim, he knew not very well what had passed in ic. But to abridge my discourse ,
Mustapha and Sarraida were called in, as well to comfort the Princess, as to advise on that
which they were to do. And whenas G^'^w^rr had requested the Princess, stie would permic
him to cell Muslapha what slie had granted him, stie answered him , chac never doing or say¬
ing any thing, which stie would have to be concealed, he might acquainc him wich all chac he
pleased. As soon ts Mustapha appeared, stie advanced cowards him. And will you,my Lord,
said slic unto him, be so generous, as not to hate a person, who weeps for che vidories of ^^
liman? and who stieds tears when slie sees the bounds of an Empire, which is destined to
you inlarged ? Madam, answered courteous Mustapha, it s$ not for me Co ask of you , whe¬
ther you will be sojust, as noc to consound the innocent with the guilty, and also to indure

<p>because ordinarily the vidorious Party pretends to no other glory, then that of makini? an,!
vantagious peace; and the weaker out of the sear of lofing all, consencs easily to veeld t

sed all together, aster they had well examined things, how they might best essed their desim
and the two Princes resolved to conside absolutely in you. To which end they chofe out 3'
old Ofsicer of Giangers, whom they sent to C'onstantinople, with order to tell you the truth
of all things. But by ill fortune, you were gone away before, upon a secret expedition
wherein Soliman had imployed you, although ic was buc sour or sive daies ascer tbeTriuaiph'
which was cclebraced for him ac your recum from Tersta. Inthe mam time, to sacihtate
things on all sides, they believed it would not be amisse for Axiamira to write once more to
some one ofher ancient sriends, and that by chis Letter, he, to whom stie stiould addrtsse her
sels, stiould be obliged Co acquaint the Sophi that slic was living; andthathe sliould also
dexcroBsly inform himsels, whecher by a marriage of her wich a Son of Solimms, a peace
mighc noc be propounded. The Princess said hereupon, chac slie would never make thispropo¬
sition ; but Mustapha answered her, how it would sussice, is slie did only write a letter, that
did make known she was living; and thac did likewise assure, how che letter, which he
would write, was of a person considerable and powersull enough, co creat of an Assair ot
this importance.
</p>
<p>The Princess, aster slie had a little chought on it, wrote to the Governor of Sultam^vik
had been alwaies very much asseded to her; and by chis leccer slie conjured him to work the
.S'o/'^i to a peace all thac ever he could. Buc before che pablishing of her being alive, and
making cbe Propofition, which he sliould sind in che lecter, he sliould send her his Opinion,
and acquaint her in what terms ^Deliment stood with the Sophi, whom she denoted unto
him, wichout naming him: she moreover assured him, that the Letcer then written unto him,
came from a person, who was able to perform all thac he would undertake; and he that car¬
ried it, had order to name him, even Mustapha, The Princes chofe a man for this voyage,who
had lived a long time in Persia, and that understanding the Language and Customes of it,copld
easily get to Sultania, when once he had put on the habic of che Country. This Governor,
having with extream joy learnc chac che Princess was living.and transported more by zeal then
discretion, went; without doing ought that the Princesse had injoyned him, to Prince Mdn-
med,v]ho had been set ac liberty,as well as my Sather,when as nothing could be proved against
them. For I forgot to tell you,how they had been made prisoners,out ofan opinion conctivi d,
that they had caused us Co be carried away. This man, I say, cransporccd wich an inconlidc-
race zeal, wenc to Prince Mahamed, and reading the Princess Letter to him, together with
that from Mustapha, they concluded Cogecher, chac this Propofition would but exasperate
things, knowing very well that Deliment would never consent to a peace, which put Axu-
mira into the power of another, and therefore that it would but inslame the War the more,
instead of extinguishing it.                                                                              r t, c    r

which seconded their inclinations; and which also they beleeved would be advantageous to

any thing ill which slie sliould say to him. That for Musiapha, he beleeved him to be too
well born to pluck away the Scepter from him, and Co despoyl him of an Empire, that was
destined co him aster his death. Roxelana, seeing thac this artisice wrought not ail the essest
she expeded from it, consults anew with the Traytor Rustan, who told her, that at any

that the easiest way for it would be to seek to poyson him; for which purpofe they wercto

outjwhich made her change her resolution. But, my Lord, admire here che strange proceeding
of things ofthis world 1 whil'st Roxelana and Rustan sought for means to destroy Mttstushn,
and that all their malice could sinde out none,chac could sully satissie cheir cruel hatred, the zeal
and sidelity of one of the ancient Ofsicers of this deplorable Prince, surnislied them within
occasion for ir. This man had been his sirst Governor,when as he went out of the Serrai^liii;
and was he to whom Soliman, during che youth of his son, had given in charge to rendst
him an accounc of his adions: But whereas the Prince had never done any, but such as wcit
worthy, he could not advertise ought, that was not to the advantage of his Master.
</p>
<p>Now aster chat Mustapha's age had dispensed him from the obedience, which he had yeelded
to this man, he had still retained him at Amasta; conversing a little less samiliarly with Wm,
chert with his other domesticks, by reason hc was of somewhat an austere humor, and tint
his former authority did as yet conserve some awe and resped in Mustapha towards h;m-
This man for all chat loved che Prince txtreamly, who on the other side heaped wealth and se¬

'er mounted then he, quickly d-Cded the combate with three blows chat he gave bira, which
Lade h.m sall dead at h.s teet. Th.s being done wichouc witnesses, the T.r/?.« continued bis
way and almoft a minute aster he was out of sight, Musiapha s said ancient Governor ar¬
rived at the place where the combate was sought, and presently knowing that man, because
h-bad belonged to tbe Prince, he approached tohim, marks whether hc gives any tign ot
hse and laying his hand upon the region of his heart, he meets chere with cbe pacquet chac
wasdireded Co Musiapha, which that man bad pue inco a httle bag that he had hung about
his neck. The sight hereof pofsest the Governor with some curiofiey, so that seemg no mark
of lise in that wretched man, but contrarily observing all the signs of death in him, whssh
are wont to be seen in them whofe end hath been violent, he speedily withdrew bom tbac
same place, carrying tbe lictle bag along with him; and being got sar enough out of the
way, heopened'it, and was much abaslied, when he perceived the i'op/)ss seal.
</p>
<p>I leave you to judg, my Lord, whether that exad sidelity, which he had always observed
to Sol-sn.'ji, did permit bim to deliberatelong upon that subjed: he never stuckatit rhen;
and to ctstisie his resped Co the Grand Signior, as well as his sidelity, he resolves to send him
thofe Lrtters withouc opening them. And seeing by the superscription of that which was
direded to Axiamira, that she must needs be in Amasia, be rtsleded on che being of tvvo
women conceded in Mustapha's Palace ; and calling to minde an hundred petty circumstan¬
ces, which when they arrived had made no impression in his minde, he certainly beleeved,
that the Vi'mcds of Persia was m Muslapha's hands: So that perswaded of this truth, he
re-entrtd into the Town through another gate then that which be went out at -, and withcut
making sliew of what had besallen him, he the next day dispatches a man away to Constan¬
tinople, enjoyns bim to address himsels to some of the Bassa's for to present him to the Grand
Signior, and commands him above all things Co use great speed.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the Persian being arrived at Amasta, and not searing Co be accused for
tbe death of him whom be bad killed, since their combate had been without witnesses, he
comes boldly to the Palace, demands to speak with Mustapha, and aster he had made hi.ii-
sels known to him to be a Persian, and had given him assured marks that hc came from
Vi'mo^ Mahamed, hedcsires tobe admitted tothe Princess; which was granted him. And
when he had acquitted bim of bis Commission, Axiamira remained very much surprized;
for 111. knew by hisdiseourse, that be whom theyhad sent to .y^/raw/^ was too long in re¬
turning, (ince this man, who set forth a day ascer bim, was already come. She hoped never¬
theless, as well as the Princes, that this unquietness would soon cease; and beleeved that somg
inconvenience having kept this man from coming so sast as the other, be would arrive at last,
and s. give an end to their sear. But the day sollowing, tbe body of him, whom the Persian
had slain, having been sound by some that passed by, he was brought into theTown, and
known to be one belonging to the Prince, who was presently advertised thereof. And where¬
as it was a matter of importance, he wenc in person to cause the Letters to be searched for,
vvivch we beleeved hehad hidden somewhere in his clothes; but having sound none abouc
him, the Prmcess was very much asslided at it, searing wich a greac deal of reason, s st chese
Lccters,sliould come inco che bands of such, as mighc give Soliman to understand that slie was

man who, as be said, was cunningand dextrous, seeing himsels engaged in a combate, had
without doubt thrown chem away, for sear they stiould be sound about him, is he should
happeii to have che worst in this occasion. At length, not able to do ocherwise, slie sussered
her sdt to be somewhat perswaded of it: and aster slie had considered what slie was to do

<p>repaired unto her, and was received by her with che accustomed resped, but withanevj,

who always loved her dearly, demanded of her with some unquietness, what it was that at'
Aided her? She answered him, chat being enforced for the good of his Empire, and the pre!
servation of his person, to discover a matter unto him, which would much amaze and grieve
him,slie could not be withouc asslidion. This obscure discourse having redoubled the ShIu^^
curiofity, and already even excited some trouble in his soul, slie went on, beseeching him to
remember the suspicions which she had of Mustapha, though he had negleded them, and
atlength intermixing the praises ofthe Prince, with her accusations against him, slic presents
che salse Lecter, that was direded to Mustapha, unto Soliman, cells him (as indeed it was
true) that his ancient Governor senc it unto him; and aster she had made him consider the
importance of it,she represents unco him, thac is Muslapha came once to be joyned [oTuch-
mas, it would be easie for him Co seize upon his Throne: Thac he was noc Co exped the suc¬

people loved him; chat the "S^/^'j seared and esteemed him; and that r«ji»s this assair was
so important, as ic concerned boch his Empire, and his lise.
</p>
<p>Soliman hearing all these things, knowing the sidelity of him that sent him this Letter, see¬
ing T^^c^nw^e^ seal to it; and coming toconsider, ihn Muslapha hzd with address declined
theWiX of Persta, he no longer doubted but thac hewas guilty; albeit Axiamira's ^■
wrack perplexed him, and kept him from comprehending chis pretended marriage. His tcn¬
derness of chis Prince made him nevertheless seek in his heart, how he might savorably inter¬
pret the accusations, which were brought against his innocence. But the conjedures were
so strong, and RaxeUna's perswasions so powersul, as satherly assedion gave place to reason
of State. He would sain have put this assair into the deliberation ofhis privy Councel, but
in regard you were not at the Port, he knew not whom to rely on. He propounded Achmi
to Rexelana, but slie, being in sear of this mans vertue, represented unto bim, that he was
too much asseded to che Prince to hope for any saithsul counsel from bim in this encounter.
In the end stie knew how Co sway che Sultan's minde with so much address and malice, as
he himsels commanded Ruslan to be senc for, who was the onely man that Roxelana did not
except against. H- was no sooner arrived, but the Grand Signior asked his advice concerning
the mater in question. He answered atsirst, with a seigned submisljon, that it was onely
for him to execute his Highness resolutions, and not to give him counsel. But aster he hsd
caused himsels to be commanded mo^e then once todeliver his opinion, he aggravated the
matter with so much art, and made sbewof such dangerous consequences in this assair isit
were negleded, as Soliman, being absolutely resolved to look to his conservation, coromnd-
ed him co make himsels ready Co set forth with six thousand men, which sliould march away
under pretext of being sent to Vlama as a recruit. That in the mean time, in passing by ^'
masia, he stiould aslure himsels of Muslapha s person with as Uctle stir as pofsibly he could,
for seaV of causing forae revolt in thac Province.

<p>cies- thatthe people were everywhere ready to revolt; chac he was noc in a condition tcj
oppofe somany Enemies; and in conclusion, that his presence was absolutely necessary for
the calming of this storm. Now that which made Ruslan advereise Solman ok 2\\ these
things was because he certainly knew, that the vertue of Muslapha was so generally beloved
in all that Province, as is he undertook to go with open force against him, he would be in
danger ot being loft, and of utterly ruining Rexelana's designs. He considered withall, that

people joyning together, might peradventure cause a general revolution, it they enterprized
tlie taking away of Mustaph'i's lise.
</p>
<p>This consideration of his succeeded but too well; iot Soliman no sooner understood so
much from bim, but he resolved for his voyage. Howbeit chat which powersully carryed
him to do whac is«/?&lt;«« desired, was che incelligence he gave him, how by a second Letter
from Mustapha's Governor he was informed, that the Princess of Tersia was in his hands.
So that Soltman, silled with choller and jealousie, and thinking that as Ruslan had escaped
shipwrack, so Axiamira not being dead might be in the hands of his son, who was sallen in
love with her, parted instandy away, with all the Troops and sanizaries which he had about
him; leaving no more behinde then such as were necessary for the ordinary guard of his Ser.
raglio. But before he went from Roxelana, she made hira promise her, that he would forgec
all chings to think of his own security. Vertuous Achmat told us since, that Soliman had a
strange combate within himsels, and chac Nacure and Reason a long cime oppofed the wick¬
edness of chis woman. Buc ac length slie made him see the peril so great, and so neer unto
him, as in parting from her, slie got bim to promise her two chings; the one, chat he sliould
not see Mustapha, and the other, that he sliould sacrisice him to his own proper sasety.
With this deadly resolucion he went and joyned with Ruslan,- chese things nevertheless were
not sodofely carryed, but the Bassa Achmat was adverdscd, how this tempest was going
to sall upon the head of Muslapha; so that at the very same time, when as Solman, being
encamped neer to Aleppo, had sent the Prince a Command to come unto him, to render him
an account of the Princess of Persta, Achmat dispatched away a Poll, Co advertise him chac
some great design was plotting against him, and that he was accused of someehing, wherein
the Princess of Persia was mentioned: but noC able Co Cell him precisely whac ic was, all chat
he could do in this occasion, considering the state wherein he saw things, was to counsel him
not to come.
</p>
<p>I leave you to judg, generous Ibrahim, whether, receiving at one and the same instant
Solimans command, and Achmat's advertisemcnt, the Princes and che Princess were not
strangely surprized ; And so much the raore, because that Perstan was on the very same day

saved hersels too: bur noc able co go into ?^r/»^, neither to see .yo/;w^«, nor rest sase in,
place, where slie was no longer unknown, slie sound that death alone could draw her out ot
so many miseries. As for Musiapha, his greatest forrow was to see che asslidion of his bro¬
ther, and the sear he was in, thac his Palace would not be an inviolable sanduary to the Prln-
cess Axiamira.- for Couching che rest, said he unro her, I am noc much troubled. Is Sohmm
deals rigorously wich me, ic will always be with injustice, knowing as I do, that I havenevtr
had a thought against the service which I owe to him, and ascer this satissadion, I sear
not death. But chac which asllids me, continued he, is the doubt, that is I go and present my
sels to Soliman, chey will come and do you some wrong in my absence, and thac is it lot
which I do not see how we can sinde a remedy.
</p>
<p>Sarraida.hemng her husband speak in this fort,cast her sels ac his seec Co disswade him from
this design, and Co pray him co remember ( said slie, aster slie had craved pardon of Gianger)
how exceedingly Roxelana had sought for a pretext to undo him; that having met with one
he might be assured slie would make use of it to his ruine: and that it was better for him to
stay in Amasia, and there to desend himsels, or sly away, then to expofe hirasels to so evi¬
dent a danger. But Mustapha's generofity not permitting him Co resolve either for theone
or the other; it becomes your assedion, answered he, to counsel me in this manner, but it
becomes not the courage of Musiapha to be perswaded by you: and since I am innocent, I
will never sly like a guilty man. For in sine, though I seem to have sailed, according to rigot*
ous and cxad policy, in not advertising Soliman that the daughter of his Enemy was in my
power, yet I chink chac I swerve noc much from soveraign Reason in serving so excellent a
Princess and my brother; and in contributing nothing to the Sultans unjust lovc, so that
aster rhis incerior sacissadion, I will remic my innocence Co the condud of Heaven, which
is always che procedor of ic. gianger seeing his resolution, desired Axiamira, not to take
it ill is he wenc Co dye with his brother; buc Mustapha,vjithout giving the Princess leasute to
answer, told him, that he would noc susser ic, but he would leave him to guard the Princess
Axiamira, and his dear Sarraida.
</p>
<p>I should never have done, is I would reporc unto you all that, which love, sear, genero¬
sity, and despair, made these illustrious persons say in chis sad conversacion. As for me, I
heard all cheir discourse wichouc speaking: when as on a sudden, ehe desire which 1 had to
serve them inspired me with a mean, whereby I beleeved I could szve Muslapha, kwt
Axiamira, dxy \xp Sarraida's ie^xs, render danger moxe excusable, signalize the assedion
which I bare che Princess, and destroy all che wicked designs of Mustapha's Enemies. Veri-
ly this choughc pofsest me with so extraordinary a joy, as ic quickly appeared in myeytsa-
midst che tears which I slied: but whereas I seared that the Princesses generofity would be
an obstacJe to my design, I sell ac her seec, and besoughc her to give rae her word, that Ihe
would noc resuse a mean, which I Choughc I had sound to draw them all one of the pain
and danger wherein I saw them. Ah, my dear maid, said slie unto me, doft thou think that
a person which would receive death with joy, is it were presented unto her, can resuse thy
assistancc ? but I greatly sear, continued stie, that thy assedion does but abuse thee, and that
the extream desire thou hast to serve me makes thee beleeve that tobe easie, which I hoiJ
impoflible. No, no, Madam, answered I; and provided you will promise me not to oppoie
this design, I assure you that you your sels will sinde a great deal of probability in it.
</p>
<p>Sarraida, seeing that ^at/^w/V^ made not much haste to answer me, prest her sofar,"
slie gave me her word to do all thac I would have her. She had no sooner said so, bnc render¬
ing her chanks for the pcrmisllion slie gave me to scrve her, I imparted unto her in what mi¬
ner I hoped to secure her. And to make her comprehend it che better, I caused her to remeni-
ber, how the same Merchant who sold her ^iAmeio Soliman. as being mine, hsdalloio^

<p>you to this resolution, reason will not let me consent unto it. "lou have promued k me.
Madam, said I interrupting her; and I cannoVtbink that a great Princess will ever break her
word. ' And then again I do not see that my lofs is undoubted; for howsoever, continued I,
Soliman cannot accuse me but for a little while receiving the honors, which were rendered to
me as to the Princess of Persia, though I were not slie; but thereunto I am to say, that to be
in the more sasety, out of the resped which was beleeved to be due to my condition. I had
not disabused the Prince, staying to make my sels known for thac which I was, till I was ac
his Highness seet, to beg his pardon, and to besecch him to grant me my liberty.
</p>
<p>Sarraida,stemg a great deal of likelyhood in that which I said,earneslly intreated Axiamira
no longer to resist this design. danger called me his Deliverer, and said such obliging thirgs
unto me, as I shall never forget the remembrance of them. For Muslapha, though he saw
some probability of that which I propounded, yet his great heare could noc resolve to disguise
the truth; and had he not certainly known, that it was the only Way which could permit
him to hope, that he might put the Princess Axiamira in sasety, he had never consented unto
it. But that consideration, joyned to the extream assedion which he carried to his brother,
made him resolve at length for all that was desired of him. We prepared our selves then to
depart the next day; I will not relate unto you whac the separation was between the Princes?
and me, between Gianger and Mustapha, between Muslapha and Sarraida, since ic would
buc renew our forrows for a matter that is not absolutely necessary you sliould know. Buc I
will only tell you, thatthe separation of the Soul and body is never made with such violent
gries as ours was, at the sad moment of that deadly and last sarewelL I was put into a Charet,
with two women which Sarraida gave me to wait upon me, and Mustapha accompanied
with a small train, to sliew the more considence, marched on horseback some sisty paces
before us. Wc arrived at rhe Emperors Camp a day later then we thought we should,

And you will know, my Lord, by the sequel of my discourse, how it is not without Cause that
I have noted this unto you. We were no sooner lighted at a Tent, which had been prepared
tor us, buc Prince Muslapha,who thoughc he stiould have conduded me to J6//iw^»,received
an Order to attend his Commandments there, and to remit me into the hands ofa Bassa who
was to present me to his Highness. I consess that this proceeding amazed me and that I be¬
gan to be in sear for the Pnnce. At the very same instant he received sondry advices, that his

<p>At my sirst appearance Soliman seemed to be very much surprized; and beholding me
with an angry look, he demanded ofthe Bajsa that brought me, where the Princess of L i,
was ? My Lord, said he unCo him, Prince Mustapha delivered no other then this ptrsonDn'to
me, whom I saw him creac as is slie were che Princess of Tersia. I no sooner heard this an-
swer sfor I had already learned a litde of your language ) but I cast my (els at ik Sultm
seet, and humbly besought him to hear me. I will hear no lying, answered he. My Lord
replyed I, it is not to keep thy Highness from punistiing it, that I beg the savor of thee tobe
heard, but to keep thee from consounding the innocent with the guilty; for in sine, my Lotd
I am saulty, and Muslapha is absolutely innocent. I would I had given thee, answered the
grand Signior thereupon, che hals ofmy Empire, chac Mustapha were not guilty. My Lord
replyed I with more considence chen before, Idoaavebuc cwo chings ot thee to give thee
thac satissadion; che one is, chac thou wilt hear me without interrupting me; andtheothet,
thac thou wilt permit the Prince to justisie himsels in person. This last, answered he, isim-
pofllible, buc for the other I do grant it thee; and promise thee moreover, that is thou doft
justisie Mustapha (which I do not believe thou canst do ) there is nothing which thcu Qiih
not obtain ofme. I did not yield at the very sirst; I besoughc him ehae he would see tht
Prince; I labored to vanquisli him with my reasons; but at last seeing I nothing prevailed, I
declared the matter unto him, as we had resolved it; and thac wich so much ingenuity, asl
well perceived he beleeved me. I repeaced chis History from Rustans arrival at Mazmicm,
and coming Co speak of our sliipwrack, I lamented che lofs of the Princess, I spakeof heras
beleeving herco bc dead; and recounced also, hovs Sarraida had received roc from thofe,
who hadsoundmeoncheSea-slioar; and consequently, how a litde before Prince Gw»^&lt;r,
having seen me with Sarraida, where I had been for che moft part sick, had beleeved that I
was the Princess of Tersia, by reason of a pidure which hehad ofme, and which a Met-
chant, who had deceived him, had sold him for Axiamira's: I told him moreover, that as
soon as A/«/?&lt;&lt;p^^ was perswaded, chac I was theVtincess of Persia, he had prcpatecl him¬
sels for che conduding of rae to his Highness. Thac for me, I had noc disabused him, as
well Co be the more secured, as for chac I hoped I sliould che more easily obtain my hberty,
when as I should request it of him by che memory of che infortunate Axiamira.

<p>Soliman, moved wich my words, setched a greac sigh, and cestlsied both by his carriage
and his discourse, chac he was asslided for che lofs of che Princess; and yec that he had some
joy, in regard he could hope th%t Muslapha vi^snoisohwhy ^sheh^^d beleeved bira tobe,

<p>/;«/?^« surprized with tbe liberty of this discourse, began to deal in another manner; and
letting gianger see the absolute power which he had, he put the Princess into despair, and Gt-
dw^^r into sury, who, without considering that his resistance would render him culpable, lesc
not, quite unarmed as he was, to do strange things in oppofition of Axiamira's carrying a-
way by force. He would have snatched Rustans scimitar from him, to have used it against
him, and doubdess he bad done it, is thofe with whom he was accompanyed had not hindred
him. He soughc all abouc ehe chamber for someehing wherewich he might have desended
himsels; butat length seeing all his endevors vain, he past trom one extremity to another,
and aster he had exceedingly reviled bim, he on a sudden conjured him with tears in his eyes,
that he would have some pity on him in the person of the Princess Axiamira; that ha
would remember he was the son of Roxelana, whofe daughcer he had marryed, being assu¬
red is che Suit ana his Mocber knew his designs, she would approve of chem; that ha
would consider how Mustapha coming one day to raign, he could not meet wich a beecer oc¬
casion CO secure his fortune, then to oblige him in this encounter; that besides, knowing how
considerable the interests of tbc Sultana. Queen were to him, he sound that he should not do
her any very good scrvxe in conduding a Princess*to Soliman, with whom hc was desperate¬
ly in love.
</p>
<p>To all these chings, iJ«/?&lt;j» answered wich an insolent coldness, how he reraembred very
well, that he was the son of Roxelana, and for chac onely reason Soliman should noC know
of che resistance he made co che execucion of his commandmencs; ehae he seared noc che dis-
obliging of Roxelana by conduding Axiamira co his Highness, sincc stie could be buc his

I ssiould abuse your pacience, is I sliould repeat unto you all that lovc, sury, and despair, made
Prince Gianger say upon this occasion; and all that forrow and generofity put into the Prin¬
cesses mouth in so grievous an encounter: but in conclusion they must give way to force, and
obey. Sarraida also had a command to enter into a charet with y^.v&lt;4&gt;»t^4, which she did
without any resistance, as soon as she had obtained, that an onely son, which stie had, stiould
not abandon her; but contranly, slic seemed to have some consolation, out^of the thought
that slie was going to meet with bet dear Mustapha again. As for Gianger, Ruslan told him,
that he might do what he pleased, but this Prince was not in an estate to reason upon that he
had to do. It is easie for you to comprehend the deplorable condition wherein he sound him-
icit, and what the separation vyas between that Prince and the Princess. He earnestly desired

tender drew cears from the sair eyes of tbe Princess, as slie assured me asterwards.   She rejch°
ed out her hand to him in turning away her head to conceal her weeping from him and as
sured him that whatsoever Fortune could do, slie sliould n^ver destroy the sriendstiip and"
esteem which slic had for him: That slie promised him, for a testimony that stie would not

to attempt any ching on her lise, is noching were attempted on her honor.   Thisdiscourse
had lasted longer, is cruel ii«/?^», who had been busie in ordering of his men, hadnotsc.

in the midst of the thousand Archers, which had accompanyed him chither.  danger kwi
he could enterprize noching for the saving of che inconsolable Axiamira, see himsels at leil
to sollow her; and geccing instantly to horse, he never loft the sight of her charet.
</p>
<p>Now, my Lord, I have already told you, I think, thac Ruslan arrived ac Amasta the next
day aster .^/ajy?**/)^/* and I were gone from thence; sothat our voyage having lasted a day
longer then it sliould have done, by reason of that breaking of the charet, whereof, it 1 be
not mistaken, I have spoken to you before; and i?»/?&lt;i» having caused thePrincesses to set
forth cwo hours aster his arrival; chance, or to say betcer, our ill forcune, brought themat¬
ter about with so strange a justness of cime, thac ac che very same instant, when as I was be¬
seeching Soliman by the memory of the Princess Axiamira; when as I was lamenting het
untimely death, and was all in tears with the gries thac I said I was in for her lofs, I saw het
come in sollowed by Sarraida, and conduded by Ruslan, who at the very sirst named het
to the Grand Signior.   To Cell you, generous Ibrahim, whac a case I was in, and that whidi
this sighc esseded boch in Soliman's minde and mine, isabsolucely impoflible for me: the
.s&gt;//r&lt;&lt;» beheld me with an eye of indignation and sury, and turning himsels towards ne, he
said unto me with a strong and impetuous voyce; // it in this fort then, that thou jusiisejl
Mustapha 1 but know, continued he, that juslicejball be done to thee as Well at tokrni.
Sarraida, hearing her husband named, cast her sels at Solimans seet, to protest unto him
that hc was innocent: but he, withouc hearing or heeding her, curned about to the Princdii
with a little more civility, and said unto her with a countenance chac yec resented the trouble
of his soul; Ic was chen buc for Soliman chac the Princess of Persta sussered shipwrack I It

which I was in for her beauty, hach made me commit one against her, which seems to dmm
me unworehy of her assedion; buc che cears which I have shed for her lofs, have throughly
desaced thac crime. In the mean time, O pitiless Enemy I whil'st I sigh for her death, whiHj
Islied cears, andconsume my sels with gries, che hippy Mustapha laughs at my tears and
sighs, becomes my Rival, or to say better, mine Enemy, and the Enemy of mine E"'P''^^'J'^

Si^nioy's Tent,to go to that whither they were conduding us,we encountred danger,whom
the Ckp«&gt;« had not sussered to enter at such time as we were carried in. This Prince, seeing
us all in ctars, approached eo Axiamira; Well chen. Madam, said he unto her, what, ;m I to
resolve ofmy lise, have you been ill-intreated, and yT/»/?^;^^ «s he convided of my crimes?

destiny, and chac ofmy dear broeher, Co cbe end I raay regulace mine by yours, and chat there¬
upon I'may form my designs, and take my resolutions. ^ Rustan, who wonld not susser this
conversation, neither would incense the spirit ofthis young Prince, before his intentions were
accomplislied, for sear he sliould be carried to some violence, answered him, tha.t Soliman's
anger would be appeased, that patience would overcome him; and lest he sliould be ofsended
is he came to know it, that it was sit he sliould forbear speaking to Axiamira, because he had
expresly forbidden it, and thac without exception. I am undone, replyed Gianger, love or
choller hath been the cause of this Command, and howsoever ic be,'I am equally unhappy.
Comfort your sels,said the Princess to him, and be sure that Axiamira will never do any thing
unworthy of her birch, of her courage, and of the esteem which you have of her: Buc inthe
mean time isit be poflible endeavor to assist Prince Muslapha.

<p>Rustan, seeing this conversation continue still, committed the Princesses and me to the cu-
stody of them that accompanied him; but Sarraida increated him, that ber son might at least
be restored to her; for he would not let Soliman see him for sear he should have been moved
with it: this cruel raan granted ber this grace, out ofthe doubt he was in, V st her cries and
lamentations sliould have caused some tumult amongst the Soldiers is they had heard them. As
for him, hc stay'd with gianger, to whom he said so many things, to pacisic him, and to
make him believc,that the more patient he was, the more submission he sliewed, and the more
considence be put in the goodness of Soliman, the raore would he make it appear in this occa¬
sion, as any other then danger would have been deceived therewith. But he, who knew the
cunning of chis Tray tor,had noC sollowed his counsel$,is the vertuous and pxndtnX. Ac hm at,^s]ho
came to them at that very time, had not counsclled him the same thing, though it was with a
very disserent intention. He promised him to go to Soliman, for to endeavor the appeasing
of his sury; and intreated him that in the mean time he would repair to his Tent, wichout
permiecing any body co see hira; as well because he was come Co the Camp without tbe Em¬
perors order, as for sear lest some violent spirie stiould make him alter his resolution, assuring
him that aster he had been wich the Sultan, he would come and give him an accompt ofwhat
he had done. Giangtr would sain have spoken with his vertuous sriend in private, to have dis¬
covered unto him his love, and his brothers innocence, but itwas impoflible for him. Not
being able to do otherwise then, he went Co Achmat's Tent, there Co attend his return, wich a
great deal of gries and impatience. He saw his brother accused and In danger for the love of

<p>The generous Achmat did his uttermoft endeavor to oppofe ic; he represented to Solmti
the assedion which he had always born to that Prince; the brave things he had done,- the

which could not be comprehended; thac ac the least ic was to be well examined, and not con-
demn the lawsul Succesfor of the Empire without hearing his Excuses or Reasons; thathe

judging him, without hearing his Justisications, he held that it stood with thegreamess and

Seam p ecipitation to obey bim ? Achmat perceived wdl by h.s countenance that the or-

<p>the Sultan commanded him to stay, and sell a walking, sometimes very tast, somet.tnes more
kasurely • one while he stood looking on Achmat, without saying any thing untohim; by
and by he listed up his eyes to Heaven,then soddenly turned them down to the ground ; ac lass,
aster so violent an agitation both of body and mind, he ka^ned on Achmat, and b holding
him with more marks of gries chen of anger. Mutt I, said he unco him, ascer s have hved uncil
now, exempted from ill ehe crimes ofmy Predeccssurs, be constrained by Muslapha to lay a
stain upon my lise ? and must ie be said of me, that I have dipt ray hands in the blood of my
son ? Achmat, surprized with this discourse, and willing to make use of so good a motion,
cast himsels at his seet, and said so much unto him, that ( neither his Reasons, nor the good
nature of this Prince, being any longer combated by the malice of i?»/«i«; he told him with
tears in bis eyes, that he seared he had been but two well obeyed, and that his re pcntance came
but too late. And then astet he had consessed unto him the Order he had given Ruslan,he com¬
manded him to go with all speed to revoke it. But, my Lord, there was no more time for ir,
because as soon as Rustan had gotten permislion to exercise his cruelty, the wicked man had
taken sour Mutes along with him, having each of them a Bow-string in his hand, for in that
manner it is, as you know, that the children of the Royal Samily are here put to death, and
carried them to the Tent of Mustaphajxom whom at che sirst they had required his Scymitar,
which he had given them without resistance. This Tyger staying without the Tenc with
them ehae had accompanied him, as well Co keep any body from entring, as to hear whac this
miserable Prince would say in breaching out his last, his Execucioners began Co aceempt che ac-
complisliing of cheir charge.
</p>
<p>When Mustapha sirst saw chese sour Mutes enter, he made no doubt but hc was loft; yet
being strong and courageous, he could not resolve to susser himsels to be strangled wichouc
some desence. The sirst that would have put che string abouc his neck, he layd ae his seet j
the like be did to the second ; and having put himsels in a pofture that he could not be seized
upon behind, he not a little troubled his Executioners. He had already taken three of their
sirings from them, and it may be he raight have desended himsels so long, till Achmat might
have arrived soon enough, had not the Traytor Rustan put his secad into the Tent, and by signs
threatened the Mutts Co do their duty. Mustapha, hearing thisvoyce, and knowing it, lesc
his Executioners to go Co Rustan; which was the cause chat thofe sour men salling all upon
him, overthrew him the more easily to the ground, and put the string about his neck. This
deplorable Prince had the leasure yet to say in strugling with them (as some of them who ac¬
companied Rustan have reported) Do so much at leastwise, thou cruel man, that I may be the
only sacrisice to appease die rage of Roxelana; and that my death may obtain the hves of
Gianger, Sarraida and Axiamira of Soliman. With these last words, which interceded for
anothers lise, Mustapha loft his own ; and in his person dyed one of the greatest and moft ex¬
cellent Princes ofthe World. The people have brutcd abroad, how by a communication that
was there, from Soliman's Tent to Mustapha's, that Prince had the cruelty to excite the
Mutes to strangle his son; but very tar from thac, Achmat arrived wichin a moment aster
Muslapha cxptxed, who, as I have told you, came to change the satal Order, yNhich Rustan
had but two mW execuced. This Prince was no sooner dead, buc Rustan, as is some ebrv
would have redounded to him by so barbarous an ad, wenc Co render Soliman an accompt ds
"'7m^" J ''"owing ought ofthe alceracbn of his mind; for Achmat had been so surprized

<p>any thing to him of a matter, which could then serve to no purpofe.
</p>
<p>This sirst motion of forrow being over, the vertuous Achmat believed that he owed tli
consex^nixonofdangertoihememoxy of Mustapha; he wenc then with speed to him sr
tear lest being acquainted with this lamentable news by another, he stiould take some s^nm
resolution.  In che mean cime the report of this death being spread over tbe Camp, all the si
nizariesame siocVm^io Muslapha'sTent, where sinding him dead, they rendered him all
the eestimonies of gries, which assedionace Soldiers could render to their General.   Allthe
Commanders did che like; there were nothing but cries and lamentations; some threw
themselves upon his body, and embracing him wet him with their tears; others said aloud
that they must revenge his death, teer out Ruslan's heare, remove Salman from bis Throne'
go and burn Roxelana in her Serraglio, and declare Mustapha's son Emperor, though he was
but a child.   Some again,less violenc and seditious, chrevs down their arms, made a vow never
to bear any, and having thereof sramed as it were a Trophy, which they ereded to the vertue
of this Prince, they layd his body upon it, and abode round about it weeping the lofs they had
sustained. Never was there a more general consternation seen; all che Soldiers continued sour
and twenty hours without eating: and is the prudence of Achmat had not shewed it sels in this
occasion, Soliman's Throne had been overturned, and his person in danger.   As for us, we
heard indeed a great noise, but it was impoflible for us to comprehend what it might be; and
they whom i?«/?4» had lesc Co guard us were so saichsul untohim, as they would not clear it
unto us.   We imagined with our selves, that peradventure Prince danger, having made one
part ofthe Soldiers to rise, endeavored to deliver Muslapha, to the end be might come aster¬
wards and deliver us also; and in this estate we were between sear and hope.    In the mean
while Rustan was gone back to Soltman, who seeing him enter alone, demanded of him what
Mustapha said ofhis clemency.   My Lord, answered he mightily surprised, Mustapha is no
longer in a condition ever to say any thing to thy Highness that may displease thee.  Ah! in¬
fortunate that I am,and moft base as thou art,continued Soli7nan,how readily hast thou obey-
ed me in a wicked adion ? He asked him then whether he had not seen Achmat; and having
understood thac he arrived noc cill ascer the death of the Prince, he shewed such exceslive grict,
as the like was never seen.   Rustan amazed at so sudden a change, would have represented
unto him, how much this death assured che quiec of his Empire; buc the Sultan, exceedingly
moved wich choller, chased him from his presence, and forbad him for ever appearing belore
him again.
</p>
<p>In che mean time Soliman not knowing whom to make his moan Co about his crime and
his misfortune, commanded Achmat co be sent for again to him. He was lought for, and
sound with Prince danger, much busied in moderating the violence of his gries, tor he hadic-
quainced him with che death of his brother. These two Princes had always loved so dciily
together, as never was there a morepersed and dis-interesled amity then theirs; sothatits
easie to imagine the despair Gianger was in, when he knew not only chat his brother wasdeid
ofa violent de'ath; but thac which touched his heart more nearly, that he dyed for his sake,
withouc being culpable of any thing, but of coo much loving him. Ah 1 my Lord, that Icould
repeat vnco you all that this asslided Prince said in so lamentable an adventure I butyouw"!
see but two well the resentment he had of it,by one only adion ofhis, without my Insiltingon

<p>Xc Princes abhorring the enriching of himsels With the spoyls of a brother^ who was d d
for the love of him, generously refored them: demanding no other portion c&gt;s Soltman, laid
he then the same string, wherewith his brother was strangled. At the same instant the
Sultan was advertised, how the Soldiers, who knew not that .S^r-r^/'^^ was in Rusims
Tent thrust on Iw the sury that mastered them, were going to sel it on sire. So that to hin¬
der this mircbies, Solmanievxt Achmat to let the Soldiers understand, how ^^rr^t^u was
in that Tent, and that in seeking to revenge Muslapha, they were upon the point of burning
his wise and his son. But to take from them an objed, which might exasperate their gries,
Achmat held it convenient, not to leave Axiamira, Sarraida, or Mustapha's son any longer
in the Camp; so that having drawn J"&lt;i//»w« to like of it, and kepc the Soldiers stom ofser¬
ing any violence to the place where we were, he came to Axiamira to assure her from Soli¬
man, that slie stould be entreated by him with the resped which was due to her condition j
and that in attending till they might advise what was sit to be done therein, he desired her slie
would be pleased to susser her sels to be conduded to (Constantinople. As for Sarraida, he
told her with tears in his eyes, that theGrand Signior pexmitted het to chuse a retreat, in
whatphice of his Empire slie would; assuring her, that he would have as much care of pro-
ledingher, as he had had violence in the person of Mustapha. Sarraida no longer doubt¬
ing of the death of her dear husband aster this discourse, and Axiamira being but coo well
atUired of ic as well as slie,they both of them said things,chac were stronger then che constan¬
cy of ^s/'»»^^ He wept with chese cwo great Princesses, and recouncing to them the mattet
as ic had past, excusing Soliman as much as he could, he made them comprehend that Ruslan
was the cause of all this mischies.
</p>
<p>In the mean tixne Axiamira, in the midst of her asslidion, demanded news of Gianger;
and aster stie had been assured that he lived, mdthzt the Grand Signior had none buc good
thoughts for him, slie aaved pardon of che infortunace Sarraida tor having been the cause
of her miseries; and made this discourse With so much tenderness and gries, as Sarraida
her sels was moved with her rrsentment. Mustapha's son yet surcber augmenced che Prin¬
cesses displcasure; for albeic this childe had noC attained Co the cenlh year of his age, he seem¬
cd to be so asslided for tbe lofs of his sather, and said such generous and reasonable things,
as it might bc said, that he would have as much resembled him in the qualities of the minde,
as in the seatures of the sace, is Fortune had permitted him to live. He assured Sarraida,
that he would one day revenge the death of his sather; he grieved that hehad not somuch
strength as courage, and that he could give her nothing but tears in this occasion.
</p>
<p>I mould never have done, my Lord, is I sliould repeac all this conversation unto you: but
in the end ^(r/)w«s having assured Axiamira^ chat it was not to the Serraglio they would
condud her, and having made her apprehend, that slie would be better at Conslantinople,
then in the Camp; he also caused J^rrWa Co promise. Chat slie would conserve her scls for

plaints, their ofsers, or their prayers, chrows himltlt upon his brochcrs body, wets him
with his rears, chen looking round about him, as it were to seek for something, he espyed a
dagger amidst that greac number of arms, which he layd hold on; and then listing up his
voyce, wich a more quis-t countenance chen before, Let some of you, O Soldiers (said he) i
the memory of Mustapha be dsar unto you, declare unto iioUman, chat in giving my brother
his death, he hath pm this steel into my hand ; and lee the Princess of Persta know also, that I
did not dye cill I had loft the hope of pofsesling her: saying this, he stab'd the dagger into
his heart, no body being able Co prevenc him, and sell down dead upon the body of his bro¬
ther.   Alass 1 my Lord, I know this cruth but coo well; for by ill fortune, the charet where¬
in we were passed soneer CO chac place, asl sivj danger when as he stab'd himsels. This
sighc, and chis adion chen made me give a greac skriek.   Is chere (said the Princess unto me,
who did noc look chat way) some more new misfortune besallen us ? Ah 1 Madam, said 1
unto her, the greatest chat can happen to you in the estate wherein you are.  Wc heard a
redoubling then of the wailings, lamentations, and cries of the Soldiers, who making the nime
of danger to xesound all about, said so much of his death, asthey had acquainted her but
too well whac this misfortune was, without putting me to the trouble of telling it her. She
commanded the charet, wherein we were, to stand still; but the consusion was so great, and
the noise so dreadsul, as her Order could not be heard; besides, they that conduded us, took
such care to gee us speedily ouc of the Camp, asl beleeve is they had heard what Ihe said,
they would not have obeyed her; so that we wenc away in this manner, without more par¬
ticularly knowing the death ofthis miserable Prince: having not learnt all that I have recount¬
ed unto you, and all chac I sliall cell you hereascer, cill we came hither, where the genetoiu
Achmat imparted it unto us.

<p>Icis easie, my Lord, Co comprehend, whac the gxies oi Axiamira ^n^s; That great and
generous Soul, which never sainted under her own misfortunes, sound it sels then too weak,
to support thofe of another. For chough love had no place in her heart, amity, compallion,
and the obligations wherein she slood engaged toVxinee danger, produced the same esreof
in her upon this occasion. Whac said slie noc Co testisie her asslidion I or to lay better, what
did she not that she might not survive this last misliip 1 slie absolutely declined the care of h"
preservation, slie resused co eat, and I dare say, she would never have resolved to live,«
with my tears and prayers I had not conjured her not to leave rae in the hands of a Princs,
which might entreat me as one culpable. It was not because I was pofsest with that tear;
but seeing this Ptincess no way sensible of her own conservation, I beleeved, that the same
generofity, which made her despise her lise, to lament anothers misfortune, would induce her
to preserve it for the easingof mine. As Indeed, aster that slie sussered metotake acaieo

caused it to be publissied over all tbe Camp, chac he deprived Ruslan ofall his Commands,
and gave them to the generous ^c^w^zr. This Declaracicjn suspendtd che sury of che Soldi¬
ers, who nocwichstanding cheir despair and rage, soon quitted their Arms,to go and gather up
the money which was thrown amongst them; Achmat having caused thii largess to be given
them from che Grund Signior, as ic were for a recompence of the zeal chey had shewed to che
Princes.This present liberalicy made them forgec chac of Mustapha;md che very same Soldiei;?,
who would have carryed sire even to che Emperors Tenc, cxyed,Iong live the Sultan, a quar¬

dies ofthe two Princes to be put into one Cofsin,and the sarae being placed in a Charet covered
with black velvet,he ordained them to be carried Co Conslantinople,tnd laid in the same tomb,
which he had prepared for himsels neer to the Mofque he had built.He willed also that the said
Charet sliould be attended upon by hals of his Army, and that this suneral pomp sliould be cele¬
brated with the same magnisicence, as is ic had been of an Emperor thac had dyed in che Wars.
As for himsels, he had a purpofe co have gone to Meccjua Co expiate his sault,and Co pray un¬
to God and tbe holy Prophet for the Souls ofthe Princes: buc the assairs of Persta presling hira,
he contented himsels wich going toIerusalem,v!hexe he gave so many testimonies ofhis repent¬
ance and gries, as it was easie to know,that this Prince had noc aded by his own inclinariorls.
Bur, my Lord, whil'st Soliman gives marks of the forrow he is in for his vioknce,RoxeLnu
repents her not of her wickedness, and sar from having so good a motion, slie thinks of new
cruelties. I have told you,is my meraory sail not,bow kuslan was chased from Solimans Tent,
but I have not told yon what became ofhim asterwards: You raust understand then,how ha-
ving executed that which Roxelana had so ardently desired, he thought it was not sit tor him
to expofe himsels inconsideratly,and chac having noching more to do there for the service ofthe
Sultana, he might go and render her an account ofhis doings. He parted immediacely then as
secretly as poflibly he could; but he stayd nevertheless at che sirst Town he came eo,where one
of his servants, whom he had given in charge abouc ie, came and acquainted him with all thac
had been done in the Camp; 1 mean,the revolt ofthe Soldicrs,the death of gianger,So Umans
extream repentance,the retreat which Sarraida had chofen, and briesly all that had psst there.

who was his Slave, and who made stiew that he was come to this excellent Princess tromT

broughc presents to her son, as being gages of the Sultan's assedion. He cold her hxtk
that his Highness would make Muslapha revive in che person of chis young Prince • and th't
he commanded her to have a great care of his health and education. This infortuna'te mother
who knew by the publique voycc how much Soliman seemed to repent him of his violence'
sussered her sels co be perswaded chac all which chis wicked man said was true. In the mean
time he chinks of execucing his design any way whatsoever; and seeing it was hard for him
to remove chis young Prince srcm Sarraida, either Co sinde means to poyson him, or to do
any violence in a Town, where the memory of Mustapha was in so much veneration, he be¬
thought him to perswade Sarraida that she would accustom her sels to take the ayr, for seat
kst keeping always in thac fort within doors, her melancholly stiould pass unto her son, and so
prove prejudicial co his healch. Aster he had gotten this Princess to yeeld unto that which he de¬

mor, seemed to be a very sie and pleasing encercainmenc for her; which was to go and see the

drive her Charec, he had broken che axlecree of ic, not quice through, buc in such a manner,
as he foresaw how upon their arrival ac a very disstculc passage, which was just in the midll
of che way, chac which he expeded would assuredly come Co pass, as indeed the matter suc¬
ceeded accordingly. In helping che Princess into her Charec, he perswaded the young Prince
to go wich him on horseback, who, according co che custom of children, was ravilhedwith
this propofition. Sarraida, out of a thought of tenderness, or ic may be out of an instinsl
that advertised her of her misfortune, oppofed ic as much as she could; buc seeing her son
asslided at it, and chat this man promised her to hold him in his arms, and co have a great care
of him, she consenced co ic. She was no sooner out of the Town, but this Traytor who car¬
ryed the young Prince, beganto gee before, and by lictle and little going sarther from the
Charet, as is he had not done ic of purpofe, Sarraida loft the sighc of him.
</p>
<p>This infortunate Princess seeing her son no longer, began co sear without knowing where¬
fore, whereupon stie commanded her Charet-raanco drive as sast as he could, but whereas
he was suborned, he obeyed noC ac sirst, howbeie slic threatened him in such anger, as hewas
constrained to do whac (he would have him; but chis speed was chac which retarded her de¬
sign che more; for che axlecree (as I have told you) being hals broken, and tbe Charet going
violently on, it btokc sooner then otherwise ic wonld have done. Sarraida,behM^,s^
overcurned,and no longer seeing her son,never consulced on chac which slie was eo do; so that
abandoning her Charec, and walking on sooc, sollowed by two women that accompanied ber,
stie continued in che way which slie had caken, with a crembling of her heart, and anextreissl
gries. And whereas stie was carryed by assedion, slic wenc so sast, as buc one of her women
could sollow her. She arrived then neer tothe Grand Signior's Tombs, but alass 1 What
was the objed which slie encountred there ? stie beheld her son strangled, still warm, pant¬
ing, and almoft in the last pangs of death. This deadly spedacle touched her in so Itrsngea
manner, as stie sell down as it were dead upon the body of her son.                              ,
</p>
<p>In the mean time hc chac had driven Sarraida's Charec, being remrned to the Town, J"
the remorse of his crime making him to answer thofe from the purpofe which demanded o
him where the Princess was, a great part of the Town, men and women, went themicivej

were both carried back to Prusa, where this accident caused so general a mourning,and touch¬
ed every one so sensibly, as there was not any testimony of assedion, or mark of honor, which
they ofthis Town did noc render CO che Corps of ^^^-m^^i and her son, which ot their own
authority they layd in the Sepulchres of the ancient Emperors, a thing without example. The
chiesest amongst them went in all haste to pursue the Murtherer of this young Prince, but he
was already gotten sar enough oft" with Rustan, who no sooner understood that his Command¬
ment was executed, buc away he pofted to carry Roxelana che news of it, who received it
wich unspeakable joy.
</p>
<p>Now whereas the Sultan was to arrive within two days, she counsclled him to conceal
himsels, until she had appeased his displcasure. In the mean time (he willed bim so to order
the matter, as it might be believed, that the death of Mustapha's son came by the Command¬
ment of ^o/j?w^.», for sear lest hc being suspeded for it, sliould draw the peoples hatred upon
him, who would easily be perswaded of that which they were willing sliould be. As indeed,
the moft part were ot that opinion, though it were otherwise; for that Slave ot Ruslan's not
long since consessed it on his death bed. Soliman at his return understanding the death of
Mustaphas son,testisieda great deal of forrow and anger for it; but Roxelana accustomed to
prevail over the spirit of this Prince, with her wiles and rears. Cold him, chac chis adion ic may
be was noe eoo much disadvaneageous Co ehe quiec ofhis Empire, for slie had been informed,
thit Sarraida, since her being ac Trw/i, bad concinually inspired her son wich choughcs of
revenge; chaC all ehey of chac Town, whensoever he palsed through che streees, did nothing
buc wish him a longer lise chen his sacher, Co ehe end he mighe revenge his dcach, and mount
up CO a Throne which appercained unto hira; that without doubt some roan zealous for his
Highness hid undertaken this bold adion; and therefore according to her sence the Author of
it was not to be much looked aster. This discourse, which sbould have begot a suspicion in
the mind of Solman, perswaded him, and was so prevalent with him, as there was no surther
enquiry made ofthis crime, which consirmed tbc people in the opinion, that it had been com¬
mieeed by his Order. Ascer this, Roxelana did her uttermoft endeavor to obtain Rustan's
grace, but slie could not pofsibly do it. In the mean time the vertuous Achm,it, having un¬
derstood more particularly the extream assedion, which Prince Muslapha and Prince Gianger
had born to Axiamira, to sliew how dear their memory was unto him, had obtained the per¬
mission to see her, which be bath done as often as his occasions would susser him. And it is by
him also chit we have understood, how Soliman would not sincc his return IcC any body speak
to silm of business, being in so deep a melancholy, ^.s Rox el ana hex se\smih all her artisices
could not divert him from it.

<p>The Third Boo{.
</p>




<p>THe next day Ibrahim went to the Grand Signior, and with a dextrous discourse he gave
him to undcrstand, that he had learned what he durst not tell him. But in imparting thii
to him, he lee him see also, that he lamented him wichout accusing him; and carrying him
insensibly CO (pea.^ oi Axiamira, he besoughc him to grant him one grace which he would
demand of him in savor of her and Selixana. Soliman gave not the Ba(sa leasure to explain
his desire, but assured him chac he mighc do whac he pleased iot Axiamira; the repentaqce
of his saulc, and che remembrance of his misfortune, having so absolutely extinguilhcd the
love which he had born her, thac is he would even send her back into Persta, although Ihe
was the daughter ofhis Enemy, and thac sli: might serve for the good of his assairs, yet would
he not resuse Co consenc unco ic. My Lord, answered Ibrahim, 1 precend Co no other grace
for Axiamira, then to make her change her prison, in obtaining of thy Highness, chat Ihe
may be sent Co Bitistsa, and that she may be encreated as a person of her birth. And then to
oblige him the more to that which he requested of him, Ibrahim acquainced him with the
interest which Vlama had in Selixana: Hc made it appear unto him also, that his in this
occasion was annexed to thac of Axiamira; that it was requisice he sliould by his good us&gt;g«
of her justisie himsels Co her, for the violence which/?»/?&lt;*» had ofsered her, in carrying her
forcibly away against his Highness will: that she would be in his power as well at BitHis*, ^
at (Conslantinople; but that being ncerer to ber Country,she woiild receive tbe mote comfort
by ic, and might be even the means of an advantageous peace for. his Highness.
</p>
<p>Aster all chde reasons, Soliman answered him, thac they were necdless, since his entreaty
alone sussiced co ihake him consenc to all thac he could desire; there being but cne onely ttog
which he could never obtain of him. The gran^ Visier, not daring to be curious in thisen-
councer, for sear of receiving some distasteby it, contented himsels wich giving Solmis^
thanks, and omitting no time, he went and^e oVder to have a stacely equipage provided
for Axiamira. And whereas he was exad in all chings, he used such diligence, as theday
aster all was in the state which hc desired it to be. 'He went the next morning to theultK
of the seven Towers, where in sew words he propounded to the Princess her going to Biti¬
Usa, whereof Vlama was Governor, and where slie stiould haveno straitera prison tnen
the walls of the Town, nor other guard chen his and Vlama's saith. He cold her s"oreove^

<p>^.xiamira, ravistied wich che generoficy and prudence oi Ibrahm, rendred him a thou¬
sand thanks, and requested him to surnisti ber with some means, that slie might not be altogc-
ther ingratesul. You may,Madam,answered he, not only pay rae for the services which I intend
to do you, but also make rae beholding to you all the days of my lise, provided you will sus¬
ser your scls ro be perswaded, that his Highness had never any intention to have the Princess
of Tersia be carryed away by force; that he hath not been violent towards Muslaphahis
son, but at the instigation of others; thac the onely desed of this Prince is onely a tacihty,
whereof love and his gentle nature are tbe causes: and that in sine, he hath so raany rare qua¬
lities, as he is not unworthy the esteem of the incomparable Axiam'-ra. The assedion which
yc3U bear to chis Prince, replyed slic, jusiisies, is not all that he hath done, at least-wise all
his intentions. And though he be in some fore the cause of the greatest part of my miseries,
yet I promise you, O generous Ibrahim,to give credit rather to your words,then to mine own
experience; and never to speak of this Prince, buc as you speak of him your sels. I will
complain of Forcune, wichouc raurmuring against Soliman; and albeic I am resolved to weep
allmyhse-timeforthelofsof thofe two illustrious children of his, yet will I not accuse any
for ic buc che crutl Roxelana, and the persidious Ruslan. This conversation lasted yet a good
while longer, and was spent in civility on either part. Selixana in her particular gave Ibra¬
him a world of thanks, and assured him she would render Vlama an exad account of that
which hc had done for her, to the end he raight help to acknowledg ic in pubUstiing ie, since
they could never acquire themselves of it ocher-ways. Presendy chereupon, che Grand Visier
took his leave of che Princess, and cold her, chac slie mighc deparc the nexe morning, is her
healch would permic her: As indeed all her equipage was ready accordingly, buc with such
magnisicence, as is slie had been in sersia. This excellent Princess had made her scls to be so
beloved of chem that guarded her, as they could not see her part wichouc abundance of
tears, though they very much rejoyced for all that toknow, thac her prison stiould noC be
thence forward so strait. But amongst the rest, Halima was so asslided at it, as sbe was not
to be comforted; she gave her two Slaves, who had always waited upon her during her im¬
prisonmcnt; tnd Axiamira, in recompence thereof, gave her a chain of Diamonds, which
slie had still kept in all her misfortunes.
</p>
<p>In tbe mean time Ibrahim had sent away Vlama's Slave, whora he had broughc away
from the Castle of the seven Towers the day before, to advertise his Master to repair co Biti-
Usa, ishis strength would permic him, chere co receive the Princess. But in case he sliould
notbe able soto do, he dispatched away another man, with a command srora the Grand
Sigmor to all the Governors of thofe Towns, which were upon the road, whereby slie was
to pass, to render her as much honor, as is slie had been the Sultana Queen. And the Grand
Vtsier, to otnit nothing that might be for the Princess of Persia's sasety, had also coramand¬
ed hve ehousand 7^«.;tm.. to be her convoy, whom slie sound ready attending for her a
days march from ^a«y?.«^;«„;/,. This Princesses journey had as profperous a success, as
Arahim had wisoed it should. She was received with a great deal of magnisicence at all che
p.ac s where stie passed, and without having any other commodity cheS that, which rhe
weariness of so long a way might occasion, she miyed?it BitiUsa, whither VUma, thox^^h

<p>But whil'st Ibrahim asswages other solks forrows, his love renders him evervdavrnl
unhappy The more he sees Salman, the less appearance he sees of obtaining his liberty whi
he had resolved to demand of him ac his departure from Monaco. This Prince ceased nt
dayly telling him, that he had been d:ad is he had not rccurned; that he was the soul of his
Empire; that he could not subsist wichouc him; chat six monchs absence of bis had been the
cause of more misforcune to hira, chen be had had in all his lise besides; and chat z«/i; soot
being able to live without him, he must resolve to dye with him. To all these particulars the
illustrious Ba^a made no other answer then with low submissions, buc by his sighs and silerce
he testisied sussiciently to the Sultm, chac he expressed not all his choughc; and chac thelight
of his Mistress had racher augmented his lovc, chen diminissied his unquietness. Neverthe¬
less, whereas che Grand Signior was desirous to avoyd all occasions chac mighc constrain hira
to resuse Ibrahim, he made as chough he did not perceive his sadness, buc endevored co gain
him absolutely, and divert bim from his raelancholy, by all the honors, by all the liberalities,
and all the caresses, that a greac Prince can conser on a great Minister. But the more die Btjsn
saw himsels obliged, the raore asslidion he had: He received the Sultan's presents, as soma¬
ny new chains, which tyed him unto him; his savors were torments unto him; and though
in his heart he loved this Prince dearly, yec would he not have been loved of bim, so certain
it is that love is stronger then amity.
</p>
<p>Inthis deplorable estace hved Ibrahim Wiih^n extream constraint; he dele no longer in
assairs as he was wont; he declined che wodd as rauch as he could; yea the very sight of St.
liman became insupportable to him; and not daring to desire of hira the power to return in¬
to Italy, out of the opinion he had that he sliould be denyed, he sought no longer for any
thing but onely solicude.  Ie was noc because his gries was che less sensible to him by it, but
it was because he knew, that the liberty to bewail ones sds is some kinde of consolation to
an asslided person.   At length, aster he had well consulted with himsels, he resolved to speak
plainly to the Grand Signior, with an intent it he were resused (as he almoft made no doubt
but he should) to abandon hirasels in such fore Co gries, as death would bcconlirained to
succor him; but he knew not, when he cook this resolution, chac hecould not execute it:
for as often as he went Co che Serraglio for thaC purpofe, Soliman with so much addreli a-
voyded all manner of discourse thac might carry che Bassa co speak Co him of IsabelU, d
always cook such care to lee him know ehe neceslity he had of his presence, as the Gmi
Sister, no longer doubting, but chac J'o//7»/«« would deny hira is he dcraanded his liberty of
him, undertook not to augraent his displcasure yet surther, by the certainty of an evil, wher^
of he was already but too well assured.   He reraained then without speaking, and tbutting
up his thoughts in his heart, he grew to be the mclancholickest man in the wodd.  He aban¬
doned the care of assairs, and making to hirasels a prison of his Palace, he went no more a-
broad, but now and chen to go to the Serraglio, and that too very seldom.   His presence,
which was wont to charm all Soliman's unquietnesses, now begot nothing but gries in him;
forbe saw him so altered, his eyes so sunk into his head, his sace so pile, his huraot sofad,
and his spirit so croubled, as he could noc behold him without extream displcasure, but a dis¬
plcasure which he held to bc so rauch the more just, as he knew it to be the cause of that of
our illustrious Bassa. He soughc nevertheless to deceive himsels, by laboring to be perswaded,
that peradventure ehe aleeraeion which he saw in his dear Ibrahim, was a raalady of the bo¬
dy, as well as of ehe minde; wherefore he consulced wich a Jewisli PhyHcian, and an Ar*-
bian, abouchim, who, having some cime observed the i?4/&lt;« without his being a ware of it,
judged the alteration, which was seen in him, Co proceed hom some strange cause, diCwnj-
ing no marks or signs of a known disease in him.   His s requenc sighs, che indisserency whicn
he seemed to have for li'e, and forae incerrupced words which he had spoken, when as ny
Soliman's oxdet chey wenc eo visie him, perswaded ehera, chac che raelancholy, whe:.ap¬
peared in him, was not an essed of his ceraper, buc of forae asslidion chac croubled his aimj.
and which questionless was derived srora some violenc passion.   Ascer so righc and so wel •
grounded a debate, chey cold che Grand Signior sreely, chac chey could not warrant Ibrahm
liso; thac chey were Physicians for the diseases of the body, and not for that of the niiode;

ssich had so often blinded him, yec had slie still that Empire over him, as he could never
resofe her any thing, but the grace of Ruslan; so that in this occalion he almoft sussered him¬
sels to be vanquistied by her.  He consessed not the whole truth unto her, but he told her,
rhat/^M/»»Vs melancholy was che cause of all his sadness; and withouc impa-'-iw roher,
that he was a Christian under the habic of a Turk., ox ofwhat Country he was, he coiu het
surther  that being sallen paslionately in love with a Christian Princess, whom hehad seen,
durin^'the voyage which he had made by his order; che gries of being deprived of her pre¬
sence and of the hope of pofsesling her, had brought him even to deaths door    Asterwards,
he declared unto her the forrow he was in for it, and how he would give hals his Empusi

which I will demand of thee, I will oblige my sels to restore thy savorice eo his wonted joy,

saw no great likelyhood in chac which che Sultana said, yec he sound same content in not re¬
solving so soon to be dcpnved of Ibra him.           s
</p>
<p>In the raean season Roxelana, without lofing a minutes tirae, sent Ruslan word, who lay
still concealed in ConslantinapU, Co corae ae the beginning of che nighc to one of the gates of
the Serraglio, where he stiould sinde two ofher black slaves attending for him, and not to sear

sailed not to be present ac this aslignation,no more chen che Slaves eo receive him,and to bring
him in.   When he was in her chamber, slie told him, chat whatsoever slie could do, it was
impofsible for her to obeain his grace; and chac slie thought he would never obtain it, but by
some very extraordinary way; thac there was one did chen presenc it sels, which she would
propofe unto him, to the end ehae is he saw any likelyhood in ic, she would sinish chac which
slie had begun; and chen she recounted unto hira what Soliman had said co her, and what
(he had answered.  But it appeared that Ruslan was beceer informed of Ibrahim's fortune,
then Qie imagined; for chis man, who choughc of nothing but his re-establisbment, had

Basa were che cause chac he was not restored. This servanc, suborned by Rustan, wenc ofcen
to him to give him account of chac which he learned: and the very same day that Roxelana
had sent for him, he had acquainted hira, that Ibrahim was in love with a Princess of Italj,
to whom appertained a Town called Monaco; that che gries for being absent from her had
madehim sick, and would cause his death, is the Grand Signior gave him not liberty to re¬
turn thither to see her • that he had heard all this chrough Ibrahim's chzmbex door, who talk¬
ed thereof in private to an Italian Slave, whom he very much loved, and whom he had com-
minded, is he dyed for forrow, ashe secmed not to doubt, to obtain permission of the
Grand Signior to go and exccute hij last Will, in carrying a Letter to the Princess whom hc
loved.  Rustan having acquainted Roxelana with whac he knew concerning Ibrahim, Cold
her asterwards, thac is Soliman vjould bc pleased to lee him speak with him, he did not

demanding of an Army of .Wjw^w to bring awaychij Prinais by force, whofe abseJc
cmsed Ibrahim's sussering: bat Ruslan replyed, thac as long as or^.^conld work by addrest
no recourse was Co be had co force; chat for him, he knew better how to beguile then t
sight; and in the end, without explaining his design unto her, h; promised her toperi|]°

war, throughly provided; and might be permitted to say, in the places where he should a
board, cbat he was going to che King of France, in the quality of a Chaoux, from the Grand
Signior.   Roxelana, seeing Rustan so resolute for ^this enterprize, sent bim away, and told
him that the next day he sliould hear from her : as indeed, slie delt in such fort with'the Grand
Signior, as he promised her the grace of i2«y?-«», is he could persoim thatwhich she pro-
pounded to him; and thisPrinceresolvedeven to endure the sight of him, that he might try
to render his dear Ibrahim happy, without absenting him stom him.  At sitst Rusinn craved
pardon of him, but when as Soliman pressed him to tell him,which way he hoped ro make his
design succeed,wherewith Roxelana had already acquainted hira. My Lord,answered he, 1 do
not think it a harder matter to carry away a Princess of Italy by force, then a Princess aiPtr.
sia; wherefore let thy Highness be assured, that is that be given me, which the SuUam with¬
out doubt hath demanded of thee for rae, andthat thou wilt make me hope I mayre-entet
into thy savor, Ibrahim (hall quickly be the happiest man on the Earch; for wanting nothing
to make him so, buc ehe pofsession of this Princess, I will bring her to him ere it be long, no¬
thing save death alone being able to keep me from performing it.  Soliman had at the begin-
ing some aversion to this violence, but coraing to consider, chac ie was the onely way to
retain Ibrahim wich him, hc forgoc all other considerations.   So that before he dismillcd
Rustan, he was absolutely resolved Co accempc che raacecr, and therefore he assured him that
he sliould depart within two days: but in che raean cime he charged him Co enereat the Ptin¬
cess of Monaco, who was slie chaC he was to bring away, with the same resped as heww
obliged to have for the Sultana Queen.   ,
</p>
<p>Things being in chese cerms, the Grand Signior caused all Rustan's equipage to bc made
ready, with all the diligence that pofsibly could be; he surnished him likewise with gteat
store of mony and jewels, in case he sliould have need of it; hehad also his dispatch, as is
indeed he had been senc co the King of France, in the quality ofa Chaoux.- and lacking no¬
thing else for his voyage, he set sail in as savorable a season as might be. This happy begiti-
ing of Navigation gave no salse hopes to the Pilot, who made such use of the advantage of k
wind and sair weather, as, his vessel being an excellent sailcr, he raade this cue with a speed,
the like whereof hath not been heard speak of in all the seas of the Levant. Ruslan v^^mi^-
ing to Monaco, sent his skiss with one of his servants, and an interpreter, to demand per-
inislion of the Princess for his entrance into the Port, there to mend his vessel, which hesaid
was bruised with the sury of the Sea, and he had caused one mast and forae of the tackle there¬
of Co be really broken, coche end, is whac he desired were not granted, he might havei
precexc Co stay in that place, and so might bc able to seek out some means for the executing ot
his design. But ic happened chat ehe Princess, having been constrained cogocoG^w"'^'^'
some irapottanc reasons, which had obliged her chereunto, was not then at Monaco .• sotj"
he, who commanded in her absence, msweied Ruslan's messenger, chac che Priocess«net

it accordingly ; and taking into the main Sea again, to the end he might be seen to come from
the Levant, he sailed to Genoua, where hewas received, not only as the Grand Signior's
Chaoux, as soon as he had stiewed his dispatch, but as one sent from a Prince, to whom the
Republique had a great obligation. In the mean tirae he dexiroully enquired aster the place
where the Princess of ATow^jco's Palace was; and having learnt it out, he made oneof his
Slav ;s watch always in the same street to discover, whether any preparations were a making
thereabout for a Voyage. He caused forae to observe at the Port, whether any Galley were
ready to set forth, and all to be informed when stie went; In conclusion, he omitted nothing
tbac m'giK- serve for bis design. He was certain days in this expedation with a great deal of
impatitnce; but Fortune, thac would not yet abandon him, sutnishedhim with a sar more
savorable occasion to carry away the Princess, then that which he attended.
</p>
<p>One nighr, when as be wss in his Vessel, which notwithstanding the intreatics of the Se¬
nate he vvould never abandon, aster be had heard a dreadsul noise of armed men, both ac the
Pore, and in rhe City, he was advertised by thofe whom he had senc thither, that all was in
con'ni^on there; that tbe gates were all open; chac the Port was no longer clofed; and that
in this diforder, it could not bc comprehended who were che enemies.   Ruslan making profic
of this occasion, and others misson unes, leaves one part ofhis Souldiers in his Vessel, and sol¬
lowed by the other goes diredly to the Princess oi Monaco's Palace, sets a Petard Co che gace,
blows it up, enters in with his Forces, and conduded to IsabelWs lodging by che voyces of
her women, who called all the servants ofthe house to their succor, he forces it, and sinds che
Princess, who sirst presented her sels, beleeving slie sliculd meet with people that could un¬
dcrstand her language, and bc moved with her prayers: Bat she was much amazed, when she
saw they were Turkj; whereupon sbe gave a greac skreek, and stepping three or sour paces
back, she would have sled into a Cabinec, buc Rustan, who perceived ie, recained her, and
puc her into the bands of his Soldiers, no way doubting but ic was the Princess, as well by
reason ofher good asped, as ofthe eagerness which all her women and all her servancs shew¬
ed in oppofing ber carrying away.  Nevercheless searing he mighc be mistaken, he caused E.
milia, whom he saw Co be more richly apparelled then che test, to be likewise carried away -
for alehoughie was night, yec had all che women of (?#»o«&lt;« their clothes on, being risen out
oftheir beds upon the searsul noise they had heard in the City.   And chen again it was easie
for thera to carry away i;«&gt;/7;rs, who seeing the Princess born away, did only cry out inthe
streets as they wcnc along to oblige some eo succor thera: As indeed there were thofe who
knowing her voyce would have withstood this rape, but ic was in vain; for Ruslan tiakine
use both of the valor of h.s raen, of ehe diforder of the City, and of the darkness of the night,
caused these two sair asslided ones to enter into his Vessel,which had been made ready whil'st

The unquietness and soar which Soliman was in of lofing the Grand Sister, took himun
in such fort, as though the aesairs of y^r/^ were excream presling, yec could he not resolve
to srame any design, concencing him onely with giving L'Z/iw^ order to oppofe the Enemy
as much as he could, is he attempted any thing; buc noc to cntaprize ought against him un.
til he had a new order from him. This commandment no whit displeased Vlama; for albeit
he was one of the valiantest men of his age, yet was he very glad thac the War did not keep
him from abiding some ame with Axiamira and Selixanst. The Enemy himsels contributed
dso to his design J for though he had goccen the ad vantage in the last occasions, yec was he a
long time without undertaking any thing.   That which caused this suspension of Armj wis
the news, which was Iwoughc to ihe Sophi's Court, ho^N Axiamira and Selixanamxm
the hands of Soliman, who retained them prisoners. This last circumstance exceedingly ixxM-
hied the Sophi zndDeliment: they did not wonder, to know cercainly that they were not
dead, as all the world had beleeved them to be; nor to understand that they were in Turku,
because they aforetime siispeded that Vlama had carryed chem away ; bue to see him Gene¬
ral of the Grand Signior's Army in Ibrahim's absencc, and to hear ac che same instant that
his Mistrese was a Prisoner, was a matter which they could not comprehend.  They resolved
nevercheless to endevor to be cleared therein, by the means of thofe seacc intelligences,which
all greac Princes have in their neighbors Courts; and in the mean time co make greac prept
rations for war, that they might serve their turns of them according to occasion.  Mdmul,
who was acquainted wich this news better then they, testisied a great deal of joy for it; It
was not because he was not forry to know that Axiamira and Selixana were in prison, hot
having beleeved them to be dead, or in the power of Tachmas and Deliment, he was rarilh.
ed to understand that they were living, and out of their tyranny; not being able to imagine
that cwo persons of thac importance could be ill entreated in a place, where Vlama was so
powersul.   Mahamed wasnot he atone, who wasglad to VxviVsj thzt Axiamira wajnot
dead, for this Princess was so generally beloved throughout thac Empire, as this news being
spred amongst the people, every one gave such marks of an unspeakable rejoycing, as is a me¬
morable vidory had been obcained over che Enemy.  All the woraen of quality of the City
of Sultania, where Tachmas was resident, when as he received this advice, sent hambly to
beseech him, is there needed a ransom for the redemption of the Princess, that he would be
pleased to let all their jewels serve for a pare of ic j estecming themselves more then happy.''
with the lofs of their liberty they could buy out the Princesses. This generous mark of asscst*

</p>
<p>As for the ambitious Terca, the onely desire that slie had to reign raade her Co move; and
that soe miqht rise to that sopream greatness, slie thought there was buc two things wanting
to her • the^death of Delment, and the peoples hatred to Axiamira. For touching IJmaa
^nd Mahamed, slie did noc beleeve that thestupidity of theone, andthe bhndnelsot the
other would p.rmit them to oppofe her. So that to execute her intention, slie perswaded
Deliment, that he was at this time to hazard all things; that it wasnot forhis honor, to
know Axiamira was so neer the stontire, and not do his uttermoft to draw her out ot Y^-^-
ma's hands: And for Tachmas, slie made hira do that which by her counsel he had resolved
upon. He said before all his Court, that he Cook it very ill, soch joy sliould be testisied upon
notice had that his daughter was in the power of his Eneray; thac the belies of her death had
touched him less, then tbe news he had received that slie lived in that raanner; and then he
publiquely declared her guilty of high Treason, aggravating all that P&lt;sr&lt;:&lt;e had said tohim.
But though this Manisest bad some appearance of truth, yet sound it no credic, eieher wich
the Grandees, orthe people. The violences of Deliment, the wickedness of T^rrs^, and
tbe vertue of AxLtrntra, were too well known to have the matter succeed, as Tachmas hoped
it would. Aad the people, on che contrary, seeing so great marks ot aniraofity in a sather a-
gainst his daughrcr, in a sister against her sister, were ready to rebel, and be carryed Co some
strange rtsolunon.
</p>
<p>In the m-jan time Deliment thinks of levying of Troops, and making up so mighty an Ar¬
my, as, va; qiisotr or vanquislied, it sliould absolutely decide the fortune of this war; being
resolved to dye, or to return with Axiamira.   Tachmas on his side, sollowing his resolution,
dispatches an Eoibassidor to the Grand Signior, toderaand his daughter, znd Selixanaoi
him; ofsering tvvo millions for their ransom, though by law he beleeved not hirasels obliged
to give any thing for two persons, that were not prisoners of war.   He sent away divers spies
at the same inls ant to BitiUsa, to learn what past there; but all of thera reported, chat che
Princess and Sdixana seemed to be absolutely at liberty; that Vlama rendred chem all iraa-
ginable civilities; and what care soever they took therein, they could not discover for what
reason the Princcis had been conduded to BitiUsa; the people saying no other ching, but
that it was bcs eved she was corae neer unto Perjia to make propofitions of Peace.  A sew
days aster, a Messenger sent by Axiamira came and broughc hira a Leccer srora this Princess,
who not doubting buc chat the Sophi had heard where slie was, choughc ic was sie for her to
write unco him, to the end slie mighc noe be wancing in that duty which she owed him, as
being her sather.  When he received this Letter, Perca and Deliment were there present,
who would have obliged him not to have read it, for sear lest he sliould have been moved
therewith, but they could not prevail with hira; for this Prince, provoked more by curiofi¬
ty, or the thought that he sliould sinde something in ic which regarded Selixana, chen by any
kindness, opened ic, and reading it aloud, he saw thac was thus.

<p>The reading ofthis Letter touched the Sophi va a diverse manner; hc selc tenderness, con*
susion,and anger; and itmay be is he had been alone, Nature and Reason had prevailed so
powersully for i/ixiamira, as she had carried away the vidory from her enemies; but tlie
counselsofP^rsrs, and the speeches of Deliment, wrought a clean contrary essed in him.
serca, told hira, thac ic was coo daring a pare in her to be so bold, as co write such thingsto
him of a man whom he loved; chac wichouc doubc Axiamira spake noc chus, but because Ihe
was well assured, chac whatsoever ransom was ofsered, slie sliould never be remitted into his
power; chat he was co eestisie a greac deal of resencmene for chis insolenc proceeding, andto
inereac him ill whom che Princess had sent, who questionless was come to Prince Mahml
ot as a Spy, racher then co bring him this Lecter, which could not serve Axiamira for ought,
whecher slbe remained in the (jr4»^ .yi^«*or'j Dominions, or whether slie returned into his
Erapire. Deliment seeing the Sophi sussiciently incensed, took a disserent way from that
which Perca had held, which yet produced che same essed. He besoughc the Sophi, with"
salse generofity, to permit hira to withdraw himsels from assairs, and from about him, tor the
contenting of Axiamira. But che Sophi, as Deliment had rightly forecast it, forbad him the
surther profecuting of this discourse, bis anger redoubling so rauch the raore by this artisics'
And fora conclusion, he called che parcy before him, who had broughc hira che Letter troin
Axiamira, charged him never to come within his Dominions again, and told him, thatitne
had not purpofed to have him carry back his Commands, he would have had him severely pu-
nislied.Then he willed hira to say unco her thac had senc him(for he would not call her the VtiJ-
cess, his Daughter, ot Axiamira) chac hc had no other answer to make her, but that it t-

<p>nrsiudice him is!; were met withall, yet had stie not sofsiciently concealed the extream assec-
Son which wasbetween them, and the incelligence tey had he d together, when slie was at
Z^a.   So that as soon as it was read, it was reso ved, for sear^^.^.«..^ sliould nMive
Xis by some more secret way, eo have cwo things done. The sirst, to change all his House.
'othe end that having none thac he could crust abouc hira, he might not receive any news from
Axiamira.   And d e second, to secure his person, lest some abroad sliould attempt chac which
was doubted trom them.  This deiign being resolved, was quickly cxexuted.  IhUment   ac¬
cording co his wonctd insolency, went himsels to command the blind Prince from the .y.;,^*
noc CO irtr cue ot his lodging, and Co charge boch his Governor and all his servanrs to be gone
from him: Thac done, he placed a Guard abouc hira, and lest chis Prince in an assl.dion, the
like whereof he had never selt before. Ali thae carae near him were his Enemies Agents, arid
whether he would or no he was enforced Co let ehera wait upon hira.  This detention made
a great noise in the Sopht\ Court, even the people themitlves were divers tiraes about to rise;
but aoiorgst the rest the Princes domestick servants could not endure this violence.   And in-
d£ed,A&lt;lahamea's Governor, having assembled the chiesest ot them together, propounded unto
them' the enterprising ot carrying away the Prince their Master to BitiUsa.   He told them,
that it wasbetter to put him into the hands ofa courteous enemy, as Soltman was to Axia¬
mira, then to leave him in the power ofa cruel and incensed sadier; that as tor them, is they
continued at Sultania,they would not bc in sasety,but upon theleasl suspicion that one sliould
have ofthcra they would be severely punissied; so that as well for the conservation of che
Prince, as tor cheir own, ehey were Co undercake che delivery of him.    They all answered
him wich agreat deal of zeal and assedion, that they were ready to expofe their lives for the
Prince their Master; but that they did not think they could coramodiously do it for him.
Whereupon this wise Governor told them, how hc knew certainly that thofe which guar dtd
him, relying on his blindness, were not very exad in keeping hira; that it being so, the mattet
would not be very dissicult, because the Prince lay in a low chamber, that jetted upon tbe Pa¬
lace garden, whereofthe walls were not very high; thac che only dissiculty was to advertise
him not to make any noise,at such time as he sliould hear his chamber window opened; which
indeed would not bc very easie to do,by reason the Prince could neither read that which slhould
be written to him, nor see the signs thac mighc be made him, so chac hc concluded something
was to be lesc eo chance; chat for so much as concerned cheir geccing ouc of the City, the
Governor thereof was resolved to sollow the fortune of ^Ar/&lt;iw;r&lt;a, and to abandon a Go-
vernmcnr, which he knew well would be taken srora hira in a sliorc cime, by reason of che
qreat assedion he had testisied to this Princess, and chac so ie would be easie for chem co escape.
This Propoficion being approved of by all, chey thought of noching else but of executing ir.
And whereas the nights were very dark, in regard the Moon did not sliine, chey deserred it
no surther.
</p>
<p>The Governor of Sultania, whom Mahahted had formerly gained, chofe amongst his Sol¬
diers thofe whom he believed were moft saithsul to hira, and without any notice taken of ic,
he placed them at one of the gates of the City, through which he meant to pass. Nighc being
CQxneAMahamedt delivcrets mec cogecher ac a Randezvouz appoinced by chem;chey brought
ladders eo encer into ehe garden, whereof ehe walls were bue low, as I have already observed.
For whereas Suhania wa^noc che residence of ehe Sophi, they had noc since the lofs of Tauris,
as yet ereded any magnisicent buildings there. This generous Troop,pasling between two Sen-
nnels.got into the garden without any obstacle, went diredly to Mahamed'sXodg^ng, opened
oneot the windows ofit, without awakening him, or any of hisguard who lay inhis anti-
chamber; and then he whofe voyce they chought he best knew, entered into his chamber
with his drawn Scymitar in his hand, approached to his bed aster he had sought for it a while,
and though he wakened him very softly, yet could he not so speak to hira, but thae he gave a
a great skreek and dcraanded with raucltresolution, whether Z)s/i&gt;»s«s had sent to kill hira.
Mahamed [p^Veso loud, that some of his guard awaked, and made a noise amongst them-
kives; but the Prince coming to know his voyce chac spake to him, and whom he was assured
was very saithsul to him, held his peace, and by his silence made them of the guard who wer-

<p>In the mean time Mahamtdh^sin^ understood in sew words, in what manner they woi
deliver him, sussered himselsto be conduded by him that spake to him.   All thisTroZ
ceived him with exceeding joy; bur searing lest theystiouldbe troubled with some crofsen"
counter, as soon as they had put clothes upon him, which they had brought purpofdy abp
with them,they went ouc ofthe garden, and presently aster forth ofthe City. About an hun
dred paces from che gace they sound horses, which che Governor of Sultania had caused tobe
there ready provided, and getting upon chem, they rode away with all che speed that polsibly
they could make.   But whereas che Prince could noc guide his horse, but was constrained to
let him be lead by anocher, chey could noC go so sast, buc chac the second day ot their joutney
they espyed a Troop of Horse pofting aster them, which, being sar raore in number then they
made chem beleeve, not only thac chey were pnrsued,buc chac they were all loft; nevertheless
they resolved to sell cheir lives deatly.Thc Prince coo,as blind as he was,caused a Scymitar to be
given h m, and Co che end, chac is chey soughc,he mighc noC strike his sriends in stead of hissoes,
he commanded his sollowers noC Co come near him without calling him by his name; and
whereas his eyes did not serve him coassaulcany, he resolved to abide in one place, with an
intention not co susser himsels Co be taken alive.   Buc whaesoever he could do, his people
placed hira in che midst of chem, much against his will, being resolved Co dye or epsave him.
In che mean time che Troop, which chey beleeved Co be cheir eneraies, came still oti, and evay
one was already preparing for desence, when as sche son of the Satrap of Mesapotmin, an
enemy to Deliment, advancing foremoft, and throwing his Scymitar to the grounts, to let thera
know that he would not sighc wich ehera, made ehera change cheir resolucion of desending
themselveSjinco embracing chem.   Prince Mahamed understanding who be was, and know¬
ing him by his voyce, caressed him exceedingly, and learnc of him, chac it was long before his
slight was known; because his guard, noc having been accustomed co enter into his chamber
buc when he called chem, had waiced cill noon without going in; chac ehe macter being dis¬
covered, Tachmas ac che sirst shewed a greaC deal of sury; chac Perca had done nothing but
laugh ac ie, and in a biccer jeering manner had wislied, chac Soliman would make bim General
ofhis Army, co che end chac a man who saw so clear, mighe chuse cue ehe moft advantageous
places for the encamping of his Troops J chac iox Deliment, whereas he hated his sather, he
accused him for having been privy to his escape; and thac having been ill-intreatcd bytk
Sophi he was retired from che Courc, and had commanded him co come and ofser bim whatso¬
ever lay in his power, noc doubeing buC hehad caken the resolution to repair totheplace
where Axiamira had already sound a sanduary; chac in che mean cime ic was requisite tot
them to make away with all speed, in regard it might be chat Tachmas had altered his deter-
mination.and would resolve to have ehera pursued. Prince Mahamed desired surther to know
ofhim who they were that accompanied him, which proved cobe the worchicstmenofthe
Courr.   The Prince made very much of ehera; and chac he mighc noc hazard persons to
whom he was so much obliged, he sent one of his servants before eo BitiUsa,to know of Axi¬
amira, whether the place of her retreat would noc be a sase one for chem.  This while thty
rode on as sast as pofsibly chey could: but when they were corae to the uttermoft part o the

When stie capdved you, stie had wherewiehall Co make one believe that her thoughts we «

Sd proraised. But,my \.oxd,Selixana hath done rauch more or "ie hath despised death
for Axiamira, stie hath expofed her sels for her, and this rare raaid hath testisied so much c&lt;^n -
stancv and generofity in divers encounters, as it will be hard for you not to love her, when yeu
soall undsrstand it. I stiall sove her without doubt, replyed Mahamed, but the more wortsi
and vertue I stiall know m her, the raore sliall I be obliged thereunto; and the more stiall I be
consirraed in the resolution, wherein I have a long tirae been, noc to esteem my tcls happy, but
when'L'/^w&lt;»stiall bc so; nor to pretend to any thing from/s//js4»&lt;», but that which she

moft certain,that I honor her ac this present so highly,and that stie hath rendred the love which
I bear her so persed, as jealousie can never have any place in my Soul.
</p>
<p>With such like discourses Mahamed and Vlama, without beinglieard of any but him that
guided the Prince, beguiled che cime; whil'st the rest entertained themselves with tbe weak-
ness of Tachmas in sussering himselsto be governed in that manner, with the malice of Perca,
the stupidity of Ismael, and che universal hacred chac Deliment had drawn upon him. But ac
length aster they had travelled a day and an hals, chis Troop arrived ac and BitiUsa. ^ Axiamira
and Selixana were exceeding joysul Co see Prince Mahamed, who noc able to enjoy the same
selicicy, was nevercheless charmed eo hear chem speak, Selixana, who loved che Prince as
much as ishe had been her broeher, durst noc testisie so much unto him; but Vlama, being as
dextrously to discover her thoughes,as he had been in discerning thofe ofthe Prince, approach¬
ed to her, and told her laughing, that he had made certain conditions with Mahamed, which
he conjured her slie sliould observe. Two such sage persons, answered slie, could not resolve
on any thing which is noC just, wherefore I think that I shall not engage ray selt inconsiderace¬
ly, when as I sliall proraise you not Co break them. Vlama then told her in sew words whac
had past beeween the Prince and him, K\dSeUxanapxoxn\sed Co do thac he desired; where¬
upon he lesc her co go and give order for che commodious lodging of all chis Troop. The
Princess would needs see all them that came along with the Prince; and with her sweet car¬
riage and address so absolutely gained them, as they would have enterprized any ching for her
service. Whil'st slie was coraplementing, and Vlama giving diredion in the Town, Selixa-
na carae to Mahamed, and such was their conservation Cogecher, as ic knic their sriendsliip sast
for all cheir lives ascer. He requested her she would permie him Co be Vlama's consident,
and would forget the misfortunes which his love had been the cause of to her; hc thanked her
for the services stie had rendered ioihe^tincess Axiamira; promised always to honor her
more then any person in che world; and without speaking to her of love, he gave her to nn-
dersland,that is reason had not prevailed over his inclination, he had still been V lama's Rival;
but ic was of chat power in his Soul, as he never spake a word to Selixana, contrary to the
proraise he had raade her, Do love her no otherwise then as his sister.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Vlama, ascer he had lodged che Prince in the Castle, the rest in the moft
commodious houses of the Town, and given order for the intrcating of them honorably dis¬
patched away a man to advereise theGrand Signior oi thac which had past, and to beseech

<p>Axiamira; undertaking to bring him his head, is this Prince, or any of them that solio j^
him. enterprized ought against his service. Buc Soliman was not in an estate of thinkinp
the ass^iirs of his Empire; and the Grand Visiers melancholy was the onely thirg that took m
his minde. The Persian Embassador was come Co ConslantinapU, and had ot'entimes d
manded audience, buc could noc obcain ie, Ihe Sultan spene the moftot bis tmeiilbu
Ws Palace; and though this illustrious i?4j5Qi was extreara weak, yet walked he sometimes
with theGrand Sigmor in his garden. It happened then thac one raorning Solman came to
visit him earlier chen he had used to do, and having raade him pass insensibly into his ereat
chamber, leaning on a Cane garnislied with gold, which he raoft commonly went with when
he was in health, he would needs have him walk down, to the end, said be unto him he
might fortisie himsels the becter by caking ehe ayr. /^r^is'/w, who sought not the preservati¬
on of his health, did noc obey che J«/s«««, for che reason alledged by him, to perswade him
Co walk down; but contrarily he did it, out of the belies he was in, that his weakness being
exceeding great, the more he should put himsels into agitation, the more would his forces
diminisli, and the neerer he sliould be to his grave. With such disserent designs did the Sul¬
tan and the .ss&lt;»/&lt;« descend into the Court; and theGrand Signior, seeming as though he
would not have the Bassa make Coo long a walk ac a eirae, caused him to lean on the ba¬
lustrade, that divided the Court-yard of his Palace, chere co rest hirasels with hira. Scarcely
had ehey been there a quarter of an hour, when as ehey saw an hundred Janizaries enter, at-
ciredall in cloth of gold, who ranked chemselves in order on boch sides. TheGrand lister
surprized with chis porap, demanded of Soliman whac ie mighe be ? buc he told him smiling,
thac he must behold che end of this ceremony, before he could be cleared therein. The B«j[i
then saw the Aga of the Janizaries enter, who raarchcd alone gorgeously apparel¬
ed; He was sollowed by the high Treasurer, whora the T^r/^/call Testardtir,KCo{i]^mi

ornaments that the women of the Levant do use. In some of them were little bats, set all
over wich precious stones; chopines garnislied with Turkeyses and Rubies; smoeks embroi¬
dered with gold and pearl; moft suraptuous gowns, which being layd consusedly together,
made a pleasing mixture, of curled cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, and of velvet, whole
ground was gold. The last maund was not open on the sides hkethe rest, and appeared tobe
sull of all forts of jewels, of so excessive a value, as ehere were three or sour hundred thou¬
sand crowns worth of pearls amongst them.They which carried these precious presents ranked
themselves all along the balustrade, where the SuUan and Ibrahim were leaning. Aster this
tntnd rwtlvecharetssullof young virgin Slaves, richly clothed, eachof thera drawn by six
white horsiS, and driven by two Eunuches. Then sollowed thirty ocher virgins, apparelled
in doch of gold, accompanyed with so many black Slaves, having all of them chains and col-
lars of massive gold : These Slaves being placed on their knees where the Aga of the sm-

are the seats of thac Country; and with a great deal of other moft sumptuous surniture lot

ing two and two twelve cofsers of China, garnislied with gold and precious stones, wjoot-

which were covered hals way with places of gold, and sliined more with the precious Itoncs

oflove, and outof a sense of Religion, before he would consent unto it.   But he was
strangely forprized, when as the Grand Signior had raade a sign to tbe Aga of the sant^a-
ries to draw the curtains of the Canopy, to see upon a white steed, held by two black Slaves,
his incomparable//*j^&lt;?//a   Ah ray Lord 1 cryed he out in Italian, Isnot this an illusion ?

the Princess ofs from her horse, andto clear hirasels througlily ot the doubt whereinto this
surprize had put him; but hecould not execute his design, for the Aga oi the samzaries
bad rendered him that service already, and had conduded her to tbe hals pace of the ba¬
lustrade, where the Bajsa received her.   This Princess had not seen hira yet, because at such
ume as the curtains, which concealed her, were drawn, the sight of so greac an asserably had
not perraitted her to mark hira, though she had caresully sought about with her eyes to sinde
him our.  But when as Ibrahim advancing towards her, did by the sound of his voyce force
her to look that way, slie had no less joy then he, though not so rauch araszeraent; for she
knew well enough thac he was at Constantinople, and slie beleeved too that she had be n for¬
cibly brought away by his order, for Ruslan would never tell her any thing.   And though
this violent design was not pleasing to her, yet selc stie nothing but joy for al! chac ac chis sirst
view; nor did the paleness and change, which/^r&lt;?^&lt;»j's raelancholy had painted in his sace,
any whit asHid her; being very glad to see the marks of his love, in thole of his gries.   Is
it pofsible. Madam, said Ibrahim unto her, thac I should once more see the incomparable Isa¬

replyed SoUmm in Italiany^ho was come to che top ot che hals pace, but trora the good-will
which I bear thee, and from the desire I have co preserve thy lise. This voyce brought rtsped
again unto Ibrahim, who told the Princess that she saw the greatest Monarch of the woild,
for sear slie sliiould not render unto Soliman the honor chat was due to hira.   Isabella would
instantly have cast her sels at his seet, when as chis Prince raising her up, against tbe custom of
the Grand Signiors, and beholding her with a great deal of adrairation, I do noc marvel, said
hc unco/^rrs^/iw, that love hath been stronger in thee then sriendship; andthat the sight of
so rare a creature hath been dearer Co thee then all ray savors: But it is not requisite thac so
many persons stiould be spedaeors of ehy selicicy; and it will be enough, is thou susser me
to be partaker of it with thee. Saying so, he commanded the Aga of the Janizaries to cause
all that had been brought thither to be carryed into Ibrahim'sVA^te, and to send every one
away but onely thofe which were to serve the Princess.

Basa might not incerprec ic amiss; so that to conceal ic in forae fore, ic must be acknowl .1
ed, said he unco him, chac thciu hadst reason co assure me, thatthe pidures, which thou S

<p>Hitherco che Princess had not answered to Soliman's discourses, save with obeysancesand
submissions, but hearing her sels so highly praised. stie sell a speaking, and humbly besought
the Grand Signior he would be pleased to justisie the love, which Ibrahim bare her %
some other way, then by thac of her beaucy.  She cold hira, chac ishe had not stronger chains
then thac, he would be blame-worthy for preserring her before his Highness; but without
considering, either her merit, or her beauty, he was co chink, that the assedion which he car¬
ryed to her, was one of the inevicable esseds of sympaehy or sace. Thae stie requested hira
to bcleeve, hovJ Ibrahim had done nothing, buc whac he could noc chuse buc do j thathe
knew withouc doubc as well as slie, chac che glory to serve so greac a Prince, was co' be pre¬
serred before all chings; buc his knowledg being ehe least of chac which governed his will,
he had abandoned Reasons parcy, to sollow thac of love.   Soliman ravissied wich the wit
of this Princess, desired her to pardon him for her forcible bringing away, and to remember
that he had not undertaken ic, buc Co save Ibrahim's lise. So sair a cause, answered the Ptin-
cess, could noc produce a bad essed, and whaesoever can sive Ibrahim, can never wrong
Isabella.  With such like discourses, the Sultan and these two illustrious Lovers entertained
themselves very pleasingly; but dinner time approaching, theGrand Signior to\d tk Buln,
that having purpofed to bestow the Sultania Asteria upon him for a wise, and his bvenot
permitting chac he slbould be so happy, as Co have the moft excellent man upon the Earth in
hisallyance, he would at least-wise bring him 7/^^s//&lt;« with thesame pomp, and with the
same ceremony, as is stie had been his daughter indeed.   Aster so obliging a discourse,
he retired, leaving Isabella extreamly satissied, both of his wit, his courtesie, and gene¬
rofity.

that you will make any ill construdion of the liberty I give you: It will be eriough then for
you to quit your lodging, wichout quitting your Palace unto me, which how sair soever it is,
cannot be agreeable to me without you. This illustrious Basa would not yeeld aC sitst, buc
at lengch he obeyed the Princess.
</p>
<p>In the mean time they who saw Ibrahim,conld not doubc buc that Soliman had sound out
the right remedy, which could throughly chase away his melancholy. Hiseye was quicker,
his countenance raore lively, his speech stronger, his gate morcsteddy, and this change was
so great and sudden, that every one spake of it as of a prodigy. In sine, ehe presence of Isa¬
beUa did thae in a sew days, which ehe arc of che Physicians could noc do in a very long cime;
and the Grand Visier sound hirasels in so persed an health,as he bad never been in a be:ctT. Buc
whil'st be was happy, Soliman did noc enjoy so greac a eranquillicy : The sighc of Isabella
through an inevicable sate had cxciced Crouble in his soul. For whereas he had erainently mee
in che person of chis Princess with all chebeaueies of Roxelana md Axiamira, and agrear
deal of resemblance of both of them, especially of thelast, hecould not chuse bue be in all
ehe paslion for her alone, which he had been in for ehe other two. This greac Prince render¬
ed noc himsels for all chac withouc sighcing; and it raay be he had noc been vanquilhed, is at
the beginning hehad known che forces of his Enemy. Buc whac Crouble soever the sitst
s\^toi Isabella broughc Co his heart, he choughc nocwichstanding thae Reason, and his
sriendsliip Co Ibrahim, would be stronger then his inclination. It was not because he had noC
tryed the weakness of the forraer; buc for che second, he beleeved chat noching could over¬
come ic. In chis considence, che sirst days of Isabella's beingit Conltaminople, and chat
Ibrahim was noe as yec in an estace Co go Co che Serraglio, he concinued visicing him as he
was wone co do: Buc Che more he saw Isabella, the more charming he sound her; he always
observed some new grace in her; and her wic raaking her still Co be more known, his passion
still augmented the more: Howbeit he perceived noc the violence and power of it, till su'ch
time as civility would no longer permic hira co see her. For che Grand Visier having reco¬
vered strength enough eo go co che Serraglio, Soliman having no more precexc Co visic
him, saw himselt deprived of che sighc of Isabella, and by this privation he selt in his heare
rhat this person alone could raake up all his selicity, or all his raisery. This Prince no sooner
knew the forceof this Enemy, by which he had sofsered his soul to be forprized but
he would have oppofed ic. Whacl said he Co himsels, unjust and cruel chat I am
cannoc I, ascer ehe obtaining of so many Vidories abroad, vanquisti my sels this once?

</p>




<p>so great unto him, but that he hoped to overcome it, is he could absent the GranciViL
as the assairs of Persia seemed co require. Whereupon he sraraed ehe design of it, aster he
had a long time combated in himsels, and prepared to give audience co the Embassador the
Sophi had senc to demand Axiamira and Selixana of him; seeming to have no other thoueht
then that of the assairs of Persia, nor other ob/ed, but the good of his Empire. He also let
VlamaVnovi, that what he had demanded sox Mahamed \NiS granted him; and the care
of his State seemed to cake him up in such fort, as albeit he became very raelancholique, and
that his countenance was alcered, Ibrahim suspeded no ocher thing, but that the incer¬
tainty wherein he was, whether he sliould make use of the persons of Axiamira, Muhmd,
and Selixana, whom he had in his hands, for the making of some propofitions of peace,
because he was pressed by the assairs of Hmgary, or that he sliould continue the War of
Persia.
</p>
<p>In tbe mean time Ibrahim and 7/&lt;i^s//&lt;«, considering their fortune, could not well imagine
by whac way they mighc obcain their libercy; ic being incredible chac Soliman sliould be car.
ryed to the design of forcibly bringing away the Princess, for to lee her return again into het
Councry, and Co deprive himsels for ever ofa man, from whom he seemed to be inseparable.
So as not knowing what to do, or what to resolve on, theGrand ny?sr propounded unto
her, considering the estate wherein things were, that slie would permit him toraikeone
warlike voyage more against che Persians; to the end,that having repaired ehe difordetj which
his absence had caused in chac Kingdom, he mighc ac his recurn come and cast himsels at the
Sultan's seet, and demand for a reward of his vidories onely che libercy of rceurning into
his Country; wich the resolucion, that is he did not granC chac which he desired of him, not
to be more generous chen he, and Co obcain that by slighe which he had resused him, since,as
it seemed to hira, he mighc do it wichouc injustice. Ae sirst chis propoficion surprized IstM-
la ; and her heart perswaded her, that Ibrahim had not Reason on his side. What, said Ihe,
will you always abandon mc? and will you sinde no place in all the world where we nii)i
live together ? when you were come to Monaco, you quitted me to return unto Cw/n"-
tinople; and now that Fortune hach brought me thither,- you will abandon me to go into
Persia; but wich this grievous disserence, that when as you quicced me ac Monaco, youlc t
mc in my Councry; your person was the onely thing, chac I loft; yourabsenccmadeupaU
my gries; and sear sound no place in my soul buc for the loveof you: But in chis encounter
I have cause to be astaid of all things. You will abandon me in a Country, whofe langaige,
manners, customs, and Religion, are disserent from ours, and where vertue is not sound Wt
in the person of Soliman. I will not make use, concinued slie, of che Reasons, which you
made use of, when you would not let me come to Constantinople, in making meconlider
whac would become of me is ie happened that you sliould dye: But chac is not my tear, ik-
ine it is certain, that in what place soever of the Earch chis misfortune stiould arrive unto ins,
I sliould always be equally sensible of it; that nothing can increase ordiminislimy gi».
that I sliall everywhere sinde the remedy to sinisli it; and that my death would w«tnou

<p>I know well enough, answered the Princess, that I ara of a sex which ought not to see war
ssve in pidure; but what will you have me do ? I see too well, continued slie, that we are
in a deplorable estate, andthat we cannoc seek for a reraedy, whereof che evenc is not very
doubtsul. Aster the obligations wherein you stand engaged to Soliman, there is no talk of
slight; yea and I seel in ray heare someehing that resists it. On the other side, I know sull
well that in the estate wherein the assairs of his Empire now stand, and his srit ndsliip to you
considered, it will not be easie for my tears to obtain our liberty; and sroiu chence I judg,
that nothing but generofity alone can constrain hira not to resuse us. Upon the vidory over
the Tersiansowx sreedom depends, is it beso that we may ever obtran it; bud sear too,
that this remedy is not very well assured. For is you prove not fortunate in this war, how
dare you demand your liberty? and is you be vidorious, it is to be seared rhat in sighting
sox Soliman, you sight not against your sels; that the conquests you sliall make for him, do
not keep him also stom resolving to part with you; and in this fore, I cannoc make use of che
power which you do give rae co dispofc of you in this occasion, my reason not being strong
enough alone of ie sels eo take any resolucion.

<p>Ibrahim saw chac all che Princesses Objedions were so powersul, as hecould chink of no¬
thing able Co destroy chem. Buc ae lengch, ascer well examining the macter, chey sound how
it was true, that it mighc happen the voyage of s^r/j* would serve them to no purpofe; but
they sound withall, that it was Che onely ching chac could be benesicial to them; knowing
well enough, thac is Soliman covAd be vanquislied, ic would be onely by generofity. Ibra¬
him assured the Princess as much as pofsibly he could, thac no misfortune stiould arrive to het
in his absencc, relying in such fort on Soliman's sriendstiip Co him, as he could not doubc but
thac he would be very caresul in proceding her. And chough he knew thac ehe Saltan was
very suscepcible of love, and chac he had seared before ac Monaco, lest he would have been
eoo sensibly couched with//.i^//«i's beauty, is slie obstinacely persisted in her decermination
to sollow him to Consiantinople, yet had he no sear of it in this encounter. Thae which
gave him chis eranquillicy of spirie, was because he knew, thac chis Prince had never been ta¬
ken, bue with the sirst sighc of the persons whom he had loved; that love never entred into
his heart but by surprizing him; and thac whomsoever he had once seen wichout passion, was
not able asterwards to touch him with any. And whereas Soliman, contrary to his custom,
had taken greac care Co conceal his choughcs, hehad noc perceived hishstto Isabella; but
contrarily, thinking that he had seen her without loving her, he beleeved chac hewassasoon
that side. In this Opinion he che more easily resolved for che War of Persia • and whereas
he knew chac assairs were presling, and chat the Sopht's Embassador having had' audience, tbe
Z),t;^«. would be held the nexe day, wherein peace or war for the incerest of che Empite
would be concluded, he conjured che Princess to take her last resolucion. Emilia, who was
present at this Councel, was on i^r^i/Vs side, and perswaded the Princess to consenc Co the
voyage he would undercake. And Co carry her che sooner chereunco, the .S^/^ told her sur-

<p>Upon these and many Other reasons the Princess resolved for this grievous reparation and
Ibrahimh^ving lest her, aster they had raade new protestations of sidelity the one tothe
other, he went unto Soliman to begin the preparing of his minde to che war of Persia. This
Prince, who never swerved from che way of vercue buc by constraine, had sought so mighti¬

at least-wiso have never made sliew of ic, had noC che Grand Visier hirasels contributed to

as ic IS very dissiculc to re jed thac which raay sacissie us, it was Impofsible for the Sidtan to
resuse thac which Ibrahim ofsered. He had had strength enough, aster a long combate and
aster he had an hundred times changed his opinion, to resolve noc Co propound this voyage
unco him, since he could noc undercake it without quitting Isabella; but he had not enough
noc Co accepc of chat which could content his pasllion. He deterrained for all that, because
the maecer regarded che good of his Empire, co have ie propofed in the Divano, to the end

until he had well examined the importance of it.

out communicating unto them the mattet he had in hand; to the end that havitig acquainted
them with the importance of it, they taight give him saithsol and dis sntscressed coUnsel.
Asc r that, he represented unto them iM vidories which he had obtained over the Persians
through the valor of Ibrahim; and theo, the misadventures. Which his absence ind Vlama's
hurt had caused in that Country. He told them that nothing rested of all bis conquests, but
the remembrance that they hid been made: and whereas he had an ititention to carry them
to a war, he aggravated with a gscae deal of vchemertCy, howsliamesul it would be tothe
Empire to make peace aster they had been last beaten. He told them withall notwithstand¬
ing, that having the Princess Axiamira the daughter of the Sdphii and Prince Mahamed
his son, in bis hands, he was in an estate, is they thought sir, to tender propofitions of peace
mtoTachmof; butthat they should well eximine before-hand, whether that would not be
dishonorable; and that they sbould remember, how in publique interests particular interests
were noe always to be considered, andthat the glory of the Erapire was tobe preserred a-
bove all things.
</p>
<p>Aster he had spoken thus unto them, he commanded chem to delivrr t^eir Opinion?, which
proved not to be alike, for they were all carryed by disserent thoughts. Some, won by/s^jss-

were of the same o|5isiion • some again, to please the J'«//4»,counselled she war; and others,
for their particular intesest likewise, oppofed peace. Yet did they not for all chat deliver theit
Opinions tumultuously, not withouc giving reasons for them; but contrarily keeping a mar¬
velous decorum In this Cotincel, they spake all severally, and without precipitation.   Buc
whereas, according Co the order which is observed amongst the r»/"/^x, Ibrahim \ms to de-

iS Machmut, Cadilescherof Natelia, vthohid been suborned by Roxelana, besought his

noc take che libercy to contradid him is I could, for I know his generofity too well for that •
but because his Reason renders it sels so absolute a Mistress of anothers, asit is not pofsible

ther base or sliamesul in a Prince to procure che peace of his subjeds, he conceived chat is it

the obtain-ng thereof, ic was Co be done: and so much che rather, because in continuing this
war, che crcasures of che State would be unproficably exhausted ; the power of rhe Sultm
would be impaired by the lofs of the Janizaries yN\s\ch^No\x\d perisli in it; yea and the ho¬
nor of che Arms of the Empire would be once again hazarded: and all this without attend¬
ing any recompence from ir, ic being absolutely impofsible to maintain tbe conquests that
were made in Persia, whereof History gave sussicient proof; and therefore is war were to
be made, thac ic was beceer eo sall upon ehe Christians wieh an Army of sive hundred thon¬
sand men, which would strike sear into all Europe, amplisie the limits of the Empire, and
eternize the narae of Soliman, rather then to lofe thera to no purpofe: How it vsould bea
sharae to see one day in History, chac Soliman had warred a long cirae against tbe Sophi; that
at several times he had led raillions of men into Tersia, and ascer all, chac there stiould not be
remaining under the dominion of his succesfors, somuch as one sooc of ground of thecon-
quests he had made there. Sinally he concluded, that not chis war, but the other, was to be
thoughc on.
</p>
<p>Isus, Cadilescher of Greece, maintained this Opinion, though out of a disserent meaning;
fortheformer was carryed by the perswasions of i2oA:s/«e»&lt;j, and he by the sole consideration
of che publique good. Bue he added Co che others Reasons, chac is che war of Persta conti.

more dangerous and more deadly then the other; chat is chis mischies stiould arrive, as the
murmuring of che people seemed co chreacen, chey stiould then be constrained to propound J
sliamesul peace Co Tachmas, who ic may be, Co raake use of chis advantage, would not ac¬
cept of it; chat so they sliould have Enemies both without and within, whil'st the Christi¬
ans, which were buc Tribuearies of che Empire, mighc pofsibly undercake co sluke ofs the

ic was just that Soliman shoxAd surpass his predecesfors in something; that theybjdcon-
quered from the Christians, as well as he; buc chac none had conserved chac which thq/ hid

to the design ot impairing the Empire on all parts, to make new conquests on that tide; since
without hazarding any lofs of the one side to gain on the other, there needed no^morc then eo
oblige Ibrahim to make one journey o-ore chicher; that it was without doubt trom his hand

him; and all the rest being divided amongst the seaven that had already spoken, it was for
Ibrahimto deliver his advice; but he was constrained to attend a little, because Machmut
said a second time to maintain his sirst opinion, that it would bc a stiamc Co be expofed to che
lofs of che advantage which they had over ehe Christians. Achmat answered, ehae ie would
beagreacer to demand peace aster ehey were bcacen. The Basa Tiali added, chac extream
resolutions were diogerous Co Monarchies; and chac in ehe end Pdnces, which loved chcir
Subjeds, and whofe Empire was greac enough, oughc noe Co raake War, buc for the procuring
of peace. IJus, to fortisie this opinion, said surther, chac che people were noc eo beso lietle
considerable with the Emperor, since from thera came his riches, his force, his power, and his
greatness; that the people had in forae parts of the wodd been happy without Kings, but no
Kings could be so without Subjeds: Hesaid likewise, that prudence neve'r did anything
precipitously, and still would have the Prince spare the blood of his people. But the Bassa
of the Sea replyed, that it was ofcentimes just and necessary co lofe one pare of his Subjeds tor
the preservation of the other; and that an Erapire was a greac Body, for che maincenance
whereof all things might be done, withouc considering particular incerests. Scander added,
thac a greac Prince was never Co make peace bue wich ehe sword in his hand, and ehae che way
to keep ehe people from murmuring, was eo raake ic advaneageonsly; ehae for ehe esseding
thereof sive hundred thousand raen were to bc raised, co the end chey raighc obcain ehae by
force which could noc be obcained by any ocher racan.
</p>
<p>This Bass^a having given over speaking, Ibrahim repeaced in order all che opinions chat
had been given ; he consuccd chac of ehe Bassa PiaU; approved that ot Scander Capitan
Basa; mightily oppofed Machmut's advice, as also that of Isus; commended the generous
resolutions of y4/t the 5&lt;i]/4 of the Sea, and the prudent considerations of y^c/!;»?/ar, with ex¬
ception nevertheless of the praises he had given him. But at length for a conclusion he said,
that great Princes were always CO give peace, and not co demand it; th^tis So Uman'sehiAdxen
had happened Co have been ehe Sopht's prisoners, all ehae could chen have been done was buc eo
propound ic; and chac even Tachmas was so generous as noc Co do ic, chough Prince Ma.,
hamed and the Ptincess Axiamira were in his Highness hands; chac ic was a gallant thing in
theVisforioustofpeakof Peace, because they thereby deraonstrated, that the sole desire of
glory had made them sight; but that it was always sliamesul, how specious a pretext soever
might be taken up for it, to speak of peace, when as one had been beaten. That this were to
yield up the Vidory, and to render ones arras Co his Enemy, Co implore che pity of the Con-

manded ot him in case hi sliould dye,was a thing whereunto h- could not answer,that thought
being too grievous for him to settle his mind upon it; that for her more sasety during his ab¬

in the old Serraglio, in the company ofhis mother, ot his sisters, and his daughters; that the
Sultana 4/?sr/&lt;i, to whom he was foraewhat obliged, sliould take care to entertain her; and
that for the exercise ofher Religion, sbs should go forth as ofcen as she would; thac his ma¬

my which can be redoubted of me, and which I stiall not easily formount.   Remember vet
Madara, that on Vidory our happiness depends; that to obtain it I must expofe my selstd

be violently pluck'd out of the hands of Vidory, isone may be perraitted to speak so. One
must sight to remain Master ofthe sield; one must give an example for the Soldiers to sollow
and put ones sels in jeopardy of being vanquislied for to be vidorious.   I tell you all these

without remerabring thofe withall, which you have endured for rae.   I am as saulty towariis
Justiniano, as Jusliniano is towards Isabella ; or to say better, we are equally innocent; and
our innoccncy it maybe causes our persecution, since it is ordinary with Fortune tofallsoiil
upon none but vertuous persons.   I hope nevertheless, added she, that Heaven will ere long
give an end to our ciptivity, or to our lives. Is we were, concinued Isabella, in ehe hands of
a Prince, thac used us ill, and laded us wieh irons, I should methinks have the more consolation,

And aster a conversation as sad, as their Souls were asslided, slie readied him her hand, which

<p>Ic was at this instane chat theyseltth3C which cannot be txprest ; You had reason indeed,
said che Princes co him, to steal away from me when you Itrst rae ac Monaco, and to save me
the griesofbidding you sarewell; but I do not know, saidssie unco him, whether you have
any now to raake me prove it. Is it your pleasure rhen. Madam, answered he, that I sliall not
part? No, replyed soe, donotyoustickat whatI say, it is only gries that makes me speak:
Go and break our chains, carry a stronger heart then I, and that you raay not augraent ray
weakness, do not oblige me to bid you tarcwell. As she was saying so, ttie gates of the Ser¬
raglio opened, ind Ibrahim, seeing himselt Constrained to quit tier in a place where men ne¬
ver come, assured ber at this last instant, that be would quickly return a Conqueror. The
Charec was no sooner entred, but he mounted on horseback, and without speaking a word
more to any body, he went out of Consiantineple with his Train, to overtake the Troops,
which were inarching towards T"***/^, carrying in his heart the moft sensible asslidion, thac
ever he had tryed. He had this advantage nevertheless over the Princess, that he could enter¬
tain his thoughts without interruption, but it was not so with her. For a; soon as she had
been conduded ro a stately lodging, which was prepared for her, che grand Signiors Mother,
although slie hated Ibrahim, came to visit her sollowed by all the Sultanaes, thereby to please
Solman, who had increaeed her unto it. The Sultana Asteria, as the savorite of the Empe¬
ror her sather, had been permitted to learn the Italian Tongue, aster the goodwill sbe had
born to Ibrahim had made her to desire ir; so as it was slie that held up the conversacion in
this visit, and that expressed the compliraents ofthe othex Sultanaes to Ijabella, who re¬
ceived them with a great deal of civility, although the excreara gries slie was in raight have
dispenced her from le. Buc whereas Asieria had address and wic, and knew that Isabella
was asslided, slie so ordered the macter as this visit was not long. The SuUanaes went away
then charmed with the beauty of the Princess; ind Asieria soundher sels as rauch inclined
to scrve her, as slie had been beforetime to save the \[se of Ibrahim. It is crue chac chough
they were all gone buc this last, yec was noc Isabella ac libercy Co think of her'misfortunes;
For the Sultan sent the Boftangibasti, who is as ic were the Superintendant of the Gardens,

<p>bella reprehending her sds, racher z6mxe Ibrahim's good fortune, in thathe could oblige
vou to save his lise, and asterwards gain the assedion of the greacest Prince of tbe Earth; and
to joyn our good fortunes, as our interests are joyned, I must add surther, m having procured

</p>
<p>This conversation, having lasted an indisserent longtime, combined the Sultana Asteria
and tbe Princes inso strait a league of sriendsoip, as they were almoft inseparable, to long as
Jsabella continued in the old Serraglio. The day aster slie was come thither, ScLman vilir-
ed ber, and by this last sight made the chains which captived him stronger then before. The
incertainty he was'in, wholly ceased; and the corabat which be had in his heart, between his
sriendstiip to the grand Visier, and the passion he was in sox Ijabella, was at an end; and
love remaining ablolutely vidorious, sJs mind bad some more peaceable raoments, so that he
had no other thought, then ofthe Conquest of//»&lt;^&lt;?//^. But whereas he knew, that to make
himsels be beloved, he must sirst please, he complyed so sar with her, as not Co speak of any
thing bcjt Ibrahim in this sirst visit. He craved pardon of the Princess for being the cause ot
hjs aWence from her; he desired her not to reraeraber it was he that caused her to be brought
away by force; and to think that slie was in a place, where slie might absolutely command 3
where slie sliould see no body but thac would obey arid serve her with joy. Isabella answer¬
ed to so obliging a discourse with all the civility and acknowledgment slie was capable of:
but whereas slie was sad, though she constrained her sels co seem otherwiie, he Intreated her
to be as merry as shs. could, for tear lest melancholy dirainishing her beauty, jt might be layd
to his charge, ehae he had buc ill preserved so rare a ching.
</p>
<p>The Princess having proraised him all chac he desired, he wene away very rauch sacissied,
and very araorous, and lesc her wich as great an estecra of hira, as Ibrahim could not have
more. And whs.reas Asieria seldom abandoned her, she talked to her the rest of the day of
nothing but of t'iie admiration she v}2.s in of Soliman, ofthe vertues ot this Prince, ofthe
greatness of his Tpirit, of that exceeding and generous sriendsliip, which he testisied to our illu¬
strious Basa.
</p>
<p>Aster chis sirst visit there were nothing but raagnisicences in the old Serraglio. Soliman
senc every day new presencs Co IsabeUa; and in consideracion ofher Co the SuUanaes, which
lived in the same place, for sear lest envying her they stiould corae to hate her, and so lofe the
care of pleasing her. And whereas there passed not a day, wherein this Prince did not visic
Isabella, Roxelana, who knew him to the very bottom of his heart, quickly perceived the
true realon that caused these yisus. Yet did not jealousie seize upon her Soul for all that; and
the only design ofraaking use of this occasion to de^xoy Ibrahim, and to labor the re-esta-
blislimept of Rustan, was that which raade her work in the raanner, as sliall be seen in the se¬
quel ofthis discourse. But for as much as the grand Signiors Mother hated Ibrahim, because
soe loved Roxelana, she communicated her sulpicions unto her, and they both concluded, that
in all likelyhood Soliman's asliduity was an essed oflove; and that it it were so, it would be
almoft an insallible mean to destroy tbe grand Vister, who it was said was desperately in love
with this person. For coming to know this paslion, he would questionless do things, which
would make him bc banished, is he did not voluntarily banisli hirasels.
</p>
<p>Having held this secrec counsel, Roxelana, sar srora txoubling Soliman's designs, thought
of nothing else but raaking hira raore in love with the Princess; being not jealous but of her
authority, and searing Ibrahim's power, rauch raore then Ijabella's beauty. And for this
tss^, whereas there is scarce any saith in Turkey of proof against presents, slie suborned one
ot the Slaves, who went dayly to ofser her forae new liberality from the Sultan,to the end that
according to the occasions slie raight invent forae obliging compliraent to him srora 7^^^^//^
who Ignorant of a I these things, lived with as much content and rest, as the absencc of the
grand VtsHrwoxxldpexmxt her. ^/.m hadso great a care of her, and ^.//«...« rendred her
to many devoirs, as soe had soarcely any leafore to think of her misfortunes. In tbe mean
time the Sultan was not a littk perplexed, out of the sear he was in to discover his love to the
Princess; for albeit he knew soe esteemed him, yet he beleeved that it was as much forthe
assedion which he cemed to bear Co the Bas,, as for his own merit. So that not darL as
yet to decUre himsels openly, he contented hirasels with praising her beauty, her wit and all
he excellent qualities which were in her, in talking to her of Ibrlhim; an7 his narae' whih
hadbeenso considerable with him, was employed against him that owed it.   Forsooft^a.

<p>he commanded Isabella, hc would exagerate how happy Ibrahim was tobe beloved ofs
marvelous a person; what judgment sbrahim had stiewed in the choyce he had made ot htr'
and out ofa malicious galhntry he told her many times, chac Ibrahim was to blame tor aban'
domng her at .'Monaco, to come and keep his word with him; chac ie was a great sault in hini
to go to the Persian War, and not to dye with gries, rather then to quit her; thai for him is
he had been in his place, he would never have done so, chinking ic a great deal sweeter to d'ye
then to be absent trom her.   So arcisicial a discourse, was noC for all chac interpreted by lU
bella as Soliman desired, and without seeking for any hidden sense in it, slie beleeved thatit
was a pure tssed ofthe Sultan's corapliance, who thinking to please her, would talk to her of
Ibrahim in any manner whatsoever.   In this ignorance,slie always answered him very civilly
and with a great deal of resped; so chac ineerpreeing in chis fore all that .yc//OT4» said unto
htrr, slie put him into an extream pain.   For withouc celling her precisely, that he was in be
with herbeauty, he would sain have had her perceive it; being so asraid eo ofsend her, that
this sear peradventure raight have wrought chac in him,which Reason could not do, had it not
been tor the messages,wh(ch the Slave whom Roxelana had suborned, at several times brought
him.                                                                                                                            ,
</p>
<p>But whil'st IsabeUa talked of Soliman's generofity, all the SuUanaes had no other discoutse
bnc ofthe love which he bore her. Asteria, perceiving it as well as the rest, and knowing to
what violences this paslion carried the Grand Signior, was much asslided at it, for IsahtlUi
interest, whom slie exceedingly loved. This raelancholy was quickly raarked by the Princess,
and whereas her cares and her mcrie had given her an high place in her assedion, slie one day
conjured her eo acquainc her with ehe caule of ic. Asteria judging wieh reason, that is Ihc
sliould tell her the truth, it would very rauch grieve her, excused her sels from it atsirst as well
as she could; but coming Co consider, that it raight be che ignorance wherein Isal&gt;elU\mi,
mighe sureher augment her unhappiness, slie resolved to conside in her, and to impart unto her
the suspicions (he had. Thac which made Asteria be interessed so strongly for all that con¬
cerned Ibrahim, as to forget che SuUan's incerests, was because slie had understood how
mighcily he had protedcd Mustapha and Gianger her brothers, whom soe had insinitely
loved; and how he had always oppofed the y/idencts of Roxelana, to whom soe bore a se¬
crec hatred, whofe chiessoundation was in ber proper vertue. Asliria, sollowing her reso¬
lution, aster slie had prepared 7/«^s//-«'s raind by a long discourse, to make good use of the
adv'ce she was goingto give her, and aster//&lt;i^(//&lt;« bad on her side promised her all manner
ofstdelity, told her, that knowing ihe Sultan her sather, as slie did, soe seared lest het
beauty had pofs.st him with more love for her, then he had sriendstiip for/^r&lt;jWw; and
that at list his reason would be sound weaker then his passion: Thac stie desired to discovet
her suspicions unto her, Co ehe end she mighc through her prudence examine the matter, k"
being altogether ignorant of it, she might increase the CJrand JtgwiVs unjust designs by
* innocenc civilitiey.
</p>
<p>At sirst this discourse surprized her, slie changed colour ever and anon, and out otthe
crouble slie was in, slie thoughc that Asteria spake not the truth,chough soe could not imgip
any reasonable cause for this sidion. The Sultanaes ingenuity notwithstanding destroyed tM
secret accusation, which slie charged her within her heart; and paslling from one extremity
CO anocher, slie in an instane justisied noC only Asteria, bue Soliman also, and calling to

<p>howbeit Emilia consirraed her in the opinion, that Soliman's respeds to her proceeded only
fromsriendso'p, in raaking her consider, thac Asttna's conjedurc was questionless grounded
on the belies of allthe othex Stiltanais, who suppofed thac the Grand Siguior could not
have any assedion for a woman, but straight it must be love; and who out of jealousie for
the presents that he sent her, and the civihties that he used to her, had imagined it could not be
otherwise. This reasoning carrying some likelyhood with it, comforted the Princess a little,
and aster stie bad run over in her memory all that Soliman had said, soe sound, being willing
to deceive her sels, that all his discourses and all his adions, might be interpreted to his ad¬
vantage : yet saw soe not so ranch certainty in all that soe imagined, that soe dUrst absolutely
rely upon it: and though soe seared the sight of theGrand Signior, out of the doubt stie was
inof sinding him guilty, yet had soe some inslancs, wherein soe desired it, outof a hope of
justisying him.

<p>Roxelana onhex hde, having communicated her di. sign to i?«/?&lt;«», and he approving ot ir,
they thought of nothing but of augmenting Solimans love to isabella, by the obliging raes-

chere were three raarvelous beautisul Slaves presented to the SuUan, who without being ever
a whit touched with their charras, had resused thera, is he had not by chance dcraanded of
thera whence they were; but having understood that they wereof/r&lt;«/^, he retained them
with a purpofe Co bestow ehera on//rs^s//^, seeking ascer noching wich raore care, rhen to
please her.   Hc went then to visit her, aster he had commanded that thofe three .Slaves Ihould
be carryed inco the old Serraglio: And whereas Asteria's discourse to her had rendred her
more melancholique then soe used to be, he marvelled at it, and by his much pressing her to
let him know the cause thereof, he raade the Princess apprehend, thac the SuUands suspici¬
ons were justly grounded; yet destroyed soe her sels, this her own opinion; and having an¬
swered the GrW Signior, that her raelancholy was derived srora the remerabrance of her
past misfortunes, rjther then stora any other reason, he desired her to forget thera, and noc
to render her sels unhappy with things, which would never arrive to her again. He told her
asterwards,that to corafort and delight her,he had chofen her out three Slaves, which it raay be
would not be disagrceable unto her; and would understand her orders betcer then the others

was Isabella they were to thank, and not him. And having demanded of them, to whom
their sriends were Slaves, they answered, that he which presented them to his Hi"hness could

<p>The Grand Signior, desiring to oblige the Princess in all things, went away for to leave h' r
at liberty to entertain her dear sriends, and to take order for the delivery of thofe Slaves
whom she had recommended unto hira. When he was gone, embraces and civilities beein
asresh between IsabeUa and these three sair maids: EmiUa likewise testisicd the satissastion.
which she had to see them; but in the midst of their sirst apprehensions ot joy, the rtmera-
brance of thc^ir pleasures past,raade thera socd tears of forrow. They demanded ot oneano-
ther, by what adventure they were raet together in the same place; and being scarce able to
beleeve what they saw was true, their amazement redoubbd every moment. The desire of
demanding one thing was loft by tbe curiofity of knowing another, and going both at cnce
CO ask the Princess questions, and to answer thofe which she asked of them, neither of them
answered precisely to each other. Howbeit the Princess understood that thofe Sriends, which
were Slaves, as well as Dorta, were Horatio, the Srench Marquis, and Alphonso. She de¬
sired to hear some news of the Count of Lavagna, and of Leonora his wise, but Sophronii
told her sighing, that she sliould know their adventures too (oon; and Hipolita added, thit
in a day wherein Fortune had done them so great a grace, ic was not sit to remember so many
misFortuncs.
</p>
<p>In the in.an time Isabella,v^ho seared lest the name of SerragUo soould disquiet thtm, and
make them conceive forathing to her disadvantage, acquainted thera with the disserence which
there wasbetween the old SerragLo,^ndihditof theGrand Signior's women. Andwherer
as in her discourse she many tiraes naraed Ibrahim without chinking of ic, and spake of him,
as ofa man, inconsideration of whom the i'«/?&lt;i» savored her, Jo/iAyoxw demanded of her,
who this Ibrahim was ? This question raade the Princess blusli, but ac length soe informed
them that this Ibrahim W2iS Justiniano; it seeraing unto her, that in the eltate wherein theit
fortune stood, it was not requisite to make a secret of his adventures to them. This novdty
t(\U3\hs suxpxized Hipolita, Leonida, znd Sophronia; not being able to imagine, butthat
all which they were told was any other then a sidion: Their own experience forced thera
notwithstanding Co bdeeve, chat whic had been imparced to thera was true, there being no
more dissiculty in giving credit to that which was arrived to thera, then to that which bid
happened to IsabeUa.
</p>
<p>When it was almoft Evening, the Boftangibajsi came to the Princess from Solman, to till
her, ehae according co her order (for he was commanded co speak co her in chofe cerms) he
had caused Horatio, Daria, and Alphonso Co be delivered; but for the othsr, he could not
poflRbly learn as yet where he was; cbat all he could understand ot hira was, how in less then J
month he had changed his Master nine or centimes; buthe besoughc her not tobetroaWed
at it, assuring her that he would the next day make a general review of all the Slaves in to"-
stantinople, rather then sail in sinding out of him; whora soe desired to have: T^.''" ""?^'

slie might go every day and visit thera at Ibrahim's Palace, where their sriends were aire
attending for them, and whither be had order to condud chem; alTuring her that theyinou

<p>The Sisth Boo{.
</p>
<p>IT was no sooner day, but Isabella sent to desire permission of tbe Grand Signior, that she
raight go and visit her dear sriends, which he durst not deny, so rauch was he asraid to
displease her; He repented hira nevertheless for having raadc////&gt;*/»&gt;&lt;«, Sophronia, ind Leo¬
nida go out of the Serraglio; and seared lest chat which he had done for his content sliould
destroy it; for it was true, that he was not carryed thereunto, so rauch by the rtquisiteness
of things, as the doubc he was in, ehae he soould noc be able eo speak eo che Princess in pri¬
vate, so long as chey were with her. Isabella then, having obtained the perraission which
slie had demanded, went to Ibrahim's Palace with as rauch raagnisicence, as is soe had been
the SuUana Quieen. Horatio, Alphonso, Leonida, Sophronia, and Hipclita, received her
with exceeding satissadion, yet was it less for all that then Doria's, who having understood
from his sister, that Justiniano was in that Country, was in so extraordinary an irapatience to
know by what adventure he was corae thither again, as he had scarcely made his sirst coraple-
raent, when as he conjured her to acquaint hira with it: But she, that was in no less Co un-
derstandhis, and thofe of his sriends, and by what hap they were arrived there, told him,
that he soould not know ir, till he had inforraed her what good or bad fortune liad condud¬
ed thera to Constantinople. Hipolita and Horatio protested, chac chac was che least thing
they could pay her for theliberty which soe had given thera. As for Sophronia, slie consented
not without regret to this sad and pitisul relation, well foreseeing that solaraentsble a dis¬
course would coft her raany a tear: howbeit soe desired at least, thac Doria raighc be he who
raight recount their misfortunes, it being irapoflible for her to do it. Doria, not using to re-
siis Sophronia, W3S preparing to obey her, when as Hom/(, told his sister, that ie would be
unjust eo oblige him Co ehis relacion, by reason of che name he bore; and albeic chac chey
which were raingled m ehis advcncnre were his Eneraies, yec were chey still his Kinsraen.
i)m4 answered chereunco smiling, chac Lovers had no ochers buc thofe of their Mistresses:
But in the end Alphonso was the rain that contented the curiofity of Isabella. As soon as
for rhe honor of Ibrahim's Palace, stie had led thera into his Cabinet, and that they wete see

wayssodis-incercslcd, as chey have appeared unto us; but««^«s, this is not a place, where
I am Co cell you whac the Count bekeved concerning him: As for me, that ever speaks sin-
cerely of things, I hold that his intentions were as sair as his enterpriz''.
</p>
<p>Bue CO come CO chac which I am co impart coyou, andtokeepyou from being too micli
surprtzcd by the Counts last adion, I am to tell you, that although in appearance hewjsthe
sweeccst, checivilcst, ehe gallantest, andofthesrecstandmoft peaceable dispofition that ever
had been seen, and that he gave himsels coall the exercisesof a man of his quility, wherein
he had profited admirably, yet had he an iraperious spirit, and was always pofsest with some
great design.   Ambition, and the desire of glory, were bis predominant passions, and the on¬
ly things for which he did all others.His education did not contribute ought to these thou'^hts-
for whereas he remained yet young enough under the government of his Mather, who'was
the moft ambitious woman that ever was, she gave hira a part of her inclinations.   He had
had for his Governor one named Pensa, by Simbaldo his sathers appointment, whofe man¬
ners were wholly noble, and thac had instruded him in all the sairest knowledges, which a
person of his condition raight have.   But chis raan being too moderate for the bringing up of
the Count according co his mochers designs, she placed another abouc him, buc yet without
removing che former, to tbe end thac is ehe one taught him the Sciences, the other Ihould
teach him noc to make use of them, but to arrive at the height of soveraign greatness.  These
two men being oppofite in all things, gave him also quice contrary counsels.   The sirst made
him in ehe Roman History observe the noble adions of chofe, who had expofed chemsdvei
for che saseey of ehe Comraonwealeh; and che other raade him ofcencimcs read che Conspiracy
of Catiline, ehe lives of Tiberius ind Nero; Nevertheless whereas the Counts indinationj
were coo vercuous to love crimes, he sollowed noC che advice of this same; bue his Soul be¬
ing wichill coo ambicious co be consined wichin the diredions of Pensa, he took a third way,
and loved nothing so much as the reading of the lives of Alexander and Casar, especially ot
this last; and he was wont co say, chac chey which had called him Tyrant were to blame;
since he can never be so, chie aspires noc co che soveraign power, bue for ehe using of ic well;
and chey which sound chemselves capable of governing people, were responable ro Heaven For
noc imploying a Talent, which mighc be advancagious eo all the world.
</p>
<p>These discourses were not ac chac cime considered buc by his Mocher, who cook incredible
delighc cherein: buc ac lengch, che Coune, being arrived ac sevenceen years of age, saw lio-
nora, che sxsket of Julio ind Horatio Cibo, in an assembly, vihexe Jannetin Doria, the Ne¬
phew and Savorice of tAndrea Doria, was presenc as well as he.   You have without doubt
observed, tha Leonora, chough gencle and civil, had for all ehae a raajestick reservcdness,
which stiewed in her behavior ehae soe had something ot greac in her Soul..  1 tell you this,
Madam, co lee you know wiehall, ehae ie was wieh ehis charra, racher rhen wieh her beauty,
thae stie began to please ehe Coune.   He regarded and observed her wich care; and seeirg
noching in all her adions, thac was noe boch excream civil, and a little iraperious, he beganto
love her, and so much the more ardently, because he knew that this alliance vvould not be dn-
advantageous to him; is he sought aster either nobility of race, or coraraodicy ot riches, lot
thac being born ofa sirst wiso of her sarhers, stie was her only heir. Buc is Leonora was agre¬
able to the eyes of the Count, it raay be said, thatheseemedcharmingtoX#«;»slr&lt;»'s: sj^J-
rily I must acknowledg, that I never saw him so araiable, as inthis asserably; and it i^
speak the truth, I do not beleeve rhat there can scarce be sound in one only person grs*^^^^
lity then he had.   And for agreeable chings, ic raay bc well assured, that never man was mo

<p>Counts designs: for, said he unto hira raising up bis voyce, it is sit for us to observe rhis yourg
Lion. He is undertaking, and hardy, and is we susser hira to gather new forces, by allying
with the house of O'^o, and Z,so»(7r&lt;»'s riches, he will be capable of encerprizing any ching.
^4»»*rj« barkened Co this discourse as one that was interessed therein, and obeying Andre(i'&amp;
ordir, he observed the Count and Leonora, and consirmed himselt in the opinion he had had,
both by his own knowledg, and the talk of the Town. Being in no longer doubt then but
that the Count was in love with Leonora, he advertised his Uncle ofit, who without surther
delay coraraanded him to be tbe Counts Rival in this suit. Ic would not be enough, said he to
Jannetin, is we soould bat break ofs tbe Counts marriage; but we must raake profit of his
daraage, and pluck the weapons out of his bands, to destroy hira therewith when we are Ma¬
sters of thera. ^oxxmu&amp;mvcxy Leonora, soe is sair and araiable; but were she only noble
and rich, it would be enough to oblige you to marry her. Think of it then, Jannetin; you
are young as well as the Count, you have spirit and courage, and though it may be you have
not so good a grace as he, yet you are Nephew to Andrea Doria, and that is to say every
thing. Think then of winning-^so^ora's heart, before icbc engaged; buc above all, come
to no violence; for ic imporesmuch, chac che adopcive son of hira,who hach resfored Genoua
to her liberty, soould not engage hira to proted bira in such hke things. Jannetin, who
held all his fortune srora Andrea Daria, and who reverenced him more then is he had been
his sather, proraised hira to forgec nothing of all that sliould lie in his power to satissie him;
as indeed, all that care and raagnisicence could contribute to gallantry, appeared in Genoua
at that eirae; and had not your raelancholy retained you then ac Monaco, you would have
acknowledged as well as we, that the like had never been seen.
</p>
<p>But whereas tbc Count could not give place to any body, be no sooner understood Jan-
netin's design, but hc overtopped him in all things. There was nothing but running at the
Ring, Turneys, Serenades, Balls, and Seasts; and in all things is the Count was noc raore
magnisicent, yet was he more gentile. His apparel was braver, his horses were gallanter
his matches better made, hisserenades better contorted; insne, he hud the advantage in all
things. And wher&lt;;as he loved Leonora really, all the testimonies he gave her of it wrouehc
another essed in her heart, then the seigned protestations of Jannetin, who prevailed not
with her at all. Things contmued a while in this manner, during the which these cwo Rivals
lived civilly enough together, as well by reason of the order which Jannetin had received for

Cook for it; whereas he on the contrary could conceal none ofhis from him.
</p>
<p>Buc to ccm^zp\n to Jannetin, be had been no sooner instruded by his Uncle, but he
went home to the Count, who attended with a great deal of impitiencc the answer which
Horatio \N^s to miVehim, for it was hc who had m charge to give it him, he quitted this
musing humor to receive Jannetm's visic wich his ordinary civility ; and according to Anka
Doria's diredion, three of sannetin's sriends arrived a. the same tirae to be witnelTcs ofthese
two Rivals conversation. Aster the sirst corapleraents, Jannetin told the Count, thathe
came not only to render hira a visit, but also to render bim up his arms, and co demand the
grace of him, that he might b- one ot the captives of his Triumph. I know not, answered
the Count, what Triumph you mean. It is a Triumph, replyed Jannetin, wherein for a
Trophy of Arms you sliall have all the chains ofthe Lovers ofthe incomparable Leonora; who
knowing that you alone merit her, wilt sollow you without regret or envy; at leattwiselam
come hither to assure you, that that is ray'ntention: and is I had known that you had bom
an assedion to her, I would have been your Consident, rather then your Rival; yet ami
not forry, that I have had the comraodity to testisie unto you, that nothing in the world is
so dear to me as your sriendship.
</p>
<p>The Count understood presently Jannetin s cunning, yet would raake no soew of it, but
contrarily answered hira with a great rteal of civility and gallantry. I choughc, said heunto
him, that I had nothing to vanquish but tbe rigors ofmy Mistress, and is I had bdeeved that
I had had so redoubtable a Rival as you, I hadnot it raay be undertaken to serve her: But
since you are so obliging, as to content your sels with meriting her, wichoi,t pretending to her
pofsession, I ara ravislied to know that you have judged her worthy of your esteem; and to
understand tbac 1 sliall have noching more then her cruelty ro surmounc, since is you had con¬
tinued serving her, and that she had been just, ! stiould in your triumph have held the place,
which you demand in mine; and which I do not grant you, seeing he that yeilds up a vidory
cannot be said to have been overcome. Jannetin, hearing the Coune speak in this fort, be¬
leeved, that his cunning had succeeded, and took that for a testimony of sriendsoip and sree¬
dom, which was but an address ofhis wit; and that not having been able to vanqailh htm in
love, he had at least surmounted him in subtleey, and was arrived ac ehe end he had propound¬
ed CO himsels. Bue che Coune was coo clear sighted Co be deceived so easily ; and whereas the
moft dexerous guile is chac which perswades our enemies ebac chey have beguiled us, chougti
indeed we are noc; che Coune said so many obliging chings eo Jannetin, as he made no doubt
ac all, bue cbat he had abused his eneray; and chac from chence-forward hc would count him¬
sels essedively his obliged: nevercheless ic proved noc so, asyou will understand by tbc tcqiei

was so much the raore pleased with ic, for thac being ofan age wherein dcsghts, Musick, and
company make up the happiness of a lise, soe sound all these things in the Counts Pahce,where
soe lived with her sister aster her marriage; for it might be said, that this house was the retreat
of all worthy persons, and of all pleasures, which made the Count to be loved of every one.
In the raean tirae the profperous success ofhis love, had not sraothered his arabition, but con¬
trarily his eskeem of Leonora seemed to have augm.ncedit; ind Sophronia hath assured us,
how soe hath often heard him say, that his Fortune was noc worthy of her. This generous
Soul had noe ic raay be for all that been ever capable of the resolution which he took, chough
he beleeved it to be just, is the counstls of three raen, who did but slatter his ambition to sa¬
tissie their own, had not consirraed hira in that design. And truly it raust be acknowledgedj

thae Andrea Dona, who hxd adopted Jannetin for his son and succesfor a good while before,
had chen raade him his Lievttnant to the charge he held of Generalissimo .- And all this, con¬
tinued soe, whilestyou are denyed the pensions which the RepublJquegave Simbaldo yom sa¬
ther ; for it was true, that as long as he lived the Senate had assigned hira 3 pcnsion for a mark
of honor, which bad not been concinued Co the Court, because he had been suspeded by An¬
drea Doria, an eneray of the Srench, to be asseded to that Nation.

<p>In the mean tirae to return unto my subjed, the Count had no sooner heard what his Vo-
thcr said unto hira, but would have answered, when as soe staying hira told him roundly,
think before thou speakest of saying nothing to me unworthy of thy scls,or of m^ thac brought
thee into the world, and know chad willl disavow thee for ray son, isthoube sobase, as to
be contented with thy formne, and to endure, thatthey, who do not outgo thee either in
birth or merit, soould mount into the Throne, and leave thee amongst tne people.   1 his dis¬
course netted the great heart of tbe Count, who was but too sensible on that part, yet con¬
cealed he his resentment within himsels, and said no more to his Mocher, buc chat all he could
promise her was, how he would absolutely lofe himsels, or lofe them that oppressed him •
and that the sequd or end of hii h^e soould not permit her to complain ofhim.    Aster this she

ing che three men of che world, in whom hc moft consided, come by chance unto him as he
believed, ac a time when he had need of counsel, could not forbear cestisying a great dealof

ly to draw me out of the thought I am in at this present? I know not, m^wexei BmiH^
cunningly, whecher my sight be pleasing to you or no, but I kno jv very well that 1 hav*no-
Chingthac is pleasing totell you. We are in an age, said che Lawyer, wherein good men
hive no greac cause co rejoyce, seeing every day che ambition of some sew carry inlolently
away all ehae which oughc co be ehe recompence of vercue. Ic may be some one will ht sound
concinued Baptisla, that will make a change in things. But, said the Count interrupting
him, and addressing his speech to Verrin, what bad news have you to impart to me ? My
Lord, answered he, it is badder for the Republique, then for you; for in ^ne, to acquaint
yon thit Jannetin hath slill new honors conserred on him, is totell youthat the power o[
Andrea Doria will pass into his hands; that h:s Tyranny will be perpetuated in the person
ofhis Nephew; and that we sliall never have tbe happiness to see vertue where it ought
CO be.
</p>
<p>Ie is cercain, added Raphaello Sacca, ehae chis is the sence of all good raen; and in the mi.
sery of ehe age, ie seeraj, said he, addresiiing himsels co ehe Count, ehae all the woild turn
their eyes upon you. Your illustrious and great birth, accompanyed with so many rare qua¬
licies as are in your person, makes all chem chac love ehe pubbque gbod desire, that your for¬
tune were as greac as your heare: And for my particular, I would gladly see your vertueona
Theater higher then chac whereon you are, eo the end you might be seen of every one: But
you are born in so unhappy an age, as it seems you cannot aspire to the power of doing good
to your Citizens; so crue ic is, that Andrea and Jannetin Doria, under the name of the pub¬
lique liberty, have solidly cstablislied their Power, or to say better, their Tyranny. And in
this fort, one may well assure, that the people do sussiciently chastise themselves for the blinde
resolution, which carries them to sofke ofs che yoke of a greac and excellenc Prince, to susstt
to be impofed upon them thac of cwo Tyrants, who will be so much the raore crud, by how
much they are less accustmed eo raign. Their weakness, being supporeed byehepowerof
Casar,ind rendred insolent by the great number of warlike Vcssds.which we see in the Port,
will never susser a couragious and resolute spirit. They will beleeve the high vertue of a man
of condition too dangerousfor their rising fortune to endure. They will raake use ot the am¬
bitious Tides, of Sachersof cheir Councry, and Restorers of ehe libercy, which havebeen
%\sento AndreaDoria, for ehe oppression of ehe raoft raagnaniraous, wich the pretext ot
che common good. So ehae a man of your courage, under chis unjust dominion, is mote sure
of ofsences, then of lise: and is unto this day we have not seen such like things, it isbecaule
thepo'wexof AndreaDoria, hath not yet attained to its sopreme greatnels; and that his
moderation hach in some fore recained ehe imperious humor of Jannetin. You know h^w
insolenc he is, how proud, and how insupporeable; chink then, is when he soall see himlcit
in an estate of being able to do whaesoever he will, and sollowed by young people, who re¬
verence him by reason of his Charge, whecher chere be any ching which will noc be permiitea

and tliis man being born for great matters, was extreamly pleased, in that hecould perswade
himsels, by ehe reasons alledged unco him, that he might both together deliver his Country,
revenge his own injuriis, destroy his Enemies, content his ambition, and do nothing contra¬
ry to glory. The joy he had ot it raade him resolve to open his heart to his;Considents;
whereupon he acknowledged unto thera, that srora his tendrest years, hehad selt a dispofiti¬
on in himsels to undertake that which had been now propounded unto hira; thac tie had
ever been an Enemy Co Jannetin, though he appeared to be otherwise; that his insolency was
insupportable to him; that having been his Rival in love, he would be the sarae in ambition:
Then he recounted unto thera, bow Andrea Doria would have broken ofs his raarriage; and

for thac essed crave che protedion of France, as being very much inclined to that

dear Master, rather hm.nt our common misfortunes, then draw any advant.-c blcon^!^^
(hding you: buc is ray good fortune can make y®ur prudence give some ro^mtofeS
thoughts, which ordinarily are che intest, you will in this occasion make tryalofths^H
and sidelity which I carry CO your service, by the liberty ot my discourse, asyoukavtS
tryal ot my diligence, in che encounters where it hath been necessary unto you. Until nZ
yon have lived m so constant a selicity, as it may be said, you have never seen Fortune dispb
sed; and that is the cause why your imagination presents noie buc agreeable objeds tint
you; thac is it which makes you, according to the custom of the hsppy, think of nothiiw
but Vidories, Scepters, and Crowns: But I ara much asraid lels these deceiving hopes be not
one day destroyed by some satal event, wh.ch wil be so much the raore insupportable unto
you, by how much you have less foreseen ic. To go abouc Co alter any thing in the Govern¬
ment of the Republiqae, in a time wherein we are, is an enterprize attended with somany
dssicukics, and expofed to evident a peril, as I cannot forccmy minde to sigure it unto issi
cercain and sacile, as one would perswade you. Yotinsine, you will precend either to make
use of strangers, or to hold intelligence with our Citizens; ofthe forraer I see no likely¬
hood for it: but suppofe it weie pofsible, at least-wise the raatter could not be carryed witt
such speed and so secretly, but the City, Doria, or the Emperor, would have notice of it.
Ital-j, for your ill fortune, is at this present in To great a trouble, as every ones eyes areopeii
upon his neighbors assairs: And Genoua it sels, by reason of its scituation on the brink of the
sea, is guarded as the key of that State, sht Djtchyof Milan, which hath beenalon»
time, both a prey and place ot battel to the fortune of the Imperial and Srench Armies"
makes C&lt;^sAr regard Genoua, as the onely desence, and sole rampart, which covers his powet
in Italy. Doria also serves the Emperor with twenty Gallies, but a great deal more with
the good-will ofthe Citizens, who believe they are obliged unto hira: Besides this.alltheCoJst
of the River of Genoua, especially towards the Levant, is absolutely at his devotion, The
City, that is still much troubled with the Tyranny of the Duke of Milan, and Government
of che Srench, detests the very name of forraign dominion. You may indeed with sraall sot¬
ces discover your inceneion, bue noc arrive ac your end. It is so rauch the raore grievous, that
encerprizes of chis nature are not savorably judged of, but by their happy success, and that is
ic which I do noc see you can obcain. For from what part hope you for great Troops i* The
King of France, on whofe protedion you rely, hath not so little to do, inregardof hispre-
teneions Co che Kingdom of Naples, and Dutchy of y^;/i«», butis he had even a minde to
make some new stir in Italy,th^t he could come and succor you wich all his forces, which are
employed for the saseey of his sroneircs. Buc say chac he, or any other Prince, soould under-
take \s, could you believe that the Emperor, who for his own incerest takes that of Gmu
upon him, would not oppofc them with forces, is not greater, at least-wise equal to thofe
which you should draw to your assistancc? And that being so, you would see your designs
bit ill assured, since chey would still depend on ehe lofs or gain of abaeeel, whofe event is al¬
ways doubcsul: buc on which side soever che vidory doth sall, you are still to sollow the plei-
sure of che conqueror, nothing being lest you that is certain, but the soame of having depri¬
ved your Country of her Libercy, for to submit it Co a stranger. Buc is you turn your eyes to
a neerer succor, by thinking to sinde it in this City; either I know not the humor, and indi-
nations of the Genoueses, or your hopes are but weakly grounded. Tell me, I pray you, trom
which fort of our Citizens do you look for assistancc? Will ic be srora ehe Nobles? into
whofe hands Andrea Doria hath put the power and government, and who being obliged to
him for che auchoricy ehey enjoy, live in an happy and honorable eranquillicy, so that no

ence as cheir common sather ? No, no, disabuse your sels from chis error; and believe ,
that che people will not be raore savorable unto you, since it is true, that the more hate J

all things; and that by the declaration thereof tbe multitude will rise for your advantage:
For ray part, I ara not of a contrary opinion, buc believe, as well as you, that chofe which

somuch che raore ardently, for chat they soall reap all the profic of ic, nothing remaining for

so raany years together have sought one against another, to obtain theprirae rank in the ad-

not be btUeved wichout clasoing with Reason. They will it may be commend your temeriry,
and name it valor; they will sollow your Colours, as thofe of their Deliverer; they will
rejoyce to see the Noble-rain put in chains,by the hand ofa Noble-man; the bowels cs their
Country torn out by you; the comraon rest troubled by your sury; their Tyranny establiso-
ed by y^ur sault: but a tirae will come when wholly dis charging themselves ot thesedition
which you have caused, the people will give them the recorapence of your travels, the glory
of your enterprize, and the triumph of your combats.   In what terms will you sinde your
Iclt then ? Which way will you turn your scls for soirae ? Detested of the Nobles, whom
you soall have betrayed; despised of the people, who will deride the raeans which have
caused their utility and your ruine; abominable to your Country, as having ravisoed her of
her liberty; in Enemy to ^a sar, the Protedor of the Republique; suspeded of the King
of France, who desires to have an absolute power at Genoua ; and hated of all the world,
which nacurally and reasonably abhors Treasons.

(and raay it please God ehae ray sear may be vain) chac ehese thoughts of troubles and dis-
quiets be not foretellers of your bad fortune; which it may be hach already resolved the lofS
of your estate, of your Isse and reputation. You know thac Jannetin Doria regards you
with an eye of envy, and you your sels have ofrenciraes complained to rae of the treacheries
he intended against you; why then will yousiirniso hira with Arras to destroy you? With
what avidity and joy would he embrace the occasion to be revenged of you, and to content
his parcicuhr hacred CO your person, under che pretext of the publique good ? He will rejoyce
in his heart ac chis resolution, and excess of courage, which precipicates you ; and taking up
Arms openly against you wich all che parcakers of his fortune, wich what reasons will not he
justisie his violenc s ? You soall be the Enemy of the peoples tranquillity ; the Tyrant of the

by a man too of whofe assedion he was sowell assured, he seemed very unquiet and unc r-'
tain, which Baptisla Verrin, quickly marking, conceived, that is the Counts reason had time"

<p>He began then wich an incomparable subtlety and address gently at sirst to oppofe Vincen.
tia's discourse, as you stiall hear, and as I understood it even trom Verrin himsds, who alttr"
wards recounted all these chings Co us at tAlbengua .- Behold then in what raanner he spake.
I would to God, saidhe, that the assairs of the Republique were brought to that pass, as all
our Citizens might enjoy their estaces with tranquihty, 1 sliould not then be atthisday'inthe
necelsicy of wisliing you an happier Condition,since as Vmcentio Cakagna bath well observed
there is never a one in Genoua, cither for Riches, greatness of Estatcs, or for illustrious Birth'
can match you: Neither am I ignorant, that a wise raan ought not to tempt Fortune during
an excn am selicity, inregard ic cannoc change buc eo his disadvantage. Howbeit destiny
the enemy ofyour good, hath in such fort perplexed the State of the Republique, i^s you are
enforced to atcempc something chac is great, ortopcriso. Jannetin Doria, who forso long
a time hath regarded the Empire of Genoua, as the term of his desires and ambition, cannot
endure you; and is you do not see on his brow, and in his eyes, che marks of th^ extrtam
hate he bears you J is by his adions you do not discover the excess of his pride, andhiscon-
tempt ofyour vertue; the Gallies, which you have bought against his will, may render you
a sussicient testimony thereof; and perswade you, that arabition hathitsjealousiesaswellas
love, and chac Jannetin regarding you as his R.ival,your ruine isone ofhis raoft ardent desiies.
His insolencv carries him so sar, as he will be absolute Master of the Sea, and he will not have
any man somuch as dare to trouble or divide his power wichhim: How chen wiU yoa have
him endure you for a Compeeicor in che Governraenc of che Coramonwealch, since jealoulie,
or che desire of raigning, spares neicher che blood of brothers, of children, no not of sathers
themselves i?
</p>
<p>A wicked inclination, and an opiniative humor, is Jannetin s is, cannot be changtd but
by violence: you must rhen, as chings stand, cither retire stiamesully srora Gencua, and aban¬
doning /our Gallies to him, declare him vidorious, in leaving him Master of the sield, or
rouze up chat spirit ihd courage in you, which is to surmounc him.   Bue is nevertheless you
be resolved co decline chis peril wieh insamy, and to preserve your lise, as having received it
of grace from the hand ofyour enemy; I am willing, I consent co it, and will no longerop-
pofc it; though it be the moft deplorable esta.e,whereineven tbe hatred of ^'^^ws^'" cm wim

<p>nc. And is that cannot be done wichout some appearance of evil, the sault stiall not be yours,
but'destinies, which leaves you no other nieantopr.serveyour lise but by the death of your
adversary, nor will not let your vertue be able to desend it sels without a crime. But What
s,v I a crime I this word is for you.O too prudent Calcagna; you have learned it no doubt
In the School of the Vulgar, who know not the politick of Conquerors. With such like terms
the adions of private persons are spoken of, but not thofe of the Great: And is your Rule
were true, ic might be said that all Empires were Robberies, because there is none of chem
which was noC establisoed by that natural right, which the strong irapofe on the weak.
</p>
<p>Nature brought raen into the world with an equality of all things, and yet lest unto Vertue
the power of raising chera, which pofsess it, to the glory of raigning over others: From
whence it coraes, that the moft part of thofe, who are Princes or Masters of the Earth, carry
not that title, but because their Predecesfors, by the address and by force of Arms, usurped
the Empire over their equals. I do not deny but ehae ehere are forae persons, who as well as
jrj««»s'o will blarae your resolution, before it be conduded to its end, in regard all hardy
and dangerous adions are never coraraended till chey are executed; but as soon as the happy
success ofehe event soall have justisied and authorized the greatness ofyour enterprize, the
blame will be turned into adrairation; and that which was calsd teraerityand iraprudence,
will be terraed valor and greatness of courage. As long as the sirst of the Casars was in Arms
against Pow/&gt;«7, and that the isow^« Empire was the cause of their conslids, he had not only
T'ow/'s; for an adversary, but even all the Nobihty were his raoft cruel soes. In the mean
time as soon as hc had deseated his Eneraies raighty Array in the plains of Pharsalia, and that
this vidory had put hira in sull pofsession of the Roman Empire, all the hatred which was
born him ceased j and he was so dearly and ardently beloved of the Romans, as this assedion
could not siniso with his lise, but ehey punisoed his deach wich a memorable revenge. Re¬
solve chen Co susser che Genoueses for a eirae Co call you Tyranc, and do nor cake chis narae as
a grievous injury, seeing ie soall be che last insolency of their dying liberty. They will accustom
themselves asterwards to acknowledg you for their lawsul Prince, and as such reverence you.
Behold how rauch I rely on your fortune, in speaking to you cs the selicities of your Empire,
before you have resolved to sight for the acquiring of ir. But things are dispofed in such fort,
as you may sooner be wanting to your selt, then the Erapire to your vertue. For is the dissi¬
culties be greac, according to r»»««rsVs opinion, your courage is yet greater. Letusgranc
him, that the enterprize is dangerous and dissicult; in what History, ancient or modern, hath
it been sound, that the way which condudcth to glory is covered with slowers ? and that an
illustrious adion hath been executed without pain? All great designs have always been sol¬
lowed by great perils; and all high places are ever near to precipices: A generous man will
not for allthat let the sear of an uncertain evil, make him a prey[to an inevicable servitude.
Amongst private persons it is an essed of prudence tobe contained within mediocrity; but in
assairs of ^'/^/^« all resolutions are Co be extream, the rest being dangerous, especially in enter-
prizes, which begin not co break forth but by their execution. For it being then no longer
m our power to retain the thing, wc must of neccsllity arrive at the end we have propofed Co
our selves, or sall in the raidst ot che course, and be utterly lofs. Yec lee us noc make so un¬
happy a presage ofour designs, but let us forecast the misfortunes which may arrive to us, not
to eorraenc our selves in che expedacion of chera, but by prudence Co take from them che
power of hurting us. We are to be guided with precaution, but yec noC so sar, as chat ex¬
tream wisdora may thereby render us raore ciraorous and viresolute. You raust, generous
Count, give foraething to the condud of Fortune, who having chofen you for the Deliverer
ofGenoua, and Restorer of the ancient/r4//^« valor, will know well enough how to sind
out the raeans to plain all dissiculties before you. It is soe that calls you to glory; ic is slie

sery longer, is the cranquilicy of the Republiqiie sliould hst any tirae, he was desirous to Heal

<p>This speech ended, they all resolved with one accord, cbaC sincsi the Governraenc could
noe be changed withouc ehe deach ot Andrea and Jannetin Doria, chey were chiesly co think
of giving soch order eo che raaecer, as ehe end of cheir lives soould be ehe beginning ot the ex¬
ecution thereof. This Consptracy being raade, rhe Count went ouc of his Cabinec, wieh a
marvelous cranquillity of spirit, and wc were all the evening with him, talkingof Musick and
Painting, as is he had had nothing else of iraportance in his thought. As for his Counstllors,
they told her who had eraployed them, chac soe was eo attend greac matcers from her son,
withouc particularizing anything unto her, for sear lest soe soould discover thera. Inthe
mean tirae, the Count, having certain days aster taken great care for the Galliej, which ht
had bought not long before, used to go oftentiraes to the places belonging tohim; where
with an admirable Providence he surnisoed his Subjeds with Arms, and made them to exer¬
cise thera, upon pretext ofbeing in forae sear of che Duke of T/*c«»/»&lt;«, whofe neighbor he
was; but indeed, it was to render thera capable of serving him in his design.
</p>
<p>The end of Autumn being come, he xetuxntd to Genoua, and applyed a'l his Cite to gain
the good-will 'sall the young racn,of thofe samilies newly ennobs d, which are called Popular.
He introduced himsels into their conversadon with a marvelous compliance. He sent presents
to some, he served others according to occasions, and ofsered himselsto all, with an extraor¬
dinary courtesie. And whereas he had a quick and pleasing wit, and a supple and charming
humor, he won their assedion in so high a manner, ashe was their Master, rather then their
sriend. When as he knew that he mighc begin co conside in chem, and chat their wills de¬
pended absolutely on his, he sdl to jeering, as occasion served, at the Government ofGenoua,
which hc termed the Tyranny ofthe Nobles. Sometimes he testisied with interrupted speeches
that he sussered in the miseries of the popular samilies; scmetiraes he secmed to tell them that
the raatter was not past remedy, and that chey might abase the pride of the Nobles, is their
hearts d|,d not sail them; sometimes also with a bitter seofs he exhorted thera to servicude;
yec still leaving chera a sting behind in cheir minds by his doubtsul and uncereain words. And
above all chings, he aggravaced che injustice of the Government, when by chance any acci¬
dent sesl our, that displeased the popular samilies. But is he were agreeable to ehera, lie had
rendred himlels no less pleasing to ehe coramon people, by such raeans as he had caresully
used for ic. He moft readily salutcd some, he siuiled upon ochers as he race chera, he was
magnisicent in his apparel, gencle and courteous co every one; and thac which advanced his
design raore was, as you know as well as I, that he was wondersul handfora, and of an ex¬
ceeding jovial humor; that the air of his sace was sweet and agreeable; and his carriage so
noble, so tree, and so sair, as one was forced eo love him ae che very sirst sight. He exer¬
cised himsels also in sencing, and riding of ehe greac horse, and chac wieh so gallant a grace,
and so great an address, as they that saw him could not chuse but love a man, who gave chem
somuch delight.
</p>
<p>But whereas liberality is the strongest chain, wherewith the people may be captivated, he
met with no occasion of deraonstracing his unco chera, buc he cestisied ic wich a magnisicence
past compare. Yec would noe our prudene Conspiracor cast himsels so absolutely inco che
hands of ehe people, as Co minister any jealousie ehereby eo che Nobles; buc he used so just a
eempermaconiundure,where racdiocricy was so hard Cobe observed. thac the good-will
ot the one did not make him lofe the sriendsoip of the others. And to that essed, choush
Jannetm was become very insolent, since C^ar had admitted hira for Generalistlmoihex the
deathof^«^rr.i; though he would be no longer sollowed by young raen but for interest •
</p>
<p>hough he would be no longer served but for sear; though his arrogance had even carried him
to ofser forae II usage to the Count; yet began he not only to go oftner to ^«^r.. then he
was wont, and to soew a raore particular reverence to him, but sliuttingup also in hs heart

<p>_ In the mean time, he had treated secretly with the Duke of Placentia, who had promised
him two thousand Soot, to joyn with two thousand othcr.^ which he had pick'd forthont
of all his subjeds, for the service of his enterprze when time soould serve. He had also
caused one of his Gallies to corae to Genoua under pretext that be meant to send her forth to
scour the Seas all along the Coast of Barbary. Howbeit during all this we observed as a moft
extraordinary ching in him, chac he was as merry as he used cobe, delighted as much in our
company, and seemed Co have no other greater thought, then of being agreeable to his
sriends.
</p>
<p>Now Baptisla, cunning and undertaking as he was, remained not idle; for in a very sliott
time he had gained a great number of persons, who proraised to sollow and serve him saith.
sully in a secret design which he said he had. With these preparations, they believed that they
had layd soundations solid enough for the execution ot their intentions; and being assembled
together to take their last resolucion, the advice of Baptista Verrin was, that wheieas there
was a ceremony to be celebrated for the perforraance whereof every one would rtfortunto
the Church, he would have them begin the executing o^" the business in that pbce, sstliing to
give Jannetin the sirst stab.   Buc the (sount's piety being unable co consenc eo chis propoiiti-
on, he made a step or cwo back, crying ouc, He would never endure that the beginning of
his enterprize sliould be a profanation and a sacnledg.   Raphaello Sacca added thereunto,
that the matter likewise would even be as uncertain, as icwjs ex crable; hcvakdnirt*
Z)m4 mighe excuse hirasels upon che incomraodity of his age, and sonot come, but send
Thilippo Doria his Kinsman in his stead. To chis Verrin answered again, thac is th:y thought
it sit he would go, whil'st chey were executing the business, to Andrea's Palace, and under
colour of visiting him as he was wont to do, he would strike hira to the heart with his Poig-
nard.   But the Count being very angry with hira for it, he gave this over, and propounded
another expedient worthy of his wit: He told the Count, that Jannetin's sister beinglhort-
ly ascer Co marry wieh/«/&lt;o Cj^o, Leonar a's bxoihex, he would have hira desire chem to sup
ac his house; and Co render the seast ehe raore rasgnisicene, he sliould also invice Auhtt Do¬
ria ind Jannetin, together with a great nuraber ot Ladies, and all such araongst the Nobles,
whom they might judg were moft eo be seared for the execucion oftheir design; That things
being thus, it would be easie for chera whom they had hid for that purpofe to kill them; that
presently thereupon the C^j^wr, sollowed byhistriends, soould go through all the streets o(
Genoua, sounding out the sweet name of Liberty, and acquaineing che people that theit
chains were broken; That in this Tumult the Palace was to be seized upon and lecurtd; that
in the mean tiuae he would pofsess the people with the Count's generous designs, concealing
from them wich address that which he had of absolutely raigning; and letting chem know
the necessity of reforming the Government, or to say better, the cruel Tyranny of theNobks,
for so it was thac he spake; Thatforthis essed he would crown him Duke of the Repub¬
lique, and cause them whom he had gained to take the oath of allegiance unto him; That it
any one, either in woord or deed, should contradid them, he soould be killed upon the
place.
</p>
<p>The Count sound this plot indisserently well contrived, buc yet he selt an extream repug¬
nancy in resolving to vsolate the law of hofpitality, in killing men in h s house, whom he )i
intreated thither; but being pe»rswaded that he sliould not meet with a better nr an to at
to his end, he resolved for it: And to that purpofe, he commanded, t^at the Soldiers, wn
be had choft-n srora amongst his Subjeds, sliould corae one by one into Genoua ^ And on
other side he solhcited the Duke of Placentia to send him the succor which he had pro
him. All these dispatches could not beso secretly made, especially having to do witn    j
of men of war, b\iithn Don Sernando deGanzagua,  who had succccded to tne       -j,^^

b- ause r^e young Count of Lav.nrta WAS conspiring some greac micccr.
</p>
<p>'Andrea received this advice,'wiir-ouc grounding any thing thereupon; for he was so
strongly perswaded of th.^ Count's assedion to him,and so powcrsullv assured, by the tranquil¬
lity which he always saw in his sace, that he had no bad design in hand, as this discourse made
no kind of impression in his uiind ; and to consirm him in his incredulity, the Count entred ac¬
cidently into Andr.ai, chamber, when as the Embassador and he were speakinp ot this assiir;
but he appeared wuh so clear a countenance, and talked to thera with so much judgment, and
hberty of spirit, thit Andrea Doria, charmed with Ws conversacion, and periwaded of
his innocency, approached to the Embassador, and said to him softly in his ear, as we have
Icarn'd since, Judg you your sds, whether this Prncely look^, this both mo'iesi and consident
carriage, this nobU and cjuiet soul and this liberty of Jpirit, can be capable of so horrible
a conRiracj ? The Embalsador not able to gainsay Andrea's Opinion, raadc a sign to him
that he was of his raind'. And albeit that two days aster Doria had a second advertisemenr,
yet the Count's address was so great, as his sight alqne destroyed whatsoever was said against
him. And so wondersul was his condud, rhat Andrea Dsria, above sourscorc years of
age, and held for cne of the greatest politicians of his time, was beguiled byarasnot cwo
and twenty.
</p>
<p>The generous Panja, who had been of none of the Count's counstls, was withouc com¬
parison more advised. For whereas he joyned assedion to prudence, ic was the more easi.."
for him ro susped forajthing of the truth. He had exadly observed all the (sount's adions,
ever since hehad bought the Gallies of the Dxike of Placentia; and caresully exaraining all
that he had seen or heard in divers occasions, he sound that he had cause to sear lest the (sount
had forae dangerousdesign a soot. He saw how he, who was accustoraed to communicate
the raoft important assairs of his house to hira, calked no longer with him but of indisserent
things; that he was often in a retired and private conversation with 5^pn/?.i Verrin, ani
having sollowed hiraforaetiraes whenas be withdrew hirasels into his Cabinet, he had per-
cived hm to be musing and melancholique: For though the Count seeraed to be raerry,
when ashe might be seen of anybody, and by that artisice admirably covered ehe dcsigns
which he had in his hearr, yec was be no sooner retired in privace, bue he becarae quice an¬
ocher chen whac hehad been seen abroad, which S.w/^ alone had marked, for he had con¬
cealed hirasels from Leonora, as wdl as from ochers. Thac which kepc ehe (sount from com¬
municating hs design to Pan sa, was his knowledg of the assedion and exceeding prudence
of the man, so that he was assured hewould have oppofed his design, or at least-wise have
counsclled hini not to have undertaken it so precipitously : and would have had him seek for
more security in an enterprize, where none had ever been.
</p>
<p>At length, one day when as the Count returned to his Palace more raelancholique then hc
used to be, carrying in his sace some raarks ofan extraordinary unquietness, and with such a
paleness, as amazement many tiraes paints on the forehead of thofe, which are upon the point
of executing some great design, whofe event is but ill-assured; the generous T^w//sol¬
lowed him to his Cabinet, and resolved to tell hira his suspcions, for sear lest is he stiould
longer deser to do ir, there would be no cirae lest for the remedying ofthe evil whereof he was

worchy of your considence ? Buc onely cell me, whac objed and whac end can the conversj
tion of chese men have, who always leave yon so sad and unquiee, as I never saw you so be¬
fore.   Alass 1 how do I sear, lest ehese secrec counsels, which yeu hold so ofcen wich thde
violenc persons, and whofe inclinaeions are not very sincere, soould by their address and
cunning draw you out ot the way of vertue! Susser me, ray dear Master, to discover the
diseaso that I may cure it. They, from whora ray suspicions arise, are not of soch commend-
able manners, or of so exemplary a piety, as I may beleeve thev give you counsels, which
do noc clasli either with Vertue, or wich Religion.   Ic may be ehey abuse your little'expert-
ence,and knowing you generous, they propound unto you adions,which in appearance are great
and glorious, but which in essed are rasli and vain.   Open your eyes then, O noble Comt,
and think that an inconsiderate man may make you sall into a precipice, out of which the
prudence of all the wisest in che world cannot draw you.   It is easie enoughto set a Palace on
sire.but it is noc so easie Co quench ie: Take heed lest they that counsel you do not make use of
you, to arrive at the end which they propofe unro themselves; and that your undoing do not
serve for the benesit of chem which deceive you.   Ie is rare eo raeec wich raen, who counltl
chac which is good, because ic is good, wichouc regard Co cheir incerest; and yec icisby this
experience, chac we are to be secured of chem.   Examine chen seriously, whecher they,wliicli
counsel you, cannoc become greaccr or richer by that they would have you undertake. And
to cell you all chac I chink in chis occasion, I cannot be perswaded, thae chey, whichspend
their lives amongst crimes, are capable of perswading vercue unco ochers.   For chough theic
be greac disserence beeween deeds and words, ehe moft iraporcane parr of perswalion consists
in example rather chen in discourse; and commonly the raouch and the hand ad alike. What
would these men have of you ? To what innovation would they carry you ? The estate ut
your assairs are at such a point, as they have no need of change; there can no mutation arrive
unto you, but will be to your disadvantage.   Envy hath a long tirae sought to sasten on you,
and will you let hcrtakeholdonyouby thediforder whereunto they are carrying you? St
you are noc ignorant, how there is a great number of persons, who are interior ro you, boih
in Nobility, Estate, and Vertue, which endevor to traduce you.   I know that hope is sweet
unto young people, espccially to chera which can sustain ic wieh ehe greaeness of their cou¬
rage, bue I know wiehall chac nothing is more slippery then profperity: Beware then 1^
the hope ofan incertain thing do noc make you lofe an aslbred good. They which counsel you
have noching co lofe, nor noching co hazird, whether cheir means or cheir repucacionbecunlj-
dered; and eherefore ie is, that these kinde of men wiso for revolts, seditions, tumults, and dis¬
orders, because it is ehe custora of such like persons to enrich therasclvcs with other mensl' li s.
and to sind cheir parcicular rest in a general consusion.   In sine, chey which are not very hiA

</p>
<p>In the mean time the second of January being arrived, which preceded that dreadsul nighr,
the Countcaused certain Soldiers of the Gari'on to come tohisPa'ace, whereof some were
hisSubjeds, and the rest soch as had b.en placed there by him, and having Idt them under
the Command ot one of the Conspirators, he went and past awiy ihe restot the day till even¬
ing with/^«^r^^ Z)m4, where he had never been seen more merry, or more pleasanr.   He
intreated ^B«^sj« again, who was there present, to give order at the Port, that his Gaily,
which was chac nighc CO see sail cowards che Archipelague, ra-ghc not be stayed.   He adver¬
tised him also, chac he would noc be croubled, ishe heard any noise, or any Ordnance dis¬
charged; for, as you know better then I, said he unto hira, they always sooot ofs some for
the Ceremony of parting, and these things never pass without forae stir.   At his coraing
from thence the Srench Marquess and I met him; but it had been hard for us to foresee whac
the Count had in his thought, for he talked to us of nothing but of matches ot sport and de¬
light for the ensuing days; Howbeit he gave us dextrously to understand, chac he sliould be
busie this evening in seceing forch his Gaily, for sear lest we soould go home wieh bim, seem-
ing nevertheless very forry ac it, and celling us chac Leonora ind Sophronia would noC be
sriends wich him tor ic.  Ascer we were parted srora him, he wene to his Palace, which, as
you know, wasin thatpartofC7s«o«4, ctWed Carignan, and which seeras tobe severed from
all the rest of the City, and to command it, as well for its advantageous scituation, as for its
magnisiccBce.   You know also, that th s Palace, being built upon a lictle hill, couched che
walls ofthe City alraoft on every side ; The Sea was inthe sace of che building, and back¬
wards It had for profped the pleasant Valley of Btsagno.   I put you in raind of these things,
chat you may comprehend, how this Palace, being as it were an Island, was very coramodi¬
ously sciruared for the Counts enterprize; having no nearer a neighbor then Baptista, who
being ofthe Conspiracy was not to be seared.   In sine, being recurned home, he drew chither
about the beginning ofthe night, a great raany of arraed raen, of thofe which he had caused
to enter secretly into the City, and of thofe which he had suborned even in Genoua it selt.
He placed them for the Guard of the Gates of his Palace, whom he held to be the moft cou¬
rageous and saithsul; with order to leave the entrance cbercinto sree to every one, but colec
no body pass out of them.
</p>
<p>In the raean time one ofthe Captains ofthe Garison, going to see Sentinels, perceived thac
some ofthe Soldiers were missing, and enquired of his Lievtenant whicher chey were gone;
whereupon some oftheir sellows answering that they were gone to Carignan wich che Coune
of Lavagna, it made hira susped something; so that he went instantly and gave notice
thereof to the Senators that were at the Palace, and to Andrea Doria; and then it was chac
the Counts dislimulaeion wroughe ehe greacest essed, and began Co produce chac which he had
expeded from it. Jannetin hearing chis advertisemcnt, told him, that his sidelity was to be
commended, although this advice had no ground for them to sear any ching. For whereas hc
was prepofsest by the Counts address, who had demanded permislion of him for the parting
away of a Gaily this night to scour the Seas towards the Levanc, he assured chem ehae all these
Soldiers, which were gone to him, being ot his own or the Duke of Placentia s Subjeds,

they already bore unto him.    But at last he went to the house of one, named Asjereto where
he sound three and twenty young Gentleman of the- Popular order, whom the coiiningof
Baptista Verrin had drawn thither.   The Count caressed them exceedingly, and talkinc with
them of divers things, and supper time being near, he desired them to go home and eat with
him.   He told them, chat it was too sair an evening co pare so soon; ehae che night was too
lighc, and che Moon eoo clear, for chem co cxcuse chemselves upon ehe season; and briesly
he increaeed them wich so good a grace, as they went along with him,   The Countled them
to a back room,willing the ditcreec Pansa eo go and encercain his wise, unco whom he would

<p>Things being in chese cerms, che Count entred into another charaber, aster he had told

turned. Buc chey were mighcily surprized, when as they saw him encer compleatly armed,
and sollowed by cwo hundred Soldiers, with Partisans or Musquets, which ranged themselves
round abouc him; He had his Viser up, and his Sword in his hand; and beginning then to
lee che hacred and choller break forch, which be had for so long a cirae kept concealed in his
heart, his sace was all on sire, and sierceness and sury appeared in his eyes. He approached
to a Table, and leaning on it with his Icsc hand, bc continued a while without saying any
thing ; chen suddenly giving a great bounce on ic, he said with an iraperious tone, and a pre-
cipicace voyce, Ic is done, I am resolved, O couragious and illustrious sriends! a spirit touch¬
ed wich any generoficy can no longer susser ic, ehe insolency of chem ebac would oppress us
hach incensed my courage, and wearied my pacience. My imaginacion presents unto roe a
spedacle, Coo horrible and coo deadly, in making me see our Cicizens tyrannized, and the
subversion of our Country indubitable, for me not to oppofe ray sels Co a mischies, which
sear, or co say beceer, Reason, makes me see so nigh ac hand. Is the evils, wherewith the
Republique is mortally caineed, could hope for remedies srora eirae, I would endure, as others
do, a retardment, which migtit be proficable Co che publique good ; bue since we are arrived
at the last period of our misery, and thac we see our selves quite ready to be ruined, we xm
of necesllity go and encounter chac which is to overwhelm us: and is it be pofl'ible, not only
sustain, but overthrow ie. How greac soever ehe peril is, ic lofes much ot its force,, whtn it

<p>What do we mean then, O my companions, by cur sloth and our cowardise ? Will we be
always the Spedators ofour own misery ? For wliat enterprize soall we reserve our courage,
is in the general desolation of our Country wc abandon our selves ? It is no time for us linger
to complain ofour Enemies, but to revenge our selves of them. Let us leave the use of tears
to our wives, and is we be worthy the name of raen, which we bear, let us eraploy our cou¬
rage, our force, and our address, in dcstroying ©ur Tyrants. We have too much already en¬
dured their insolency, which doubdess carries them to bs lieve, thac our patience is an essed
ofour sainc-heareedness. They who leave crimes unpunisoed, are guilty of chofe, ws ich ehe

which raay justly be attended srora a Tyranny, that is born for the ruine ofthe Country, nou-

our swords solitdiedg, as we cannoc cue ofs che insaraous lise of him, who makes a glory
of our soame, who criumphs over our misfortunes, and seeds on our miseries ? Shall we not

</p>
<p>me, the Gallies upon a Signal given will sall into the hands of a Troop of men, as hX to ren

hundred inhabicants, which are arraed for us; and even now that I am speaking to you there
are m che Suburbs cwo ehousand of my Subjeds, and as many of the Duke of pLemi.'s
whxh arc come to succor us.
</p>
<p>Lee us go chen, my companions, and caliche people again co liberty; let us return to the
dweetness ofour anccnt Government; let us exterminate the Nobles and /rs^wrt/VsTyrannv
and in one only night, more sliining then the sairest days of our lives have been, let us re-
eltabhsli the glory of the popular samilies in their sirst splendor j let us for ever desace out of
th J memories of men our past siinc-hearredness.But is any ofyou as I cannot believejbe soau-
dacious &amp; so cowardly borh together, as to oppofe a design so glorious for us,and advantageous
for our Cou itry, let him behold round about him chis dreadsul company of Arms and SolJi-
ci s, and let him imagine that he sees at the very same instant the points of all our'swords level-
ed ac his heare. Yea, my Companions, I do protest it openly, we raust of nectssity either
sighc or dye. And thit blood which sliall be ingratttully denyed to ihe succor ofour Lcuntry,
so neer to ruine, (hallb | bed, in ehis very place, eo wjso away che stain of such persidious¬
ness. Yea, I say ic once again, ehe sirst sacrisice, which soall be consecrated for che publique
saseey, shall even here have his chroac cue wich my hand, it any one undercaktj to tppofe
my will.
</p>
<p>These dreadsul menaces amazed chofe Co whom they were addrtst; they beheld cne ano¬
ther, and chen that great nuraber of Soldier| which environed them; and aster they had been
a while without speaking, they cryed all with one voyce, cwo excepted, that they would
sollow che Coune even co ehe death; that they would be the companions of his triumph, or
of his sall; and in conclusion, thac they would never abandon him, but would obey him in
all things. The Count embraced chem chen with a great deal of joy, and testimony ot satis-
sadion; and being turned towards chofe two, which as yet had said nothing, they besought
him to have pity of cheir weakness, wich words wherein tear appeared so vilible.as the Count
could noc forbear smiling. They represenred unto him, rhat the request which thty made
him, was advantageous tohim, as well as to thtm; bt cause being so uncapable ot sighting,
they sliould hurt him more then they could help him; that their sear might beget the same in
others,and their slight give an ill example to his Soldiers: Britsly,chey gave hira (o many marks
of their assright and terror, as changing his determination, hc only contented himsels with re¬
proaching them for their cowardise in a bitter jear, and for the security ot his enterprize he
caused them to be sliut up in a chamber, where he lest thtm under a Guard, which should
keep them from coming forth. Aster this he comraanded raeat to be brought in, but in such
a sastiion, as this meal might be rather named a collation, then a supper; tearing lest they
sliould be too much taken up wich good cheat. Whil'st chen thae forae did eae standing, jnd
others were arming themselves with the Arms which ehe Coune had caused eo be presented
unco chem, hc wene co Leonora's chamber, who was talking with Sophronia hex siiser about
the unquiecness slie was in co see so many Soldiers in her Palace. As soon as he was entred,
he approached co her, and taking her by che hand, he cold her in sew words the design he had;
desiring her Co pardon him for noc having spoken to her of it till then.
</p>
<p>The great heart of i^soword sound not it sels sirm enough to remain constant in this occa¬
sion ; and considering the extream peril whereinto che Count was going to expofe hiinsdt,
assedion and sear troubled her iss such fort, as salling at the Counts teet, and her sace all be¬
dewed wich cears. My Lord, said slie unto him, imbracing his knees, to what danger arc
you going co expofe your selt ? I conjure you by che thing that is dearest to you m the world,
by che love which I bear co you, by chac which you b arcome, by che cears which im a,
and by your own glory, Co preserve ray lise in preserving ye.urs. The incerest of our Coon y

rather then to see my sels expofed to the hazard of wearing raouming for your deacn.

atrerwards through S. Andrews street to S. Donat, and passing by rhe place of the SMv^-^c,
writh his cnmpan:ons he arrived at the pofnt of Catana.   Baptisla Verrn went aboard'the
pally, and Thomxso Aster eta did what he could Co srize upon the gate of DarsoH; at siill
inregard hewasoneo /^w^nVs Ofsicers, and had the word, the Guards sust:red him to
enter; but perceiving so great a number of armed m;n, wherewith hc was lollowed, they
rudely r. pulstd him: Neverth- less st:e;ng ic was necessary, tha? some one so uld enter to open
the gate unro the Count, it was resolved that Scipio, oneof his subjeds, and a Cap ain of
greac courage, sliould cast himstls with forne Soldiers into hede Boats, kepc thereof pur¬
pofe, in ca eof neccsllity, and by thac means encer by che S;a into che Pore, where the Gal¬
lies hy, and so sacilitate che entrance of the rest of the Conspirators thereinto.   Thisdtlign
was as happily executed, as itwas well thought of; for albeit they sound some rtlistance
there, yet in regard the Conrpiiators were more in number,and incomparably more valorous,it
was ealie for them to prevail.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the Count was come by Land to that Gate, where with much impatience
he attended the signal that was Co be given him, which stayd longer then it ought, hy reason
the Gaily with her motion and agitarion had struck her sds a ground, and it was above hals
an hour before they could see her asloat again. All these things, which could not be due
without noise, began to raise a great deal; but at length the lignal having been given, the
Count, devarcingall his companions, leapt with txcccdirg courage intoT^n./s Gillies.
This unexp ded violence, and the noise o''Arms and Soldiers, having awaked all the Miri-
nersanj Slaves, a drtadsol and consused din of chains and vojccs was suddenly heard. All
the Sailors cryed to Arms, ail theG^lly-Shvts resoundcd rhenameof Liberty, and labored
as much as they could to break ofs cheir Lons: But che Count, who knew not what to do
with the Gallies is he hsd not m n, considering what a prejudice the slight of the Slaves
would bring unto him, he cast himsels asoore again, and wenc with all speed to the Admiral,
which with the sudden and un: uly motion of them wherewith soe was silled, sloated leasure-
ly, and seemed as though she would eb''gn her selt from the Land.
</p>
<p>Whil'st rhings past thus in the Port, Girahmo and Ottobuono sailed not in that which haJ
been coramanded them; for as soon as rh^y heard the Cannon discharged, which was the
signal that was given tt chem, they went couragiously with threescore Soldiers to sezion
S. Thomas gate, not on; ly to render themselves Mistcis of it, buc co pass along unro Dirn^'i
Palace, which was hard by, for tokW Andrea ind jannetin. This enterprze was not so
sacile unto the Conspirators, as the former; the Soldiers that guarded chis gate desended them¬
selves wel enough; and SebasiianoLtrcata with his Biother,whereof theone was the Captain,
and the other the Ensign, coming in, made all the resistance that valiant men could A^y- ||^i'

<p>Gallies. Andrea, more foreseeing then he, and searing forae unlooked for accident, would
not have had hira gone forth, but well accompanyed; H.s Wise cast hersels at his seet Co
keep hira from ic: hue he, carryed on by his dcsony, contemned ehe counsel of ehe one, and
the prayers of che ocher, and wene oue alone wieh one Groom ot his Chamber, and a Page,
thae carryed a Torch before hira, wichouc any ocher Arras, chen his single sword. When hc
arrived ae Saine Thoma4 gace, which he choughc was guarded still by his own sollowers, ac¬
cording CO his insolenc humor, whereuneo che choller he was in chac Cirae being joyned, he
siercely coraraanded chem eo open unCo hira. Jannetin's voyce being straigheway known of
the Conspiraeors, ehey opened ehe gacc, and sussered hiraeo encer wichouc resistance; buc
scarcely was he enered, when as a soowre of Muskee sooc sell on him, and layd hra instanely
dead on ehe ground. This adventure raade Giralomo and Ottobuono change che order which
the Count had given ehera, for going diredly Co Doria's Palace. For seeing Jannetm dead,
who was ehe onely raan of ehe Co«»sV Eneraies, ehae could sacissie wich his person; and be¬
leeving ehae ehe Count had rendred hirasels Master of ehe Gallies, ehey did noe think that
Andrea, sourscorc years of age, and sick ot the gout, could bring any great obstacle to their
design. Moreover they seared, that is they soould go to Dorius Palace, the riches of the
booty would withdraw the raoft part of the Soldiers from the adion, and make them quit
their Arms, to lade theraselves with che plunder of such rich raovables, as it was sull of.
</p>
<p>In the raean time, the noisc and diforder stili increasing, Andrea was much troubled for
Jannetin, not being able Co imagine whac soould be che cause of so rauch stir. Buc ac lengch
having sene one of his servancs, cercainly Co know che occasion of chis Tumulr, he broughc
him word, chac ehe Count of Lavagna had raade hirasels Master of Genoua; ehae the Re¬
publique was in extreara peril; that his Gallies were sull of his Eneraies; thae che people re-
sounded all about the word of ia^ursj, and the narae of Giovanni Lodovico; chac surious
men ran up and down with Arras in their hands; thac there was nothing seen but blood and
slaughter; and that every where was talkingof outrages against rhe Nobles, and menaces a-
gainst his lise. So dreadsul a relation perswading Andrea that the matter was past remedy,
he resolved to accend ehe violence of his Enemies in his Palace, and eo yield Co chem whom he
could not resist. But his wise, and his servants, with their tears, intreatics and reasons, raade
bim at last resolve to let himsels be carryed down into his Palace-yard, where chey see him
on an horse wich much ado; in ehis estace ehey conduded him eo Mazona, which is a Castle
belonging to a Kinsman of mine, and from thence to another place, where they understood
the death of Jannetin, with which he was sensibly touched.
</p>
<p>In the raean time the Conspirators still advanced their design; and whereas this noise and
Tumult had awaked every one, all the Count's particuUr sriends having heard the people cry,
Long live the Count of Lavagna, went forth with Arms in their hands to see what the mat¬
ter was, and co joyn chemselves wieh him j and araongst the ress Doria, the Srench Marquis,
and I, who by chance lay together that night, going also forth to seek the Co««s, met some
thirty paces from my lodging, Giralomo with all his Troop, who sought for hira as well as
we. All the people, that took his pare, required to see cheir Dehverer; but though chere
was crying every where, Long live the Count of Lavagna, and that every one enquired as¬
ter him, yet no body answered thereunto. This silence raade us sear forae disaslrous success,
yet did It not raake thera give over the design of pursuing a vidory, which seemed so cer¬
tain. Giralomo lest a sussicient Guard at the gates, and senc Ottobuono to cake a care of che
Gallies, in case bis Broeher was noc ehere. The i^r*«c)b Marquis sollowed him, and I stay'd
with Giralomo, who being accompanyed onely with two hundred Soldiers, went, as he
had resolved, through all the sixeetsoi Genoua, to cause tbe people, both wich his speeches,
and che hcjpe of Libercy, eo rise. And though the Count appeared not, yec each one decla¬
red himsels for him with earnestly demanding where he was. The City in che mean space
was in a general cons usion and consternation; every one ran up and down in the streees,wich¬
out knowing whither they went; every one asked ot one another what was ehe cause of chis
dreadsul diforder, wichouc knowing whae Co answer; ehe woraen ouc of cheir windows,

cucraged in his; buc ae length aster hc had gotten company about bim, he resolded to ice the

gcous for his Master. To that essed he went to the P.ilace, where h= sound Cardinal bma a, d

being no Duke at that time.   They resolved thac Bonisacio LomelUn, one of the TAUxn
cins, and Antonio Calvo, with che Ensign ot the Guard and sisty Soldiers, soould go and
desend S. Thoma4 Gate; but having on the way encuuntred with che Troop where we were
they were constrained to retire into one of their sriends houses, but not without leivingiome
oftheir men prisoners.   Part of them went in great haste by another street to the same gate to
learn some n:ws of Andrea ; but sinding it wdl guarded, and LomelUn having at the very
sirst been made a prisoier, thvysltd away with great precipitation, whereat ours were io
joysul, as this prisoner escaped from chem.
</p>
<p>In the mean cime ic was noc known where the Count vvas; they that were withG/^/^wo
thought he was at che Pore; ehey of the Port on the other side believed that he had Ics thtm
to repair unto his brothers; Ottobuono not sinding him there, thought that he was gone to
visit the Gates, or it miy be to Dona iViUce; they of the Gates were perswaded thathe
was in the City; in sine, everyone thought anything save the truth. But amongst all the
rest, BaptiHa Verrin, as having the greatest ssiare in the enterprize, was raoft earnest in ask.
ing aster him. He saw the business so well carried, and the Vidory so certain, as he was mad
for that he could not see che Coune; the Gates of che Gey were cheirs; ehey were Masters
ofehe Pore; the people savored thera ; the Nobles seemed to.make no oppofition; the Senate
had no Duke; ^Andrea was sled, and had lest the sield to his Eneraies; and Jannetin was
dead ; in sine, there wanted nothing but thae ehe Coune soould soewhimidt tothepeople
for receiving the Oath of Allegeance srora them. ButsllTsmw's care was invain, sothat
hearing no news of him, and seeing the enterprize ruined is he did not appear, he retired in
despair unto the Gaily, to the end thac is ehe Count came, hemight secure him the Port still,
which was a matter ot extream imponance; and is the enterprize were ruined by his si'stncc,
that he might have the means to sly to Marse ill es.- This resolution was the cause of very
much mischks to (siralomo; because the Conspirators, neither seeing the Count, w'^o \v«
their Head, nor "Baptisla Verrin, who had been always the principal Agent in the Conspi¬
racy, did not so much rely on the cond\idi of Girahmo, who being very young, and of an
haughty humor, carried things wich more irapetuolity then discretion: They sollowed him
for all chat out ofthe hope that the Count would appear ere it were long; but ic was not with
that considence, which makes one abandon his lite without unquietness, and obey without
repugnancy an Head whom one estecms, and of whofe prudence and valor one is allured, so
that onereserves no more care then to sight and obey : but contrarily the moft part began to
murmur, yea and some thought already ot seeking some occasion to withdraw, or atleastwne
to go and enquire oue the Count. On che ocherTide, che Stnace, noe knowing what resolu¬

for Ottobuonohe had loft him in the press. He came presently away then, to acquaint us with
this dolesul news, but having encountred, as he told us, with a great number of armed men
which issued out ofyour Palace, whereof the Gate was broken up, he stayed to learn what
che macter raight be; and thinking that he knew the voyce of EmiUa, whora they were

quess tor the luccor hc would have given her, and craved pardon of the company for her inter¬
rupting Alphonso's relation, he continued his discourse in chis fort.
</p>
<p>The srsMciE; Marquess having been a good while pursuing thofe which cmied you away,
it was the cause that we knew not the deplorable death of the Count.till there wanted noching
but his presence, to make an end of obtaining the Vidory : And judg,Madam, whecher there
can beany doubt ofthis verity, since the Count being dead alraoft at the beginning of the exe¬
cution, it raay be said that his narae alone vanquisoed all his Enemies: And certainly is be had
lived, the business had had a quite contrary event. For my part I profess unto you, that I stiall
never bc comforted for chis deach. Had the enterprize succeeded ill; had any ofehe Con¬
spiraeors becrayed him; had ehe people abandoned hira; bad the Nobles resisted him; had
Jannetin vanquisoed him; I soould say ehae ehese are ordinary chings, ehae ehese are acci¬
dents, whereof there are are examples sound: But Co see a mmof twoandcwcncyyearsof
age, che goodliest, the handsomest, the moft courageous, the moft dextrous, the sullestof
spirit, and the moft generous that ever was seen, to see hira, I say, ascer he had contrived a
great design; aster he hadso admirably conduded it; asterhehad deceived Andrea Doria;
abused the whole Republique; vvas come not only to the execution, but also had executed
the business; Jannetm being dead,and Andrea himselt sled away; aster all these things. I say,
to imagine, that this excellenc man soould tall from ofs a plank, and be drowned not above
three or sour steps from the Land in sive sood of mud, is so un upporable to rae, Madara, as I
cannot endure the thought of is.
</p>
<p>But to testisie unto you, that the Count alone held the Vidory in his hands, I ara but Co
to tell you the end of this enterprize. The Srench Marquess had no sooner acquainted Gira-
lomo with the death of his brother, but the Deputies srora the Senate appeared. At sirst,some
would have set upon thera, nevertheless this tumult being appeased, one of the Deputies ad¬
vanced, and demanded of Giralomo where the Count was, to acquainc hira wich whac he
had in charge srora che Senace; Giralomo surprized wich ehisderaand, answered rudely and
inconsideracely, chat he soould seek for no ocher Coune of Zrsz/&lt;i^»^ buc hirasels, for he was
now che Coune, and ehae Co him only ehey were Co render up ehe Palace, which he ordained
ehera to do, and ehae wich speed. The Deputies understanding &gt;y this iraprudent answer
that the Count was dead, returned back to advereise the Senate ofthe change of things by the
death of the Count. This news put thera in heart again, so thac chey instantly commanded
twelve otthe chiesest of them, chac were come to the Palace, to go and arm as many of rhe
people as they could, and joyning them with the ordinary guard,to use cheir uttermoft endea¬
vor to chase the Conspirators out of the City, or utterly to deseat them: But chere was no
need of sighting to put them to slight, for they were vanquislied inthedeachot ehe Coune-
which being publisoedover all, puc one and che sarae resolucion inco ehe rainds of all thofa
who had taken up arms for him. And whereas the day began to break, chey desired it slnuld

so many ocher diforders, whereof che marks were evidcnc; had been the work ot an mvisible
hand. No Enemy appeared, all che Tradcsmtn were in their sliops, every man was in hij
house, and Genoua was never in a greater tranquillity,at leastwise as we were told asterwards:
For as for us, as soon as we understood of the Counts death, we went diredly to his Palace
to save his dear Zso»(?r&lt;!»; Doria's in:exe^ in Soprromamide hira go thither with incredible
speed ; and though he was Jannetin's kinsraan, yet having never asseded him, and been hard¬
ly used by Andrea, his love met with no very mighty obstacle to overcorae. shesrench

about him, so chac beleeving him Co bt in sasety enough we went eo ehe Counts Palace, sear¬

claring unco her the estate of chings, we repre;enced unco her, thac we were not to susser the

grieved co abandon Hipolita.- Buc Fortune, who was willing co savor him, so ordered it, that
being arrived just before Doria's house, we heard people ^coming in wondersul haste, which
without doubt were forae of chera chac sled ; sinding our selves chen in so coraraodious a place
for CO let thera pass by, we entred into DsnVs house; and whereas H»/&gt;o/t.'&lt;i was exceeding¬

gled with some womens, but slie carae down Co us, and understanding our design, What,
said soe eo her broeher, will you abandon me ? I do noc abandon you, sister, answered he,
bnc Love and Forcune do snacch me srora you. HipoUta's mocher was dead noc long before,
so chac having noching Co reeain her ac Genoua, and noC knowing wiehall whac should becorae
of her, she made use ot all ehese reasons Co perswade her brother hc would permit her not to

you have me stay here, that Andrea may revenge himsels on mc, for the injury which hc be-
Ueves he hath received from you ? And having loft ray mother, and seeing my sels forsaken of
my brother, soall I abide here without supporc and coraforc ? I do not desire you co leave So'
phronia, buc chat you will permie rae Co sollow her. Hipolita spake ehis wich so much gries,
chac every one was couched wich it. And when as Horatio prayed Sophronia, that she would
oblige Doria to consent thereunto, Doria imbraced his sister with a great deal of assedion, and
told her, that he was ravisoed wieh her generoficy.

<p>Hipolita having obcained her desire, and we no longer hearing any passing by, we pro¬
ceeded on in our way Cowards che Pore, where we arrived withouc any obstacle. Ottobuo-

her, and told her thac slic soould know ere iewere long. .In the mean time wc were no

<p>Behold, Madam, what the deplorable fortune of the Co«»^ hath been; as forthe rest of
us, aster wc had taken another Vessel ac y^/^s«^«4, and being puc again to Sea would sive
direded our course for Marseilles, our nivigstion was not nore prolpious this second time
then formerly it had been; for we were not tar from the Port, when as the tempest began
again with such sury, as during six days and six nighrs vj^ were continually in expedacion ot
being cast away. Ac length a calm having succeeded the storm, we came to discover Land ;
but we were mightily surprized, when as our Pilot assured us, thac that which we saw was
the City of Marocco. Our Vessel was so bruised, as we resolved to land there ; and this de¬
sign being executed, the King of Marocco received of with a great deal of courtesie. Now
for that which arrived unto us there, and for that which brought us to (son stantinople, I
think it will be requisite to reser the relation thereof to another time: And whereas the beau¬
tisul Hipolita and Sophronia have a greater soare in it then I, you soall, is you please^ learn the
sequclof our fortune from their raouths.
</p>
<p>It is without doubt very deplorable, said Isabella, and I can assure you, thac I have not
selt chac raotion in ray hearr, whichtheysay isso ordinary with every one, and causes us in
some fort to be comforted for our miseries, when we see others infortunate as well as our
selves; but contrarily 1 sinde ray forrow augraented thereby. That proceeds from your ge¬
nerofity, said Sophronia unto her, but do not lament the Count so much, as not Co reserve
some sighs for my sister, whom we have loft as well as he, wich ehe gries soe cook for his

did her Coo much honor, and how soe was very glad ehae incoming Co visie her he gave her

use some artisice to keep her from going so often to visit her sriends. In che mean cirae Isa-

also, he wenc away from her sooner chen he had decermined, to give her the longer time lor the

then chac slic was arrived, but he descended in all haste to go and receive her: And whereas
the change of places, misfortune, and slavery, had broughc none Co his humor, he scarcely
saw her appear before he advanced co kiss her robe; I do noc know, Madam, said he unto her,

</p>
<p>T Will not renew Sophronia's forrow in particularizing unto you the lofs of Leonora since it
1 will sofsice rae eo cell you, chac her end had no other cause but her assl.dion; and ehae heC
destiny was such, as dying on che raain Sea, we were constrained to give her the same Tomb,
Which the injustice of Forcune had given her illustrious husband: Buc cogee away speedily
srora so laraentable an advencure, you soall undeistand, ehae we were no sooner arrived at
Marocco, buc we loft all chac che Terapest had lesc us, ehae is to say, che wrack ofehe Vessel
and our libercy. For whereas ehey knew us ae che sirst sighc co be Christians, hardly had we
cast anchor when as chey raade us Slaves. Indeed ic is true, thae in the beginning our servitude
waseasie enough; for as our good Fortune would have ic, theVthceis Manama, met to
King Abdalla, who raigns ac Marocco, passed accidencally along by che Pore when as we
were raaking into it; and chis Princess seeing our soip without sails, without rudder, the
tackle torn, the sail-yards broken, and every part of it almoft battered in pieces, slie caused
the Charet, wherein soe was, to stay, that soe might see us land, and know of what Nation
we were: for the Tempest had lesc our Vessel no raarks, whereby ie raighc be known. When
as we carae near ehe Porr, whicher ehe wind, racher chen ehe skill of ehe Piloe, conduded us,
there was noe one in the Ship which goe noC up on che deck Co behold ehis Land, where we
hoped, is we did noe sind a resuge, ae least wise we sliould escape casting away: So ehae the
Prmcess Mariama, having observed women amongst us, redoubled her curiofity and compas¬
sion rauch the raore. As soon as ever we touched Land,then soe coramanded us to be broughc
unco her, that soe her sels raight know who we were, and what our fortune had been. This
order having been observed, chey led us before ehis Princess; and verily chis sirst encounter
was an happy presage for us, and an extreara consolation for the beaueisul Sophronia,Leonida,
and Hipolita', for ehis Princess hach so rauch raajesty and sweecness, as she caused in us boch
a greac deal of resped, and a greac deal of hope. And whereas soe had noced by our apparel
thae we were of i^/;, and noe understanding chac Tongue, soe would not stand Co send for
an Incerpreeer, buc choughc that forae ofus peradvencurc could speak i'j?^»iy^, which slie un¬
derstood persedly, and is comraon enough chroughouc all ehe Kingdoms of Sez., Tunis, and
Marocco, by reason ot ehe neighborhood of Spain wich ehis pare ot Asrica, and of che Wars
and Commerce, which in forraer eimes they have had one with anocher, especially before
the Kings ot Granado, who were originally Moots, were subdued by Serdinando and Isabella,
And cruly soe was noc deceived in her conjedure, ibr chere was noc any of us hue spake ie well,
or ae leastwise could make our selves be understood in ic.
</p>
<p>When as rhis Princess saw ehae her design had succeeded, soe cestisied as much joy for ie as
we did ; and having demanded of us whicher we were going, of whence we were, and in
whae place we had been caken with ehe Tempest ? we colsl her all chings as ehey had past,
wichouc acquaineing her nevercheless wich ehe occasion chac had caused us Co pare from Ge^
noua, and wichout celling her our names, and salling ae her seec we besoughc her Co proced
us; sot by ehe resped which was rendred Co her,and by her crain, we believed soe was Queen
of Marocco. This excellent Princess raade us rise up wieh a greac deal of courcesie; and be¬
ing couched wich che charms of chofe whom we conduded, slie cook an assedion Co us, and
resolved eo serve us as ranch as soe could. Bue whereas slie was willing to observe in all
things the resped which soe owed to the King her brother, soe took up Sophronia, Leonida,
and my sister, into the Charet to her, and comraanding us to sollow her, slie willed some of
che Guard that attended upon her, to lend us their horses. We went in this manner to Ab-
dalla's Pihce, whom we sound alone with his Savorite, aWed AU-Ben Ducar, a man ofa
great spirit, but cruel and ambicious. As soon as Mariama appeared, and that the King
saw her sollowed by so many unknown persons, and chiesly of three sair women (is my sister
can susser me to put her in that number) he was so surprized therewith, thac advancing pre¬
sendy towards her, he said to her in her language, (as Mariama recounted unto us aster¬

her natural Tongue, you may not. Madam, deprhrethesethreesaircreaiures, of thehonorns
being your Slaves; Liberty cannot be so happy to them as this servitude, and youwill^
cruel to them in using them ocherwise. Alj hach reason, replyed che King in his hnguaee and
to concenc you and chem co, I permit you eo cake care of chem, and to proted them • and I do
withall conjure you to retain them in your service. You know thac all eheChristiiisareour
Enemies, so chac to set them ac libercy, when we have them in our hands, were to violate
our Religion, and Co insringe our laws, wherefore accepc of chese sair strangers tor yout
Slaves: Buc whereas their beauty deserves a gentler usage then others, give them no other
said he smilmg, but cords of silk to reeain ehera. My Lord, answered Mariama, the greatest
of all good things is Liberty, and by consequence the greatest of all evils is servitude; thera
ar? no chains thac are not heavy, and ehe less chey be, the raore do chey straicen him that wc»«
them; In sine, my Lord, cither chey do load him, or chey do wring hira, and both the one and
the other is always grievous.
</p>
<p>It was in chis fore. Madam, that the Princess Mariama spake to obtain our liberty j and
that which cirried her yec more Co oblige us, was, beanse Aly, whom slie extreamly hated,
had ac sirst oppofed our deliverance wich speeches of gallantry. Bnc ac lengch, seeing her pet"
sist too much in her demand, he by an artisicial discourse ccdoured the maecer with the pub¬
lique good, and gave the King a pretext to sollow his inclination, by obliging ^4n&lt;«W(i to
reeain these three sair Slaves in her service. It being so resolved chen, che Kii^ used them
wich a greac deal of civilicy, and having demanded of them what we were unco chem ? thty
answered, thac we were their brocbers, and besoughc hira chac we raighc noc bc sepanted
from them. As forus, seeing we mighc be understood, we humbly requested che King to
increat us as sree men; and eo consider chac we had been driven inco Marocco by a Tempest j
thac howsoever is he would nocwichstanding have a ransom of us, we desired he would be
pleased to see ic down, to ehe end wc might seek oue che means to satissie hira. Buc there¬
unto he answered no ocherwise, but chac che nexe day we stiould receive his pleasure; and
instantly we were conduded Co alodgng, which wis in the oucward Courc of the Palace,
where we had a Guard set upon u^. In ehe mean time the Princess Mariama, being moved
with the cears and increacicsof chese chree asslided ones, permicced chem Co remain wich u»,
on condition that they should spend ehree or sour hours of ehe day ae her lodging, praying them
not to be grieved, and to hope for all chings from her aslistance.

<p>Buc, Madam, chac you may che beceer comprehend ehe sequel of our History, I am Co rdate
unco you a part of Mariama's, and acquaint you in whae estace the Coure of Marocco ^a
at thac cime. I will noc stand for all ehae to tell you by what Areisices, ewo Xerises, chat is
to say amongst them, two holy men, and descended of the race of their Prophet Mahomet,
invaded the two Kingdoms of Marocco ind Taradant; buc I will only cell you, ehae these
two Xerisses, though chey were brocbers, could noc concenc chemselves wieh the partition
they had made of their Conquests; and aster many breaches of promise on either side, they
came at last to Arms. Whil'st they were in good cerms cogecher, Hamet, who was the
eldest, and co whom che Kingdom of Marocco was sallen for his soire, had married ^"'j'^*
ma, daughcer to Mahomet his broeher, King of Sus or Taradant, co Muley Ztdan, the cldctt
ofhis sons; so that when the War began between ehese cwo brothers, the sair andvcrtuow
Mariama sound her sels on the party of her sathers enemy; and whatsoever soe could do, it
was impofstblc for her to make them change their resolution. Seeing then that her prayers^*
tears, and perswasions were all to no purpofe with her sather-in-law H^wss, and that/w*-
ley Zidan, her husband, told her, how he could not but sollow him in this War, who had
given him birth; chac he was noc an enemy co Mahomet, buc only an obedient son; that i
was noc for children to ask who were the enemies of chofe co whom they owed their lives,

Abdalla was not at Marocco, so that when the news of his death arrived there, Aly, who'

savorite he would be, as he had b^en Mahomet's. And truly it was not hard for him tobe
so; for whereas chis man was very great in rich?s, moft miglity in sriends, of an extraordi¬
nary courage, having a great deal of prudence and wit, and rauch raore ambition, there
would havebeensolly,andnolitdehazardjsi9rwhorasoever would have enterprized to dis¬

<p>Abdalla, though grieved with chac which ys/y had done, yec naraed ic an excess of zeal
and assedion, racher then inhumanicy ; and continuing him in his Commands, committed
unto him almoft tbe whole sway of his Kingdoms. But in some fort to repair this cruelty,
he took care to dry up che tears of the ^i\nttss\ Mariama, inforced her co return tothe

thac Aly was not altogether cidpal^le of the Seacn of Hamet and her children, and would ex¬

thac Aly had counselled che deach of her Husband, and had caused her Saeher-in law, and her

<p>their Enemies, but because we were Christians, therefore w- sliculd be treated very gently, yea
and hope -iven us that in time we might obtain our liberty'. This resolucion taken, all ou
Soldiers and Mariners were thenextday committed to sasecustody without any ofher ill
usage ofsered unto them; and forus, they contented themselves with leaving us under the
guard they had formerly asligned us, with this disserence nevertheless, thac we were separated
stom Sophronia, Leonida,ind Hipolita; for il ms Abdalla's absolute pleasure, that they
soould abide in the service of the Psincess Mariama, and that they soould lie in her lodgings;
but with this grace forus, that wc soould be permitted Co go someciraes and see eheni, or
they CO come and visie us. This extraordinary savor having been granted to us, against the
custora of the Country, by the goodness of Manama, whora these new Slaves always sound
ready to render them all kinde of good ofsices. It is certain that this separation was grievous
unto us, and seeing ihe terras wherein we stood,we were almoft forry that we had not sussted
soipwrack, at least-wise me-thought I observed such like apprehensions in the raindes of Ho-
ratioi^d Alphonjo: But as for the Marquis, it is to be spoken for his glory, that never man
was so soon coraforted as he, and I was not a little surprized, co hear him say laughing, a quar¬
ter of an hour aster we were returned from conduding thepersons, who were so deer unto
us, tothe Viincess Mariama's lodgings, chac the ^snV^wi Love could cell how to use his
bow beceer, thenheof Europe; it being very true, laid he, that hehad never beenso sud¬
denly strucken to the heart, as hehad lately been by the charms of a sister of thePrincess
Mariama, who Was called Lela Mahabit, onely with seeing her at a window.
</p>
<p>For me, said the Marquis interrupting him, who had neither Sister nor Mistress to grieve
for nor was asslided but out of a sense of sriendsoip, I am not to be blamed, is, to render
my sels raore like unto thofe with whom I convetsed, I sussered my sels to be surprized with
the paslion which pofsesscd their Souls, is I be always interrupted inthis manner,-said Z)ss-
ria, it will be hard for me to relate this day that which you desire to know of me. Isabella,
sinding that Dijrw had Reason, raade all the company pass their word that they wonld not
speak any more until he had ended their History; so that every one keeping silence, and Isa¬
bella having renewed her attention, Doria profecuted his discourse in chis fore.
</p>
<p>These new Slaves were no sooner come Co ehe Princess Mariama's lodgings, buC Abdalla,
who visiccd chem very often, repaired chicher, accompanyed wich Aly. And whereas he
sound her wich them, and that therefore they would out of resped have withdrawn, he would
nor permie it, telling them thac che name of Slave, which he had impofed upon them, was
racher an artisice to retain them about the Princess his sister, then a design to keep them in ser¬
vitude. This complement was seconded by another which Aly used Co chem, and with a sin¬
cere protestation made to thera by Mariama for the treating ofthcra as her sisters, rather then
as her Slaves. This second view yet raore augmented the love, which the King of Marocco
and Aly already bore to Hipolita; and whereas Aly was cunning and dexerous, and had out
of a sense of ambition for a long eirae before caken greac care co observe all Abdalla's raoti-
ons, he quickly perceived that thebeiuty of Hipolita had Couched his hearC, and chat his
Master was his Rival. And whereas he knew very well chac Love, no raore chen Royalty, en¬
dures not any corapanion, heresolved to conceal srora theKing the design which hehad in
his head. It was not long, before his suspicions were sully cleared; for Abdalla being become
passionately in love, and searing lest is he soould ia\k too often with Hipolita, his sister, to
whora he carryed a great resped, would corae to know his intentions, he opened his heare
wholly to J/j, discovered his patlion unCo hira, conjured him eo sinde ouc the means to ac¬
quaint her with it, who had caused it. Aly, as wc understood asterwards testisied a great
deal of joy unto him, for that he being sallen in love, as he said,"^wi'ch one cs thofe Slaves, he
had been so happy as no: to prove his Rival. The King demanded of him chen, whecher it
were so chac he loved any of chem ? and ehe other answered him wich a salse considence, chac
iW^ had couched his heare. Thac which obliged him eo ehis lye, was his belies, ehae by
chis mean the King would never be jealous of him, nor would sear his salling in love with hI
p^ita, beiniT perswaded that his assedion was engaged otherwhere; and indeed thematcer
Ml oue as he imagined. TheKing gave him the condud of his Love, as well as chat of his

<p>/«A«s, the greatest of our unquietnesses was, that we could not foresee the end of our
prelent selicities, nor divine wherefore they treated us so savorably, and yet would not d liver
us.   Howbeit we were no: long w'    Jut discovcring it, for the King's and Ah's love still
augmenting, whereas gallantry seems to be natural to all the Moors, they were wilhne to re
store Hipolita to her former joy,bcfore they would speak to her of their paGion. For notwith-
stsnding all the caresses which these sair maids received from the Princess Mariama, and the
ast.dion which they carryed to her, yet melancholy appeared still in all their discourses, and
in all their adions: So that to delight them, there were nothing bu: publique tcalss, turneys
balls, and rejoycings.   But in all these encounters Aly so carryed the matter, as all th: parties'
whereof he was the Head, were, both braver, and more magnisicent, then that of others'
wichout the Kings ever suspeding any thing of his true intent, because his rainde was pre¬
pofsest wich the opinion, that it was Leonida he was in love withall, and not Hipolita. And
lurely he sliould have been very melancholique, that could not have taken pleasure in these as.
semblies, it being certain, that nothing is seen which is more agreeable even in Surope, espe¬
cially for dancing.   For whereas, since the desolation of Granada, many persons ot quality
retired to Sez., Tunis, and Marocco, though the remembrance of their misfortunes ought
to have made cliem renounce all manner of delights, yet their desire to please AbdalU w/io
proteded chem, caused them to be present ac all these seasts.   And truly I do not marvel, is
the Spaniards in conquering cheir Kingdom, though they be conquerors sevcre enough, have
noc forborn raking some of cheir gallantries, chiesly that dance, called Sarabanda: But it
must be acknowledged that they are but bad imitators ot chem, no raore chen we, who have
taken ic from theSpanyards; it being moft certain that they dance it in a manner wherein there
is so much arc and grace, as we come nothing neer it.   And whereas out ofa panicubr savor
we were present at all these seasts, I reraeraber one amongst th:irest, wherein the Maiquis
made an end of lofing his liberty by a Sarabanda, which the Princess Lela MahaVit danced.
For whereas all the seatures ot tier sac^ were exctll-nr, her eyes sparkling and passionate, her
sliape advantagi¬ous and comely, her carriage sree and ma)cssical, although the colour other
skin was not very agreeable, yet her whole person togenher appeared insinitely pleasing in this
Assembly, where slie danced a J'^scd/'^^^/^ with a negligcnc so sull of charms, with so grace¬
sul a dispofition, and so gallant and amorous an ayr, asthcMirquis wasinaminde sokmnly
to renounce his ordinary humor, and become constant tor this Princess.
</p>
<p>And Co eestisie unto you, how greac an impresilion slie raade in his heare, I only can tell yoii,
chac in sour days the Marquess, who was desirous to transtorra himsels into the person beloved
as much a&lt;: pofsibly he could, learned this dance so miraculously, that having demanded per-
niisiiion of Aly to intermingle himsels araongst a Troop ofGranadins, who were to dance dis¬
guised in one ofthese Assemblies, he charmed all the company in such fort, as che Prmcess Ld*
Mahabid, who was an equitable Judg of such like things, would needs knowwhohev;as:
But she was much amazed, when as sti? perceived that he was not a Granadin, but one of the
savorite Slaves, for so we were called ; Sophronia, Lcoivli, and/:///&gt;o//V.e were no Ic's then
she, to see chac they had admired him without knowing hiro, never dreaming it sliould be n-^,
though chey discerned him not amongst us.   In the mean time this adventure wasnotdis-
pleasing to her, for ascer thac, there pist not an Aslembly (and there was one almollevery
day) wherein he spake not to her, wherein he danced noc besoiehrr, and wherein with his
adress, and accustomed considence, he gave her noc s kw mark of his assedion, vet without
pasi^ng chofe bounds of resped which he owed to her.   Buc whenas all chese Seasts were
made upon design, the King solicited Aly to speak to HipoUta ofhis lovc, which he did loon

civilly enough coche ofsers he had made her; bnc forso rauch as regarded ehe Kings love, slie
spake CO him wich so much sirmness, as hc seemed co be very blank at it. It was not because
he desired soe soould accepc of Abdalla's love, bue seeing in whac raanner soe resu'e^d ehe
Kings assedion, he seared lest when he soould come Co discover his own, he sliould be worse
increaeed. And whereas H&lt;/&gt;o/sM perceived his unquietness; for whae reason, said soe unto
him.arc you asslided eo see me resolved eo oppofe ray sels wieh all ray power against, an assedi¬
on which you seera noe co approve of? Ic is, answered Aly, wich as rauch cunmng as malice,
because knowing by your discourse, how much chac which I have used eo you hach croubled
your mind, I cannoc chuse buc grieve for thac the King hath pick'd out Co persecute you, tha
only man in ehe world chac honors you raoft: Bue believe, sixx Hipolita, concinued he, chat
this unjust love couches rae as rauch as you, and chac ehere is noC any ching which I will not
do Co deliver you trom ic. Aster this Aly quicced her, and lesc her in such an unquiecness, as
tbe like was scarcely ever heard of. Noc only the Kings assedion asslided her; not only tbe
sadnessjwhich soe had observed in tAlss sace, troubled her; not only the incertainty wherein
soe was,whether soe soould discover Abdalla's love to the Princess Mariama, disquieted her;
buc ao odd and aicogecher extraordinary jealousie pue her mind upon the rack. She did not
complain of Horatio's looking on any odier person ; soe did noc accuse him of insidelity, but
soe was jealous because he was noc jealous: For when as Aly calked co her, soe had marked
how Horatio's eyes were still sixed on her, and albeic he had seen chac man encertain her along
time, yec had he not appeared the raore unquiet for it. And as it is the custora ot paslionate
persons to aggravate things, according to the apprehensions which they have, so Hipolita had
the injustice CO believe, chat her Lover must needs perceive the Kings love, which slie her sels
had not known. Ishe loved me ardently, said soe (for soe declared it unto us asterwards) the
sear of lofing me would have raadc him sear all things; he would have taken notice of the
Kings civihcics; his liberalities would have been suspeded unro him; I soould have seen some
unquietness in his eyes, when as Alj talked so earnestly to me: tnsine, concluded stie in htr
heart, either he loves me not, or he loves rae but a httle; and is he loves rae but a lictle, he
loves rae not at all, since lovc never endures any raediocrity.
</p>
<p>Whil'st soe reasoned in this manner, Alj, who desired to perswade the King chat he wai
inlovewithZ,s.W^ took great care that notice mightbe tiken how slie was pleasing to
him. And whexe^s Alphonso hath not by nature so quiet a mind as Horatio, he seemcd to us
almof^ as mucb troubled as HtpoUta, though it were .n a disserent manner. He was not jea-
\mso\ Leonida, buthe was vext to think that ^/; was amorous of her. Hedid notsearthat
soe would be unsaithsul to him, buc hc was angry that anocher was paslionate for her; ic
being his humor, as I conceive thatthe person vvhom he loves stiould never see any but hm,
nor soould be seen of any but him. As for mc, that am of a contrary mind; thac would have

that places all ray selicity in having Rivals, to the end I m.y pofsess tbe glory of beingbetcc J

<p>Behold, Madam, in what fore this Assembly ended; The King retired witha ^^.^ i ,
of impatience toknow what answer Hipolita had given to Ah; this s IsrConsiC, '
forty for having encountred with so much sirmness in my sisters mind ^ ^ Jl„° olii  '7
</p>
<p>which ^/jr seemed co bear her; ^//,/,.«/. netted with having a Rival, though h w^n "
^tT^a^ ;t to us; the Marquess exceedingly contented with h'avinga M l^ ^
Mahabtdwe\^ satissied with the Marquess his gallantry; Horatio with a mind ind.C
enough for all that had past; and I sofsiciently contented in our misfortune, and em
with a secrec sense of loy, co see chat che beauty of Sophronia was so persed, as soe made her
selt be adored of all Nations.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, ehe Princess y^^r/^w*, who hath a quick and piercing wit perceived
all che divers interests of this Assembly: and though soecould noc discover them persedly
yet knew slic thac che King was in some paslion; chat zAly was not exempted from it • that
Abdelcader her broiher did not hue Sophronia; and thn Lela Mahabid was too civl to¬
wards a Slave. This wise Princess resolved for all rhsr,noc to n ake any soew ofall chese things
Till slie was more cercain of chem; bue it was not long before slie was cleared therein. For
my sister being retired with her companions, and having acquainted them with Alss dis¬
course, they resolved Co advertise the Princess/J/&lt;«r;.(OT^ of ir, and absolutely to conside in
her vertue.   Sophronia was notwithstanding of the opinion,to ask counsel of us sirst ; to thst
the next morning, according to the permislion chey had for it, thty senc for us.   And wsien
as Sophronia had propounded che maccer unco us, and chac I began already Co give my advice.
Let Horatio speak sirst, said /^«/»o/«&gt;&lt;« unto me,with precipitation enough; for is to give good
counsel one hath need of a quiet mind, it may well be said that he is^in such an estate ashe
oughc CO be, to counsel us as we sliould be.   Were it true, replyed Horatio mightily surpri¬
zed, thac I had a quiec mind, che manner wherewiehall you have spoken is enough to trouble
it in such fort, as to render me incapable of counselling others.   Since your resl is so dear un¬
to you, answered she, as you even seek a pretext not to assist asslided persons with your ad¬
vice, leave us at leastwise to think of whae we have to do.   Horatio seeing her to bitter,
■would no: answer her out of prudence and resped, for sear lest her santastical humor Ihoald
appear too visibly unco us.   As for me, who co.mprehended noching in chis discoud', i said
unco my sister hals laughing, chac I believed che King of Marocco^s love had pofltH d her
wieh pride, racher chen wich melancholy, is (he concinued speaking in chac sasoion.  But in
theend we resolved, thae these sour Slaves sliould absolucely conside in che Princ.ss yl/«''w-
ma, for sear lest isthey sliould noc advereise her ofthe truth of thematter, soe might hive
cause to chink, sliould she discover ic some other way, that it was noc displeasin:^ to chem,
sincc chey made a mystery of ic.   We conceived chic from her alone ehey were eo his s'c
their protedion, and their liberty, and consequently that itwas requisite they soould make
all their vertue known to this Princess; who out of sympathy and conformity, would without
doubt be always carried Co scrve ehera.
</p>
<p>Ascer we had a long cime reasoned of all these chings; aster thac Sophronia had acquainted
us with her new Conquest, and Leonida with that which soe thoughc soe had made; alter, I
say, we had spoken of all ehis in general, Horatio, who desired to know what he was ac¬
cused of, separated Hipolita dextrously from us, and having led her to a window, where (be
leaned, he conjured her to tell him what had obliged her ro speak wich so much bicterntsj
untohim, ( at leastwise he related it so unto us,) I know sull well, said he unto her, thatl
am not saulty; but I do not know ofwhat crime I im accused : Be so good unto me then as
to acquaint me with ie, that I may justisie my selt; but isyou will have me speak like anot-
sendor, although I be none, let mc know what saulcl have committed, to the end Imay le-
pcnt me of ic, and amend it. You may peradventure do the former, answered so", but it is
impoflible for you to do the other. J have a long time known, that thcreuouldbetoinc
injustice in accusing you of an insensibili:y, which you cannot chuse but have.; ^'O'^^''^'^
cannot also chuse but complain of my hard formne, iw having a mind so lenhb.c ^^'^^^ ^^^

<p>that is so little himsels.  The more you complain, said Horatio unto her, the less do I compre¬
hend of what saulc I am accused; for to say that the beautisol Hipolita does noc couch my heart
sensibly,and ehae soe alone makes noC up my selicicy,is a ching wichouc all likelyhood. You have
reason.said soe unco hira wieh a biccer lm'\e',HipoUta can do someehing upon your selicicy, but
stie can do noching upon your raisfortune :She can foraeciraes with a savorable look,or wieh her

soews tooehers,begee any sadness in you: verily, concinued soe, you are the happiest Lover
thac ever was; noching displeases you, noching raolests you; neicher sear nor jealoulie trouble
you • you hope withouc unquiecness; you desire withouc irapacience, and of all Che choughcs
which Love inspires, you know none wichouc doubc, bue chofe chac lead Co joy.  You m-
Cirprec all chings, as you say, eo ehe advancage of ehe person beloved; bue Co speak ™ore rea¬
sonably, ic is CO ehe disadvancage of your love: For whofoever loves cruly,can never hold him¬
selsso assured of ehe person whora he loves, bue chac sear will be stronger in hira chen hope;
now for your pare, you hope all chings, and sear noching.   Ic is cercain. said Horatio unto
her, ehae you ofcencimes reduce me co an estace of searing noching, and of having recourse
unco hope to comfort me.   For in sine, whereas the greatest of misfortunes is Co see you m
choller, I behold my selt so raany tiraes expofed thereunto, that Ihave nothing else to tear.
No, no, said s/ip&lt;?/&gt;r^ unto hira, you are yet more ingenuous then so; my very choller gives
you joy; yon regard it as a mark of my assedion; and chus making profic ofall chings, you
are never unhappy.    Mighe it please Heaven, said he nnco her, chie you spake crue 1 Con¬
sess CO me, added soe incerrupting him, ehae is I had said noching co you of ehe long conver¬
sacion which I had yesterday wieh ^(7, whecher you would have suspeded any ching of ic.
Any ocher bue you would have been croubled at it, continued soc,and whereas love renders the
mind clear-sightcd,you would have imagined foraething of the truth. But as for you,doubtles$
you believed thathe entertained me with che Governraenc ofcheKing of yWrsrocco's State;
thac policy was ehe objed of our conversacion, whil'st you could in ehe mean cime look
wichouc unquiecness upon the Princess Lela Mahabid, becausis soe danced with a good grace.
Are these, rigorous Hipolita, said Horatio unto her, all the criraes which I have committed ?
Have I done nothing buc see you talking with y^/y, wichouc divining what he said unco you,
and wichouc asssiding my sels ae ie? No, answered soe, you have done noching else; buc
this indisserency, or to say better, this insensibility, and this stupid lovc so vexes rae, as in
the state whereunto ic hath reduced ray mind for a long eirae Cogecher, I had racher see yon
despcracely in love wich another,ehen eo see you so quiec: for eieher che spighe ofyour change
Would see mc ae rest;or is I hid noe resolucion enough for ehac,I soould say in slaecering my (els,
he will corac ouc of his error, he will repene hira ofhis inconstancy,ind sincc he can cell how to
love,he raay be capable of recurning and repeneing, and of having as much assedion for me, as
he bach for anocher.Buc in ehe case wherin I see you ac ehis presene,you wil be always insensible
and always happy,and I always unforcunaee.Thac cannoc bc,answered Horatio,my destiny and
yours arc noe separated so easily But,amiableHi/&gt;o/jr&lt;»,why wil you noC have me live innocentlyj
why will you have me render my sels saulty, in suspeding you araiss ? Why will you have me
make ray sels unhappy voluntarily,and abandoning Reason.forra monslers Co my sels co combat
withall ? and why will you not on the contrary have me conside in your vercne,rely on your si¬
delity, and without rendring rae infortunate, susser rae to be in seme rest ? Would you kno Wj
said Hipolita unto hira, why I will not have it so, it is because I do not seek in you for a Wise-
man, anda Philofopher, but for a Lover.   Love hath a Reason, which is Wholly parcicular
unto it; reasonable persons, who are couched wieh ehis passion, never abandon Vercue soe
ic, buc wiehall ehey do noe sollow ehae severe Reason, which will have one receive wich an
equal ceraper, both good and bad forcune.   Love oughc eo be stronger chen Reason; ic doCh
noe destroy ir, bue ic eroubles ic.   I bluso, Horatio, ae ehae which I say, and ac che gries I
am in, for that isl ara to know these things, it hath noc been racher by your adions, chen
by mine own experience, that I have understood Chera.   You oughc co have taught me, that
love IS suspicious, irapatient.urquiet, and curious; chac ie wisocs for chac which it hach not j
ehjcicsearech Co lofe ehae which ic pofsessech; you oughc eo have learUCme, that none ofehe
adions ot ehe person beloved can be indisserenc; chac she alone oughc to bc mote considerable

<p>cause I know how to love well, and chac I resped you. Resped, replyed Hipolita can L
bue a m.rk of esteem, and noc a mark oflove: And cell me, I pray you, by whac way ore
tend you to eestisie yours unco me. In proccsting to you, answered Horatio, that you are
all my selicity ; m absolutely remitting unto you ehe condud of my fortune; and in aslurine
you thac I would lofe my lise with joy for your service. One may do all these things out of
est em, and out of generofity, replyed stie, bue one can never be jealous wichouc love- all
other passions may receive interpretaeions, bue chis same leaves no room co doubt of the
csuse of it; and jeasousie is cbe only assured mark of this passion. Is I could cease from
cl&gt;s em:ng of you, replyed Horatio, I soould be jealous, I soould be unquiet. Say, answered
slie lilting up h r voycc, and quitting him, that is you could cease srora being insensible, you
stiould be a Lover. She spake this so loud, as Sophronia, Leonida, the Marquess, Alshmso,'
and I, heard h^r, and we judged thac chere was forae lietle diforder beeween them, elpecially
when I sa w a Carnation colour on my sisters cheeks,which used rot to be there, and a certain
constrained and artisicial smile, which anger always produceth in her sace. Sophronia will¬
ing CO pi iy ; he good sister in this occasion would needs know their dispute; and when ai He-
ratio had r counted it unto her, notwithstanding H»)&gt;o/&lt;s &lt;i's resistance to che contrary, we
made their peace, aster they had on either part said all chac their wit and passitm could stirnih
them with.
</p>
<p>thereupon we retired to our lodging, andthese three sair Slaves to che Princess y^^ori*-
ma's; where ascer che sirst civiheies they besoughc her to give thera a particuUr audience.
Mariama, having granted them their dmsnd, comminded her woraen to leave her ate;
which was no sooner done, bxxi the siix Sofhr on! a, who had in charge to speak in the nattie
ofall the three, requested her to remember the promise slie had raade to proted them; and
then siiie related unto her the discourse which ..^Z;'had used to Hipolita ind Leomda-Mt
noc able to obtain so much considence from her modesty, as to tell her wiehall, that Abdelca.
der hid testisied a great deal of assedion eo her, my sister acquainced ehe Princess with the
conquest char Sophronia had raade.   Mariama being very much sacissied with cheir si'eedom
and cheir vertue, redoubled ehe care and good-will which soe had for chem; and to (hew
thac she puc as much considence in eh.ir discrecion, as ehey done in hers.- and colec them see
also, how much interest she had to oppofe all the bad designs of Aly, slie recounted all his
adventures unco chem, namely, all ehae I imparced coyou at the beginning of this History;
And thereupon assured them, that whatsoever came srora a spirit so arcisicial as Alsi, was
ever to be suspeded.   She cold chera moreover, chac whereas he did always work with tun¬
ing, he wis always Co be dele wieh in the same manner: that to that essed, greac care was to
betaken toke^ bim from discovcring, that they had acquainted her either with the Kings
love, or his; thac ic was likewise requisite, that Hipolita soould seem to place some consi¬
dence inchae salse generoficy, whichhe had seigned eohave in speaking to her of ehe Kmgs
love.   ^ox,skid Mariama mto them, I Sanow Aly, he wonld never have dele in chat fort
wich Hipolita, had noC some paslion, more powersul chen his raslice, carryed him thereunto.
Hitherto he hath never contraried the King in any tl ing; hitherco he hath asseded a blind obe¬
dience to all his will, and an exterior sidelity, which hath not permitted me as yet to revenge
the miss hiess he hath done rae.   Nevertheless I see foraething in his hearr, since the time that I
have obtained of my k\s to speak wieh him oftner chen I uled to do, which puts me in hope
that I stiall sinde ch^ means for ic.   In sine, brlie ve ic, said soe co HipoUta, chac Aly hach not
declared ehe Kingslove unco you, and promised eo proted you against him, wichout some le¬
crec reason chac induces him chereunto, and wichout some particular interest.  But tor disco¬
vcry, we must dissemble as well as he, and not speak so severely of the love which he laitu
the King bears you, thac wc may see whae he wiU be ac.   Leomda, for her pare, mult enae-
vor to discover his designs; and Sophronia, carrying her sels according eo her humc-r ana n
vertue, will no doubt punisi Abdelcader rigorously enough, for iussering *"ra'^|^ ^^ ".

<p>Thcsc sair Slaves gave her chanks for a discourse chac was so advantageous unto chem; Com¬
mended her vercue and her generoficy; lamenced ehe misforeunes chat had arrived unco her;
detested ehe cruelcy of Aly •• and raaking an exchange of cheir own forrows, ie mighc have
been said thzt Mariama selc cheir miseries raore chen her own; and chac ehese sair Slaves,
who were no less generous, nor less sensible chen she, had as much sense of her past fortunes,
as of cheir presenc raisoaps.
</p>
<p>Aseer ehae so sad a conversacion had lasted some cime, and ehae ouc of ehe compsssion,
which chey had one of anocher, ehey had in some fore micigaeed their griess, the Princess
Mariama cold chem smiling, how ic would noe be just, chac whil'st (he was chinking of

wieh anocher love; desiring thera eo advereise the Slave, which danced withso good a grace,
that the Princess Lela A/ahabid was her sister; because soe believed, char eieher he knew not
so much, or that he had forgotten it. Sophronia perceiving by Mariama's speech, thae she
meane ehe Marquis; and that soe also had taken notice of his inclination to the Princess Lela
Mahabid, choughc ic was best eo acquainc her wieh his humor, Co ehe end slie mighc noC be
ofsended is hc concinued che gallantry he had begun. Sophronia then drew the Marquis his
pisture so agreeably, and so advantageously for him, as the Princess told her that she was
very glad of the conquest her sister had made, and Aat slie might in some fort sliare with het
therein, it was sit soe soould raore particularly know so extraordinary a raan: and so, tha
Princess Mariama, and Sophroni&lt;t,becime his Considents, without having any purpofe to be
so, and procured him che pleasure to see the Princess Lela Mahabid alraoft every day at the
Princess Mariama's lodging. The sitst eirae he was chere, I reraeraber chac we broughc him
thither with forlie kinde of repugnancy; for he had understood from Sophronia her sels^ in
whae manner soe had spoken of hira. Ic is noe, said he unco us, because I ara angry that
Sophronia hath spoken che eruch; buc ie is because I do noe seel my sels in a dispofieionco

<p>I profess, said the Princess Mariama, chac this is the sinest way of commending ones scls
that ever was heard of. Buc, said slie to the Marquis, how comes it to pass, that in so little
time as you have been here, you have so persedly aceained co chat, which the Granadm who
are our masters in gallantry, are so long a learning } for, as you say your sels, there are things
which you understand but supersicially, because your love to thofe that asseded them was
noc long enough. Ic is, Madam, answered he, because I have ac this picsenc a greater desire
to please, then ever I had in all my lise.

<p>She thae hach given you ehis desire, said ehe Princess Lela Mahabid unco him, soould have
a greac deal of merie, or sliould be very much obliged to you. She hath somany excellenc
qualicies, replyed the Marquis, as I may say, chac in ehis illustrious person I love all thofe
whoinl have loved in all my lise-eime: it being moft certain, that I have never admired any
thing in all the others, whom I have served, which I do noc sinde yec more eminently in het
whom now I adore. She is wondersully sair; slie hach a spirie as sull of brightness, as het
eyes are of light; and chere is seen in her whole person, a charm so powersul and so extraor¬

<p>The Princess Lela Mahabid, not able to forbear from blusoing ac ehe Marquis his dis¬
course, would ae leastwise make a gallancry of ie. I leave you Co judg, said soe unto him,how

replyed he, thac in chis occasion you cake one vertue for another; and that this change, which

Princess Mariama incerrupting him, chae is my sister will be perswaded by me, soe soall al¬

the thoughts of resped and adoration which I have for her, will not permit me to commit

<p>ing but one heart and one assedion, to ofser to love all chac is araiable in her at one and che
same time: so that to love her the more persedly, and in some fort also to sollow this incli¬
nation, which predominates over all mine, I give every day a new objed CO my passion. To
day I adore her eyes; to morrow I love the beauty of her siiape, the next day I susser my sels
to be charmed with the graces of her minde; another cime her goodly asped ravislies me;
and by ehis means yielding my heare wholly eo each of chofe excellenc qualicies which she pof¬
sesses, I soall love her as much as soe deserves to be; and without beiig inconstant toher, I
soall yet bc always so much, as never to be weary of my servitude. This new way of loving
so mightily surprized all the company, as albeit they had no great cause of joy, yec could
they not forbear laughing at it. I soould never have done, is I (hnuld rehearse all the pleasing
passages, which the Marquis delivered in all the visits which he gave to chese ewo Princesses; ic
soall sussice chen eo cell you, chae ehe Princess is/4 Mahabid hid i\\ the esteem and all the
assedion for him, which a Princess, gallant enough, and who for all that was vertuous, was
capable of
</p>
<p>In the ra an tirae you are Co know, chac Aly had noc sailed in rendering an account to the
King of the comraission which hc had given hira: but whereas he wa? a Lover and cunning,
he had disguised the truth of thae which he had said to Hipolita, and of ehae which Hipolita
had answered him. For though my sister had cestisied sussiciently unco him, that Abdalla's
assedion could never please her, yec he seared chat is the King should undertake co speak eo
her himsels, soe mighc at lengch bc perswaded; so chae co keep him from ie, he cold him,ehac
albeic Hipolita had noc savorably received che dcclaracion which he had made her of his love,
yec he hdd ie noc absolutely irapoflSble to touch her heart; st having seemed unto him how
hehad observed, thac ehe greacest sear H//»o/j&gt;^ had, was lest ehe Vxincess Mariama sliould
perceive chis assedion. Wherefore, my Lord, said he untohim, iemust be by me that slie
must be acquainted wich all ehe thoughts which you have for her, until such time as by great
hopes we have chased away ehis sear from her heare. For chere is no doubc, added he, consi¬
dering che estate wherein I saw her minde, is you encerprize Co speak eo her your sels, bnc
you will be very ill sacissied of her, for che reason I have cold you.
</p>
<p>tAbdalla, though very amorous, and consequently very impatient and very suspicious, yet
made do question of ^'/;'s discourse; and remitting himsels absolutely to his condud, he
conjured him to remember, that on the conquest of Hipolita all his selicity depended In ehe
inean while, albeic he had promised Aly to give my sister che least cestimony of his assedion
rhae he could, yec was le impoflible for him co conceal his" paslion: for he no sooner enered
inco Manama'sXod^xng, buc he asked for Hipolita; he no sooner saw her,buc a new jov ap¬
peared in his sace; HipoUta's looks guided his whecher he would or no; he sollowed her
wich his eyes wheresoever soe wenc; and seldom did he make a visic wichouc praisine forae
beaucy, or tome vercue, which he said he had not yec marked in her. These praises did not

<p>displeased, besoughc her not to condemn him without hearing.  For, sair HitoUt^ r. -jT
unto her, it may be you will sinde some disserence between the love that Abdalla hArc
and chac which I bear you: He onely loves che beaucy of Hipolita, and I adore the v ml""s
Hipohta.   He is not your servant, but to make you his Slave ; and I do not love vou h V
marry you.   His slarae is unjust, and mine is lawsul; the end of his love is his own htlsJ^
on, andthatof mine is your glory, and your conservation. For &lt;« sne, continued he it &gt;
be true ehae you love honor, you will have some indulgence for ehe assedion which 1 carrv r
you; seeing chere rests no other mean co warrane you from ehe violences of AbdalUS love
bue chac of receiving che same which I ofser you.   I acknowledg, said he surther to her that
I am an ill subjed, but ic is noe buc Co be a saithsul Lover, and because I will not expofe vou
to che greatest miseries, which a vertuous person can susser. For, is you wils said he nnto
her, all che Kings love, all his force, and all his power, sliall not keep me, from protesting
and marrying you.                                                                                                =
</p>
<p>^ly having made an end of speaking, lest Hipolita, for that he would not have her, said
he, answer him withouc advisement, in a raatter where on all his happiness or unhappiness
depended. From chence he went to the Princess Mariama, to whom in appearance he bore
a great deal of resped. And whereas for some cime past, this Princess had given him more
commodity to speak to her then before, out of the design soe had to discover bis intentions
concerning him that was to succeed Abdalla, it wasnot dissicult for him to talk with ber in
private; so that aster he had protested an inviolable sidesity tt) her, and had sworn to her,
thac nexe eo ehe glory and incerests of Abdalla, noching in che world was so dear to him as
hers; he cold her, chac knowing her exceeding vercue and prudence, he choughc he wasob-
liged to acquainc her, how ehe King was so despcracely in love wieh HipoUta, as he teared
thac his passion would carry him eo lofe che resped which he owed Co her, in drawing him to
use some violence to ehis maid: That is in chis occasion he mighe be permicced to give adver¬
tisements and counsel both together, he conceived chac che best course could be taken, would
be to remove HipoUta out of the way,or to marry her; That, as her Slave, soe might dispofe
of her, wichout the Kings having any lawsul precexc co coneradid her, since he himsels had
bestowed herionher.
</p>
<p>The Princess received this discourse of AL's, as is soe were obliged to hira for it; and
akhough she knew not as yec the interest which he had in this assair, becsuse soe had not seen
Hipolita; yet she believed that chis generofity, which appeared in his speech, was not in his
heart: Slie chanked him notwithss anding for the advice he had given her; promised him to
observe the Kings and HipoUta's adions; and then told him, thst soe would resolve of no¬
thing in this assair, without demanding his counsel about it; and that he onhis part Ihould
not sail to advereise her of all that he knew. Aly, to let the P. incess see that he lyed not, de¬
sired her to call to minde all che eestimonies of unquietness and assi:dion, which tbe King
could not conceal in the visits he had rendred her for some time past. And when as (he had
told him that slie reraembred them very well, he went very well satissied of her. Soe
knowing che vertue and prudence of this Princess, he doubted not buc ehae now understand¬
ing che love which the King bore to Hipolita, she would oppofe it with all her power; and
so, is it happened ehae HipoUta sliould cell her che pr poficion he had raade Co marry her, (he
would noe coneradid it; because it would be a raean to keep the King srora committing a
sault; and because she would believe al o by this way to puc bira ouc of grace with Abdal¬
la, which he seared noe much, in regard ehae all che force of che Kingdom was in his hands;
thae all ehe Governors of Places depended on him; and chac ic was impofsible sox A bdak
torid himsels of him, buc by caking away his hse; whichhe stood in no doubc of, for he
could noc imagine, that a Prince to whom he had conserved che Crown, could make him loie
his head. And aseer this manner he resolved eo make a stiew of considing in ehe Princess A?&lt;&lt;-
riama; judging chae noching could arrive cherein thac would noc be advantageous to him.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Abdelcader had his designs both of love and ambition, as we I as Aij;
and though he was no very excellent Prince, yet the desire of reigning isso natural in men,
as ic sound a place in his heare, and so much che more strongly, because he knew that acco u-
ing to equity the Crown of Marocco appertained to him as^r the death of his brother, cnoug
Abdalla had a son; for thac che Xenss Mahomet had so ordained by his Teltamenc. in ni^
thought, he had a long time already very much courted Aly, to the end he mighr gam m

<p>as much as he could; out ofehe hope tha is A blalla ame toedye, he Would (ide wich him,
or ac leastwise rcmiin a neucer beeween che son of Ab UUa and h-m.
</p>
<p>Nevercheless, whereas ac chac time ^/; had other designs, h- never said any thing to/s^-
delcader, which might make him hope for ought from [bim.   siut whereas he was dextrous,
and knew not certainly whether he tbould let Abdalla's son raign, or raign himsels, he had
never disobliged hira, but was contented to tell him still. Upon the divers propofitions which
he had made unto him, that for matters regarding the State, he was noc the servanc of the
pexsono\ Abdalla, but of theYiv:)gof Marocco; That as for him, he was perswaded, how
it was neither reason, nor justice, that ordinarily made Kings, but Fortune only; And with¬
out conlidering whether soe were blind or no in the distribution of Crowns, hc was resolved
always to serve the State with sidelity, in the p.^rson of thofe whom stie would place on the
Throne of Marocco.   But in the terms wherein things then were, he nevertheless alcered hiS
mind, albeit he bad an hundred tiraes proraised Abdalla, is he should happen to dye before
hira, to conserve the Crown for his son, to che prejudice of Abdelcader: And whereas Alj
undertook not this d.sign, but for his particular interest, for in raaking a young King to raign,
he soould in a raanner be King hirasels; that interest coraing Co change, hc also changed his
resolution.   For aster he had well examined both che Kings love and his own, he sound chac
whae industry soever he could use, ie would be impoflsible for hira co marry Hipolita wieh
Abdalla's consent; who soould no sooner be incensed against him, but the Princess Maria¬
ma, joyning her credit and address to the just occasion soe had to wish him ill, would no
doubt constrain him to have recourse to extream remedies.
</p>
<p>With such like thoughts it was that Alj had entertained hirasels a good while already,when
as Abdelcader, who believed he was in love w h Leonida, and consequently hoped, that he
would excuse the passion he had for Sophronia, came unto him with an intent dextrously
Co learn of him whae designs he had for chac maid , Co ehe end he mighc rule his by
thofe of a man, who, as he believed, durst not conderan that in anocher, which he sussered
in hirasels.
</p>
<p>All their conversation at sirst was but of indisserenc chings, and of che beauty of Mariama's
Slaves. And whereas Aly was not ignorane of Abdelcader's passion for Sophronia, he was
willing in ehis occasion co incense che mind of ehis Prince against Abdalla, and wholly to gain
him Co himsels, eo the end chit ishe were to raake a universal subversion in chis Seaee, Abdel-
cadermiQ,ht surniso Mm wich a precexc specious enough, by giving thepeople Co understand,
chac AbdAla by a ttsta-menc, which always reraained in Alss hands, incended his son soould
raign Co his prejudice: For howsoever, Abdekader was Mahomet's son, as well as AbdAla;
and albeic he was no very able Prince, yec had he no vices, so ebac the people did not hate him!
^/y considered surther, thac ishe soould come to extream violence, and dispofsess Abdalla,
that Abdelcader might raign, he soould make a King, without ceasing to be one; ic being cer-^
tain, that he would have need ofhim for the Government of his State.

<p>Aster this reasoning which ^Z; had within hirasels, and aster an indisserent lon^discourse
which he used to Abdelcader, Co prepare hira for that he was going Co say co hira. he gave

be dextrously bruted amongst the people, chac Abdalla would desraud him of che righc he

matter more plausible, he sliould in a publique audience go and demand perraission to marry

I shall have (hue up AbdallaMs son,and Mariama; and asccr (his you stiall have ehe Crown

pence which I demand of you. You mistake ehe name, said Abdelcader eo him, and you
wonld no doubt speak of Leonida. No, no, replyed Alj; and ehen he declared unto him the
truth ofthe matter, and so they parced, aseer they had well examined their encerprize again,
and sully resolved not to let a day pass, without laboring to advance the execution thereof as
much as chey could.
</p>
<p>In the mean space Abdalla lived still in some hope, chat he should be able co touch the heart
of Hipolita, especially sincc che Conspiracy of ^^&lt;is/c&lt;i«/*r; for che subtle ^4/; since thar, to
busie his mind the more pleasingly, had aslured him, chac provided he would continue living

hirasels che happiest raan in ehe world, for being savorably looked upon by che Princess Z,s/&lt;i
Mahabid.
</p>
<p>Bue noc Co prolong ray discourse wieh raaccers which ate noC necessary for you to know,
I soall cell you, ehae in sour or sive conversaeions ehe Princesses address was so great, ehae slie
knew wieh as rauch cercainty as strong conjedurcs could give ofit, thac Aly had ill intentions
for ehe Kings children. And wichout being able co divine chac diey wete in forae fore Co ehe
idnnta^eoi Abdelcader, soe knew ehae is che King carae Co dye, he Would noC conserve the
Crown for his son. That which raade Mariama more easily discover Alj's designs was, that
seeing ehe civility which soe had soewed to hira forae days before, and the vertue ofthis Prin¬
cess being more dreaded ot him then all Abdalla's authority, he had used certain obscure dis¬
courses unto her, to make her apprehend, that is soe would embrace his sriendsoip, he would
cause the Crown of Marocco to sall upon the head of whomsoever soe would. For whereas
Qaevjistheviidowof Muley Zidan, to whom of righe che Kingdom appercained, isthey
had let him live, he thought that it may be soe was capable of the desire to remount into the
Throne of her Sathers. But that being no intention ot hers, soe seemed not to understand any
of Alss speeches in that raanner, though indeed soe raarked thera very exadly. Aster slbe
had throughly run over again in her mind, even to the least circumstances, whatsoever might
either increase or dirainiso her suspicions, slie resolved to advertise the King thereof But to
prepare his raind for the entertaining of forae distrust of Aly's sidelity, slhe willed HipoUta to
make Abdalla perceive, as often as soe saw hira, thac soe rook greac care Co decline his en¬
councer, Co ehe end soe raighc be the raore credited, when soe soould assure hira thac Aly had
ofsered to raarry htr, for the securing of her trora his violences. The Princess Mariama,
who did nothing inconsiderately, resolved for all that to carry some cime yec for che disco¬
vcring ofher suspicions.

<p>In ehe raean season Aly took order for all things necessary to his enterprize, and according
to the plot which he and Abdelcader hidhyd^ one raorning when as the King of Marocco
gave audience to all thera which had any thing to rcquest of hira, Abdelcader, sollowed by
certain ofhis Partisans, went and besought the King to grant him the permislion to marry

<p>to his Estates, and to surnisli him with a pretext to make War as often as he mee wich an oc¬
casion foric; That to cake from him che boldness thence-forward to ofser such like propofi¬
tions, he was to tell him absolucely, thae this marriage did noc please hira, even wichout co-
louring the matcer with any apparant reason$,as he might do; because, said he, AbdeUader's
boldness could not be sussiciently punislied.
</p>
<p>Abdalla sollowing Aly''s opinion in all things, contradided hira not in this, where he
thoughc his incerest alone was regarded. He senc Abdelcader word then, chat he tbrbad him
to think of marrying himsels, either to che Princess of Tunis, or eo any ocher; ehae he ssiould
leave co hira the care of chusing a wise for him; and that is he did ocherwise, he soould then
be declared gmlcy of High Treason. Abdelcader no sooner received cbis answer, buc every
one in Marocso knew ic, and every one murmured ac ic. The Princess Mariama could noc
comprehend chis business; tor slie knew chac Abdelcader had cestisied a greac deal of love to
Sophronia ip divcrs occasions; and knew also chac he had never regarded ehe Princessof Tum
bue wich indisserency; and ehae is chere had not been some hidden thing in his deiign, she
sliould have been the sirst to whom he would have spoken ofit: but howibever soe reasoned
thereupon, slie could not discover the truth. And whereas HipoUta had for some time toge¬
ther lived with the King, as slie had ordained her, she observed that Abdalla perceived this
change; so thac seeing the macter in chis estace, slie wene one morning co his lodging, where
slhe craved she savor of him eo calk wieh him in privace, and the King having granted it toher,
sbe besought him co promise her, chac is he did noc give credic to whac soe was going to tell
him, he at leastwise would never speak of ic again; being sully resolved noc co acquaint him
with chae she had co communicace unto him, unless he would engage his word unto her
to do so.
</p>
<p>The King, being touched with an extraordinary curiofiey, and yet searing that Mariama
would speak to him of his love to HipoUta, stood a while without answering her; but at
length having promised her as much as she had desired of him, stie began to prepare his mind
with a very particular address. I know, said slie unro him, thae for chis which I am going
to tell you I oughc to be suspeded ofyou, eieher of malice, or of prcoccupaeion: I know also,
that Aly being so mightily establistied in your assedion, I soall expofe my sels to ehe hazard
ofdispleasingyou, incclhngyouchac I susped he is noC so saichsul uneo you, as his birth and
obligations toyououghe tomake him: I know too, ehae in whac manner soever you hear
the business, ic will be still ofsensive unro you; for is you beleeve chere is any malice in my
discourse, you will np doubc be forry co sind a stain in ehe Soul of a person chat is so dear unto

betrayed by a man whom you have so much obliged will disquiee you; and whedier icbc ouc
ofasenseofglory, orof cenderness, you will be grieved: Judg ehen, my Lord, is the matter
which I am to tell you be noc iraporcane, since bearing you all ehe retped and all the atsettion
thac I ought CO have for a Prince, who is boch my King and my broeher, I expofe my scls not¬
withstanding CO che hazard of troubling his rest, and geccing his hatred, which is to me my su-
preamest misfortune.                                                                                            -       ,.

<p>Abdalla, imized with Mariama's discourse, though hc did not believe that the could

<p>more unlikely then the other, because he might conceive, that Mariama had taken his Con¬
sident for a Lover of Hipolita, yet he beleeved more of it ehen (he would have had him.
And making stiew of being raore moved with Aly's wane of resped eo her, ehen wieh his
own incerest, he demanded of her very txadly, how soe came eo perceive/^/;'s passion;
and whecher ehe con jedures soe had of ie were strong enough ? because it it proved to be so,
he meant Co pnniso hira for his boldness. My Lord, saidthis Princ ss unro him, you do me
too much savor, rather to chink of rae, ehen of thegood cs yout State; bue eo imiraec your
generoficy, be pleased, wiehoue considering,rae, eo lee rae regard noching bue your person
alone, and by forae invcncionlec me surnisti you wich means, eieher co convince or justisie
Aly. And chen, wichouc Abdalla's deraanding ie, soe recounced all chofe chings unto htm
which had been cause of her suspicions: but at length the trouble of this Princes raind being
somewhac appeased, he beleeved that Aly raight be his Rival, but beleeved not thac he had
any design upon his Crown. Howbeie Mariama said so much unco him, chae in ehe end
wieh her enereaeies and reasons soe obcained of him, chae for sisteen days space he would do
whaesoever soe would have him for ehe clearing of the business. This Prince had much ado
to resolve upon making any doubt of Aly's sidelity, so tar forth as Co seek oue the means of
convincing hira; but ac last the consideration of Mariama, and a little touch of jealousie car¬
ried hira unto it: yet was it upon condition, that ii Aly wete sound innocenr, she (hould
srora thence-forward have as much goodness for him, as (he had had aversion.
</p>
<p>Mariama hi\ingpxomised Abdalla all ehae he desired, soe began ehe very sarae day one
of the moft extraordinary Artisices, as ever was made use of, for ehe discovcry of the thoughts
of an ambitious man and a Traytor; and lo, how stie proceeded.   She obliged Abdalla to
keep his chamber cercain days, and not Co lee himsels be seen of any bue his Physicians, and
the Slaves which served hira.   Ac sitst Aly raarvelled noc Co see che door kepc sast aoainst all

rocco CO shuc themselves up many times whole Moneths Cogecher wieh cheir wives and Slaves

and ehae chey which looked eo him, had forbidden any body srora seeing hira • as indeed che

Je would either convince, or justisie his savorite: And having instruded him in that which
stie would have him to do, slie caused a Guard to come in for co seizc on Aly, in case ehere
sliould be need of ic; and cook order for all chings so secretly, as no body discovcred any
thing. The day sollowing Aly early in che morning came co Mariama, wirh an intent to
employ all his address for che clearing of che doubc wherein he was: for ambieion and lovc
gave him so much irapacience, as he had no rest. And verily in ehis occasion the protestion
of Heaven appeared visibly, both to revenge ^rsn^w^i o[ Aly's cruelcy, and to preserve us.
For icis cercain, thac as ehe maccer was carried, Abdalla and Mariama had been loft; So.
phronia had been expofed to the violences of Abdelcader; Hipolita to the brunsoncss of
Aly, and che rest of us Co be constrained co dye in desending chem,or noc eo survive their lofs
had not Mariama wroughe as she did.
</p>
<p>But in sine, Aly, being come one morning, as I have cold you, to che Princesses chamber,
and she having used as much address in calking wieh him, as soe had done ac ocher times, aug¬
mented in such fore ehe opinion which he had chac Abdalla was dead, as noc able colec him¬
sels be any longer guided by prudence, he in plain cerras desired che Princess eo tell him whe¬
ther che King were not dead ? because, said he, is ic be so, ic were sie chac ehe assairs of the
Kingdom were speedily provided for.   Mariama, seeing so sair a beginning co her deiign,
did noc answer him buc wich a great sigh, and wichouc saying any ching unco him, (he led
him into Abdalla's chamber.   Now albeic he was already perswaded chac che King waj
dead, yet lesc he not co be mighcily surprized Co see all ehis chamber hung wich black Velvet,
all che windows sliuc, in che midll a great bed of State invironed with a balustrate of Ebony,
set all abouc with slaming Torches, and upon Cusoions near to the Bed, the Mantle Royal,
the Scepter, che Crown, and che Turbanc of aAlbdalla, wich his Scymiear ae ehe teet of the
Bed, whereupon was a large black Cloth trailing a greac way on che ground, which seemed to
cover ehe body of the King; some of his Wives and Slaves were about the Balustrade, who
testisied by their couneenance so sensible a forrow, as would have drawn cears from any other
bue Aly.   The Princess having conduded him chen inco chis charaber of raourning, and per¬
ceiving chae this sad objed had (utsiciencly perswaded hira chac which soe desired he should
beleeve, she began Co shew an excream asslidion, and Co st quest him wieh seigned cears, that
he would perform ehe Kings last Will, in consc ving ehe Crown for his son, according to
the Testamene he had made, whereof he had ehe custody, chough ic was contrary to the Xerijse
Mahomet's intention.  And then, said she unco him, he hach comraanded me eo restore the
Slive Hipolita, and her sellows, Co cheir libercy; inregard iehid seemed uneo him that he
had violated the Law of Naeions in retaining persons in slavery, who by Tempest had been
driven into Marocco.   Buc, concinued slie, generous Aly, ehis last ching imports not much;
nor have I cold ic you, buc ehae! would noc sail in any thing which my King, my brother,
and my Lord, hach given me in charge ac his deach.   For so much as regards ehe Prince his son,

<p>Is Abdalla, answered ^/y insolencly, would have me conserve the Crown for his son, ne
should have lived a longer cime; for ic shall never be reproached unco rae, that 1 have placed
an Insant on the Throne of Marocco. The same Testament, added he, which gave the Crown
to Abdalla, stiall set ic on the head of forae ocher; for in conclusiion, it is for men eo govern

<p>under which he was hidden; tbv persideousntss must be punislied with my hand; saying so,
Ab,\alla\iydho\d on his Scymitar, and all the Guard, which lay concealed for that essed,
rusoing into the chamber, Alj Wis so surprized, and so consounded, as he knew not at sirst
whether it were an apparition, or whether essedively this Prince, whom he had beleeved to
be dead, was living. In so great a trouble Abdalla without doubt had killed hira, is cbe
Princess Mariama, who would noc have him dye by so illustrious an hand, had noe hindred
him; which was che cause, chae ^/y, beingcoraeco hirasels again, and sreeing himsels from
che Guard which would have seized upon him, opened a window when as they were noc a-
ware of ie, and whereas all the houses of ehae Councry, as chey are here, are exceeding low,
he leaped inco the Court-yard, and was so forennaee as he did noc hurc himsels, bue goe shiet
away oue of ehe Palace; leaving Abdalla so amazed and asslided ae his persidiousness, and
Mariama so sacisied wieh che happy success of her design, thae is the displcasure of seeing
Aly escaped had not moderaced her joy, ic would have been eoo violenc.
</p>
<p>Abdalla instandy comraanded him cobe pursued wieh all speed, and alive or dead Co be
brought unto hira: But Aly was already gotcen inco a raans house, whofe lise before eimes he
had saved. For in whac diforder soever his soul was, yet had he judgment enough not co go
to his own horae; imaginingrightly thae he would be soughc for ehere. In che mean eirae,
the sear he had lest ehe King sliould cause che gaees of che City Co be sliue,raade him seek oue all
kinde of inveneions to escape. For albeic ttie plot which he had layd wieh Abdelcader was
ready eo be execuced, yec waneed ic so rauch cime, as he durst not encerprize ie, especially
oue of ehe thoughc he had, chat chey would noc have made use of so cxcraordinary an inven¬
tion to discover his ineentions, without having taken order for all things. He senc word
then secretly to Abdelcader, chac he sliould accempc noching uncil he was in one of the places
of cheir intelligence, to the end they mighc be assiired of a reereac, is their assairs sliould go
iU. Ascer chae, he disguised himsels like a woman; for whereas chey are all vailed in thac
Country, he believed chat getting speedily out of the Cicy, before any exad order was given
at the gates, it would be easie for him to save himsels, as indeed ie sell oue. He ehae served
him in ehis occasion promised to bring him an horse to a place, which was not above a mile
from the Town; zndi^enAly, being disguised in the manner chat I haverelaccd, wene out
of ^4r«;cs&lt;» a very hede before the Guards had been placed ac che Gates, with a Command
to susser no body ro pass ouc upon any precexc whatsoever. In the mean space Abdalla had
sene eo search for Aly in his Palace, and asterward caused ic Co be proclaimed over all the Cicy

<p>thac whofoever could bring ^/y unco him sliould have a recompence able to enrich him for

whereas ehe people arc inconstanc in cheir resolueions, ascer ehey had commieeed an hundred

<p>who taking che same horse which ehe other had made use of before, he went to ore of the
gates to get forth, but hehad the like success as the former; who, willing to hazard all for
Aly, senc a third person thither: which was the cause, that one ofthe Guard, who had more
brain then the rest, perceived, that although three several men bad presented chcmlclves for
to go ouc of che City, yet it had been still with one and the same horse; sothat hecrtainly
believed there was some mystery in this adventure, and how it might well be that /j/rwas
not sar ofs.  This Soldier having imparted his thought to him that commanded the gat., he*
conceived chae his opinion was noc ill grounded ; wherefore, to clear himselt therein' he
made shew of being perswaded by the intreatics of this man who d-sired to be let forth;
buc whil'st to gain time he made yet some new dissiculties, he sent for three horses, to the end
he might sollow him a sar oft'with two of bis compai i:;ns; which were no sooner come, but
having lee him go out, and set them elves to sollow rim, they saw thac contrary to thecustom
c s all such as tear co be sollowed, he went on still without turning his head to rhe place from
whence he parted, so great a desire he had to arrive where the unhappy W/7 waited for him.
Seeing then that they might sollow him without his b-ing aware of it, they approached netn:r
to him, then they would have done is he had behaved himstls ocherwise, and quitting the
high-way as weil as he, when chey came neer eo a wood, whither chis man seemcd tohavea
purpofe to go, they espyed a woman, who having discovered them, hid her sels in the thickcst
of thebuslies. This adion made him,that was carrying the horse to ^/;, turn about his head;
who knowing that he was sollowed, would have tak.n more on the lest hand, and nut have
gone to the place where he was attended • but this trick would not serve his turn; howso¬
ever it was not because thofe which had observed her believed that this woraan was essedive¬
ly y^/y, buc being neer unto ic, ehey would needs know cercainly whac ehis adventure was.
The Captain then, having given order to the two Soldiers to seize on chis man, went to the
place where he had seen che woman hide her scls, and had noe gone sisty paces bue he sound
her ae ehe sooc of a tree; where, keeping down her vail still about her, she besought him, in
counterseiting her voyce, not to do her any violence.   And when soe saw chat this man had
no incenc to use her civilly, and seemed sully resolved eo discover whae soe was, soe would
have cempced ehis Capcain wich che hope of a greac recorapence; so chae suddenly listing up
her vail. Thou seesl, said slie, the infortunate Aly, r^ko can ma^e thee happy is thou bee}
Vpije; for is thou VciU resolve to let me escape, I \VUlput thee in a condition that thou shdt
never need to atk. any thing more of Fortune.   This Captain, who was saichsul, or it may be
did noc believe chae Aly in ehe case he was in could recompence him as much as he said, an¬
swered him, chae he would never enrich himselt byalreaion, and wichouc surther delay he
called his companions, who, having eyed cbe man, on whom ehey had seized, Co a tree, went
to help him co cake the miserable v^/7,who,though without A'ras,lest noc ofs rt sisiing them tor
while.   Buc ac last ehey broughc him co Marocco, and having conduded him before At-
dalla, rhis Prince reviled him wieh all imaginable reproaches.   And whereas Aly had always
been happy, chis one blow of unhappiness so mightily surprized him, as chac judgment and
prudence, which had rendred him so consid-rable in his profpericy, wholly abandoned m
m his missoi tune: so that in stead of seeking to colour his sault, he consessed ic as ic was, ana

<p>But, Madam, to make an end of celling you at once, both the goodness of Mariama, and
our fortune, you stiall understand, that in the consusion wherein all the City of y^.&lt;rofc-o was
this day, when as the Princess Mariama entred into a Chamber where these three sair Slaves
were, and saw them all in tears, especially Hipolita, who knew well that sli;; was in part
cause of all this diforder •, this Princess, Isay, seeing them in this estate, h?.d somuch gene¬
rofity, though soe loved them very tenderly, astodcpriveher stls for ever of them: Itmay
be also, that the design of taking from theKing an objed of paslion, which might trouble
his rest; srora Abdelcader that which had raade him sail in this duty ; and from the Princess
Lela Mahabid another, which mighe raake her in forae fore forgec ehe rank which she held,
carryed her eo this resolution.   But in conclusion, a lictle interest, and a great deal of genero¬
sity, raade her cell thera, that profit was to be made of ochers raisfortune: so that before
the King had leasure co ask for chera, soe caused chera Co be secrecly conveyed eo ehe house ot
a man, who abiolutely dep.^nded on her; and having advercised us Co repair chither, we con¬
tinued concealed there above eight days.   She in like fort caused the Mariners and Soldiers,
which we had brought to Marocco, CO be delivered; for the arabitious Aly being dead, the
Princess Mariama was as powersul in the State as the King himsels
</p>
<p>The day sollowing, Abdalla, seeing the Princess Mariama with a seigned melancholy in
her sace, which yet he believed to be true, demanded of her, whether revenge, which is
said to be one of the greatest pleasures of Kings, did not give her some ? My Lord, said soe
unco him, presenc misforeunes are doubtless more sensible chen past pleasures; ehe lofs ofehe
Slaves which you gave rae, is cause of raore gries eo rae, ehen that ot Aly hath made me seel
joy.   So strange a discourse surprized che King excrearaly; and whereas he desired co be
cleared cherein, ehe Princess Mariama cold him, chae in che consusion wherein all chings were
the day before, whether y^/; had caused chem eo bc carryed away by force, or whecher we
had concribuccd any thing chereunco, so ie was, chac rceurning in the Evening to her lodging,
slie had noe sound chem ehere, neicher could soe poflibly learn any news of ehera.   I will noc
repcae uneo you all thit Abdalla did inthis occasion, although the ?xince(s Mariama ac¬
quainted us with it: But in conclusion, ic sussices you soould know, chac ^^^;?//^ took ehis
adventure as an amorous Prince would do ; and aster he had caused search to be made over all
the Cicy, excepc in ehe place where we were, which by che care of ehe Princess was exempt¬
ed, soe had che goodness Co come secrecly and bid her dear Slaves sarewell, eo whom also slis
gave very rich gists: And the night sollowing, having dispofed of all things for our deparcure,
soe caused us to be imbarqucd in a Mcrchancs Vessel, chac see sail the same nighe; and where-
of ehe Capcain, who was of Palermo, undercook Co carry us whichersoever vve would go

</p>
<p>Now, Madam, before I kive Marocco, 1 am totell you. that che Marquis was not so
glad of ehe hberty which we hoped Co enjoy, as for chae he soould nolongesbe expofed eo

so great a danger; for is I had rarryed longer at Marocco, I wasin jeopardy of changing mv

<p>Roxelana in the mean cime was not wiehoue unquiecness, in knowing by her Spies, chat
Soliman's sriendsoip eo Ibrahim, and ehe resped which he had to Isabella, had kepc
him uncil ehen srora dilcovcring his love plainly co her chae caused ie. For whereas arabicion
was (he only ching ehae raigned in her heare, she raighc well be jealous of the power of Ibra¬
him, buc noe of ehe beauty of//«^?//rs. She knew ehae ehe ^&gt;-^Wr»js&lt;rr would never give
her ehe raeans to ruine hira, nor do any ching against the service of the Grand Signior, were
he not constrained thereunto by forae very sensible outrage. She knew also, chac ScUman
would never disoblige Ibrahim is forae raighcy pasllion did noc force hira ro ic. In sine, ehe
love eo Isabella was chae, which begac a hope in her heare of destroying a man, whom she
did noC hace, bue because he was eoo generous, and chae soe would raign alone. And where¬
as soe saw eliac is//^^^'//^ wene every day oue of the Serraglio, ie mighc come to pass that
Soliman seeing her buc scldom mighc peradvencurc change his mind, soe resolved, for the pre¬
venting chereof, .o complain of ehe liberty soe had, and eo lee ehe SnUan understand, how
the Muphti had advertised her, that the people began already to murraur at ir. There needed
no surther raatter Co oblige Soliman co a ching, which he desired sar more chen slie. Buc
whereas che sear oi iispleasing Isabella was so much che greaeer, as his love was che stronger,
he could noc resolve, noc only Co forbid her srora going forch, buc Co see her chat day wherein
slie soould receive this order; neicher knew he whac person co chuse chac raighc deliver chis

he enjoyned, aster he had extreamly caressed her, so Co order the matter, that Isabella mighc
go hue very seldom ouc of che Serraglio.
</p>
<p>My Lord, said &gt;4/m.« uneo him, haeh thy Highness forgot what chou saidst Co her yestcr¬
day wieh chine own raouth ? No, did the Grand Signior unto hex, and eherefore ic is why
I will noc raake a prohibicion which concravenes che civilities I have used Co her, buc I would

</p>
<p>My Lord, answered tylsieria, aster ehae which ehy Highness haeh said Co Isabella, I doubt
chae my counsel and speeches will be sofpeded of her; and chae stie will give more credic eo

his pleasure: and contrarily, is it be true, that he is in paslion for you, the Iss occasion vou
sliall give him tobe carried to some violence, will be the raoft advantageous and sure. A
Lover in choller (as I conceive) is more to be seared then another; for whereas choller doth"
moft commonly banisli away resped from the Souls of chofe whom ic pofsesscth, onemnll
forbear as long as is poflTible from expofing ones scls to the hazard of angering an amorous
Prince, who being able eo do whatsoever he will,is always in an estace Co beseartd. Youhavo

shall see that I do not visit them any more, and that I abandon them ? Will they not have
cause Co chink, ehae the magnisicences ofthe Serraglio have blinded rae ? andit miy be some¬
thing yec worse.   No, no, said A deria, for we will cause chem Co be advercised of the truth
of the matter, or ac leastwise of che precexc which ehey have raade use of Co retain you here.
Buc, iddtd Isabella, whae end can I foresee of my misery ? The recurn of Ibrahim, replyed
cy^steria, will make ic cease; and he soall no sooner be ac (sonsiantinoph, buc ehe Sultan
will no longer have other chen just desires, and you soall recover your libercy.  Ascer thac
these two vercuous persons had eneertained theraselves a while, chey parced; Asieriaj^ro.

next morning, as indeed she sailed not to do.
</p>
<p>This news strangely surprized all this sair Troop; but whereas the precexc, whereof M-
man mide ase, was noc withouc probabilicy, and that//&lt;»^s//&lt;« by her Letter had rendred it
more likely unto them, Co the end she might keep them from conceiving any thing to her dis-
advancage,they believed it co be as it was represented unto them,withour seeking for any other
explication thereof; comforting themselves in some fort with the hope which//"^^irZ/d gave
them of visiting them sometimes: For to make their separation the easier, though soecould
not hear from Ibrahim as yet, she lest not for all that to assure thera that he would be back
in a lictle space; and so consequently they should ere long be in an estate of going to see their
Country again.
</p>
<p>This hope sailed not to work the essed w hich Isabella expede-,.rora it; all this company
was more jovial and more sociable, and whereas Ibrahim'i Palace was wondersul sair, and
that they were served there by the Grand Signior's order exceeding magnisicently, their exile
no doubt was supportible enough; sometimes they walked in the Garden; sometimes they

not explain your scls becter, answered Leonida, we soall not make up our march;.buc
whereas the entertainment of the company is exceeding dear to me, tell me,what recompence
do you demand? I desire, said he unto her, chae before I relate that unto you which besell
me, you will let us know whae disconcenc ehae was which raade you quie Genoua to go Co
Albengua ; whac moved yon eo marry a man whora you did noc love, and banish one whom
you did noc hace: For Co speak sreely unto you, ic hath been imparted unto me at Genoua in
such a raanner, as gives rae a great deal of curiofity, and makes me desire eo know whecher I
have been told che truth or no. As for me, said Hipolita, I have intended a long cime since
to intreat Leonida soe would acquainc me wieh ie; bue Forcune hach so cruelly persecured us,
as we have scarce had any leasure buc Co seel new miseries, wichouc remerabring thofe which
were already past. Cercainly, added Doria, is I durst joyn my inerearies Co chofe of che
Company, I would request Leonida co grane us ehis savor. For my psrc ,
(aid Sophronia, I have noc che same curiofiey, for I am so sully informed of ehis
History, as I do noC know any ching thac hath hapned to my sels better. Is the company,
said Leonida to her, will needs know it, I stiall make advancage of it is you will take the
pains to relate it unto them; for as for me, I am sully resolved not to expofe my stls a second
time CO ehe vexation which chis relacion hath been che cause of Co me. Do noe reproach my
old error unco me, said Alphonso incerrupcing her; and Co deliver you from this unquietness,
and for sear lest I should sind ray sels too weak Co hear a thing without gries which hath given
me so much, I will go and walk in the Garden, or entertain my sels wich a Book.

<p>Alphonso, aster hehad said this, went without attending L^onida's answer forth ofthe Qs-

<p>»«^^ had continually all the complacency for him, which a vertuous woman was aoib^ ns
And whereas you know thac i^^om^^ haeh naturally a gallanr wit, and a very o^J.^Z'
Ih-otcencimes gave him ehe pleasure to hear her jeer his Rivals in his pnsence, and an ^o- \
times made her Conquests serve for his glory. Alphonso then lived in rhiv,'ore with more
content, then che extream love which he bore her seemed to permit; for, as I have heard it
said, this paslion seldom leaves any greac tranquillity in the Souls of thofe whom it
poflcsseth.
</p>
<p>B\it sox Alphonso, he was che moft generous Lover that ever was; his inclination had not
been blind; all the world approved ot his choyce; he loved an amiable person, and was be
loved ofher ; slic cook care not Co give him any cause of jealousie; his very Rivals serv, d for
his dehghe and selicicy by ehe usage that slie gave chem; his saeher did noc contradid hisas-
sedion; Leonida was of a sree condition, and mighe dispofe of her sds; yea and to keep
him srora being deprived of ehe pleasure of hoping for the passcslion of aperson chat could
render him contented, Lt onida, to assure her sels yet surther of his love, would not (c much
as let him make use of his sriends for the motioning of their marriage. In so happy an estate
methinks it is hard Co imagine whac could crouble his selicicy, especially when llball have
told you, chac Leonida used him still as savorably as before, and wichouc any change arriving
in her, yec ehere arrived a change in him. I well perceive, concinued Sophroma, atccr (lie had
been a while wichouc speaking, thae you cannoc divine whac ic was which croubled Ahhoii.
so's happiness; and cercainly I cannoc chink ic strange, seeing accoiding to my 1= nie this ad¬
venture is so extraordinary, as ic is impoflible Co conjedure ie. You sliall understand then,
thac one day Alphonso being gone to see a kinsman of bis, whereas the person beloved is a part
ofall conversations, and a man insinitely amorous speaks withouc choyce and judgment othis
Mistress Co everyone, became tofpeiV.oi Leonida ctJ his kinsman, chough eo say truth hc
was noc worchy of chac honor j for chis man is boch malicious and blockiso; According
then to his humor and stupidiey he rudely asked of Alphonso, whether he beleeved that he had
been che sirst which ever had been asseded of Leonida ?
</p>
<p>Now whereas Alphonso had been a long cirae in che voyage, srora whence JtisUnim
broughc him back, hc had understood nothing of what had hapned to Leonida, for being sallen
in love with her presently aster his return, no body had been so uncivil as to say any such thing
to him. It was noe, as you sliall know by ehe sequel of ehis History, because ehae which ar¬
rived unco Leonida was noC glorious for her; bue because love is a paslion ebac renders the
spirit so sensible and delicaee, as ie is irapofllible to hear ehae the person whom one loves,
sliould have assedion for another, without some sense of gries. And verily Alphonso tryed
it but Coo well in this occasion; he beleeved at sirst notwithstanding, that this was an essest
ofehe malice ofhis kinsman, who regarding his succession, had perchance a design co do what
hecould for che rendring z:tso«tV&lt;» less amiable: but when as continuing his incivilicy he had
told him, ehae one, mmedOBavio, of ehe House of the Tallavicins, and who was dead
since, had in cimcs past loved her, and chac he had been insinitely loved of her, he did not be¬
leeve ehae chis man durst have cold him chings so precisely, is ehey had noe been crue.
</p>
<p>Atkn^ih Alphonso, having made his visic, recired with some unquietness; nevertheless,
whereas he had noc yec loft his Reason, he did noc sind chat he had any cause eo complain ot
Leonida, sot chae stie had been loved ofO^lavio, or for that soe had loved hira in a time when
as he was not known to her. For, said he, I stiould be unjust eo desire, ehae ehe ^V" of ^^a-
nida sliould noC have begun Co raake Conquests before chey capcivaced rae; and 1 soould be
unrcasonable co desire also chac slie sliould have been absolucely insensible of ehe assedion ot a
man, who ic may be was of more worch chen my seP. Now whereas Love is ingenious to
torment thofe which are under his Empire, Alphonso did noe complain of having a Rival, thac
had noc been haced, bue for chac Leomda had made a secrec ot ic eo him: This unquiecncis was
noc for all chat very strong, buc you soall understand by che sequel of ray discourse, that ic
carried him co another, which puc him to a greac deal of pain.

<p>ixom Alphonso, slie layd her hand over her eyes, and endevoring to change di'course, hewas
thereby perswaded, that th's touched her heart exceeding sensibly; augmented his curiofity;
and made him resolvc to testisie ic co her plainly.
</p>
<p>In pursuance of so precipicons a design, Alphonso,without deserring ehe execucion of ic any
surcber, said unco her, I would sain, sair Leonida, bcassured,thic aster my being dead for your
service, my name soould be so happy as eo make you bluso and sigh, as ehe blessed OUavio's
haeh done. You soould do beecer, answered Leonida sighing a second cime, Co call him in-
soxtxxnueOUavio. Whofoever hath been loved of you, replyed Alphonso, could never be
unhappy, notwithstanding any thing that could arrive to him otherwise. I wiso for all thar,
(i\d Leonida, that younever make tryal of the like sescity : But, continued soe with an al¬
tered countenance, why have yon spoken to rae of Ofs^i^/o.' Let us leave hira to enjoy that
rest which he could never sinde in this lise; let us not trouble ours in troubling his j and let
us, I pray you, have so much regard to him, as to leave his asoes in peace. Please you to par¬
don me, said y^i/&gt;/S)o«/o then unto her, is without lofing the resped which I owe to you, I
dare crave of you, for a raark of your assedion, that you will cake the pains Co rebec exadly
unco rae, thac which Ofs^z/jo in ciraes past bore unco you, that which you bore to bira, and
briesly all that besell you till the tirae of his death; ocherwiscyou will give rae ciusc to cora-
plain of you. Leonida would not at sirst accord to Alphonso that which he desired of her;
for as soe knew how highly her heart had been touched for O^avio, so soe knew likewise
thac ie would be impoflible for her Co remember all chcir selicities, and all iheir misforeunes,
wichouc a greac deal of unquiecness; wherefore soe excused hersels from icas much as she
could; nevercheless seeing ehae Alphonso cook ehis resusal for a wrong, she promised co grant
bim his desire, so ashe would give her some eirae; and in chis fore many days past away,
Alphonso being unable co make her keep her word wich him. Bue ac length, his curiofity be¬
ing grown the stronger by Leonida's resistance, hc testisied unto her one day so seriously, that
he soould hold himsels disobliged by her, is she continued in the resolution which she seem¬
ed to have, as having appointed him a tirae to come to her for that purpofe, soe resolved to
content him. Is one had then demanded of Alphonso why his curiofity was so strong, he
could not have told, at least-wise he hath acknowledged so mut^toLeonidas\nee: For
whereas he was perswaded that soe had loved oElavio, both by that which his Kinsraan had
told him, by that which he had also learned other-where concerning it, and by the marks
which he had seen of ie in her couneenance, is in her speech nevercheless soe had disguised che
truth, thatiying would have given hira a great deal of unquietness j and yec hc selc In his
heare, that is contrarily soe soould avouch unto hira, that soe had loved hira very rauch chis
discourse would not please him. But at last, carryed by a secret raotion, which he could' noC
resist, he went with an extream impatience to the assignation which Leonida had given him
He sound her more sad then ordinary; for whereas her imagination was silled wich displeasl
m^idea's, that charming and jovial ayr, which soehachusuillyin her sace, was somewhat
changed. Aster soe had caused Abhonso to sit down, and had told him, that soe was going
to render him the greatest proof oT her assedion chac he had ever yec received, soe was readv
to impare uneo him whac her fortune had been, when is Alphonso, before he would give
her leasure soco do, conjured her once again noc Co omic any pare of all chat which bad arri
yed unto ber. But he had no need to intreat her thereunto, for Leonida had no sooner began
to speak but forgetting that soe was recounting her History to her Lover, slie sussered her
sels CO be charmed wich her own relation; and soewing gries or joy, according arch mar

<p>nally; that this spring-ng sovc sti dd one day be the cause of his death, and cis rrtsol
ny tears; and withouc dreaming ofany such thing, the pleafore alone of seeing one anoth i
and talking together, took up all our Souls. We knew not as yet for all that added Z
what thofe thoughts were which we had one for the other; neither did we peoive
them, till decency would noc permit us to see one another so often. The privation ot a eood
makes us know the greaeness of it, and the design which we had to conceal our assedion be¬
gan to make me susped that there was something in it more then good-will: I did then all
thar I could to disengage my minde stom a paslion, which I had always heard to be vry dm
gerous; but whereas it was more ancient in me then Reason, Reason was not strmg enouch
to chase it ou: of my Soul; but contrarily it was soe whxh engaged mc surther in it^and ihat
speaking to m-; of OUavio, drew the pidure of the worthiest man that ever was. She told
him moreover thac, which slie selc in her hearr, whenas by any reason of honor, or business,
he was constriined to bc absent from Genoua; the sraall delight soe took in Assemblies whcti
he Wis not there; and how rauch slie enforced her sels to seem merry during his absence. She
acquainted him also, howexad'Ofs&lt;«z'/o wasin sollowing her pleasure in all things; what
care he used to take from her all occasion of suspeding his sidelity; and with what discretion
he still demeaned himsels towards her all che time ot his serving tier.
</p>
<p>But, said Alphonso incerrupcing her, had you never any of thofe petty diforders, which
augment love, rather then dirainish it? No, no, answered Leonida, OHavta re\tx gave me
cause CO complain; besides, our assedion had no need of that artisice to render it the strong¬
er ; since it is certain thac^jever any person loved more persedly ehen we. Alphonso would
sain have assured Leonida, chae he loved her yec beecer ehen OUavio had loved her, but his
minde was so unqu'ee,.as he could scarce speak. And then again, Leonida gave him not lea-.
sure Co do it; for she was soaeeencive in exadly relacing all chac had past beiwi\iOUavio
and her, as she never took heed ofall the several changes which her discourse made in his
sace. She continued chen celling him, chac aseer an indisserenc long love, OElavio, having ob¬
tained permisllion ot her eo demand her of her parents, believed that his happiness was so sure,
ashe had no doubt at all of ic; for whereas his Saeher and hers had always lived as good
sriends cogecher, and cheir forrunes were equal, hecould foresee no imped imene in it. But
he knew noc, said Leonida ehen looking on Alphonso, that a passion less noble then that
which raigned in his heart oppofed his; and that avarice, which is lar raore powersul in the
mindes of old raen, then love is in that of young solks, slbould destroy his and myhopes,and
sliould sinish our love by his death, for to setrie a gries in my soul, which I soall conserve chere
eternally.
</p>
<p>In sequel hereof, Leonida likewise declared to Alphonso, that one named Livio, of the
Samily of theSrigoz.es, a raan very rich in che goods of fortune, but very poor in thofeof
the minde, being touched with her beauty, without any thought of discovcring his assestion
toher, or gBining her savor, went the very same day that he sell in love with ber, and de-..
manded her of her Sather; prescribing him no other conditions, then thac ot giving him his
daughter; and thae this old man, who knew Liviu's wealth, being more mightily touched
wieh ehe love of riches, ehen Livio was with the beauty of Leonida, had promised him to
bestowed her on him, and had engaged his word to him in such fort, as nothing was able- to
make him break it.  So that OElavia arriving an hour alter that Livio was gone, and making
his propofition, he was wondersully surprized to learn srora Leonida's Sather, that he had
promised his daughtar, and thac ie would be in vain for him eo hope he raighc make him
change his resolucion.   Ollavio could noC apprehend, ehae Leonida could be promised to any
one, andsliinocknowof ie; and on che ocher side, si\d Leonida to Alphonso, my sidelity
wasso well known cohira, ashe durst nor doubc of ir.  In so deplorable an estate, con-
tinned slie, he lest ray Sather, and came and sound rae out at an Aunts of mine who ta-
vored our assedion, and where I had appointed him to come and acquaint me with the an¬
swer he stiould receive.  But O Heaven 1 cryed slie, I did noc foresee chac this sencence
sliould be chac of OBavio's deach, and of ehe less of all che selicicy ehae I attended from it
He carae chen, buc with so much melancholy in his sace, as ac sirst I made no doubc buc en

I repenced me for noc believing hira 1 and racher chusing co obey ray Tteher, ehen eo be saich¬
sul CO ray Lover.
</p>
<p>Aster chis cranspore of assedion, soe recounced unto hira all ehe resistance^ she had made a-
gainst her Parencs pleasure; her griesand despair, whenas soe saw ehae neicher her prayers,
her rears, nor her reasons could avail; the pain soe was in not to grant OBavia the permission
to steal her away, or to rid himsds ofhis Rival; and fora conclusion, soe acquainted him,
how the tyranny of her Sather, and the consideration of her honor, having forced her to a-
bandon OUavio, Co raarry Livio, soe saw her sels in so deplorable an estate, as that which
would have made up the bicterest gries of another, was her onely consolation. For, said she
to Alphonso, I had no other in ehis encouncer, ehen Co know chae I raarrycd a raan whora I
could never love, no noc is cime soould cure rae of che passion I was in.   Ie was noc because
I was noe resolved for my own glory Co live well wichhim, buc because I had ac least-wise
this consolacion, ehae OUavio could noc susped me of insidelity ; yea and I hop d coo, chat
the more petviso Livio soould be in his humor, and che more cankered and unpleasing he
soould be, che more he would soorten my days.   Judg chen, said she unco him, is these
were the raoft agreeable thoughts that I had, what che rest were.    .
</p>
<p>Buc in ehe end, said Alphonjo unto her,'you raarryed Livia? %es, inswered Leonida
wich cears; and the infortunate OEiavie, unable to resolve to see me in the pofsession of an¬
other, departed from Genoua to go and seek for the death which he sound soon aster. For
although I had done an hundred things beyond what was sitting, to oppofe my sels against my
Sathers will, yet he believed with reason, notwithstanding he knew thac I loved noching but
him, chae seeing I could noe bc marryed wichouc mine own consenc, I soould never have
granted ic, and chae I soould rather have resolved Co dye, chen abandon him. In so reason¬
able a chought, despair seizing on his soul, he went to the Emperors Army, and arrived
there so unluckily, both for hirasels, and for rae, and so opportunely for the design'which he
had, ehae ehe nexe day there was abaeeel soughc; buc before he enered incoic, he desired Co
kc me understand, chac hc wenc noe so rauch eo expofe his lise for ehe Emperor, as for che lova
of me. In saying so, Leonida lee him see ehe Leccer which OUavio had wriccen unCo her j
and whereas I have sound ic excrearaly moving, and ehae icisnoclong, I think is I do not
remember the words precisely, I soall meet with at least-wise the true sence of ic.

<p>Leonida, having sinislied her relation, and wiped her eyes, thanked Alphonjo for the sad¬
ness which appeared in his countenance; imagining chat it was an essed of the compassion he
cook ot her past misfortunes. But soe knew not, that che same which soe believed to be a sense
of pity, was one of the moft violent jealousics thac ever an amorous spirit was tormented
With. For he so strongly perswaded himsels that Leomda could noe have the same appre¬
hensions for him, which slic had had for oaavio, as he went away from her, with an as¬
slidion che like whereof was never seen; yet he lesc her wichout giving her any notice there¬
of: but when he was come home, and had sout himselt up alone in his Chamber, he ran over
all thar, word tor word, which Zs(Si«/^.« had told him, for ehey had made so powersul an
impression in his Soul, as I think there escaped noc so much as one ouc of his memory. The
more he considered the maccer, ehe more was he consirmed in his jcalousie. Hc remenibrcd,
thac she had loved 0&lt;57^'://&lt;7, outof sympaehy, ouc of acknowledgmene, and ouc of reason;
that cheir assedion began from their insancy, and continued all their lise. Now, said he to
himsels, OElavio is not dead in the heart of Leonida, he lives there still in despite of me, and
in such a manner as I cannot chase him from chence. He is noc onely dead Co keep mc stom
being revenged of him, buc he is also dead co raign eeernally in her soul. For, added hc,
quice cransported wich grieS, infortunace Alphonso, Leonida loves chee noc neicher buc for the
love of him; chou knowest it stom her own mouth, and thou canst not doubt of thy unhap-
piness. Ah how wretched I am, continued he, and how imprudent have I been in laboring
mine own ruine my sels 1 is I had not been curious, I had been the happiest of men, and I
have rendred my sels the raoft infortunate that ever was. Thae which I have seen, that
which I have heard; the cears of Leonida, her sighs, her speeches, and the marks of love
and cenderness, which she hath rendred to the memory of OElavio, have not onely destroyed
my present pleasures, and all thofe which I hoped for, but also my pleasures past. I no longer
marvel, continued he, is Z.soW&lt;&lt; iil-intreats my Rivals, it is for the asoes of O^-J^"* that
she hath this resped and this sidelity, and noc forme. O b\e^ed OElavio, cryed he, how
worthy of envy is chy sate, and how unhappy is mine 1 This santastical jealousie got such
deep rooting in his heare, as he loft all ress, and almoft hs Reason. He wisoed somecimes
thac OElavio were still living, Co ehe end he might be revenged of him; and by and by aster
in another quite concrary thought he considered, thae is he had been living Leonida had never
loved him, and in chis manner he was in forae fore glad chae he was dead. Foraecimcs lil^e-
wise, he comforced himsels for ehae Leonida had noc loved OElavio so much as to marry him
against the will of her Parents; but then when be came to remeraber che last mirks of as¬
sedion which Leonida hid received from Octavio, and whac resentment soe had testisicd tor
ic in relating it to him, he entred into despair again. What can I do, said he, that can ever
perswade her that I love her as well as Octavio ? When I soall tell her, that soe raigns in my
heart; ehae her will may dispofe of mine; chac slie is absoluee Mistress of my soul; and m
conclusion, that I live noc bue for her alone; wieh one onely word, soe will see Octavioi-
boveallchatl have said; for celling me thac he dyed co eestisie his assedion co her, isco telJ
me, chac he hath incomparably done more then I; chat he raigns always in her minde; and
that I can never precend to the sirst place.                                                          .u,„„s.
</p>
<p>Ofall the chonghts that i^i^ed Alphonso,tha ofhis not being loved hy Leomda but became
he had some conformity with 0^?-«^'»9. was the moft inhumane; and the opinion which k
had, chac since chis was che cause of his Mistresses assedion, soe could noe eherefore see iir.

<p>cransporcs; and demanding of himstls whit he desired of Leonida in this occasion ? he knew
not very well what he would have; but chese good intervals lasted so lietle a while,as icmighc
have been laid thac he had no rest ac all. Ir 1 had a Rival, sa d hc sometimes, I stiould spend a
pare ofmy an^u so in seeking occasion ro hurc him, and co set him ac odds wieh her I loved,
and whom he soould love; I soould observe cheir adions, and knowing chem, I soould make
use ot them, t icher Co crouble cheir dcsigns, or to advance mine, or co cure me of my passion.
Buc as the case stands, I have a stcret Rival inthe heart of Leonida, whom slie entertains, I
not knowing, nor being able to hinder it: She weeps, soe sighs, even as soe is talking with
me, for this blessed Phantofm, which soe loves still, and ever will love, since he is no longer
in a condition tobe able to do any thing that can displease her. As for me, said he, I am in sar
other terms; for I can easily displease her, and I cannot be agreeable unto her, but because I
reserable OElavio. Who ever saw, continued he, such another thing ? I am jealous, and yec
I have no Rival; I am beloved, and yec I am noe happy; and chrough an excravagancy of my
destiny, or ofmy huraor, I soall never be; \et Leonida do whit she wiW, icis irapofsible chac
ever I should be so. For say I soould raarry her, ie would always run in my mind, thac is by
a miracle OElavio could rise again, soe would abandon rae for hira : Yea and I beleeve, added
he, that is soe could buy his lise with my death, soe would content unto it wieh joy.
</p>
<p>This deadly ehonghe seized so strongly on Alphonso's hearr, as ehere were cercain moraencs
in which he had as much hatred for Leonida, as he was capable of. For whereas ehis extra¬
ordinary jealousie agitaced all his passions, and principally hace atid anger, noc sinding a nearer
objed co employ them upon, he had for her no doubc very disserent choughcs^ and wholly
rtplen socd wich violence. Love remained nevercheless stiU vidorious over all ehe rest, orco
speak more rightly, all thofe several passions were but esseds of thae same.
</p>
<p>But in the end, aster Alphonso had spent forae days in the entertainraent of his anguisli of
raind, without seeing Leonida, che excreara love which he bore her, carried hira eo her
whecher he would or no. He haeh cold her since, ehae being gone ouc of his lodging, wieh
an incenc Co walk in forae place ouC ofehe way, chae he mighe muse by himsels beceer chen at
home, and exadly run over all the savors which Leonida had conserred on him, to the end
he might compare thera.with thofe which OElavio had received srora her; he acquainted her,
Isay, that against his purpofe, and without being aware of it, his steps conduded him to her
door, where he ni sooner was, but without coniulting whit he was co do, hc knocked chere,
and understanding that Leonida was wichin, he wene up diredly co her charaber wichouc ad-
vercising her of ic, though ie was noC his custom so eo do; for Leonida seldora ever saw him
ac htr houle, when soe was alone ehere; bu: at chis time Alphonso was noc in a case regulatly
to observe good manners. When as Leomda sirst saw him, slie received him somewhat cold¬
ly ; tor whereas he had been a good while without sending to her, or enquiring aster tier, stie
thought it was buc just to use him so.
</p>
<p>hskox Alphonso, how difordered soever his mind was, yet durst he not make stiew at the
beginning ot chat which he had in his heart; for resped and Reason had so much power over
him, as he could not resolve to discover his sofscring to a person who caused ir, until he stiould
be extream ypressd thereunto by her. Aster Leonida bad received him somewhat coldly,
arid had obierved the change which jealousie had made in Alphonso\ sace, the anger wherein
stie was in for his neglcd turned into unquiemess. She was asraid lest some misliap had be¬
sallen hini; or through some adventure, which was unknown to her, Alphonso stiould accuse

<p>I do not think, answered yi//&gt;Ao»/i, with as much inguisti, as Z»(j»i^^ had gallantry that
It IS as easie for you to restore tranqu llity unto my Soul, as it was easie for you to deprive me
ofit: for, continued he, I have no Rivals, whom you can ill intreat, and yet I am ehe moft
jealous chac ever was. I donor understand you. si\d Leonida tohim wich more coldness
chen before; and is you do noc explain your sels becter, I soall bcleeve that either you have
loft your Reason, or chac vvich a premedieaccd design you purpofe eo break oft with me:
Buc cake heed Alphonso, of leaving me long in ehis suspicion, for sear lest, whereas I am
proud and disdainsul, I do not prevenc you, and it be too lace for you chtn co have recoursc
to my goodness.
</p>
<p>Alphonso, surprized boch wieh Leonida's discourse, and the manner wherewich soe spake,
resolved at lengch sreely to tell her the cause of his gries. I know very well, said he unto her,
that I am going to speak in vain for my sels, and indeed it is rather out of despair then Reason
that I am carried to obey you. Know then, continued hc, that I am jealous, and that I (bill
be so eternally, since the Rival that surmounts me in your heare can never dye; for eo conceal
the truth from you no longer, the bXt^tdO^avio is eheobjedof my jealousie. The tears
which you slied for his memory are the cause of thofe which I ihall pour forch all my lise time;
the sighs which you setch for him,sl:iall always make me sigh;and his past selicicy soall b^et the
misery of all che rest of my days. You have loved him so much,coneinued he,and yon love him
somuch still,ehat I can sind no place in your Soul: Hc must raign there alone,for indeed you do
not susser me there but only eo conserve the memory ofhim the better. Ah cruel man! cryed
Leonida hearing him speak in this fort, ts it pofilible that you have the inhumanity to open the
Tomb of OElavio to persecute mc ? and in stead of weeping with rae, or at leastwise of be¬
moaning and comforting ms, you are so audacious as to give ms marks of your hatred to a
person, whom I have so much loved, and whofe raeraory is still so dear unto me; and yet in
gratesul as you are,said slie to him, you owe ehe asstdion which I bear you to that Httle resem¬
blance yon have with OElavio; bue as this inforcunace creacnre hath been the cause of ie, ^o
sliall he likewise give an end co ic: for in regard of ehae which you have said eo me, I ordain
younever to speak co me,and never to see mc more. Why do noe you soue your scls up then
in OEiavio's Tomb, answered Alphonso,svnoe you can love none bue him ? Reply no sureher to
me, inhumane thae you are,said slie to him, and take from my sighc ehe petsecutor of Leonida,
and the enemy of OUavio.
</p>
<p>Alphonso seeing Leonida in such choller, and not able to give her a good reason, either tor
the maintainir^ of his error, or for che obtaining of his pardon, went away more jealous then
before. Alas, said he to himsels, how sensible slie is on that side I what a powersul mark tl
her love is her choller I isslie had loved me, slie would have used rae aster another manner;
slie would have caken pity of my weakness; slie would have given rae some new proof ot
her assedion; but slie could not disguise her heart; all her thoughts have been soxOaavio,
and all her words have been against mc. In this opinion Alphonso got him home, with an
intent to obey Leonida exadly, and never to see her again. As indeed he canne no more at her,
and thac hc mighc avoyd meeting with her any where, he seigned himsels ('ck. /.s&lt;)^/rs^, ic¬

savor CO complain ofhim by a L'ceer.   Her departure did noC cure Alphonso ofhis sr&lt; nsie, but
concrarily ic augmenced it; for he bdeeved chac Leonida did noc abandon Genoua, bue co be¬
wail OEiavio with ehe more libcrey.   This thought for all that was noc the moft powersul in
his heare; the impofsibilicy of seeing Leonida, redoubled his desire of ic, and lovc being
stronger still chen jealousie, he pui pofed an hundred draes to go to Albengua, Co cast him¬
sels at Leonida's seet; to crave her pardon; and to obtain an oblivion of his sault of her.
But no sooner did che Phantofm of OElavio presenc ic scls eo his imiginacion, no sooner did see
all the tears and sighs of Leonida to remembrance, buc he re-encred inco his former suries.
He made an hundred irapoflible wislies, which destroyed one anocher, and led a very irksom
and melancholick lise.   Daring thae time he wroee divers Leccers Co Leonida, according co
the divers thoughts wherein he was; buc when as soe perceived so great an inequalicy in his
mind, and such marks of an unseded Reason, soe returned no answer chereunco; and alchough
slie loved Alphonso so much, as Co be excrearaly grieved Co lofe him, yec could she noe iraagine
how stie might cure hira ofthis saneasie: soehae sinding no expcdienc for ic, and being very
much incensed against hira, soe lived wich so much anguiso, thais Alphonso hidV.nowx\het
moft secret thoughcs, he would have been healed of his jealousie, and would have been assured
thac slbe did noc grieve more for the deach of C&gt;&lt;??4v/ss, then for che lofs of his assedion.    Ic
was in ehis fore then that Leonida and Alphonso lived until thae inforcunace day, wherein we
were constrained eo forsake Genoua.   And I make no doubc bue ehae Alphenjo's despair In¬
duced hira Co sollow us, as well as the generoficy which he cestisied co us in this occasion, in
not abandoning us in che forrow we were in, since he absented hirasels from a place where
Leonida was not.  You know in like manner, whac that Terapest was, which luckily for him
drove us to tAlbengua; neicher are you ignorane how che corapassion and generoficy of Leo¬
nida obMged her coimbarquc her scls wieh us: Bue doubdess you do noc know, whit A I*
shonso's and het choughcs were, when as,ascer chey had had che goodness co lament our mis-
screunes, chey had che leasure co think of the cerms wherein ehey stood.  For whereas we had
scarcely been upon ehe Sea wichouc a Tempest, wichouc sear of deach, and wichouc extream
forrow for the lofs we sustained there, they had never talked together in privace during this
troublesom Navigaeion; buc when we were ae Marocco, and ae chofe eimes, wherein we had
the libercy eo see and speak eo one another, Leonida, who desired co conceal die cerms where¬
in soe was wieh Alphonso, eneercaining him wieh indisserent things, sound that his under¬
standing was as deeply wounded at Morocco, as it had been at Genoua, with this disserence
nevertheless, thac ac the sirst time he spake to her he moved her eo anger, and the second cime
he moved her to pity.   What is the reason, said he to her wieh cears, ehae I can neicher con¬
tinue loving you, Bor begin co hace you ? and wherefore, since you are capable of some assec¬
tion for rae, must I noe only soarc it with another, but I must owe ic wholly co him &gt; and
wichout being able, either eo change my passion, or revenge my sels, I must erernallv be che
moft wretched of raen.                                                                                          '

But Ofl^wo IS no longer in being, said Leonida to hira sighing. Yet he is still in your Soul*

No, no, Leonida, said he unCo her, thae which I susser is wichouc remedy; one may some!
times make presenc misliaps cease, and decline thofe which may happen unto us in time to
come, but when wc are unhappy by the remembrance of ehae which is past, death alone can

XoVingoi Octavio more chen/^/p^ow/o,-wherefore marvel noe is ic be not in your power to
cure my mind ofthe jealousie thac pofsesscth it.
</p>
<p>It was much aster thig fore that che sirst conveisaeion ended, which Leonida and Alplmso
had Cogecher ae^ Marocco. Buc whereas Leonida asseded him, and saw the estate whereunto
this santastical jealousie reduced hitn, she opened h r heart to me, and having asked my advice
what slie should do, I counselled her, I think, as slie desired to be, and as indeed was just.
I cold ber chen, chac slie was eo do all that soe could to set his heart at rest I that thiscapn.
chiousncss proceeding raeerly from an excess oflove, she was to pardon so bad an tsscs, since
ic came from so noble a cause, and labor Co restore his Reason to him, which soe bad deprived
him of. I agree wieh) ou, said soe uneo me, thae Alphonso is eo be eased, but in what man¬
ner do you think I may do ic I* is he were jealous of theSrench Marquiss, of Doria, or of
any ocher, ic would noc be ditsicule for me to satissie him. The coldness which I would (hew
to them, should soon see him ae rest; and is ehere were no ocher raeans for ir, I would de¬
prive my sels absolutely of cheir company co preserve ic; bue as ehe case stands I know no
remedy for ie. Ie is from my sels thac Alphottjo hach learnc the assedion which I have born
to OElavio, I cannoc unsay ic; and is I sliould be so base as Co swear co him chac I have noe
loved him so much as he imagines, I sliould cell a lye to no purpofe; it being very certain that
he would give mare credic to my tears, then to my latter speeches; and then again, that is
a ching I could never do. Counsel me chen, continued she, how I soall carry my sels. I
profess unco you, that I was chen very much perplexed whac counsel co give her, for 1 saw
no assured means chac could cure Alphonso.- Nevercheless aster I had mused a little, my opi¬
nion was, thac the only thing which slie could do was, eo endeavor eo perswade Alphonst,
thae she loved him as much as sli; hid loved Octavio, as indeed, I chink I did not oblige her
to tell an untruth.
</p>
<p>At sirst Leonida told me that this would serve to no purpofe, bue sinding nothing to (land
with more reason, slie resolved eo sollow my advice: So chac the sirst time soe could speak
with Alphonso in private, his melancholy still increasing, soe demanded of hira, whether be
were resolved to live long in that manner ? Truly no, answered he, tor I do not doubt, bnc
from the mi'ery which I seel, deach will come stiortly and deliver me. Is it not pofsible, sud
slie, thac Alphonso (hould make use of his Reason in this encounter ? I perceive very wtll,
answered he,that you have some pity ofthe hurt you have done me,bnt know ;hat it is not that
which I desire;in the estate wherein OElavio is I could endure that you soould havecnmpassicjij

<p>in divers occasions; you have many times bewailed his absence as much, as I could pretend to
be lamented by you, is I had loft mv lise in your servics, and for my last unhappiness he dyed
in speaking to you of Inve. It raay be, is hr had lived lonj^er, you would have repented the
tears, which now you sofd tor him; buc as che case stands, ciureis a sh\dow of OElavio te-
maining, which is in stead of his person to you, chac pofsesses your soul, and will not susser
you CO have such thoughts for another.
</p>
<p>How unjust you are, {i\d Leonidauntofim, to speak to rae thus 1 howsoever, since I am
resolved ro try whether I can draw your rainde out of that diforder, whereunto this strange
jealousie bath carryed it, proraise rae, that it by my discourse I can let you see, that you
have received more testiraonies of ray assedion, then I have given to the infortunace Octavio,
you will then repent you of your error, restore tranquillity to your soul, and leave raine in
rest. Alphonso, aster he had withstood it a while, in saying that soe propounded an irapof¬
sible thing to hira, and by consequence he wasnot to answer unto it, resolved for all thac Co
hear her, and promised her ehae it soe kept her word with hira, he would crave pardon for
his sault, and would live better for che sucore. Aseer ehey had raade ehis agreemene j cell me,
Alphonso, said soe unto hira, is I can raake ie appear eo you, ehae since ehe day wherein I
permicced you to serve me, you never have had occasion co complain of me; and is lean
soew you, ebac ehe unhappy Octavio, is he were living, mighc wich justice accuse mc of
lietle assedion; would you noe have reason ehen cobe contented? Thae will not be enough,
answcrcd Alphonso, for it may be that you have never given me just cause to complain, and
that you have given Of?&lt;ix'io occasion soto do, and yet forall that I cannot be happy: Buc
that which 1 desire is, you would let me know, that you have not done any ching for Octa¬
vio, which you would noc have done for me, and chac I chink will noe be easie for you co
perform.
</p>
<p>I will peradventure soew you yec raore, xepXyed Leonida, and Co begin Co cure you, is ie
not true, Alphonso, that che original of che assedion which I bear Co yoa, is sar raore advan¬
tageous CO you, chen ehae which I have born Octavio ? when I began eo wisli him well, con¬
tinued soe, I was in an age, wherein perchance chac which I chen called love, was none-
wherein I counted for great services petty things, which now I sliould not regard; and
wherein I aded without knowledg, and without judgment. I, said Alphonso interrupting
sier, but not without inclination, which is that which renders assedions the stronger and more
durable. I agree with you therein,said soe untohim,but howsoever I had this indinaeion in an
age, wherein ac h'st ray reason did noe corabae with ir, for I had none at thae cirae. Thac is
the cause, said Alphonso why ie is so well secled in your soul. And chac is che cause, replyed
Leomda, why I do not know whether it were any whit strong, since I did not raake resist¬
ance against it. Butasforyou////&gt;/:;.«/o, when as you began to please me, and thac ravin.

condition to oppofe it scls against it; as indeed, ic did resist ie as rauch as ic could. You had
eo vanquiso ,n my heart notonely that wisdora and that modesty, which permits not a wo¬
man to engage her sels l.ghdv tn assedion to a raan ; buc had also che meraory of OaavTotl

that vvas pleasing in me: and by this reason, ic was almoft impofsible for rae not to have ad^-
mitced of his assedion: But for yours, I accepted of ic in soch a manner, as would not per¬
mit you to doubt of mine, is you be reasonable. And to pass from the beginning to the
progress of it, tell me, I pray you, what is chat I have done for him as long as he lived.' All
things, answered Alphonso; and whereas raore marks of assedion are given by gries, then
by joy, wichout running over all the complacencies which you have had for him, I will only
say thae you h.ve wept an hundred times for him, and ehae all ehe love which I have bom you
hath noc coft you a cear,
</p>
<p>Ic IS not time yet to discover my weakness unto you, replyed Leonida; and to answer pre¬
cisely to thae which you say, as long as we lived well together, it is true that I have not wept,
buc it was because you were not unhappy; aud I doubc noc but is our assedion had been
chwarted a? Octavio's and mine was, I should have had the sarae forrow.   And then again
you have this advancage over that infortunate man, that I have not forsake n you, as I did him;
for indeed is I had known how to love persedly, I had not raarryed Livio, I had not aban¬
doned Octavio, I had not been the cause of his death.   Therefore it is, answered Alphonso,
that to repair that sailing, in not \ofingOctavio enough, you love his asoes and his Tomb j
you cannoc speak of hira wichouc cears; you cannoc tsiink of hira without sighing; and it
may be is I sliould lofe my lise, I soould not give you a minute of unquietness. Ah crutl

are, said (he unto him, I will resolve co do ic, coche end I may cure your rainde, or haveso

slie unto him, thae I have wepc for Octavio; buc ic is erue eoo, chac spite of che gries, which
your capricious humor hath pofsessed rae with, I can assure you, not onely that I soould dye
with asslidion, is your death stiould happen, but that I cannot call that a lise which! have
led since thus unjust passion hath troubled my rest in eroubling yours. In sine, Alphonso, I
have shed as many cears for che sear alone of lofing vour good-will, chough you were saulty
towards me, as ever I sticd for Octavio, who dytd lor my sake; so that is I ara unjust, it is
onely to him, and no way eo you.  Ie is erue, ehae he hach rendred me all the testimonies of
assedion that I could attend sro.m him ; but ic is crue also, that I have not done the same; I a-
bandoned him to marry Livio, and I have been capable of a second love, which wichout
doubc must be stronger chen ehe ocher was, because ie haeh been able eo comforc rae for the
lofs I had sustained : For you, Alphonso, ie is noc so ; you have no occasion co complain of
me, I have done for you all chac reasonably I could do; and whenl gave you a mark of my

to you.
</p>
<p>The Marquis seeing ehae Sophronia hdd her peace, and chaC Leonida was going Co speak,
as is soe would have excused Alphonso: Iemust be acknowledged, said he, thac there is a
marvelous diversicy amongst men; and thatwhich makes rae moft to wonder, is eo see by
example, ehae Alphonjo, who in all ocher cncouncers haeh a greac deal of wic and discrecion,
and would in indisserenc raaccers wichouc doubc chink che same things chac I do, should sall
inco an iraagination so sar distant from all good sence. I think, answered Leonida smiling,
thac in raatter of love, it raay be said that you are both of you an objed of adrairation and
wonder the one to che ocher, hue wieh chis glorious disserence for Alphonjl, chac his san¬
tastical jealousie was noe derived bue from an excess of passion; and chac your inconstancy
proceeds noe bue from a desed of love.
</p>
<p>Is che very excess of Reason, replyed ehe Marquis, comes near to solly, I bdieve chat ehis
excess of love IS noe sar from ie: and is ie be crue, chac byeheesl^cds one may judg of che
cause, acknowledg, siix Leonida, chae this inconstancy, which you call desed ot love in me
gave you noc so much unquiecness, when I abandoned you for anocher, as chis excess of pas¬
sion haeh been che cause of to you; and consess withall at least, that icwerebeccee cobe
loved of a man of my humor, then of chat of Alphonso. It would be more advantageous,
replyed z;««,^4 very roundly, because as long as one soould not beloVed hue by an incon¬
stanc man « you are. one soould noc be expofed eo ehe hazard of too rauch engaging

<p>I consess, said Sophronia laughing, as well as the rest of the Assembly, that in this ncr.si.n
I am of the Marquis his side, for / cannot but sollow Reason wheresoever / meet with it   /

ed the Marquis, to go and setch him my sels; and saying so, he went and called l^M,„r/
Who was almoft sstiamed to corae unto che Company again, making no queslion but tliat tbej

untohim, as long as/am on your side, yoUwill haveno Enemies which you may'not over

and thatby this means/ should bcthe ciuse of condemning a vertue in you, which makes
one to be commended in all che world besides.
</p>
<p>Is we engage our selves in making of'Corapleraents, said Sophronia interruprit^ bim, the

chac he cannoc cell us any thing but whac will delighc us. I do not know, answered tbc Mar¬
quis, whether this discourse be advantageous co rae or no, howsoever, since I have promistd

<p>Seeing it is so, did Leonida, haste you to satissie J'epArowia, in sacissying your sels, and be
not of the number of thofe, who make one hope so long for an indisserent pleasiire, as one

</p>
<p>The History ofthe coo gooi Slave.
</p>
<p>N Ever was any so happy in servitude as I, and never did happiness produce an essed like
unco chae which lam going eo recounc unco you. You remember wichouc doubr,
that when we arrived all at ConstantinopU, and landed at the Port, there was a man, who
lightly imagining by the chains we had on us, rhat we were destined tobe sold, and sinding
foraething in my person chat pleased him, bought me for the price chae was demanded of
him. This raan, who was ray sirst Master, carried rae horae to his house; and whereas he
was one of the raightiest men in Con (I ant inopU, Iwas comforted in my raisfortune tofee,
thac ae leastwise is I were a Slave, it sliould be in a place where I soould have corapanions.
I was no sooner come thither, but to testisie that he had some indination for me, he caused
the chains that I had on me to be taken ofs, to give me lighter; so that desiring to be ac¬
knowledging for this savor, and render my slavery also raore easie, by raaking ray scls be be¬
loved of thote, who raight ill-intreat rae, I becarae in ewo hours ehe best Slave that was in
Consiantinople. I did not only that which was ordained mc, but I also helped others Co do
that which had been commanded them. Andwhereas it is the custom of theTurkj, as I
learned ascerwards, caresully to observe all their new Slaves at their sirst coming, my Master
was a witness of all the services which I rendred him, and seemed Co be so sacissied with m/,
that all the other Slaves began already Co hate me.
</p>
<p>The sirst day being past over in this fort, che next morning my Master would needs have
two wives thac he had CO see rae; he coraraanded then that 1 soould go to their lodging, and
whereas I knew noc whither they led rae, I was so surprized with their beauty, as I could
not forbear testisying a great deal of joy by ray carriage at it. I sound them so much the
sairer, because for sour and twenty hours before I had seen none buc black Slaves; I sabted
them then very civilly, and beheld them at leastwise with as rauch aeceotion, as ehey had in
considering rae: and wichouc regarding whecher ray Master cook ic well or no, and wichouc
remembring chad was a Slave, I choughc of nothing buc of raaking soew with low obcy-
sances, as ofcen as I could judg by their behavior that they spoke of rae, chae I was as re-
spedsul for chem, as I was serviceable and diligene for cheir husband. Bue ae lengch h^ com¬
manded rae Co wichdraw, which presently I did; erue indeed ie is, ehae ie was noc wichout
turning back my look to the place where I lesc cwo sair women, and Cruly I selc some pain in
separacing my selsfrom th!m.
</p>
<p>I was no sooner gone down, and had done something which had been enjoyncd me, but
I went with all speed into a back Courr, upon which the windows ofthese womens chamber
opened, out ot a hope that I might peradventure see them again : But by ill fortune ray Ma¬
ster was there as well as they; so as having observed that I had nothing to do ehere, I cannot
etllyou whecher he suspeded the truth or no, howsoever without having any cause Co com¬
plain of me, he commanded me to be conduded the next morning to che Markec where
Slaves are sold, and that there they soould rid themselves of me at any price whatsojver. I
nust consess to you that this change forprized rae; nevertheless whereas I comforc my scls
eMy, as you know, in all things, I resolved for patience.
</p>
<p>He that next bought me was a Merchant oiTripoli, whom I served as exadly as the ocher:
And whereas in these kind of houses the restraint is not so great, as in thofe of persons of qua¬
lity. I had some content to see that in serving my Mister, I soould at leastwise have ehe sa¬
tissadion to raeec sometimes witha wise thac he had, andtwoGrs^ Slaves that served her,
and that certainly did not soime their Nation. I got their good-will che very sirst day, with¬
out being able to tell you how I d^d ic. Is they saw that I hid a purpofe to go forth, they
went in all haste to open me the door; is I carried anything, they presently ofsered co help
rae; in condusion I won theit inclination in soch fore, as my Mister hated me for it. For
when he was withdrawn to his chamber, his Wise and the Slaves praised rae so rauch, as out
ot jealousie and covetouinels he resolved to be rid ofme. He seared lest his wise would love
mc too wdl, and that his Slaves would agree together with me to rob him
</p>
<p>In this thought, he conduded m.'himlUs tothe Market; buc whereas he was known to

<p>In this opinion no body bought me the sirst day, nor on the scond neither. Howbeit mi;
Master, having observed that his Wise and Slaves were very gbd tofee me brouRbthome
again, he purpofed to part wieh me for less ehen he had incended. hoping ehereby to be the
sooner nd of me. Bur I.e considered nor, that ouc of ehe opinion tbe world had of him the
less he sliould ask tor me, che more he would be croubled to sell me. And verily there was ne.
ver any pleasantcr thing, then th^ choller of this covetous wretch when as he could noe resolve
to lofo his money, and was constrained in the evening to carry back to his house a man, whom
he beheld as his Rival, and yec had no cause to complain of him. For whereas I was noc
Ignorane, thac Slaves in this Country are at cheir Mssters mercy, the starof some crofs ad.
venture made me very prudent, so chac as long as my Master could see me I did noe answer
che complacencies of his Slaves. Wherefore noc being able either to sdl me, to complain of
me, or to resolve so give me my liberty, because he would noe lofe bue a parr of rhe
money he had given for me, he was in an unquietness which I im noe able co represent unto
you.
</p>
<p>Bue ae last on che third day a Boluchbajsi, who had cheapened me when sitst he would have
sold me, and who imagined that I could have no other desed ehen of being uofaithsul,
tempted by ehe good peni worch, resolved to take mc into his service. And to securc himsds
from the vice whereof be suspeded me, he purpofed to employ me in his Garden, untill such
time as he had made tryal of my siddicy. I was then conduded home Co his house, where I
no sooner was, bue having given me wherewich to labor the ground I sound mysclsatsiist
somewhat troubled. Nevertheless whereas I had whil'st I was in the Wars helped many
timesoutof a bravery Co ast up Trenches, and raise Fores, I became in cwo hours so good
a Gardiner, as I levelled an Alley betcer then all they of Conslantinople could have
done.
</p>
<p>My address having pleased my Mister, he broughc three Wives thae he had, sollowed by
all cheir Slaves, Co see my work, which ehey admired; and passing from tbe commendation
ofmy work Co chat of my person, chey said eoo much for ei.emsclves, is ehey took any plea¬
sure in seeing me. Nevertheless ic was noc chac alone which made me change my dwelling,
buc ic was for chac, my Master being gone a lictle way ofs, and ehae I saw all ehese women
walking still abouc me, wichouc making shew of heeding chem, and as is ie had been eo ren¬
der my labor ehe less iiksom, I see my sels Co sing indisserenc loud. My voyce pleased them
in such forr, as I thoughc chey would never hive lest me; and when I perceived che satiisac-

sailed not in the expeded success, as also ic sailed noc in making rae eo be turned away. For 1

ver heard of In sine, this mutmuring and this revolt went so sar, that this man to be at rest
resolved to sell me away, which he did the next day witha great deal of rsgcec, becanse I
pleased him excrearaly.
</p>
<p>Itwas my destiny to be bought by an/^r«?^/^«Physidan; for whereas he had asked co
whac eraployraent I had been put in ray Masters hou'"e, and bad been answered that I was an
excellent Gardiner, be iraagined that I knew some Simples, and consequently might be nse¬
sul to him, by reason the Physick of this Country consisU much thert^n. In essed, he ac¬
knowledged that be bad n§ver been served more diligently ; and ajb-it I was very ignorant in
all the things that he made me do, yet my address and considence supplyed thae desed. This
Physician had ewo daughters, who having loft their rapther lived alone wieh him; sothat
whil'st he was in bis visits, I had sometimes tbe pleasure to see thero. For whereas the wo¬
men ofC&lt;"»/?'««/'«&lt;'/'/^ are very curioas oftheir beauty, thedssisetseey hadtogainme, to ike
end I might give them catain waters for the sace, which thsirsatkr would not let them
have, mide them use me veiy civilly j and for sejir I soould be put away, tsis y caught me ali
thac I had to do cbe best tl»ey couW.
</p>
<p>I had no sooner made an end of whatsoever the Arabian Physician hsid commanded me to
do at his going forth, but I went to entertain his daughters at a lattice window that was very
low, and teach them new means to become s«is, whkhl sakd I had learnt in Italy ; sothat
when ray Master carae home, he never sound me araongst his essences: yet he could not cora¬
plain of rae, beause whatsoever he had ord*ined me eg dp, was always performed. He iraa¬
gined then, that since I wasso diligent, he wu to give me more employment, for sear lest
ouc ofidlencss I soould have coo much conversaition wirh his daughcers; bue whereas chey
were dextrou«, they percdved his design, so as sinding that tobulie me, besides necessary
things he had lest nie great store of Grite roots to prepare for the Bacbs, which are so srequent
in th« Country, they made me give them part of item; so chat all three vvorking,the business
was quickly dirpatched,and we had tirae enough bdides for conversation: Inso rauch thae my
Master coming horae in tbe evening, wich an opinion chac he sliould sind me very busie, and
a belies tbat he had wee wich an excellenc cxped;&lt;nt to keep rae from eneercaining his daugh¬
ters, he wa» strangdy surprized to stc mc Isbor ao more then I was wont to do. Neyetchdess
hs could not resolve to quarrel with me , having never been so well served as
by me.
</p>
<p>In this unqaietnesjs he itootk a new resolution, which was to en/oyn mt to wait upon him
in the streees, and toiegve himin my place who was usually to accompany him. Buc ehese
maids were no kss witey in this occasion thtn the other; they won this Slave with money
and dealc in siich fori, as wben we came home, there was nothing done of all that had beeri
ordained him ; and this out of the hope that their sather would alter his mind, and not carry
rae any more abroad wirh bim. This slight nocwichstanding wrou^t that which they ex¬
peded tiot; for the Physician, seeing that when he carried me abroad with him, none of his
worli was done; and that when 1 stayed at hc«ne, hisdaughtersalwayssentforme, resolved
to sell ,me. And truiy I was not forry for it, in regard I bad bat litde knowledg in the min¬

</p>
<p>Now you must understand, chac ehese cwo JanizarUs had each of them a sair Slave • and
that as long as I was wich them, though they were both of one company, yet were thev ofa
disserent Squadron, so chae ehey were noe boch upon che Guard at one and rhe same day bv
vvhich means one of them always remained ae home, as it were the Guardian of the tw^
Slaves. In the mean cime I acquieced my sds admirably of the employment had been con-
s.irdnnm.-; and never had their Arms beenso wdl ktpr, as since the time that Ihadbecn
in their s rvic ■. But is they were contented with me, no less were the two Slaves though I
contribured nothing rhertunto: For by reason of that which I told you in the beginning I
was never k(s above , then inallthtse several encounters, albeit I was never so much^be-
lovs d. These sair Slaves did not for all that testisie unto me both at once the good- will thev
bore me; and out of a particular address they chofe thediy whexeinthesar^iz,aryth3ii\\i
their M.'st'.r was upon the Guard, so chac he which stayed ac home very well perceived the
care and coraplacency which his sriends Slave had for me ; but whereas he was contented with
my service, andsiw that i contributed nothing thereunto, be did not advertise him of it.
1 he same roason which this Soldier had, tbe other had also; and by this means I was for some
time equally beloved of both the two sanizaries, and ofthe two Slaves. It hapned at
1-ngth, that by order of War these two sanizaries were put into cne and the same Squadron,
and thereby would have been constrained to leave rae alone with their Slaves, being obliged
to go upon the Guard the sarae day, had they not bethought themselves of telling one ano¬
ther that which they knew concerning the good-will these Wenches bore rae. Wherefore con-
sidering how they were equally interessed in the business, they disputed a good while betwixt
themselves what they were to do. At last,though they loved me exceedingly,they sdd me that
very day, not being able to resolve to leave me alone with their Slaves.
</p>
<p>The santasticalness ofmy fortune so wrought, that a Musician ofthis Country, who tacght
to play on the only Instrumenc which they have at Consiantinople, and that holds somewhat
of the form ofthe Lutes of/^-j/y, took me into his service, and carried me horae with him.
The next day aster my coming chicher, when he was gone abroad, I rook one of thofeTari^i/J
Luces (for he had many of them,) and whereas this Instrumenc hath buc one string.I thought,
thac is Icould put more toir, ehis Harmony icmay bc would please my Master, and might
obcain my liberty.  I cook one of chofe Lutes then secretly, and going toone ot thofe that
makes them, who dwelt hard by rhis Musicians house, and whom! bad by chance taken
notice of as I came thither, I direded him how I would have it done.    At length I made him
sie this Luce for seven ranks ot strings; and whereas I bad still one of thofe enamelled Gold
rings lest, which are worn rather out ot galliniry. then for their value, I gave it him tor pay-
men: ofhis pains.   Being returned home, I put strings to this Lute, and beginning to touch
it, I drew to me with my harmony my Masters wise, two sisters that he had. and three
Slaves.   So thae when he returned, he sound me in the midst ofall these women, who barken¬
ed to me wieh a greac dealof delight and attention.   Ac sirst he was angry,both with them.and
with me; but coming to hear me himsds, he pardoned thera their curiofity, and hoping to
gain good store of money by my means, he caressed me extraordinarily.  He undertook not¬
withstanding to maintain against me, that in something thdr Lutes were more persed then
ours; because, saidhe, having but one string they can never be outof tune.   This pleasant
reason being noching hard eo be destroyed, I raade bira easily comprehend, thac ray Mulick
was beecer then his; and che very nexe day he carried me coall cbe houses, whither he used
to go; where they had no sooner heard me, but chey would hear him no more.   This man
being as proud as he was covetous, although I raight have got him a great deal of money, yec
could he noe resolve Co carry me any more along wieh him ; so ehae purpofing eo learn eo play
as I did, he lesc me ae home; and mornings and evenings only I took him out Ldlons.  But
I was noc long boch h'S Master and his Slave ; for whertas' hc was \o less jealous then proijl,
knowing thac his Wise, hisSistets, and his Slaves, did nochir:g buc barken to rae, ouc of a
capticiousness worchy of him, he resolved Co sell me. Nevcrchdess ic was nor wichouc a
greac conslid in his mind; and vanicy, covetousness, and jealousie, gave him no little
trouble.                                                                                                             .^^.^

quiet above an hour at least; howbeit I hoped to meet with soms good fortune which I did

was I not long wich him, for whereas he was avaricbus, and had no need hut of one Slave,
that could row, he was perswaded that he might sdl rae for somuch, as he raight therewith

persons of quality. The Cadilesquer then of Natolia becarae ray Master, and to his house I
was carried; but from hira I parted a little aster for the like reasons; ehen was I encercained
by ehe Muphti; and ehe next day aster I past into the service of the Aga of the sanizaries,
where they chat sought tor rae by the Grand Signior's coraraand sound rae. Indeedie iscrue,
that I lliould not have been long ehere, for / was Co have been sold away again the very
same day.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, aster I had had for my Master a great man of ehe Pore, a Merchant of Tri-
poU, an Arabian Physician, two sanizaries, a Piaycr upon the Luce, an Asrican Captain of
a Galley, the CadtU I attcroi Natolia, the Muphti,ind the y^^^i of the sanizaries; aster,
I say, I had eqjally satissied them all, Forcune ac last restored ms eo libercy. And cruly I was
noc a little obliged to het for so sar complying wich my humor, as not to lee me wear cha same
chains long; ic being raoft cercain chae I soould have been dead wich gries, is she had used
the raaecer ocherwise. For is ic credible, coneincd the Marquis, chac a raan, who could not
live long under ehe Empire of one onely Mistress, whofe dominion is incomparably more
gentle ehen a Merchane of Tripoli's, could have lived long under chae of an imperious Ma¬
ster? And CO say all in a word, icis easie Co be iraagined, chae is I had still worn but one
chain, ic would have seeraed very heavy eo rae, seeing even bracelets of hair would incommo¬
date me is I soould wear them long. Change is the charra ofall pleasures, and the ease of all
forrows. There is not an evil, how lictle soever ic be, chae would noe become insupportable
tome, is I soould always endure ic ascer the sarae manner; nor is chere any which I should
noe bear wich pacienc-, is it were noc always ehe same. For in sine, whecher it be for the
pains of che body, or for the pains of the minde, one cannot pass from one evil Co another,
without some moments c s rest. Change hath this marvellous in it, that in pain ic sds, mau¬
ger tbac which we hei, it diverts, ic eases, and fortisies us. And of what humor soever we
be, wc chink not so much of the evil that is arrived to us, but thac we have some joy for
that which hath lest us.
</p>
<p>You are Ceo dcquent on this subjed, said Leonida interrupting che Marquis, and is I might
be credited herein, both for the interest of publique society, and good manners, you should
be prohibited from ever speaking in the behals of inconstancy: For whereas you have a great
of wit; whereas also you speak as a man interessed; and as a man thac maintains his own
cause, you may ac leneth p rvert the good thoughts of some. Is it be true, added Sophro-
nia,thu one easily perlwades others.when as ont is raightily perswaded hirasels, I acknowledg
thac by this reason, rhe Marquis soould be tbe raoft dangerous Orator in the world. Is I had
establisoed my dodrine well, answered he, you soould be constrained Co acknowledg, chac it
isnoc contrary either CO common socicey, or ehepubliqac good. For never haeh any incon¬
stanc man precipitated himsels; never hath any inconstanc raan killed his Rivals, nor ill-in-
treaced bisMiltress; and sire, sword, and poyson, are chings of no use in nature to hira • but
heleavesrhciiuo the dispofing ot all thofe obstinate Lovers, who always render theraselves
unhappy, m sollowing this constancy, which you cerm che Queen of all Vertues. We are noc
ro judg always of things replyed Don^, by the event; and then in this occasion it isnot
Constancy that makes Lovers unhappy, but Fortune, that delights to persecute Vertue • and
III rhis surr, even unhappiness, serves tor the glory of which are constant.                      '

<p>The Third Boo\,
</p>
<p>WHil'st this agreeable Corapany endeavored to forget their present misfortunes, by
remerabring chofe which ehey had avoyded; Isabella was in an extraordmiry melan¬
choly, although soe was as yet but in the apprchension of an evil thac was co arrive uneo her.
Every cirae that soe heard her charaber door open, slic always bdieved that Solman was
corae to discover his unjust palTion to her; and every cime chac ehe Sultana cAsteria wenc
srora her, ic seeraed to her that soe abandoned her to che Sultan's violence. There were yec
some eiraes wherein soe conderaned her own thoughts; and wherein Emilias speeches gave
her forae consoladon. These good intervals for all that lasted not long; and how constant so¬
ever Isabella was, slie was always nearer to despair then to tranquillity. On the other side,
SoUman Wis in no less pain; his love, his vertue, and his irresolution upon chae which he
was Co do, put his Soul into so great a diforder, as he then raeritcd to be as rauch lamented,
as blamed.
</p>
<p>But at length, whereas it is hard to consenc to the rendring of ones sels unhappy for ano¬
thers seiidty, and to renounce things out of generofity which one ardently asseds, Soliman's
Reason being combated by his own desires, by a violent paslion, and by ehe Artisices of Rox¬
elana, it sound it sds in the end so weak, as he absolucely resolved ro speak eo Isabella of his
paslion. I know very well, said he Co himsels, chat chis is Co becray the sriendsliip which I
have promised Co Ibrahim; bue I know wiehall, that ic would be ehe beeraying of my sds,
and che cause ofmy deach,is I soould bereave my sels of che hope which I have of prevaiSng
one day wieh Isabella.
</p>
<p>In ehis resolucion, Soliman wene Co the Princesses charaber on a tirae when as the Sultana
Asteria was Corae srora her, and ehae none buc Emilia was wich her. When as sirst che Prin¬
cess saw hira, stie changed colour j and Soliman on his pare, who very ranch respeded her,
and thac still loved Ibrahim, thought Co alter his resolution; and in chis fore, sear eroubling
IsabeUa, and resped silencing SoUman, they were a while unable to speak to one anocher.
The SnUan was he ac last ehae began ehe Conversation, in craving pardon of Isabella for che
constraine wherein slie lived. My Lord, said soe unco him, since ic concerns the quiet of thy
State, I dare not murraur at it; and though the privation of ray sriends be a displeasnre sen-
sible enough, I do endure it without coraplaining of thy Highness; I do accuse Fortune, and
do justisie Soliman, who without doubt will never be bue equieable. Would Co Heaven, said
he unco her, I raighc be sure chac you would speak chus always 1 My Lord, replyed sbe, chis
is a ching which will absolucely depend on chy Highness; ie being moft cercain chae I sliall ever
be reasonable, and not be so inconsidetate as to think ought to ehe disadvancage of ehy Majestyj
is I be noc constrained chereunco by chy sels. I could have wisoed, xep\yid Soliman, chat
wichouc excepcion you had promised rae never co chink araiss of rae; for it may be you will
learn from mine own raouch ehae I ara saulcy.
</p>
<p>Isabella blusot at thisdiscourse, and casting down her eyes without daring Co look any
more on Soliman, and being unable Co answer him, soe was a pretey while in this incertainty s
but on a sudden, Soliman, carried away by his paslion, resolved to discover it nnto ber. I
know sull well, said he unto her, chat I ara going to destro/ray sels; that in acquainting you
w-ith ray thoughts, I am going to raake you hate rae; but I would sain have you edl rae.
added he, before Icontets ray crime unto you, whether an error, which is not voluntary,
merits as rauch chastisemcnc, as a preradicaced malice i» My Lord, inswexed Isabella all
persons that hive great Souls like thy Highness can never commit saults but voluntarily There
IS nothing that cm force Reason whenone willmikeuseof it; andthe raoft violent passions
withouc doubt are but the pretext of weak ones, whenas chey will excuse che bad adions

liomcd cobe benesicial Co all Lovers, co be prejudicial to me. For, added he, I see very
well, that the more I sliall perswade you thsc I love you, the more you will hold your seili
injured by m:. But to take away at leastwise the means from you of reproaching me with
my crime, I will acknowledg, divine Isabella, chaC I know being your Protedor, lought
not Co be your Lover; chjt loving Ibrahim as I do, I oughc noc cobe his Rival; thatre-
spcding you as I ought, I sliould not use ^ny discourse Co you thac ofsends you; that loving
glory, I ought noc CO endure an assed'on which may blemish Ic; bue I know, more then all
this, that lovc never sh;;ws it sels, either greater, or more persed, then when it destroys
sriendship, forces Reason, and wic/iouc considering either honor or glory, carries us to dye,
or Co mike our selves be beloved of ehe person whom we adore. This, incomparable Isa¬
beUa, is che dhee whereuneo you have reduced my Soul; buc is nocwichstanding I maybe
permitted to eraploy Reason for che obliging of you to pity, remember thac you would be un¬
just in causing the deach of a Prince, who herecofore hath saved Ibrahim's lise; andthat
cruelty can never pass: for a vertue. Ee then in some fort indulgent to my paslion, and atleast-
v/isc bemofn the hurt which you have done me.

<p>Great Prinof, replyed//^^.//^, ou.,hc to be sensible of piry, but they never ought to put
theraklvcs into a condition of being the objed of it to others: Neither will I be drawn to
beleeve that Solimm hath a thought so unworthy of hirasels. For, ray Lord, how can I
think that thy Hig'm \ will stab a Poignard into the heart of Ibrahim, aster thou hast saved
his htr s* is -t soould be so, ic hi- better, both for him, for me, and for thy Highness, that
he ha \ bee n lest to languiOi in his irons, or to dye of melancholy, then to save him for to kill

that/^r.ii!;/w is yet mire powersul imhySoul, then the satal beauty of Ijabella. No, said
Jo/iW4« interrupting her, do not justisie me in this fort; since in rhe terms wherein I ara, I
have no other design, then to lee you know, that I am the raoft saulty of all raen, in perswa¬
ding you, that I am the moft amorous. Ah, ray Lord, said soe to him weeping, doth not

</p>
<p>Soliman being moved with so presling a dilcourse, stood a while without answering ihert-
unto; but at length his passion still surmounting his vertue in this occasion; I know, said he
unto her, that Ibrahim's lise oughc to bc dear unto me; but I know wiehall chat mine oughc
to be considerable co me: and I am certain, chac whae exploits soever he can do in Persta, I
have done more yet in consideration of him. I have soughc for him against my sels; I have
selc my sels in che slarae withouc daring eo coraplaipi; love and sriendship have corn ray heare;
and I know no corments so terrible which I have not endured since the sirst instant that I saw
you, rather then to do any thing against the assedion which I bear hira. But being corae to
the terms, either of dying, or speaking, I chofe the last; and so rauch the rather, because I
do not think but a man, who could abandon you at Monacc, to corae uneo rae Co Constan"
tinople. Will easily enough resolve co quie you, for che saving of a Princes lise, co whom he is
indebced tor his own. Ah, my Lord ! cryed Ijabella, is Ibrahim be saulcy in ehis occasion,
ic is against rae, and nor against chy Highness, who by ehis very saulc arc yec ehe more straicly
obliged noc to comrait one against him. For what doch noc a raan deserve, who racher ehen he
would sail in his word which he had given thee, resolved to abandon,noC only his Country, not
only his Sriends; but tbe only person whora he could love; who was in stead to hira ofall the
world; and without whora his lise had been irkfora, and death the terra of his desires? No,
my Lord.continued soe,slatter not thy sels in this occasion; think better.both of Ibrahim and of
isabella, and be raoft assured, that as I am certain he would dye a ehousand eiraes rather chen
abandon me, so soould I do che like, rather chen be unsaichsul eo him. And is by forae pro¬
digy, which I cannoc sear soould happen, Ibrahim soould consenc Co chy paslion; is he him¬
selt soould speak co me of chy love, yec lee ehy Highness know, chac I ara noC capable of sail¬
ing by exaraple. I soould cease co love Ibrahim, is he ceased Co be generous, but I sliould
love chee never a whic che more; concrarily, I soould regard thee then, both as having out¬
raged me, and as having bereaved rae ot a vertuous Lover.

was done her; but whereas he was too sar ofs se&gt;r them ro hope for any succor trom him
this advice was but a weak consolation to Isabella. Howbeit soe desired the Sultana Ajl^nl
to endevor the sinding ouc of means to convey a Letter to Ibrahim, which the Sultana pro-
mised her to do ; upon condition that stie might obtain of her generofity, that he soould be
contented with ddivering her, without cnterprizing to be revenged on Soliman; for, said the
SuUana to her,Were not the Grand Signior my Satherjkno wing him as I do,I could not chuse
but have compaslionof theestate wherein I see hira. Is he were noc generous, he were noe
to be lamented; bue I am well assured, continued slie, that he punisoes himsels in ofs.nding
you; that the remorse which he hath in his Soul torments him as much as his passion; that ac
the very same time when as he speaks to you of his unjust passion. he craves pardon in his heart
of che generous Ibrahim; and chac he repents ac ihae very instane wherdn he commits the
saulc. Alass. cryed Ijabella, how dangerous is this unprofitable generofity I and how little

vercue, and is noc able co sollow it. Repentance, continued she, thae begets no change in

sdl oue, ehae ascer Soliman had been at the Princesses lodging, there had been luch an expreis
O.der given, that none sliould be sussered to'goout of the old Serraglio, as it was impollible
for her to execute her design, and that Was it which redoubled her asslidion, and that ot
Emilia and Isabella. But is chese ehree persons were asslided; Soliman was noC without
unquietnes; that constancy which he had noted in//^^s^&lt;»'s rainde extreamly asslided him,
by making him see an irapofllibility in his design; yet out of an altogether extraordinary per¬
secution, thac which oppofed his lovc augmented it; and that stedsastness which hc had sound
in che Soul of the Princess was a new charm, which rendred her yet raore araiable.

Slave whom he had made his Consident, carryed him still on by che raeans of ehe same Slave
to violent resolueions; bue whereas resped never quics love, buc when as sury and despair

srora his soul, he resolved to speak co her once for all, co see is he could gam her. Thatwhich
carryed hira the racher to this extreara resolution, was the thought hc had that it would not
peradventure be long before Ibrahim returned; and that a conqueror or conquered, the love
which he bare Co Isabella would raake hira soon siniso this war: for when as Ibrahim went
away wieh an absolute power to treat ofall things, without having new order srora Salman
he had assured him, that he would corae and render hira an account of his voyage hitnsds,
without ever sending to hira before.                                                           h r    r •

<p>Ihe Sultan, not knowing then aC whae Cirae/^r^^/w would return, and well foreseeing
that his voyage would not be long, is by ill fortune he had not received his last order, as hc
began CO doubt, racanttotryis he could obtain thatby sear, which hecould not obtain by
love. In the mean time Isabella lived in so greac a mdancholy, that all her vertue and con¬
stancy were not strong enough to keep her trom wisoing, that deach would speedily deliver
her oue of che deplorable estace wherein soe was. She saw her sds sar stom Ibrahim, wich¬
ouc means Co hear from him, che place of her resuge become her prison, Che sighc of her
stiends forbidden her, Soliman's persecucion dayly redoubling ; in ^w^, slie was expofed eo
moft scnsiblemiseries wiehoue ocher consolacion, chen chac of the Sultana Asieria's, and her
dear Kinsworaans cears. Her sriends on ehe ocher side, were noC wiehoue unquiecness; so
long an abode at ConslantinapU pofsessed them with a great dealof gries; and the privation
of the sight of Isabella very much troubled them; but at length, nothing resting for them but
patience to mitigate their displcasure, they comforted cheratelves as well as chey could with
the hope of Ibrahim's recurn, wherewich they were still entertained from Isabella; who
not able to dirainiso her own misfortunes, endevored at leastwise Co slaccer thofe of others
with ehis hope chac soe gave thera: for che Grand Sigmor had still permitted her to send un¬
to thera by a Capigibasii, in whora he absolucely consided.
</p>
<p>All chese illustrious persons being in chis deplorable estace, Soliman, chrust on by despair
and his love, wenc one day co Isabella's lodging, having sirst sene a Coramand co che Sul¬
tana Asieria Co go to that of Roxelana, for she had for a pretty while before been sddom ab¬
sent srora the Princess. This command exceedingly disquieted the Sultana; but noc able co
do any other then voluntarily obey a Prince, who had power and right eo constrain her
chereunco; soe lesc Isabella wieh Emilia, wichouc leccing her know any ching of tbe sear
soe was in, chac SoUman had a purpofe co use some displeasing discourse Co her, seeing he re¬
moved her from her. Scarcely was soe gone oue of her chamber, when as Soliman came In
CO ic; and whereas ic seemed eo her chac he had less civilicy for her chen he was wone; and
chac his looks gave more signs of choller, ehen of love; soe was in some joy, hoping chat it
may be her constancy had so sar provoked hira, as Co oblige hira to turn her oiit of the Serra¬
glio ; but soe soon understood, thac this incivility, and this choller was an essed of his love. I
lee very well, said he unto her, chat ray visits do importune you; chaC my presencc displea¬
ses you; chac my passion begees your hacred; chac my respeds augraenc your pride; thac ray
prayers render yon inexorable; and chac Cears do harden your heare; Wherefore, concinued
he, I am resolved Co cake another course. I have ereaced you coo long as a Mistress, ic is just
then, since you will noc be so, ebac I cease co be a Slave: buc whereas I cannoc cease Co be a

<p>, cue eoo well; and ic is as equally impofsible for cheeeo pofsess me wieh sear, aswich love;
thou mayst have unjust desires, bnc I hold thee uncapable of a wicked adion. Thou raayst, I
say, have weakness, hue noe crudcy; and love cannoc produce in chee ehe esseds of hacred.
Ic is noe, added soe, because I do noc wisli with all ray heart, both for thy glory, and my con¬
tent, that either out ot choller or hatred thou couldst resolve to chase me stom thy presence
and never to see me raore.                                                                                        *
</p>
<p>The opinion wherein you are, replyed Soliman, that the same passion, which carries me to
persecute you, will keep me from hurting you, is that wichout doubt which makes you speak
with so much considence; but know, that a Prince, who sees nothing in his choyce, but death
or your assedion.ought to enterprize any thing for the avoyding of theone, and obtaining
ot the other: It can never be unjust for bim to think of his prelervation; that oughc co be

<p>preserred before all other chings. I have stiendstiip for Ibrahim; I have veneration for ynu ■
bu' I have also some interest in my lise. I have done what I could to procijre my content with-'
ouc troubling yours; but at length, seeing I cannot do it, and thae there is a late v.hich vvi'l
not let me live wichouc you, I must seek ouc the means for is. Remember chen, thac he which
cnves your assedion, can command you; chac he which ofsers you his heare, is no: unworthy
your love; chac Ibrahim owing his lise co me.ougc Co render ic rae in this occa Jon; that li ctr
so many services, submissions, respeds, sighs, and tears, the anger and spite of being Jdp Ad
may seiz? upon my Soul: and for a conclusion remember, that revenge is the d li^ht of in*
censed Kings; chae Ibrahim is in my Armies; ebac you have in Consiantinople persons which
are dear co you ; and chae you are in che Serraglio.
</p>
<p>Ic is true, my Lord, replyed Isabella, that 1 cannot be ignorant of all these things; but I
know wiehall, chac thy Highness commands, both in thy Aimics, in Constantinople, vai^ in
the Serraglto; and that Cons quenrly I have nociuse to sear any thng; but contrarily I
think that ibrahim, my sriends, and I, are in more sasety in thy Estaces, then inonrown
Country. And then ac^ain, my Lord, I cannot imagine thac the remerabrance of Ibrahm is
uccerly desaced ouc of thy memory; that a man whom thy Higness harh so much loved, and
so much obliged, can be ill- intreated by chee ; nor can I believe that Isabella can inspire thee
with such unjust thoughcs; no, my Lord, I cannoc think it.
</p>
<p>Isabella, replyed SoUman, hath not pofl'est me with unrcasonable thoughts, I have nothing
buclovefor her; howbeie I must conress, chac her cruelcy pofsesses rae wich sury; and that
she may carry me eo destroy all chac I soall chink can raviso her from mc; and consequently to
do all chae I shall believe can serve my turn concerning her. This being so, answered IsabelU,
I need not be chreatened in the person of my sriends, nor in that ot Ibrahim, since on my
onely will that absolutely depends which thy Highness calls rigor, and which I term an essed:
of Reason and Vertue. For, ray Lord, continued soe,, were not ray heart, nor ray word en¬
gaged to Ibrahim; nay,had I as rauch ass^ dion for thy Highness as I am capable of, yet soould
I not give thee more cesliraonies of it chen I have done. Were noc ray Religion, I say, dis-
serenc from chine, yec in thae I could noe beihy wise, I soould noe be ehy Slave, since che heart
of Isabella can never have choughcs contrary to her honor and her glory. The Slaves of Soli.
man, replyed he, are more then Queens of other Nations; and then again, to say the tmcb,
to have you command absolutdy in my heart and soul, is not to treat you as a Slave.
</p>
<p>Isabella, chinking she was to speak more chroughly co ehe Grand Signior, then as yet (he
had done, and believing, that when he had no raore hope, he would have no mere love, said
to him with a more consident voyce then before: Sinally, my Lord, all that I can say to thy
Highness, is, that is, forgeecing chy ususl mildness and generofity, thou couldst resolve to carry
me by sear ro char, which chou couldst noe get by love; and for chac essed wouldst persecute
me in ehe person of I brahim,who is dearer then ray sels,to rae I would see him dye rather then
change my resolucion. Let thy Highness judg aster this,whether death can sright me,and whe¬
ther tear hath any power over ray Soul. Consider then that though thou hast no hope lest thee,

to have coniidcred nothing buc rae in that encouncer; thac one oughc noc to be generous Co
the prejudice of the person beloved; and that in the end I had joyned force to intreaty; he
had not returned; 1 had not been carryed away by force; I soould not be at Conslantinople;
Soliman soould not be my persecutor, and we soould not be separated : yec chis is noe my lasi

would be taral to me; buc I foresaw noc ehe mischies which was Co arrive unto me; ic
had noe beenso greac, it ic could have been foreseen. In sine, hid ehis illustrious Princess,
I am come eo that pass, as I can scarce sear new miseries: I am in sear for my IrienJs, I am
in sear for my sds, and I ara in sear for Ibrahim. There is a design on ray gbry, and on the
lise of the person that is dearest to me in the world: aster this, lee Forcune do whae she will,
stie cannoc increase my misery raore. The like was never seen in any agej the infortunace il¬
lustrious persons of Antiquity had at least this advantage, to be perswaded by the error where¬
in they lived, thac cheir despair was without crirae; and thac they raighc with glory sinisli
their corments in sinisoing i heir hves: but for rae, I am Co attend this succor from che plea¬

<p>Ah, Madam, said Emilia ro her then, do not abandon me! and Co oblige yoa thereunto,

vancageous for her Co bc lamented by susliniano, then to be expofed to the violence of a
Prince, who can be no longer moved, neither by my tears, by my prayers, nor by his own

could not forbear weeping too, though soe knew not cercainly ehe cause of ie; and noC daring

thae all ehe Troops, which had been senc for cheforcisyingot cheArmy, were ehe bravest in

her or gallancer ehmg seen chen these ewo Camps; nor Peace wiehall its abundance   what
pubhque seasts soever It hath caused, ever stiewed more stace, chen War did ac chac'time in
these two Armies.   For Soltman out of a parcicular grace was pleated chat Ibrahim ssioulj

tolodgallthe Soldiers in Tents, andthat ordinarily they are all very sumptuous, these two
Camps sliewed the goodliest objed that cm sall under the eye of man.   There was noriiii^
buc Cloch of Gold and Tinsd in all Ibrahim's Pavillions, with Silver Cressents, Peoons,
and Streamers on che top of them.  The least Tents were painted on che out-side witse
Arabesque soliage of Gold and Silver, intermixt with disserent coburs; and thofe
of the very Slaves were of Cotton Cloth of lively colours, and woven Chccquerwise.

Beglierbej oi Amasta, and of the right to the Bassa Tialli. He caused part of his Ordnance
to be set in the midst ; and to surprize che Enemy the more, the rest was placed between two
Battalions of Soot.   He chofe tour thousend also from out ofhis Horse to ride up and dovm

deprive my sds of the means ro sly. Aster this he comraanded to march on; and that great
body, compofed of so many disserent parts, began to advance withso regular a motion, asit
might bc said, that one spirit made it raove.

<p>In the mean time Tachmat, who knew the manner of the Turks sight, had ranged his Ar¬
my in battd array rauch aster the sarae fort, wieh chis disserence nevercheless, chac whet eas he
had more Horse ehen Sooc, behinde ehebatcalion which corrcsponded Co ehae of the J*««&lt;&lt;-&lt;«-
rits, in ehe bead of whom Ibrahim had see hirasels, wasa sqaadron of the moft couragious
Nobilicy of all his Empire, in che midst of whom he was. And when as he saw ehae his Ene¬
my s Army moved, he caused his CO see forward, soehae chese cwo greac bodies advancing e-
qually came wichin sive hundred pices one of anocher ; and by the manner of their march¬
ing, it had been a very dissicult raatter to discern to which side che vidory would lead.
</p>
<p>When as chey were at this distance, Vlama, aster he had obtained perraission of I ibrahim
for it, severed hirasels srora the Array, and went diredly towards the Enemies with his
Scyraitar in his hand; buc scarcely was he advanced sisteen paces, when as Deliment, having
also severed hirasels from his party, came and encouncred him in the same fore; and ehese cwo
brave Cavaliers joyned cogecher just in che middle of the place of batcel. The two Armies
raade a stand to see ehis corabae, which was beheld by boch pares almoft as an insallible pre¬
sage of che vidory eo chac side of chera ewo which should carry ie from che other. As loon
as Vlama and Deliment were raet, ehey sell Co sighcing, eieher of chem having coo greac a
heare for Co stand reproaching and reviling one anocher. Ac ht^, Deliment soughc like a de¬
sperate man, and Vlama like one, who withouc lofing his judgmenc, or otherwise cransporc-
ed, made ie nevertheless sussiciently appear by che manner of his c jrriage, chat he was resolved
eieher eo vanqu so or co dye. Signs of sury were seen in the one, and proofs of an invincible
courage in the other; the sir st struck wtrh violence, and inconsiderately; and thelast, expo¬
sing himsels valiantly some cimcs eo his Enemies blows, assaulced hira wich judgraent, and
warded with addreGs: Bac ac length aster they had made an hundred passades to no purpofe,
had tryed in vain to gain the crupper, and had been a long time without hurting one another;
'L'/&lt;«»i»4 seeming to be vexc for staying so long from vanquisoing or dying, redoubled his en¬
devors, and pressing bis Eieray more vively then before, hehad ac lengch che sacissadion co

his chigh. This sirst advantage more augmenced Vlama's courage, and redoubled Deliment's
rage; for ascer chae ie was irapofsible eo discern rhe blows chey gave each anocher: Deliment

hurc in ewo places, when as in an instane slying violently at him,he discharged so great a blow
with his Scyraitar on his neck, that salling from his horse, he extended him dead at his seet

thereunto, onely catiled his arm to be bound up witha piece of linnen cloth of a Turbant
and placing himse s by Ibrahim, and all the Trumpets, Drums, and AttabalUs having sound
ed a charge, they began to march with thofe great cries, which all the Oriental Nations make
at tilt beginning of battels; but yet with this disserence, ih^t Ibrahim'% Soldiers seemed to
be almoft allured of the vidory, whereas the others on the contrary seemed to have no other
deiign in sighting, then to revenge the death of Deliment: It was not for that he was be-
loved, but because the %/?; sliewed so much resentment for it, asit passd even into the
hearcs of his men.   In rhe end ehese ewo Armies bdng provoked, tbe one by the deiire of
glory, and the other by that of revenge, chey encouncred cogecher.   And togive yet a surther
courage to/^r^^iVs forces, it happened chae T'^t^/^w^, bdng arrived sirst in ehe sield, had
stized on an high piece of ground, upon the which he had planted his Ordnance; but that
which hc conceived would have been advantageous, proved unprofitable unto hrm; tor
when as the two Armies caused their Cannon eo play on eieher pare, thae of ehe Per sum did
no hurc so ehe Turks, because all ehe slioc passed over cheir heads in regard ic was planted too
high.   IbrMm's Ordnance wrought another essed, and bis sirst discharge lighting just in the
midst of that Sq -ladron, where the Sophy was in person, cleared all the ranks, wich che sliugh-
ter of a world of men.   But when as the Sophy, who loft not his judgment in this occasion,
had commanded thofe behinde to take the place of them before, /^r^/[)/?wonhi$side,caustd
two battalions, behinde tbe which were ehe rest of his Ordnance, eoopen, and the Soldiers
having accord ngly divided themselves to the right hand and ro ehe lesc, ehe remainder of his
Ordnance discharged all together through the voyd space that was between the ranks, and put
his Enemies into so strange a diforder,as the like was never heard of. And truly it was zi^yixwA-
geous to ihtTcrsians, chac the thickness of the sraoke and dust, which enveloped thesetwo
Armies, kept chem from (eeiog the horridness of chis execution, for ocherwise peradventure
they would not have had so much heart to sighr, as they cestisied asterwards.
</p>
<p>Ac length, Tachmas having formed hisbaecalions anew, for repairing of che diforder which
the greac Ordnance had made, and Ibrahim's Soldiers having re- assumed cheir stations, thete
two Armies came to cope with one another.   Ibrahim, sollowed h'j Vlama, gave sirst in¬
to the batealion, behinde ehe which was ehae broken squadron, where the Sophy and Ismud
were in person.   And itwas there, where out of a prodigious valor hedid things, which
would not sinde belies with pofterity, is they were written.   He made way through all op¬
pofition, and not contented with carrying sear and terror wheresoever he went; with desend¬
ing his own lise,and giving death co his Enevmies; but took care also for the conservation of his
own party.   He saved the Ba^a Sinan from being killed, by discharging a greac blo\y with
his Scymiear upon him chac was striking him : now though he performed the Soldier in this
encounter, yet lest he noc for all that co behave himsds like the General of the Army, and to
have an eye to all things.   Somecimes hc senc eo succor chofe chae stood in rieed; somecimes
he wene Co chem in perion, and joyning boch prudence and valor cogecher, ie mighc bcsud,
thaencver cwo several men exercised chem so nobly, k Ibrahim in his person alone made
them co appear in chis occasion.   And che course chac he held was such, in sending his diredi¬
ons to every pare, as ie mighc also bc assirmed, that he was in all the sights that were in the
sield, and that he might with reason be lamd the soul of his Army.  Vlama in hke manner
worthily seconded his valor; and all the samzaries, seeing in che head of chem so couragious
a Chi'train, performed cheir pares so well in this encounter, that they pierced q^'^e througn
this battalion, and so absolucely deseated it, as all that the squadron which was behinde ic

<p>WHereas it is not enough to have vanquisoed, isone does not know how to use
thevidory, the  Illustrious Baila knew too well how  tO make use of
the advantages of fortune, for to negled his enemy aster he had surmounted hini.
He was not ignorant that the chance of war is inconstant; that Conquerors may
oftentimes bc Slaves to thofe whom they have put in chains; andthat the Crowns
which Vistory hath set on the head of thofe whom soe savours, are not so Wc il set¬
led, but that they may bc plucked from thence. Out of so just a reasoning, Ibrahim
took as much care to have good order observed in his Army, as is that of Tach¬
mas hzdhccn^WWn the hdA^ and had not been deseated.   He discamped then the
next day, and still advancing into the Enemies Countrey, without incountring any
obstacle, he carried terror over all the Persian Empire.   For whereas the Sophies
/jniy had been utterly routed, they which had not sollowed hini to Sultania , and
that iiad cscaped killing in the battell, sled to thenext adjoyning Provinces, and by
their report wrought that in the mindes of thofe that heard them, which the Arms
oi Ibrahim had wrought in them, pofsesling their hearts with sear and terror.   And
whereas it is naturall enough for a man to seek to* excuse himsels, they made the
Army of the Turks sar greater than it was, for the justisying of their slight; they
commended the valour of Ibrahim to cover their own cowardice, and sighting for
him in this occasion, they induced many Towns to render themselves, who other-
wise had at leastwise attended the Canon,   and  the sight of their  Enemy.   But
whereas the moft part of the Palaces inthis Empire arc not much fortisied, and
are commonly his th.it keeps the sield,/^r&lt;t/'/&gt;» being become so absolutely Master
of it, as there was not an enemy appearing, hc had no other imploymenr aster the
battell of Niphatesj than to receive the Deputies of Towns which came to bring
him the keyes thereof,and one would have said, considering in what manner things
past, that Ibrahim was rather a lawsull King, that rode in progress about his King¬
dom to raake himsels known to his Subjests, than a Conqueror, which received the
submissions of the people whom he had subdued.    In sine, the matter went in that
fort, as in two moneths space the Grand Visier restored unto Solimans obedience all
the places which he had formedy conquered, andthat had revoked aster Ulamaes
desear,anddunng the time of his sickness.    In the mean while he had sent to
VnncG Mahamed znA to jixiamira,to &amp;i!iuTc them that he did not conquer their
Countrey but cnly to oblige the Sophy to demand peace ; and is it soould bc long
before he heard from him, he would send to propound it unto him, with such just
condidons, as hc could not resuse it.  Ulama likewise on his part had written to the
Princess and Seltxana, who had not sailed to testisie unto him by their Letters a
great deal of acknowledgement for the vistory which hc had obtained of Deliment.
Axiamira was nevertheless m.uch disquieted, to understand by all them which came
from the Camp to Bitilisa^ thuhncc Tachmas cnttcAinto Stiltania ^ there had been
no news of him: For albdt the Sophy had intre.ited her very ill, yet still he was
her S.uher, and the apprehensions of Nature were yet stronger in her heart   than
the remembrance of injunes was sensible unto her.    This unquietness was not par-
ticular to her, and though it was aster a diss-erent sasoion, yet certain it is, that
the Grand Viher was troubled for that he could learn nothing of Tachmas; not
being able to imagine what design he soould have in soutdn^ himsels up in Stdta-
ma, and never appearing since, nor giving any order for setting some forces on sooc
again. One morning as he was talking with ?^/^;«^ about it, andthat  neither of
them knew what to think of it,one came and told him,that one nan,ed^.nrr/.,Cip-
tain ofa Galley ofthe BalTa of the Seas Sleer, desired to speak with him   Ibahl

<p>Bassa of the Sea to beg a grace of him in savour oi Arsalon. This name equally for-
prued both Ibrahim and Ulama ; for the Grand Visier rcmcmbred very well that
this Arsalon was hc who had taken Doria ncer to Naples; that he was Sather to AU-
bechy whom Ofman the BaslTa of the Seas son had maried; but he could not conipi c-
hcnd how they soould meet together, and be made sriends: UUma knew too, by
report, that the Satrap Arsalon was become the samousest Pirate of all the Seas of
the Levant', so thatboth of them provoked by curiofity, prcslcd^Wbr^sA to explain
himsels more clearly. My Lord, said he to Ibrahim, before I tell you what Arsalon
desires, may you be pleased to let me relate unto you the scqudc of an History
the beginning whereof you are acquainted with, co che end thac by the knowledge
you soall have thereof, you may be the more easilier carried to grant the savour
which is desired of your generofity. Ibrahim having consented thereunto, caused
every one to go out of his Tent, except Ulama, and they two being see, Morath
spake in this fort.

<p>IheSeqnekof the History of Ofman ^W Alibech.
</p>
<p>I Make no doubt, my Lord, butis the generofity of Alibech mowed you at such
time, as by your goodness you got the Grand Signior to judge her cause to her
advantage, I make no doubt, I say, but that which I am going to impart unto you
will carry you to scrve her. I will not stand to run over her sirst advcntures,thcrc-
by to make you understand the rest, since 1 hold it impoflible that you stiould not
still remember, that she is the daughter of Arsalcu the Pirate, or to say better, of a
Satrap of Persia, whom ill fortune hath made a Pirate. And I do not think you
have forgot that this Pirate took Ofman prisoner, who in a sew dayes became despe¬
rately in lovc with the veituous Alibech, and that slie delivering him, saved hersds
with him, upon condition that he sliould marry her when he came to Conslantinople:
No more can you be ignorant, that the Baslla of the Sea would never have permit¬
ted his son to have kept his word with her, had not the Grand Signior by his
commandment, and by his liberality, forced him to receive this sair iVlaid, in whom
hesound no other desest but poverty. Now sincc that, my Lord, I canaslTurc you,
thztAUbechh^th not rendred her scls unworthy ofthe grace you did her , nor
of that which yet slic attends from your goodness. She hath lived with the Bassa of
the Sea in as much obedience to him, as is stie had been his own daughter; and
with her subniiinons and respests hath in such fort acquired his aslcstioivs he loves
not his son with more tenderness. As for 0/»»^, there hath never been heard speak
ofa more violent, or more durable lovc than his, and every day too he sees some
new grace in his dear v^/*itssJ&amp;} for whereas the beauty of her soul is ser greater
than that of her sace, slie hath given him so many new marks of her vertue, of her
courage, ofher love, and ofher generofity, as he stiould be the ingratesullest of men,
isthe assestion which he bears hcr,could enter into comparison with any ottier.
This person then, being so straightly linked in good will to her Sather.in-Law,aiid
toher husband, could not resolvc to abandon them, at such tmic as the Bassa of
the Sea was constrained to imbark himselsfor to go and command the Sleet, vvhich

heSeabcingovercomebyherintreatics stie irabarqued her sdt with her hus-
bard ,\vho^a.. Vice-Admiidl under his Sather. Their Navigation having
been profperous enough, untill they came to Mmgresa, they thought ofno.hing
more than^of chooling a place where they might make a delcent, according to
the order they had for it: but a horrible tempest that arofe, destroyed all then de¬
signs. It was sb great, sb long, and sb extraordinary , that the whole Sleet was
dispersed- so that when it t^rew to be calm again, three Vesl-ells were scarce sound
together: Howbdt so great was our good fortune, as in sour or hve c^ayes tlie
whole Rivyreioyned, aBdalbdtmoft of the stiips had something o^' odier broj
ken,yctwe rcioycedtofeethcmallstiatteredas they were, aster we had believed
they were loft. The two Vcsl"ells of Ofman , and of the Basl'a of the Sea, were on¬
ly vvandng to the Sleet; but at length that of 0/?»^« comming m, made us hope
thatthe Basla would return in like manner. Aster he had been attended some
dayeswithan impatience, which well domonstrated the love which QsmanyZndtht
generofity which Altbechhiidiiovhim ; and aster that many Vessells had been sent
out to crofs up and down the Seaj for to try is they could meet with him, one
day as 0/w/t« was looking forth himsels to see is he could descry any thing, he
discovered a Veslell: and though it was so sar ofs as he could not discern of what
Nation stie was, yet the extreme desire which he had that it might be his sathers,
perswaded him that it was he. In this belies he caused his dear Alibech to come
upon the deck to kt her see that which all the rest of his Veslell saw as well as hc ;
they continued a pretty while in this fort, between hope and sear , but at length
this Vessell approachint:; by lirtle and little, destroyed the sirst, and increased the
other; for 0/?w*jw certainly knew that this Vessell was a Brigantine, and not that
of his sather, whofe fortune had b cen very disserent from his. The tempcst having
severed him from his Sleet, aud the storm having raightily bruised his Vessell, he
had beenso unhappy as to encounter witha Pirate-, who having sound him in
so deplorable an estate, had set upon him, or to say better, had taken him, he not
being able to make .my resistance. The Bassa ofthe Sea asterthis misfortune,
was perswaded^ that tobe the more gently used, and to get the sooner out of his
enemies hands, hc was to tell who he was, to theend that ofsering a great ransom
he might be restored to his liberty ; the rather, for that in this occasion the assairs
of the Empire being much concerned , he should have committed a crime , ishe
had concealed his name for the saving of money. But that which he thoughc
would conduce mols to the getting himsels out of trouble , gave him the more;
for be pleased to know, that by an encounter altogether prodigious, he that had ta¬
ken him was the Pirate Arsalm, sather tothe vertuous Alibech ; who no sooner
understood that this prisoner was the Bassa of the Sea, but he appeared to be migh¬
tily incensed with anger. W^hat, said he unto him, are you the sather then of the
Traytor Ofnian^ or to say better, of the Ravisher ofmy daughter ? and hath for¬
tune, who hath alwayes persecuted me so cruelly, at last surnilhed me with meant,
to be revenged &gt; Speak, said he unto bim, but disguise not the truthjlest I bc drawn
to make you tell it by force. The Bassa of the Sea surprised with this
discourse, and perceiving very wdl that this Pirate vvas Arsalon, thought
nevertheless, since he had said so much alreadyj that the best would be not
to disl^cmble , and to indeavour by the asllirance which he would give hin;
that Alibech vj-a.i Ofmanswik, andthat he had alwayes used her as ss stie had
been his own daughtei, to induce him to use him also with the more humanity. In
this relation, I acknowledge, s:tyd he unto him, that I am the Bassa of the Sea, that
1 am the sather of 0/&gt;w^«, andthesarher of theravislierof Alibech; but withall,

unto ;_ nevertheless, whereas he isgenerouj, and that the vertue of y4/zi/c/j hath
won his heart, he could by no means agree to what was required of him.   No,
sayd he to Arsalon, I will never be ingratesull to your daughter 5 sire restored mv
sonne to his liberty, and J will lofe mine to preserve her thatwhich she en joyes.
And then again, said he unto him, I am not master ofher, slie is Ofmans, who
commanding the Navy in my absence, is in an estate to resuse hci  unto me, isl
sliould be so base as to demand her, whichi will never do. We shal I see, laid .or-
salon then to him, whether you will not change your mind; and aster theyhad
disputed yet a while, he commanded him to be loaden with chains, and told him
once again, that he stiould never have his liberty,, and that every day he would
make him try new torments, is he did not write to his sonne to uLlige him to de¬
liver Alibech into the hands ofthofe whom he would send to him Cr that pur¬
pofe ; promising hini, that she should be no sooner in his power, but hc would re¬
store hini to his liberty.    The Bassa insocrofs a conjunrruic, knew not what ro
think, or what ♦to resolve on.    He knew by the report of his Ibnne, and of .i^'&gt;
bech too, that Arsalon was sirm in his resolutions, and of a severe and crucll in¬
clination.  Heknew that his absence  would prejudice the assairs of the Empire;
yeaand he was perswaded, that his sonne, loving Alibech mc.z thr.n hislise,
would never resolve to lofe her for the saving of him ; he selt a strange repugnan¬

ing what to do inso deplorable a case, he lamented his misfortune, accused Jr-
salens cruelty,  and without sraming any design, indured the sharpest gries that
any soul can be capable of. In the mean time Arsalon, searing lest the Balsa of the
Seas Sleet should remove surther from him, andthat t icn he stiould not h-xst A-

perceiving the intention of them that were making towards him, struck sayl, hung
out a slag of truce, and putting himsels into the skiss, wich three of his compa¬
nions, to testisie the more considence, hc went in this fort to encounter thofe
which were advanced towards him. When he was so near them a&gt; he mightbe
heard, the Psr/&lt;t«, to have audience the sooner, required to speak wich Ofmm
from the Bassa of the Sea his sather. This name made them all to stiout for joy
that heard it; and the word pasling strait from Veslell to Vcliell, and from Gaily
to Gaily, the;e was a generall rcioyciiig over all the whole Sleet. In the
mean time 0/w.r« having been advercised otit, attended with as much joy as im¬
patience, him, that brought him news of his sather. And whereas he Ihared all his
bad, and all his hood haps with his dear wise, she was with him at such time as
the P&lt;sr/i2« was condusted unco him. Thesightof thisnian nude the vertuous ^-
libech change colour, for she presently knew him, as having seen him with her sa¬
ther, all the time that she lived at sea. This sirst motion was quickly seconded with
an extreme gries; for when as O/Jw^w, outof an impatience derived from his as¬
sestion, had demanded of this man where his sather was; My Lord, said heunto
him, witha great deal of boldness, he is in a place from whence you ma^ easily
draw him, and to clear the matter unto you, know, that the chance of War, or
rather the equity ofHeaven , hath made him sall into the power of the invincible
Arsalon. Alas, (uid Alibechy looking on Ofman, what have I heard ! and what a
destiny is ours like to be ! What, said Ofman, interrupting her, and all amazed,
is my sadier in the hands of Arsalon &gt; Yes, my Lord, replyed the Perstan, and it is
from hini that I come to tell you, that you shall never see the Bassa your sather
more, isyou do not render him his daughter : This is the price he hath see for his
liberty, and it is that which you ought to pay him. I know that I speak boldly,
and that in some fort I endanger my sels; but be-think you that you have a per¬
son in the power oi Arsalon, which ought to keep you from entreating ms ilL I'
leave you to judge, generous Ibrahim, what this propofition essestcd in the minds
of Ofman and Alibech, and what a combat that Was, where one must resolve to a-
bandon a sather, or lofe a wise; yea a wise, to whom Ofman owed his lise and li¬
berty : which made up all his selicity; and which was both his wise and his mi¬
stris. Nature and Love could not be satissied in this occasion : Ofman could not be
acknowledging without bdng ingratesull; and sinding cradty in both the pardes,
he knew not what resolution to take. Ofman never reasoned at sirst for all that on
this adventure, but withoutsticking a whit atit, hc told him that had spoken to
hini, how he could not render his wise, ndther could hc abandon his sather , buc
he knew well enough how to destroy Arsulon. Ah, my Lord, cryed Alibech then ,
vvho had done nothing as yet but weep, bdng scarce able to form aword- Isthe

I must, continued stie ; for whereas I am the daughter of Arsalon, it is for me

captivity, it is for me also to ddiver him ; and it is for me also to dry up the tears
■which you slied for him : Susser me then to go and undo his chains, and wear his

worse than the disease, and which I cannot accept ot: My sather is too generous
too, continued he, to indure it; and he would disavow mc for his sonne is I were
capable of such a baseiiess. To have such thoughts vvould be a thing worthy of
his great heart, replyed v4//^scA, but it would also be a thing unworthy  both  of
you, and ofme, is I could suslper you to be crudl to the Bassa your sather,  and that
he should lofe his lise by my means. No, Ofman, it is that vvhich I can never indurc
and since we cannot live happy together, let us at leastwise die innocent.    Do what
you ought for your sather; owing him your lise, you ow him all things; sacrisise
your wise to deliver him, it is just, and she desires it.    I must, added she,  for the
love of you, deprive my sels of you ; and sear not that I will accuCc you of want
of assestion, whenas you shall consent thereunto ; no, Ofman, I stiould not be glad
that your love to me should stisle the motions of nature in you.   Reason must bc
stronger than all other things; and hc that could .abandon his sather, niight also in
some other occasion abandon his wise. Permit me to do what I ought, and leave

will you do then, replyed ^/'^sc^? I do not know, answered he; onely I know
that the estate wherein my sotil is, I can neither be wanting to my sather, nor to
you ;  and yet being unable to save you both, I see that nothing but death can suc¬

strange an astion;   whereas then you would not be carried thereunto, but only to

<p>sa y all, consider him as my sather.    I do not resuse to deliver oyurs, but contra¬
rily, I conjure you to permit mc to do it, but have also the goodness to spare mine.
Heaven can witness, answcrcd  Ofman,   aster hc had  raised her up, whether S
have any intent to hurt Arsalon ; no, Alibieh, I v»ill never do it j but irt the difor¬
der wherein my soul is, I say whatsoever my gries suggests unto mc, vvithout giving
my reason Icasurc to examine whether the thing be just, or whether it be not.   lit
sine, generous Ibrahim, aster so long and so sad a convci-sation, Ofman, not able ci¬
ther tod.liver his sacher, or deprive himsds of his wise, or sight with Arsalo/t,
resolved at least, and made Alibech resolvc so too, to go with all his Sleet, and
set himsels in the sight of that of ArsaUn; iot ill the Pirates ofthe scas ofthe Levant
had a little before betaken themsclvei to him, and acknowledged him for their
Chiestain.   It was nevertheless aster he had promised Altbech, that hc would not
sight with him ; and that it stiould bc only to endeavour to make him do thatby
sear vvhich he could not make him do by reason. All the dillicultic of the matter
was but to know precisely where hc was; but this obstacle lasted not long: for Of-
muM having sent for the ?*r/54» to come again to him, he talked to him with so
much address, that he learnt the place ofhis retreat; asccr which he told this man
in a gentle manncr,for sear his sather should be ill intreated,that before he answcr¬
cd  direstly to the propofition which had been made to him, he would willingljs
have aLettcr from his sathcr,to the end thac being sure he was Iiving,he might deal
with the more certainty. The P^r^** sinding some justicc in Ofmans dem^iTid, pre¬
sently lesc him, wich a promise to return him an answer of ic wichin a sew days ;
but take    heed, sayd hc unto him, that you go not away, for sear lest Arjaloh
sliould revenge himsels on your sather, is you stiould deceive him.    So Ofman ha¬
ving assured him that hc vvould not stir; and this iPrr/Mw having set say], he made
his whole Sleet to steer the same course ; so that two dayes aster, at the break of
day, the Pirate Arsalon, who could not oblige the Bassa to write to his fortne, saw
his whole Navy appear.   At sirst his ddign was to sight with it, andto that es¬
sest, he caused also his Sleet to bc made ready; but when as that oiOfman appro¬
ched, and that enlarging it scls, he could distinstly count all the vcslcls, whereof
it was compofed, he sound it so great, and his so small in comparison of it, as see¬
ing that it would have been temerity and solly in him, to hope for the Vistory
with so unequall a number, hc took another resolution t And aster he had instrust¬
ed the same Persian wsiom hc had formerly imployed, with his intendons, he sene
him back to Ofman; who seeing a vcssell loofe from Arsalons Sleet, and comming
towards him, hoped that it might be his design had succcedcd. Alibeeh was not of
this opinion; and sear so absolutely oppressed her soul, as there was no place lest
for hope: And truly stie had reason; for this man was no sooner brought before

<p>man then, is to put me in remembrance ofthe obligations wherdn I siand encage 1
to you •, and it is to say to me also. Do not abandon me.   Do not you abandon L
answered slie, but susser me to abandon you. I cannot, replyed 0/w^». Bot could
you indeed, sayd Alibech to him, see a dagger in my sathers hand to stab the heart
of yours? For my part, continued stie, I would rather dye. Let us die then, said
Ofman to her; for I tell yon once again, that it is as equally impollible for inc to
resolve to lofe my sather, as to abandon you.   In pursuance ofthis discourse, ./-
libech did yet what slie could to obtain her husbands permission that she might &lt;'o
to hersather: She joyned tears toher prayers, and albeit that which stie desired
would destroy her selicity, bereave her ofher liberty, expofe her to the sury of
her sather, and deprive her of her husband , yet was siie so generous, as to omit
nothing of whatsoever she thought was capable of perswading him not to resuse
her that slie   demanded. But seeing at last that she entreated in vain, and that Of
man unable to resolve on anything, yet seemed to be resolved not to render her,
she purpofed to make use of a kinsman of the Bassa ofthe sea, whom she had won
aster the sirst time that Arsalons Messenger came thither: And that (he might talk
■ivith him at liberty, and without suspition, I see very well, sayd she to Ofman,
that the tears which I shed to move your heart, do but harden it the more, and
that as long as you see me, you can resolve of nothing, wherefore susser me to
•withdraw my Cdi, and remember, sayd slie unto him, that the lise of your sather
is in question. Asterthis, she retired into the Captains cabbin, whither having
sent for the Bassa of the Seas kinsman, who slie knew was very much assested, and
greatly obliged to him, as holding his fortune of him;   When hc was come, and
that stie cOuid speak to him without witnesses, slie summoned him tothe perfor¬
mance of the promise he had made her two dayes before, to doany thing forthe
deliverance ofthe Bassa of the sea, when slie sliould suriiish him with means for it.
For rightly foreseeing that Ofmanwould never resolve to remit her int., the hands
of Arsalon, though he was very generous, and that he loved his sather exceeding¬
ly ,   this courageous woman had forecast a way hovv to beguile him.   As'rcr then
tha't slie  had asked of him, who was to serve her in her design, whether he was re¬
solved for it or no ? and that stie had told him how all that stie vVould have of hini
•was   that he would give her the opportunity the night sollowing to go to Arsi-
/o« in the veslTel which he commanded.    This man, albeit very much obliged to
the Bassa of the Sea , was notwithstanding somewhat unwilling ro consent there¬
unto.    But lr4//^&lt;?(r/:'adding art to her entreaties, undertook to peiswadc that to
him,'which stie did not bcleeve her sels.   She told hira that her sather would let
himsels be moved with her tears; that without doubt this generous astion would
touch him; and thatso without expofing her to any great danger, stie stiould de¬
liver the Bassa of the Sea.    This man then sussering himsels to be carried to what

<p>to  ddiver his sather, without lofing his wise ; no, no, said he to himselse, lean-
not lofe Alibech, but 1 must lofe my scls too.    Let us resolve upon it then, and
make the Bassa our Sather see, that we doe for him all that we can.   He hath given
me lise, I am ready to render it to him .igain ; and   I cannot think that Heaven
would approve ofthe ddivering ofan innocent tothe crueltic of ^r/^j/&lt;7«; neither
doc 1 think too, added he, but his revenge would be more satissicd with having me
in his hands, than with having/^///^scA.    And albeit he hath not demanded mcas-
well as slie, it vvas doubclds because he bdeeved, that I would render him my wise,
rather than render him my scls But alas cryed he, how was hc ill informed of my
thoughts! As for my Sather, saidhe,I may not beleeve that he can complain  of mc,
siuce 1 indanger my sels for the love ofhim. And as iov Arsalon,hQV]i\\ in my
person sind an objest worthy ofhis wrath ; it is I that stoleaway his daughter from
him ; it is 1 that was the cause ofthe slight of that generous Slave, from whom hee
expested sb many things; in sine, I alone am culpable ; and is there bc any justicc
in his cruelty, I alone too sliall be punislied. He shall deliver my Sadier, or at least¬
wise 1 shall wear yrons with him ;  and is rage carries him to take away my lise,
I shall howsoever have the satissastion to dye , without having abandoned, either
my Sather, or my wise.    1 owe my lise to my Sather, and i (hall render it to hini
again, in lofing it for his sake. I owe my liberty to the generous Altbech,znd char¬
ing my sds with the same chaines wnich are prepared for her , I sliall have done for
her all that the unhappiness ofmy destiny permits me to do.Let us goe then, added
he, let us goe to Arsalon sincc it is as equally impoftible for me, to abandon my Sa¬
ther, as to lofe-^//^ss/;.   This designc being strongly imprinted in his heart, hee
drew the Persian aside, and told him softly, that as soon as night was come bee
should have satissastion ofhim, and assured him besides, that is hedid not render
Alibech to him, he would at leastwise goe along with him in his vessell, and carry
hisanswer himsels to Arsalon.    Thisnian, being able to doe nothing else, resol¬
ved to wait the time he had appointed; in the mean space Ofman sent for one,
named Alahomet, a man of command, and one that you know hath courage and ex¬
perience; and having told him thathe was going the iicxs night to try is hee
could deliver his sather, by meanes ofan intelligence which hee'had with Arsalons
messenger, he willed him, itby misfortune his deiigne stiould not succeed, to com¬
mand ihesleei in his absence, and not to sail in taking speciall heed to Alibech,
and to send her back to Conjlamimple in a vcssell; but not before hee had tarried
some dayes in the view of Arsalons sleet; and whatsoever slioidd happen not to sight
with him.   This man, vvho vvas prudent, would saine have been a little better clea¬
red of Ofmans dehgne; but whatsoCver hecould do, he could not obligchim un¬
to it ; and Ofman making use of his absolute power,   hee could doe no other
but obey.   Alter this , Ofman went to Alibech, but whereas both of them had
eadi their dehgne, dthough they had an hundred things tofay to one another, out
of the opinion wherein they were, that they sliould never meet again , the desire
they h^d to execiite their enterprise made them say litde, seadng lest their conver-
lation being too long,they sliould not beguile one another, as they purpofed to do
So that aster p&gt;^«, to deceive Alibech, had told her that he had put ofs thesend-

whenas these veslcils comming neer to one another, hee saw Alibech standing on
the deck. Whereupon he gave a great skreek, and litle lacked but through a trans¬
port for which hecould give no reason he had not cast himsels into the Sea to m
to her. How unhappy am I cryed he 11 parted from my sleet to save Alibech.und my
departure alone delivers her into the hands ofher sather ; and so 1 came not with¬
out doubt but to be a spestator of her punistiment.But is Ofman was amazed, no less
Wis Alibech; for some ofher vessell having known Ofman,3Lnd having told it to her,
she was insinitely asslisted, &amp; beleeved the same of Ofman which hc had bdeeved of
her.In the mean time v^r/^/o»,having sent to discover this vessell, was much surpn-
led to understand,that Alibecb came in that,and not in his Brigantine;which still ap¬
proaching aswell as the othcr,niade him see Ofman on the poop.Now albeit he could
not comprehend that which he saw,yet was he glad to see more in his hands than he
bad hopedfor; and causing the Bassa ofthe Sea,ladcn vsith chaines, to mount upon
the deckjCome said he unto him,give your yrons to this Slave that betrayed me,and
to this ingratesull daughter that abandoned me.The Bassa discerning his Son, was
extremely asslisted; and Ofman seeing his Sather in that estate,was sensibly touched
therewith. At length these two vessels being come up to Arsalons, and Alibech &amp; Of
sw&lt;«« being brought before him. Behold, said he as they were approaching tohim,
these worthy objests ofmy hatred &amp; wrath, whora their treachery had drawn out of
my po"Wcr,and whom fortune hath restored unto me.We are rather an objest of youi*
pitty, answered Alibech,who was forraoft,&amp;: sallen on her knee when sliee came ncer
to"Arsalon; but,continued slie,l came not hither to nioove you to compassion; I bc¬
leeve that your wrath is cquitable,&amp; your hatred just.And seeing I hold it impoflible
to reenter into your savor, I come to break his chaines who hath been in stead ofa
sather to me, ever since I abandoned yen ; doe not think that Ofman hath consented
to that which I doe;, it is a pure essest of mine own will. Alas! cryed Ofma» then,
beholding the Ba(sa of the Sea, pardon me dear sather, isl could not resolvc to give
my wise for to save you; but to testisie unto you, that I doe whatsoever I can, I am
come hither to take your chaines upon me, and to obtain your liberty with the lofs
ofmy lise. Wherefore, said he to ^r/^/ow, deliver my Sather, and put the chaines
OJi me that he wcarcs.    I alone am saulty, and I alone am to bc punislied; for asfor
Alibech, all her cnmc is nothing else but having compassion of others misfortunes.
^r/i«/a»,sceing two persons so neer him, by whom he thought he had been much a-
buscd, could not contain his former sury, and commanded that the Bassa of the Sea
sliould be loofed, and his chaines divided betwixt Ofman and Alibech: but the Bas¬
sa beeing touched with the generofity, both oi Alibech and oi Ofman, would not
susser hinisels to beset at liberty.   I will not quit my yrons, said he to Arlalon^ to
charge my children with them; for I beleeve, since you have no more seeling of a

have had him resuse the liberty which I ofsered him? Do not justiue nie,said Ofman,
interrupting her, liiloncani culpable; it was I that stole you away ; it was 1 diat
caused the Slave whom ^rp?/o» loved somuch to sly away; in sine, itwas I   that
have done all these things: so that my sather being innocent as vvell as you, I am,
to demand justice for you both ; render it unto them then in this occasion, saidhe
to Arsalon, and let me susser all imaginable torments; for provided I may see these
two persons set at liberty, I sliall dye willingly, and without gries    We will not
have it with the price of your blood, cried then both the Bassa of the Sea, and the
generous Alibech, and to save you we arc even ready to shed ours. Why will you
not have me ddiver my Sather, said Ofman to her tlicn ? For that answered Ali--
bech, as I am the cause of his misfortune, it is just I should be so too of his liber¬
ty.    But said she to Arsalou, consult no surther hereupon, Ofmanloves me tothat
height, as he will never yeeld but by violence. And sear not, tny Lord,said she unto
him, to give him his liberty, you will punisti him enough in punishing mc; and
the irons which I sliall wear, will be more heavy to him without doubt than to me.
Arsalon not able to forbear srora bdng moved with so much generofity, and Alibech
having incountred his eyes, where slie saw (as slie thought) some marks of tcnder¬
ness, continued her discourse, and redoubled her prayers.    My Lord, said slie un¬
to him, I believe that i my sels labour mine own ruin, and that consclTing my sels
guilty, vvithout seeking excuses for my crime, I render my scls unworthy to ob¬
tain that which I desire of you : Wherefore , continued she , permit me for the
lessening of my sault to put you in remembrance of that blessed time, when as the
Pirate vsr/i?/i5« was aSatrapeof Persia; you know, my Lord, that my Mother a-
bandoned her Parents to sollow you, and that then you called that excess of love
andgenerofity in her, which now you term an horrible crime in me.    Ic is true,
thatlhavesollowed0y7»/r»,butit was not as a slave, it was as my husband; and
let heaven be my witncsj, whether in abandoning you, 1 do not quit a part of my
sels; and whether I have not ever since made vowes for your preservation.    This
mighty Sleet which is ready to set upon me (said Arsalen to her, who yet did
not yecld) is without doubt an essest ofyour prayers and assestion. Alas I answc^
red Alibech, is Ofman would have sought with you, he would not have come and
put himsclsinto your hands without Arms. Considerthen, my Lord, is there be
any sense of pity resting in you, whether you can with justicc resplve  the destru¬
stion of a man, who seeing his sather in captivity, hath notwithstanding had that
respest for you, as not to sight with you because you were mine; you see too that
he is not an unnaturall sonne, since he comes himsels to ofser you his liberty and

you shals understand, that Arsalon notonly pardoned his daughter, promised an in¬
violable assestion to the Bassa of the sea and his sonne, but also took the resoluti¬
on to cease from being a Pirate : For which essest he obtained the Bassa of the
seas permission to dism iss all them thathad ranged themselves under his obedi¬
ence; who although they were forry to lofe so courageous a Chiestain, yet vvere
they comforted with the greatness of the booty which he lest them; and cmbar-
quing himsels inthe same vessell which had brought Alibech thither, vvithout re¬
serving any part ofthe riches which he had gotten ; You see, said he, smiling to
the Basla of the sea and his sonne, how I render my sels at discretion, and how I
conside in your generofity. Aster this, my Lord, they went to the Sleet, where was
so universall a rejoycing, as the like hath never been heard spoken of.   Inthe
meanwhile, whercasapart of the Gallies and Vessels had been bruised with the
tempcst, wc made to land, that wc might put them in a condition to sollow the
sirst design.    And it was there, generous Ibrahim, where we learned that your
Vistory had no need of our succour.    This good news being made known to
Arsabn, who had been acquainted by Alibech with the obligation wherein stic was
engaged unto you, hc desired the Bassa of the sea to obtain of you, thac is any
treaty of peace were to be made between the Sultan and the Sophy, you vvould be
pleased  to take the care of making his, and getting him the liberty to go
and end his dayes  in his country, from whence love in times past had banished
Jiira   I desire this grace of you then on the behals of Arsaloti, of the Bassa ofthe
sea, of 0/w^«, and of the vertuous Alibech, who beseeches you that you^^'llbc
her protestion yet a second time.    Morath having given over speakine, est Ibra¬
him and Ulama so ravistied with his relation, and the generofity of Ahbeeh, as they
thought they stiould never have done praising her.    Ibrahim promised Morath to
re-cst"ablisti &gt;^/.«; and having sent him back   again the next day, because he a-
sured them that he stiould sind them stil abiding in the Port,where he had lest hem,

<p>till their vertue were worthily acknowledged.    And verily it might be sayd, that
Ihrahtm knew what would happen s sur le.nvcly was Mjrath z diyes jour ley from
the Camp, when ashe was advertised that there were Deputies icom Sultama thac
desired to speak with him ; he was told alto that these deputies wereall in mourn¬
ing, and seemed to be extremely asslisted. This novelty sui prised bim, and where¬
as UlamavTHsnot present at such time as this message Was delivered unto him, he
sent for him in all hast, and when he was come to his Tent, and  the Deputies
likewise, one amongst them, asterhehad begun his discourse withanElogitim of
Ibrahim, the better to prepare him not to resuse them that which they purpofed to
crave of him, acquainted him with all tbathad past at Sitltani.t, 'iince the battell ot
Niphates, wherewith ULim.i and hc were strangely surprised :   And truly this rela¬
tion was extraordinary enough, to beget no mean amazement.     For it hud sallen
out, that aster that day which had proved so glorious to Ibrahim, and so satall co
the Sophy, the death of r&gt;ts//&gt;Ws«^, and the di^leasure for having been vim^nilhed,
pofsesscd him with somuch gries, as he sell sick at the very same instant,  Asfor
the ambitious-P^rc^, slie reioyced in her heart at the death oi Detirh'ent, as a thing
which slie  had long wished for; the sicknest of Tachnas did not disquiet her, but
contrarily slie beleeved, that the less able he sliould be to direst, the more power
the should have.  As sbr the stupid Ismofel, Ihe did not regard him as any great ob¬
stacle to her design; she was notwithstanding very much vexed, when she Under¬
stood of hira, aster the lofs of the battel!, that in the heat of the sight Ulama had
given him his lise and his liberty,  in drawing him out ofthe hands of agreat
many souldiers, who would have either taken or killed him : For albeit slise for¬
bad him to publisli this astion, yet was he so silled with joy iO\' his escape out ot
thac perill, as it was impofsible for her to keep him from telling it to divers per¬
sons, though it was not out of any acknowledgement.   Perca was not ignorant,
th^tUlama had a number of secret sriends, who watched but sot" an occasion to
declare themselves for his  advantage. She knew likewise, thit all which Were of
Mahxmedes znd Axiamiraes party, sought but for a pretext to stir ; so as she
si:ared that this astion comming tobeknoWn, in the estate wherein things were,
use mightbe raade of it forthe making of some propofitions to Tachmas, vvhith
might be prejudiciall unto her, inthe design which slit had to reign. But this in¬
forcunace Prince  was not long in a   condition  to think of the assaires  of
his Empire ; for albeic his Physicians  had imployed all their skill for the pre*
servation of his lise, yet could they not pofsibly save hiirt ; and the sourth day aster
the lofsof the battell, death stisled that passion in his heart, which had made him
do so much injustice.  As soon as he had given up his last breath, PeH'a, Without
amusing her sels in unprofitable tears, took great cate to conceal it, Uhtill sush
time as stie was assured of the minds of the principal! persons of Sultnkin ; for as
forthe men of command, so great a number were slain in the day 6s battell, as
there scarcely rested any conlidcrable enough, tsrongly to oppofe what sile m64nt
to undertake.   She caused the Courtcill then to be assembled in the name ofthe So¬
phy, where slie and//w^?/appeared in nioatning ; and whetcas stie had Wit and
subtilty, aster slic had with seigned tears made the hearts of thofe that heard her
pliant, stie acquainted them with che death of the Sophy, craved their assistance for
the direstion of Ismael, and in conclusion slieWed thcni a paper, vrhich indeed slie
hzd^zdeTachmas to sign, without knowing What he die!, vvhereby hi declared
that in case Ismael sliould prove incapable of reigning, his intent then was that
the Empire sliould devolve to Ptrc/j, not holding them forhis lawsull slicceslbrs
which hadcast themselves into the armesof his enemy. All these things exceed*
ingly astonlshed thofe which heard them; the death of TachMax asslisted thertt •
the order which he had lest did not please; Ism.ids Sovcralgnty Was a thing thdy
could not resolve for; and that oiPiYca seemed yet worse tn them.   Thiy ^ulJ
willingly have called home again Mahamed, Axiamira, and Ulama •  butbesideg
that it was not a propofition to be made to Petca, they were not i^no'rant that the
exiled Princes were no longer in their own power, but in theirs that protested

<p>them; and that consequently, they werenottogo tiimultuously andacquaintl^
enemy with the death of Tachmas, for sear lest he sliould make use of this ad
vantage to ruin them; yea,and thofe persons too whom he had in his hands   and
■which were so insinitely dear unto them.   The moft of them then resolved, with
out making any stiew thereof, to deser the manisestation of thdr hatred to ' Perca
of thdr contempt oi Ismael, and of their assestion to Mnhamed, Axiamira, ind Hal
ma, untill such time as they had recovered new forces, to the end they might oppofe
Terca,znd to the end also that in making some propofitions of peacejthey might yet
be in a condition to desend theniselve?,is"it were resused.Concealing then their true
meaning, aster they had lamented the death of Tachmas , they acknowledged
Ismael for their lawsull Prince ; saying nevertheless to Perca, thac sliee was to
assils him with her counsell, and that she should raign under the name of//5w&lt;?s/.
This Princess, who thought that the moft saithsull might be corrupted , and that
particular interest was alwaies preserred before honor and glory,because such were
her true thoughts, beleeved, that is sliee inriched all these which were in thiscuim*
sell, stie should absolutely gain them to her selse, and oblige them to set the crown
on her head.   To which essest, whcnas the Assembly was ready to break up, ihee
said surther, that the Sophy her Sather having given all his treasure unto her, by a
testament which he had made in her savor ( as indeed it was true) slie did not think
that stiecould better dispofe of it,than in distribudng it amongst thofc,that were ca¬
pable of aiding Ismael to CnHain the Scepter which hewas going to bear.  Asterthis,
Ihe made them pass, though they were unwilling to it, into a great room, where
she had caused all the Sophyes riches,and treasure,to be laid ; to the end that by the
light of so tempting an objest, their hearts might be overcome with the desire of
snaking themselves masters ofit.    They  proved notwithstanding more generous
than she imagined ; for although they tessisied a great deal of acknowledgement
to herfor her liberality,yet would they not accept of it.ln the mean time they resol¬
ved to let no body go out ofthe Citty, which might acquaint the enemy with the
death oiTaehmas; for being so powersull as he was, it m ight give him a minde to
come and assault them in Sultania, which otherwise it may bee hee would not doe.
Durin&lt;^ all these things, every one had their designes; Perca thought of nothing but
oi mzkin^ Ismael to be hated; the iviend^oi Mahamed, Axiamtra, and Vlama, at¬
tended with impatience the troopes which were to come unto them from the re¬
mote Provinces, to the end they might doe thatwhich they thought would bee
moft requisite; Ismael sought how hemight sree himsels from the care of assaire?.
Things having'continued some dme inthis fort, it hapned in the end that thesame
sacility, which stie had so much liked in//w^s//dispofition, gave her agreat deal
of unquietness, for even in the like manner as stie had made her sds mistress of ir,
so did others • he was no sooner out of his sight, but this Prince altered his mind
according to the humor ofthofe that talked with him; and ui.ercas every one was
enemy to Perca, as often as slie returned to hira,stic sound him changed; and thought
5t was not dissicult for her to bring him to her bowagain, yet shee seared thatat
some time or other use would be made of his name to undoe her. They,unto vvhom
Zael had told that Vlama had saved his lise, having reported it to others, ad the

had rather yield the Crown to Mahamed, than to expofe himselsto the lofs of liis
lise.    Ah base coward, cryed this ambitious Pnncess, whofoever is capable of
yielding up a Crown, is not worthy to live /  In the mean season, the sirst gates of
the Palace were forced, there wanted no more but breaking up the rest for to get in,
they which garded them having abandoned them.    In this drcadsull estate, Perca
taking a dagger, which had been brought to Ismael out of a beleesthat he would
have armed himsels, and seeing that slic could not avoyd salling into the power ot
a people silled vvith sury, did yet what she could to get him to sliew himsels.    Shec
joyned threatnings to intreatics, and perceiving at last rhat all which sliee sa id vvas
in vaiiijSs that in an inss ant slie the uld no longer be mistrd^s ofher sels,rage so seiaed
on her soul,as presenting the dagger unto him with an extreme transport;Chuse,said
(he unto him, either to pierce my heart, or to doe what I would have you.    And
when as Ismael had told her, that he would not doc either the one orthe other, and
that she heard a great noyse, whereby she knew that the last door was broken open;
since thou knowest not, said slie unto him, cither how to reign, or how to obey, 1
will keep thee at leastwise from dying a Ihamcsull death; saying so slicc stabbed
the dagger into Ismaels heart, who presently sell down dead, and without surthei
delay struck it into her own bofoni, and salling down upon her brothers body, she
ceased to be ambitious in ceasing to live.    These conspirators being entred into the
Palace, and having learned from some ofthe Princess women the cause of IsmaeU
death, and likewise that of Ssrc/j, they redoubled their cryes, and testisied asmuch
joy, as is all their enemies had been deseated.    In the mean time the Wisest and
the moft considerable of Sultania had begun to oppofe the people, although they
loved not Percn ; but comming to understand the success ofthe business, they held
it not sit to incense them, but rather in so strange an accident to make use of theit
zeal in savor of Mahamed and Axtamira. Aster then that they had let them know,
how there was no surther uced of taking up armes, sihce the objest oftheir hate Was
no longer in an estate to hurt them ; aster that for the calming of their sliry, they
had removed the bodies oi Ismael and Perca out ofthe Way; audi aster that they had
promised speedily to settle a peace for them, and call home their exiled PrinGes,e".
very one retyred to his own house : and the CoUiiccll being set, it wag advised
chat it was no time any longer to deser the pi'Qp&amp;ustding ers" a peace? because is
the newes of this strange accident sliould be spread over the Prbvincesjit misht slisc--

andthat in sine, it was better to yeeld something untO theentmy, than to putK

them to bee sent as Depudes to Ibrahm, With an absolute power to treat SsSi
things.   The grand Visior,as I have said, having received theni in the astM^rrce

<p>rcstiops, he could assure them thatthey stiould have cause to commend him • that
his gries was, he could not keep Mahamed and Axiamira from receiving this pea e
with tears, since they had so lamentable an occasion for it; but whereas this as¬
sair direstly concerned them, they were to treat with them about it; that in the
mean time hc hdd it requisite, that one of them stiould return to Sultama, to assure
the people that ere long they stiould see their lawsull Princes again ; and that the¬
rest stiould go to Bit ilisa, to do their duty to Mabamed and Axiamira; that to
comfort thcni forthe gries which so dolesull an accident would bring thcni Hi..-
ma sliould take rhe pains both to condust them thither, and also to accompany the
Prince, Princess, and Selixana back vA'hen they returned.   Ulama perccivinj; that
/^r4^;&gt;w in turning himsels towards him, seemed to demand his consent for that
■which he had spoken, aslured hira that hc vvas very ready to do it.   And whereas
he was generous, I doubt not, said he, but the Prince and Axiamira will be senii-
bly touched with this lofs, smce I that am not obliged thereunto by so strist bondr
and that have seen my sels the objest of the hatred and persecution of thofe whom
Ibcwail, cannot choofe but be grieved ac the accident which is betallen thcrn.
Aster that ^/^wrs had given sussicient proof of his generofity by his forrow, and
that Ibrahim had commended him for so noble a resentment, he gave him coniniis-
sion totake care of the Deputies of 5«/s&lt;i«/^ till rhe next day, when bethought it
sit they should depart for to go and setch Mahamed, which accordingly was exe¬
cuted.     Ulama parted with thofe that were to accompany him, carrying Letters
from Ibrahtm to the PrinceG i one ofthe Deputies went to Sultama, and. the
Grand Visier remained with a joy that cannot be exprest; for whereas he was per¬
swaded thatthe beginning of his selicity depended on the happy end of this war,
seeing the savourable means which fortune presented him with to terminate it
speedily and with glory, he could not render thanks enough to heaven for soad¬
vantagious a success.    And whereas hc knew that the people generally delircd
peace, he was assured that the treaty of it would be agreeable to every body; not
knowing that Soltman had any other interest in this war, than that of the glory of
his Arms. In ibis thought it niight be said, that never any Lover absdit from his
Mistress was so happy as he, whilst hc entertained himsels with so sweet a hope.
In the mean time Ulama arrived at BitiUsa, presented the Deputies to Prince Maha¬
med andthe Vrinceh Axiamira., and delivering Ibrahim's letter to her, and ac¬
quainting them with the lofs they had sustained, they being generous instandy for-
£ot allthe persecutions they had sussered, and no longer remembred ought but
that r^s/:'w4&lt; was their sather,//w/Js/was thdr brodicr, and Perca thdr lister; in

tllama having imparted to them the generous designs of Ibrahim, and how necessa¬
ry their presence was to their people for their consolation against so many iiiite-
rics as they had indured, they set forth on their way. As for ^W, the sight of his

Princesses forrow was to both of them their greatest displeasure. In theend aster

ruptinghiui, as tu speak in this tort tothem which ow their lives and libertie to
bim, ought alune to make it such as he pleaseth, since it is certain that he cm doe
nothing that is unjust. Aster that these illustrious persons had rendred all the civi¬
lities to one another which their generofity obliged them unto, they sell to accord
upon the Articles of this peace, vvhich were so advantageous for the two Lmpire?,
and so glorious for Ibrahim, as the people and the souldiers, who will meddle with
judging of all things vvithout knowledge, and outof interest, could sinde nothing
to murmure at.    This Treaty, having been signed by Axiamira, for the supply¬
ing of ^^^^ws^-s desest, was also signed by/^mA«»?, by Ulama, by the Deputies
of Sultania, and by the chiesest of Ibrahims Army.    Aster this, Mahamed, who bad
alwayes loved ^.v/Vzw/r/j exceedingly, desired her that slie would Ihare in his pow¬
er, and having requested her that ihe would be his guide, slie promised him, that
as slie had never had a deiign to marry, so she vvould neither think of it, nor aban¬
don him.    And in this manner slie satissied that which slic owed toher own incli¬
nation, that \A\:\&lt;ih Mahamed dtiued of her, and thatwhich the memory of Prince
GMw^sriequired of her generofity.   Mahamed then 2i%]ked oi Ulama, whether he
vvould not injoy the selicity of his reign? And think not,  said   he   unto    him,
thatsucceedingtotheSophy, I will succeed to his pasiions ; I shall be your Prince,
and your Sriend, but i shall never bc your Rivall. Ulama answered to this discourse
with a great deal of generofity ; and whereas the love to ones   Countrey is ssrong
enough in every mans soul; and whereas there was a very straght union between
all these illustrious persons; though Ulama was exceedingly obliged to the Sultan,
and that he loved Ibrahim as much as himsels, yet he resolved to abandon his pro¬
testor for to sollow his lawsull Prince.    Things being in this estate, Arsalon arri¬
ved luckily for himsels, accompanied with Ofman and Alibech ; and whereas
/^r^t/j/w was presently advertised thereof, he went and received them, and condu¬
sted them to Axuimiraes Tent, where Mahamed was: and aster he had recounted
unto them the history of Arsalon, whereof the beginning was not unknown to
them; aster hc had commended the generofity of 0/ilw/«« and ^//i'ei-/?, and excu¬
sed the violence of her sather, he obtained this grace of the new Sophy, who in¬
gaged his word to him to restore him to his former dignity.    In the mean time the
Articles of the Peace had been publislied^ both in the Army, and in Sultania, with
great ligns of rejoycing on either side; andthe hour of separation being come,
the Sophy said to Ibrahim, that owing his Lise, his Libcrty,andthe Crown which
he was going to wear, unto him, he selt himsels obliged to tell him, that he sliould
alwayes siiide him ready tohazzard them forhis service : In sine, said he unto him,
generous Ibr.xhim, I ow unto you not onely that which you have done for me, not
ondy the good vvhich my Empire receives from you, but also that which you have
done for the Princess Axiamira, for Selixana, and for Ulama.    judge aster this, is
without being ingratesull I can be meanly acknowledging.    And I profess unto
you, added he, in taking his last sarewell of him, that rhe moft sensible forrow
which ever my blindness gave me, is that vvhich I now sed, for that I cannot see my
Protestor.    y^ra^/wgoing to answer him, was  hindred  from it hy Axiamira;
Desend not your sds, said (be untohim, with an unjust modesty, and permit, that
iiowatparting, we may testisie unto you, how not sinding means to   oblige you,
we are not unworthy to be obliged, (ince we know hovv to prize your vertue, and
dkcm of the rare qualities that are in you.    And for my particular , added stie,
I hold 5o//w^«to be gieater, more mighty, and more happy in having you for his
Subjest, than in being Master of so great a number of Provinces, which make him
to be redoubted over all the earth.    You so consound mc, Madam, answered Ibra-
/vw, with an high respest, asl cannot answer you ; but know, said he , that into
what part of^ the wodd soever fortune cardes me, you sliall ever have ofme a

Visier having promised Arsalon to take care of them , and to protest them as much
as he could,this generous Pirate comforting his daughter,told her,that owing more
to her husband than to him, it was just that slie sliould sollow his fortune; and that
(he had done enough in getting him the honour and liberty to go &amp; die in his coun-

nothing but of withdrawing his troups out of the enemyes country ;   to the end
that being upon the srondre, he might quit the Army, and go to carry the news
himsels ofhis Vistory, and ofthe Peace to Soltmcn.   He discamped then the next
day with a great deal of order and diligence ; howbeit he had the satissastion
before his going out of ^trsia to understand, that Mahamed had been received in¬

<p>r-rHe Illustrious Bassa having past the whole night without sleeping, somuch
1 had the hope of seeing//^W/^ pleasingly entertained hmi, ^nt .is soon as the
Sun appeared to know whether Soltmau would be pleasedth.it he stiould come wait
upon him, and render him an account of his voyage. The Sultan surprised with
athinti which hehad not much apprehended, in regard he thought it not so
near, gave not his answer so speedily. He marvelled ac the grand Vihers return,
considenng the order which he had sent him, not to come back before he heard
fromhim, what profperous success soever he snoiild happen to have; but in Hne,
it bdng no longer time to reason on things past, and being constrained to answer
precisely to that which vvas demanded of him, his mind was in agrcat diforder.
The name of Ibrahim, vvho vvas so near, pofsessed him with some remorse of his
sault , but the thought then of lofing the Princess, madehim instantly repent him
ofso good amotion, and with never to see Ibrahim more, that he niight still re¬
tain IsabelU, whom he had not seen since that crudl instant, wherein out of his
sear of the Bassaes return he had joyned threatnings to entreaties, and given her
but only eight dayes time to resolve once for all, whereof six were already past
when as the Bassa came back to C&lt;'w/?'&lt;«^'w/'/s ; and he had been three moneths a-
•way without any news at all of hira, so exastly had the resolution which he had
taken for it been executed. But in sine, how violent soever Soltmans love was,
yet could he not resolve to see Ibrahim, and keep Isabella from hini: For wherc-
.is he had alwaies a strong dispofition inhis heart to gCKid , and some thoughts
of sriendlhip for the Grand Visier, the sliarae of his crirae, the small hope he had
of vanquisliing Isabella, and the short time he had to resolve in, made him send
Ihrahimviovd that he might come presently; and thatat his arrivall he should
sind Isabella at his Palace, whither he was going to return her : This Prince cer¬
tainly would never have yeelded to this, had he had any hope lesc of gaining the
Princesses heart; but since the day that hc had last spoken with her, and that hc
had taken great care to have her narrowly observed, hehad learnt, that she was
in so great an astlistion, as he was asraid the extremity ofher gries would kill
her: So that considering he (hould commit a crime to no purpofe, is he should
retain JsabelU, he was the more easily induced to let her go forth ofthe Seraglio.
In this thought he would not see her, but sent for the Sultana Asl-eria, who vvas
no sooner come to him^ but he commanded her to go and tell Jsabella, that Ibra¬
him vvas returned, and that out of an excess of bounty he permitted her to go out
of the Seraglio ; but that she sliould beware of acquainting theGrand Visier with
oughtthat he hadsaid unto her, because an extrenie mischies might thereby ar¬
rive both to him, and to her. Asieria went and executed her commislion
with a great deal of pleasure ; for albeit slie loved IsabeUa very dearly, yet
the desire of her conservation was stronger in her soul, tiian her own con¬
tent. The Princess received this news with so excessive a joy, as her heart
was not capable of resenting it siissiciently ; Emilia likewise was insinitely glad
ofit: At sirst Jsabella could not beleeve it ; aster slic had beleeved it the gain-
sayd hersels; and slie wasso accustomed to misfortune, as she could not think
sogrcat a good hap was besallen her. In the mean time the Chariot, which
was to carry her to Jbrahims Palace, being come, stie embraced the Sulta¬
na Asieria i promised her that Soliman sliould have no cause to complain of
her; gave her thanks for her goodness in protesting her; assured her that sliee
would never lofe the memory of it ; and then stie got into the Ch.inot
vvith Emilia , and went to Jbrahims Palace to meet with her sriends to
whom sliee gave a greater and a purer joy, than that which stiee sdt her Vds
for as Are was going into the Chariot, that Slave, whom Soliman hadso often

her : and slie vvas no sooner gon, but his love, and the desire of seeing  eralmc!
ted; nevertheless in regard the thing was done, andthat Ibrahir^^Z^ldd^,
to arrive, he changed nc.t his order.    In the mean time the grand Visier  hiv   J
madenodoubt butthatheshouldeasily obtain thcpermission^^^
of 5.W, caused a stately Galliot, which he knew was in the Arsenal at Pera to 1-
launched into the water; and it was for this purpofe that hee had sent one of hVs
servants certain dayes before, to the end he stiould give order secredy for the ha
ving of It in a rcadiiiess against became. As soon then as he understood the SukaiK
pleasure hee irabarqued himsds, attended by all the Commaiuicrs which had acl
companied hini: and truely there was never a more magnisicent or more .'.prccabL-
objest: seen than this Galliot, especially when Ibrahm was abord it.    All that was
looked upon was painted and gilt; the whole Poop was hung with Persian Tape¬
stry, whofe ground was gold ;  it was covered all over with is aggs and streamersof
divers colours; all the slaves that rowed were sastned with silver chaines, and all
of them had garments of cloth of gold; twelve Trumpeters were on the Coursey
cloathcd in velvet, whofc ground was gold; all the Commanders appardl was
imbroidered vvith pearles and diamonds; and in the midst ofthis stately troup
stood/^r^^&lt;»» alone, though be had sixgreatcusliionsof cloth of gold at his seet;
He held in his hand a battoun of command, and was so superbly apparelled, as it
■was easie to perceive that this petty triumph was an essest of peace, since richcsand
abundance were every where seen, and very sew marks of war.    Jbrahim hid thar
day on a robe of cloth of silver, imbroidered with gola and diamonds, intermixed
with certain carnation silk twist, which added very much to the beauty of that ha¬
bit ; His turbant was covered all over with carnation and white plumes of seathers,
set up with jewels of diamonds of an inestimable value ; His Scymitar, and the
golden   chaines  whereunto   it was sastned, were answerable to the gorgeous-
3iess ofhis garment: now akhough silk , iilver, gold, pearl, and diamonds richly
appeared there, yet might itbc said with truth,that Ibrahim gave rather a new luster
to all thofe things, than that he recivcd any from thera. His sliapc was goodly, well
made, and advantageous ; his cariage sree and noble; his sace ovall; his eyes black,
and sull of sire and sweetness; his mouth agreeable; his complexion neither too de¬
licate, nor too grofs, neither too pale, nor too rcdj but such as M.in is painted,
■when ashc is amorously represented unto us; His hayr wasofchcsnut color; and
his nofe somwhat aquilin, yet so as it served to give him the better aspest; His phy¬
siognomy was promising and sprightsull; his soul was seen in his eyes, his courage
and his assabilitic appeared equally in them; and without having ought of the
beauty ofa woman, hc was the goodliest man that ever was beheld. In tine there
■was seen in his whole person, a lofty ayr without pride, a gallanterie without as¬
sestation, a iieglcstsull handsomness, a srceness without artitice, a civility without
constraint, and somthing so great and so high therein, as one could not behold him
without judging him worthy to wear a crown. All these naturall graces had a new
lustre the day wherein Ibrahim entred into Conslavtmeople, and the hope of seeing
/s^^s//4 had painted such a joy in his sace, as gave him a certain cxtiaordinarya-
sireeableness. This petty triumph was not without spcstators; for IbrahmsretMrn
bdng known, whereas he was universally bdoved, all the Grandees of the Port,
and 111 the people oi Consiantinople, repairedtothc Haven, andby the sliouts which
they gave as soon as the Galliot approached, they testisyed their zeal and assestion

also placed hiniiels  upon a  Terrace   with a B.illustrade   of Jasper ,   vvhich
lookes tothe Sea on that (ide ; and when every one still continued their shouts
of joy, Mast all thcsc people, sayd hee  to himsels, reproach  mec with my

bcmorebeloved of them than of me, who am obliged thereunto by so many rea¬
sons^ Yes, said he, Lovc and IsabelU will have itsb, and 1 cannot hinder it.   But at
length Ibrahims Galliot being come lb near, as it permitted him te) discern Soliman,
who was leaning on the Balustrade, he saluted him vv/ith a profound relpest, auel
being landed, all the people redoubled their (bouts.    The moft considerable ap¬
proached to salute him, and they that could not do so, did at the least: what they
could tobe seen of hini.    Aster that   this multitude had slishcieiitly cunsidercd
him, vvhom they acknowledged for their Protestor, Ibrahim, sollowed by all the
Grandees, and all thepeople, went to the Seraglio, where he entred alone ;  for
Soliman iteXin^ the diforder of his soul, vvould not give hini any but a private:
Audience. Whcnas he  was come into the Sultans chamber, Soliman could not
chuse but be somewhat glad, yet was he pofsdsed with consusion at the very same
instant,  and received not the Bassa with ;^hat sreeness, wherewith hc was wont to
testisie the aisestiun which he bore him.    Before time, he would rather haye spoken
to him ofthe gries his absencc had been the cause of to him; of the sear he was i»
for him ; of the health of IsabelU; and of the   joy he had for his return ;   than
of assairs of State: but in this encounter, he would needs have him at the very
sirst render him an accompt of the War;   and although hc had resolved to give I-
brahim no marks of the diforder of his soul, yet could he not forbear it.    In the
midst of his relation hc asked ofhim, whether he hadnot received a new order
which hehad lent him?   AndvAiems Ibrahint had assured him that he hadnot
he scemed to be vexed at ir, without telling hini what it was :    And at such time
as the Grand Vilicr had informed him, how advantageous the peace which he had
made in Persia was for him, he CQuld not chuse but tdl him things, which might
make him judge, that hc would have been glad he had not terminated the War as
yet.     Howbeit /Z-r/s/w; suspested nothing else of it, but that during his absence
Roxlana and Rnsi-an had periwaded him from making a Peace so sbon.This thoui?ht
gave him some unquietness, nevertheless ic presently diminislied ; for Soliman per¬
ceiving what he had done, dilguised his mindalittle betcer; andout of a scnse'of
jcalenisre, he began to caress Ibrahim move, to the end that retaining him the longer
with him, he Ihould not go sb soon to see IsabelU ; it being certain that out of an
excess of paslion, Solimm looked no more on the Bassa aster his return,but with that

As they were standing there, Ibrahim chancing to cast up his cjes wa y et Z  ''

Court, IsabelU commn^?, towards him, accompanied with Sophronia, Hipolii

You see. Madam, said he unto her, in killing her hand which slie had given him
that they have not been in vain, since I can assure you, that my voyagehath been
profperous, and that I am still absolutely  yours.   Aster this, Ibrahm saluted these
tourbeautisull companions of the infortunate Isabella, who each of them in their
pardcularniadehinia complement; and then Ibrahim having lent the Pnncess
his hand, this sair troop entred into the Palace, and went to Isabellaes chzmhzr
It was there where these illustrious sriends testiiied the true thoughts which they
had for one another; Ibrahim nevertheless marvelled to see sewer marks of joy
in//^^s//&lt;^(s J sace, than in that of all the rest, which had not so much interest in
his person: Notwithstanding whereas he saw that her complexion was a little
pale, he believed that it was an essest of some sickness which slie had had; and in
this thought he went on in entertaining his sriends with liberty enough of spirit.
He understood consusedly, and in sew words, that which had Lrought them to
Consiantinople, but not without  gries was heacquainted with the  Count of L.t-
VAgnaes zndLeomraes de^loT^le de^th.    You see, said IsabelU tohim then iioh-
ing, that there is never anyjoyso pureforus, but it is mixed vvith some bitt^r-
ness.She said this in suth a sasliion,as gave him cause to think that IsabelU had some
thing which was   displeasing in  her niinde ;   so that  hc  rdblvcd  as soon
as   in   civility    he  could   speak to her without  being   heard, not to   lofe
the occasion   for   it,   which    instantly presented it sels.    For all thofe  per¬
sons were too intelligent , and knew too well how to love,  to be ignorant,
that aster a long absence it would have been some inhumanity to keep two
hearts that loved one another so persestly,  from communicating their thoughts
in private; so that presently aster they were risen from meat, some went into
the Cabinet, some into the Gallery, and ?..4^w/7/V« alone  remained in a corner of
the chamber with the Srench Marquis.    In the raean time IsubclU was not with¬
out unquietness, the remembrance of what Solman had said to her pofsessed all
her soul, andthe incertainty wherein she was, whether she sliould impart it to
J^M^/w, or whether she sliould not speak to him of it, put her minde upon the
■wrack.    What sliall I doc, said she toher sels, in so crofs an incounter? Isl con¬
ceal the truth of that which hath besallen me from him, I trespass against our asse¬
stion, andit may be put his lise and my honor in jeopardy : Butis I tell it tohim,
continued she, and he cannot forbear testisying somewhat of it, when as the Sul¬
tan hath injoyned me not to speak of it, we are undone, and nothing can save us.
Is I stay too, added she, till Solimtniends, to me forthe answer, which hc will have
nie give him within eight days, what stiall I doe then ? and what sliall  I say to
Jbrahim ? And is 1 come to the point to be constrained to acquaint him vvith his

him, and that he sent not the slave to me, but ondy to try my discretion, I should

musing' May I, said he unto her. Madam, without lofing the respest which I owe
unto you, coraplain to you of your sels,  in reproaching you for thac you have
notasrauch joy for my return, as yoa had gries for niy departure?   Is this be a
crime, said the Princess, it is true that I am guilty of it; yet can I assure you, ad¬
ded (hc, that it is not occasioned by any desest of assestion, but by an habit which I
have gotten of mdancholy, I am asslisted more easily than I am comforted ; I am
raore sensible of gries, than of joy; and in the estate wherein I sinde my icM,
there needs more things by sar to content mc , than there needs to render me insi¬
nitely unhappy. It is iiot,continued slie, becaust your return doth not give mc all
the joy thac I aai capable of, and even to that height, as without this remedy I an\
perswaded I sliould not have lived long ; but in conclusion wc are at Consiantinople,
and that is no litde evill.  Jbrahim hearing IsabelU speak in this fort,and observing
her eyes and her sace, hc contirnicd himsels yet more in the opinion which he had ;
so that to be the betcer cleared therein, I consess, said he unto her, that we arc al¬
wayes neerer to bad fortune, than to good; but you raust consess unto mc withall,
that untill such dme as .bV;»;/i« hath resused us the liberty which I ara to ask of
him, you havenot soniuch cause to be melancholick, as you had whenl parted
for Persia.    The event of the war was doubtsull; it might have been long; I mighc
have been beaten ; I might have dyed there; and slncc none of thcsc hath hapned,
and that I may justly demand my liberty for a recompence, why do I, Madam, see
mor: signs of gries in your rainde, than when we had all to sear, and noching to
hope for?   The Princess not answering precisely to Jbrahim, began to make him
partake her unquietness.     He believed then that he was raore unhappy than he
thoughc hc was; and suddenly calling to rainde the change which he had noted in
5o//w4«x sace, he no longer doubted but that there was foraething which Isabella
did not tdl hira.    What accident, said he unto her, Madara, is besallen us ? Hath
fortune invented some new torment to persecute us withall? Speak I earnestly
besecch you, and whatsoever itmay be, be pleased to let me know it.    Jsabella
would then have put him ofs, with assuring hira that (he had no new matter to ac¬
quaint him vvith ; but the more (he stood ofs, the more unquietness slie gave him :
Wherefore he began to cast in his minde what the mischiesmight be, which would
not bc told him; Hath any one, said he unto her, wronged you during my absence^
hath any body conspired against your li'c ? hath the hate which Ro.xeUnahe^iV^ me,
carried her to seek the means to hurt you ? would slie have sacdsiscdyou to her
revenge, as slic hath sacrisiscd Pdnce Musiapha to her rage ?  would they have for¬
ced you to change your Rdigion ? hath Ruslan plotted any thing against rae ? and
(that which would be ray last misery, and which I think cannot pofsibly be) is Sdli^
man becorae ray Rivall, or mine Enemy &gt; The Princess thereupon not able to retaiti
her tears, put her hand before her eyes to conceal them from Ibrahim.   Ah ' Ma¬
dam, said hc unto her then, gently pulling doWn her arra, do you answer mc with
tears? can it be poflible, that this Pdnce stiould hate me, or loVe you too much?
leave me not long in pain, and I beseech you, Madara, express your sels more clear-
ly. I would I could draw you out of it, answered the Pnncess still weeping,  but

IS no time to speak of that which is past, said the Pnncess unto him, but to think of

hatred and jeloulie had also some place in his soul; ncverthdess in the midst ofhis

he loved Solimanio much, that there were tome instants, wherein without conside¬
ring Isabella, and without considering himsds, he was asslisted for that this Prince
had given this blemisli to his lise. But when as he surprised himsels in this thought
hc repented ofit, as ofa crime, and recntrcd into his former sury.    At length aster
that Isabella and he had said all that their griesand assestion could suggestrand that
the Princess had related to Ibrahim all that slie beleeved vvas necessary hee sliould
know, the better to advise on that which they h.id to doe,they sound that their rea¬
son was too much troubled, and they themselves too much intcressed in the busi¬
ness in question, for to judge sbtindly thereof    They rdolved then to call unto
this counsell, both their he and she sriends; to the end that all ofthcra together
might seek out the meanes to avoyd the mischies that menaced them.    IsabelU iox:
that essest willed Emilia to czW them, and the Srench Marquis taking this imploy-
mentuponhini, brought this sair troup alittle aster into the Princess chamber,
ivho with teares in her eyes craved pardon of her deer sriends, for having made .i
secret to them of a thing, which slic would sain have concealed from hersels; and
then, having recounted the estate wherein (hee was with .Soliman, slie silled thdr
hearts with gries, both for the interest which they had in her fortune, and for thdr
own ; knowing very well that their liberty depended on Ibrahim and Isabella, vvho
being at odds themselves vvith Soliman,'were not like to obtain that for others,vvhich
they could not obtain for theraselves.    This misery rhen being common, they all
sell to think ofwhat niight bcdoiie.    Some would have Ibrahim, without testisy¬
ing any knowledge of this unjust love, pursue his sirst designc, and demand his
lihcnyoi Solman, because, said they, it may be that this Prince bdng asliamed of
his sault, and incensed with Isabellas constancie, will grant him his rcquest, and re¬
solvc to deprive himsels ofthe sight of a man whom he can no longer look upon
but with consusion, and of a person, whom it is impoflible for him to conquer. But
Ibrahim oppofed this opinion; for whereas he knew Salman sull wdl, he vvas sure
that love being (aicc entred into his heart, would never goe out ofit again but with
violence; andthat hecould not be capable of repenting, but v/henas the cnmes
Tvbich love made him commit, were sar greater than his paslion. Then it was pro¬
pounded, that no resoludon stiould be taken, till the dght daye.s which Solman
had given IsabelU to make her answer in, were expired; because the sight oUh-a-
him it iiiicht be had revived the snendstiip which he bore him, and had banishcd,or
dimisticd the lovc which he carried to her.    But is Ibrahim was oppoute to the hrlt
advice that was given, the Princess said that stie would never consent to this second:

<p>but two reniidies to be chofen, cithcrdeath or slight, The last is the belt, replyed
the Marquis, .and isl raay bc beleeved , it IhiU be the only thing we will think of.
This advise having been sound the surest and the ealicst, there was nothing m^ore
thought of, than of seeking out the meanes to extent; it.    It was not because Ibra¬
him did not upon the sirst apprehension of it sollow this opinion with repugnancy,
but because he was perswaded, that a Prince, who coram iticd sogrcat an insidelity
against hira,could not coraplain of hira with reason for his going out of his Erapire
vvithout his consent.    In this thought hcconsidcred with the rest, which way they
might draw theraselves out of captivity; in theend the resolution was, that Ibra¬
him, being able to doe what he would, stiould secretly assure himsds of a vessell;
and that untill it was ready to part, he Ihould see Salman as often as poflible hee
could, and take great care to keep him from suspesting that Isabella had spoken to
him ofhis lovc to her.   The rest ofthe day being spent in this fort, the nexe mpr-
ning the Grand Visier having understood that there was a Christian Vcssell which
was to set sail theday ensuing, wrought in such manner as hc absolutely assured
himsels of her ; and without any bodies being aware of it, he caused a great raa¬
ny Christian slaves, which were newly delivered, to enter into her.    Aster hc had
taken this order, he went tofee Soltman again, but it was with so rauch repugnan-
c^ie, as it sdl out well for hira that he did not see hira ;  it being raoft certain, that
•w)hcreas hewas  not accustomed to disguise his thoughts, it would have been
impofsible for him not to have testisied somewhat of that vvhich he had in his
heart. When hc arrived at the Seraglio,  he was told thac the Grand Signior vvas
at the Sultana Queens lodging ; andwhereas it was the onely place in the outward
Seraglio, where Ibrahim entred not, he returned to his Palacc;  and there as long
as the day lasted, he received the visits of all the Bassaes, Beglerbei s, and Sangiacs,
that were at Consiantinople.    Inthe mean tirae .S&lt;7/;&gt;»4« wasnot vvithout unquiet¬
ness, he would willingly have had Ibrahim alwaies with him, to keep him from
being viith Jsabella, and would willingly withall never have seen him, since he
could not do so without being asliamed ofhis sault; and indeed it was out of this
consideration that hewas gone to the Sultanaes lodging, that he might decline
the sight of hira.    It was not because his mind was quieter in that place than in
another; for he carryed his torraent in his heart.    His love, Jsabellaes constancy,
and J^M^/w/return, pofsesscd hira with strange thoughts; and in the diforder
wherein his soul was, hc made wislies against his own glory, and would that Jbra¬
him had been beaten in Persia ; that his Array had been deseated ; and that with a
^vvasull pretext he could banisti him from the Port,and retain Jsabella.lt yvis not
because he knew not rhat his designs were unjust, but  it was because his passion
was instead of reason to hira, and made hira deal inthis fort.    Roxelana on her
side was not in a little pain; (he snw JsabeU.t out oi the Seraglio j and albeit the
Slave, her consident, had assured her, that Soliman had not changed his mind for
this Princess, yet slic seared that seeing her no longer,' and seeing Jbrahim, the love
which hc bare to Jsabella  would diminisli, and that his good will to the Bassa
would reassume new forces. Howbeit slic hoped that Jsabella would acquaint the
Grand Visier with the love diat the Sultan bore her; and that thereupon sie would
do something which might give him opportunity to ruin hira. In this belies an
hour aster JsabelU was gone oue of the Seraglio slic senc to Will  Rusian that he
sliould caresully observe all Jbrahims astibns by the sarae Slave which before dmes
had informed him ofthe Love that he carried to Jsabella.    Rusian obeyed her so
cxastly, that what care socvcr theGrand Visier took to conceal his desissri    vet
did he suspest it.   Sirst hc understood that the Bassa had enquired, whether

a CapigM a Letter which he had written in case he could not speak vvidih
^oxelanah^d no sooner received it, but stie went her sels without surther consl.lt-
ing to acquaint Soliman with what Rusian had ceaisied ; and whereas this Pnnce,
blinded by his passion,sbught but for a pretext to complain oijhahm, he hearkned
to her with a great deal of impatience, which Ro.xelana having observed, slie made
use of the occasion, and told him, how slie had a long time known that Jbrahim sa¬
voured the Chnstians; that without doubt he had some hidden design,which could
not be comprehended ; and adding yet more to that which Rusian had wntten, sre
so wrought, that Solman, to bc cleared in the business, rdolved to send to Jbrahms
Palacc for him. And whereas there vvas no body about him whom hc judged tit for
it, Roxelana having propounded Rusian unto hira, who slie said was at the gate of
the Seraglio, he consented thereunto ; and having caused him to enter, the Sultan
commanded him to go to Jbrahims Palace, and will hira to come presently to him.
For Soliman doubted not, is it were true that he had caused a vessell to be made
ready, but that it was iox Jsabella,   or for his sriends; and that so, which soever ic
■were, he sliould have (^according to the mind he was in^a just occasion to ruin Jhra-
him. But Rusian was not like to sind him at home ; for as soon as it was night, he
had caused Jsabella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia, with the rest oftheir troup
to go secretly out ofhis Palace ; and he hinisels had got out aster thera thorough a
door of his Garden, which was towards the Port, to erabarquc himsels in that
veslTell which he had made to be prepared, and whereof the Cuptain and the Pilot
■were absoliitely his, by means ofthe raony which he had caused to be given to thcni.
Before his departure he had written a Letter to ^c^/iw^^, and had lest it with one
ofhis servants, with order, that is any one came to ask for hira srora the Grand Sig¬
nior, to deliver it unto him; sothat ^«/?^« arriving at his house, sound hira not.
It was in vain that he enquired aster him , and what care socvcr hc took for it, he
could learn no other, than that hc was not in his Palacc , that JsabelU, his sriends,
and her sriends, were not there neither; and that he had lest a Letter for the Grand
Signior. Rusian having taken it, sent to the Port to learn whether any vessell had
set sail, and then went in all hast to the Sultan,to acquaint hira with Jbrahims slight,
and present him with the Letter which he had written to him ; for hc durst not
conceal it, though gladly he would, because ra.iny had seen it delivered tohim.
My Lord,said he when he was come unco him,Jbrahim is no longer at Consiantinople.
This speech amazed Soliman; but when he knew thzt Jsabella vvas out ofhis power
he seha redoubling of love, jealousie, anger, hatred, dispair, and sury. And when
as Rusian had given him Jbrahims Letter, he broke up the seal with violcnce,and not
knowing whether he stiould read or tear it, hc stood a pretty while without speak¬
ing; but at length carded by his curiofity, or rather by his paslion, he opened it
lighing, and sound that it was thus.

ted his sury the raore. Let this ingratesull wretch, said hc to Rusian, be pursued ,
and let all that is poflible bc done to return him into ray power.   Roxelana entring
hereupon into Solim.ins chamber, from whence slic had gone a little aster Rusians
departure, and perceiving his mind to be in the tcarms wherein &lt;slie had long de¬
sired to have it, provoked his anger yet more; and propounded untohim the im¬
ploying of Rusian in the pursuit of Jbrahim : But that which slie thought cunning¬
ly to do succeeded not with her ;  her intention was so to use the raatter, as Rusian
sliould nothnd Jlirahim : For whereas her interest was, that be should no longer
have power, nor be longer at the Port, she seared is he sliould be brought back a-
gain, that she sliould not oblige ^o/w^« to ruin hini uttetly ; andso hemight re¬
turn into grace again.   Howbeit this design was not executed; for besides that she
could not speak with Rusian in private, the Grand Signiorso absolutdy comman¬
ded him to bring hira back Ibrahimund JsabelU, or never to return, as she vvas
constrained to let hini go without saying any thing tohim.   He wenc then in all
hast to take a Galley to pursue him, because hc had understood from him whom
he had sent to the Port, that a Christian vessell had set sayl by the Grand Visiers
order a little before. He imbarqucd himsels then with all the speed that pofsibly
he could; and not doubting but that he took the way of the Archipelago, he made
his Pilot hold the same course.   In the mean time Soliman wasnot without un¬
quietness; the privation of a good whichhe ardently desired, made him  regard
it as a thing yet more precious; IsabelU appeared to him more amiable than ever
hehad seen her; yea he beleeved thatit may be he might one day have won her
heart; and in this belies hc was insinitely asslisted. He looked upon Jbrahim with
hatred, and this Prince was so unjust, as no longer to remember cither his merit,
his courage, or the sriendship he had born hira ; nor to consider him inthis oc¬
casion but as his Rivall, and as a man who had stollen a person from him, of whom
he was insinitely amorous.    In this unjust thought he termed him ingratesull, he
called him ravilher, unsaithsull, and persideous; and thinking of nothing but how
to sind out means to ruin him, outof a sense of jealoulie hesaid, Were I sure that
I sliould never touch the heart oi Jsabella, yet 1 sliall alwaies have this advantage,
is they be brought back to mc again, thatl can separate them for ever ; and I stiall
at leastwise have this satissastion, that is 7y4^&lt;r//«be not mine, stie stiall never be
anybodies else.    WhiJst Soliman was incensing his sury and his rage, Jsabella and
that dear troup, which slie loved so rauch, were already thinking of giving thanks
to Heaven for their deliverance.    For  whereas they had embarqued'themselves at
the beginning of the night, they beleeved that when their slight came the next day
to be known, they sliould be then sar enough ofs srora being taken any more •   So
thn Jsabellaes raind was quiet enough   ; and the hope of^bcing soon out of the
Grand Signiors power, entertained her so agreeably, as sear had soarcely any place
in her sou .    Her sriends began also to be no longer assraid oiSoltman,\nd to be

for, andsearing that the Christian slaves which were in his Galley would n»t

force in this occasion, and thatby their means he might stay Ibrahim; sb that car¬
ried bythishope, and without inquiring whether thofe which they would take
wereTurkforChristians, they rowed with somuch vigor, as in a litde time his
Galley was within Cannon shot of/^r&lt;«^/;wx Vessell. And to keep him from sly¬
ing, he discharged apiece of Ordnance, to adveitise them that v^eve of the Guard
in the Castles of Sesiof and Abidus, that enemies vessells were in that place. This
device sailed not to work the expested essest; for Ibrahim knowing that there
were on both sides of this straight forty pieces of Ordnance planted even wit h the
■water, which without doubt would aster this signall discharge upon him is he at¬
tempted to pass, sound himsels strangdy troubled. For of one side he seared lest
hecould see //&lt;t^s//&lt;J carried away wich a Cannon- shot; on the other, Rusians vio-
lence \yas little less terrible to hini; and in this unquietness he commanded his Pi¬
lot to doe one thing, and byandby unsayedit again. IsabelU would have had
them expofe themselves rather to the sury of the Cannon, than to sight with Ru¬
slan ; but they were not long in an estate to choofe what they had to doc; for this
Galley which pursued them having overtaken them, and spite of their utmoft in¬
dcavours to the contrary having grapled hersds tothem, /^r^/?;^, sollowed by his
sriends, performed such things in this occasion, as lurpassed the valour of the moft

Turks, they never inquired surther, but joyned with them; M^d Ibrahim seeing his

by Rttsians comniandment, they had all the enemies upon them ; so that sight how
they could, number prevailed over valour, and Rusian made hitnsels Masser of the
Vessell, and of the persons whom he sought for ; and having forced them to pass
into his Galley he returned to Consiantinople.    These infortunate ones had yet the
contblation to make this voyage together without being separated; for Rusian,
busied about stopping theblood which he loft at the wound hc had rcceived,had not
the inhumanity to keep them from talking together.    Jbrahim was likewise as well
as Horatio, Alphonso, Doria, and the Srench Marquis, loaden with chains,   which

your liberty, as I purpofe to beseech it ofhim, 1 sliall dye even with pleasiire.   Let
us not separate our destinies, answered the Pnncess; either let us live toaether, or
let us dye together.   Aster sofad a discourse, the excess of thdr assestion forced
them to hold their peace; and their displeasure being sliut up in thdr heart, they
seltic more vively than they did, whom as they eased themselves with their com¬
plaints.    The unhappiness ofthe persons which were ingaged in their misfortune
asslisted them the niore;aiid they saw all about them so many occasions ofdispair,as
it niight be said, that never was the vertue ofa person put to so hard a triall.   Hi¬
polita, Sophronia, Emilia, and Leonida, were wholy dissolved into teares; Alphonso
Doria, Horatio, and the Srench Marquis, were also intinitdy asslisted : and is Rustan
could have been touched with  any compaslion,   hee had been doubtless with
so lamentable   an objest.    But sar  from  having  any   humanity for another,
he was cruell to himsels} for though he were wounded, yet the desire which
he had to destroy  Ibrahim, and to sinisli a thing which he had so well begun,
made hira in stead of repayring to his house to look to his wound, to goe di¬
restly to the Serraglio assoon as hc arrived   at Constantinople,   and to   behave
himsels so as ishe had not been hurt at all. Presently upon his landing, hee sent to
advertise Soliman ofhis return, and ofthe sacccss ofhis voyage. And whereas this
Prince had increased his sury with his solitariness, he instantly commanded, that
Ibrahim and Isabella should be brought into the Seraglio , and put into severall pla¬
ces with a sure guard; and that all thofe which had sollcwved them sliould bee put
likewise into another place.    Never was so deplorable a thing seen,as theexecution
ofthis commandment; Isabella would not quit Ibrahim, he too would not abandon
her; and though they had well enough foreseen that they sliould be separated, yet
could they not for all that consent thereunto.    Their srends likewise would not
leave them, and ii Soliman could have been a spcstator.ofsb sad a conversation, hee
might peradventure have been moved to piety.    But at length/(^/-/e/i/w znd Ija¬
bella, being constrained to resolve for that which they could not avOyd, took their
sarwell of each other, as persons that were never to see one another again ; and sol¬
lowing each other with their eyes as sar as they could, they sware unto themsdves
to dye loving one another as saithsully as they had mutually proraised.    Aster

<p>■which he saith appertains unco hinnBut he was never of the Race of the Paleobgues ;
And chen, continued he,is h t could perswade m: to it,that would be yec a surther rea¬
lon to oblige mc to destroy him.  Ic behoves he thould die ouc of reason of State, as I
pretend he stiall die out of reason of Love. Is I regard him as a slave, I have power o-
ver his lise,sinceevery slivethat breaks his irons deserves to lole it. is I regard him as
mysLibjcst,hc is worthy ofdeath for going out ofmy Eni^iiie withouc niy consent.
Is Iregard himas a Chdstian, I cannot hate him enough; andis I consider him as an
Eueiiiy-Prince,ic behoves he should die,that the end of his lise may make an end of sci"
ling my Throne to ray succesfors. Soliman having,as it seeraed to hira, seded his reso¬
lution sirmly enougli,sdc some rest in his minde.Howbeit suddenly some beam of light
coming to him again, he was astiamed ofhis own thoughts; yet would he not oppofe
them, but rather sought how he might fordsie them ; nevertheless there was one thing
that retained his sury for a while: Suppo(e,said he, that I resolve to destroy Jbrahim;
thathe be already punislied forhis ingratitude and persidiousness-, that the end ofhis
lise hath ended the lovc which he bears to Jsabella ; let us see  asterthis, whether
in thinking to do our sels service, wc do not hurt our sels: For can slie love a Prince,
who bereaves her ofthe person that is dearest to her in the world ? But can she, con¬
tinued he, love any other thai^ Ibrahim, as long as he is living? No, no, sayd
he raising   his  voyce , it  behoves  hee  sliould dye  ; and   I sliall  alwayes have
this consolation ,   that is  shee  love noc mee,    shee shall at  leastwise love no¬
thing in the world.   But Ccricd he again,  aster he had continued a while without
speakingj hc whom I will destroy, is the same Jbrahim who hath done me such impor¬
tant service, and whora I have so rauch loved; howbeit, continued he, it is Jsabellaes
Lover; it is a sugitive slavc;it is a revolted subjest; it is a Prince my enemy; or itmay be
an irapoftor.In such like thoughts as these was the Grand Signior,when as Rustan came
to hira, who ou.t ofhis raalice carried hira to surther violence against Jbrahim, by for¬
ging matters,vvhich he assimied hc had heard hira speak against hira. Presently therup-
on Roxelana entred, who, raaking as isslie did not know, that there was any interest of
love in the hatred which Soliman bore to Jbrahim , spake not but of the good ofthe
Scate,and ofthe glory ofthe Erapire. She represented to Soliman, how mightily hehad
alwaies protested the Christians in all occasions that had been presented; as indeed stie
lyed not. But although the moft part ofthofe things were done by Solimans consent in
the savor oijbr.thim, yet was this Prince so unjust, as to hearken to this accusation, a&amp;
is hehad been acquainted with new criraes.   Aster then that this wicked Woraan had
made him resolve to put Jbrahim to death, slie told him moreover,that is hast were not
made to take away his lise,the people undoubtedly would rise to save him;for,said slie,
ouc ofthe design w.iich hc hith had to usurp the Empire, he hath alwaies taken great
care to make hirasels to be beloved oi them. Selimanieeing hinisels upon the poinc of
absolutdy resolving the raatter,sdt a new corabat in his heart; lovc, hatred, jcalousie ,
srieiidsliip,sliame,andglory,did their last and uttcrnic st endeavor to vanquisli one ano¬
ther; but at length vertue was surmounted in this occasion by the wickedness of Roxe¬
lana and Rusian : And Soliman consented that without surther delay he stiould go and
execute this satall scntence, which their hatred,rather than hc, pronounced against the
illustdous J^r^W. Away hcwcnt with agreat deal of speed, for sear lest the Sultan
sliould alter his mind.   Nevertheless not dadng wholly to sail in the usuall form    he
sent iot Jbrahim to conic to supper; and this persidious wretch, who seared a revolt
kept all that were in the Seraglio srora going forth. In the raean tirae Jbrahm bdns set
at table as the rest, Rusian in the midst of the meal presented him with a robe of black
velvet, which was an undoubted mark, that the end of diis satal seast sliould be the end
ofhis lise : For aster thismanner is the news ofdeath denounced to persons ofquali
ty, that are to lofe their lives in the Seraglio. Jbrahim seeing his ruin cercain, received
this robe for all that with a great deal of constancie.   And whereas dt   was Drcsenrp.s

of sadness appeared in his sace,the intcrcstof//^^(r//^ alone was the cause of it;&amp; indeed

uncertainty of what shonld become ofher aster his death, which was scarcdy irksom

to his heart.
</p>
<p>The Sultana, who was not so scrupulous as Soliman, nor made so exast a profession of
keeping her word,did what slie could to perswade him not to keep his. No, said he unto h; r,
I may not sail in it ; and had I promised my Empire and my Liberty, I should descend from
my Throne, and put on the Irons my sds which I was to wear. Jbrahim must live, ('nee I
have promised it j I have sworn by ALL A, and that is to say all that can be said. I should
draw down the wrath of Heaven upon me; and I should do that which I have never done,
isl should do otherwise. I have observed all that ever I have promised in my lise, even with¬
out an Oath; having then sworn so solemnly, I may by no means break is. I sliould destroy
mine enemy, but thereby I should bring one into my heart, that would persecnre me eternjlly j
and repentance, which is a motion unknown to me, would without doubt sind place in my
Soul. At length ascer a long concestacion, Roxelana pet(wided Soliman, to take the advice
oi the Muphti, whoflieknew was absolutely hers, as having gotten him the place which he
held during/^r^ibjw's absence. And a\bdt Soliman did not think that this man could sind
out any thing that would satissie him, yet he sent for him. When he was come, and that
Roxelana, in propounding the matter unto him, had dextrously signisied to him that slie de¬
sired the death oi Ibrahim; this man, who naturally had wit, malice, and cunning, was ncver¬
thdess sussiciently troubled to answer precisely unto that which was demanded ofhim for the
contenting oi Roxelana. He (aid then that this assair was not to be spoken of precipitously;
and having required an hours time to think of it, aster he hsd caused Soliman to repeat unto
him the very same words, which he had before-time used to Ibrahim, he sdl deeply a musing:
But he was not long in searching out that which he did not think to sind; My Lord, said he to
Soliman, the Prophet, whom we worship, hath no^doubt inspired me with that which I
am going to tell thy Highness, that thou mayst be able to punish him whom thou wouldsi:
destroy. And when as SeUman had asked him how he thought to perform that which he said,
he obliged him to repeat once more unto him the promisc which h« had made to Ibrahim. I re¬
member it but too wdl, answered the Sultan, and lo the very words which I spake. Re¬
member (said I unto him) hare I swear unto thee by kLL h., that as long as Soliman lives^
tkott siialt not dye a violent death. This susticeth, replyed the Muphti, for, my Lord, to
express my thought to thy Highness; is it not true, that the promise, which thou hast raade
to Ibrahim, is a thing which cannot secure him but only during thy lise ? and is it not cer¬
tain, that thy Succesfors should not be obliged to preserve hira i* It being so, my Lord, said
he unto him, it will not be hard for me to content thee. For thy Highness having promised
Ibrahim, that he (hall not dye a violent death, as longas Soliman lives ^ iss Can make it ap¬
pear to thee, that there are every day some hours, wherein Soliman doth not live, it will ap¬
pear to thee by the same reason, that during the said time Ibrahim may dye,without breaking
of thy Highness word.
</p>
<p>The J'w/s^jw hearing him speak thus, beleeved that this man knew not very wdl what he
would say; but the ocher noching daunted, and speaking to him with as much considence,
as ishe had been inspired from Heaven; My Lord, said he unto him, it is a matter whereof
nobody is ignorant, that Sleep is called the brother of Death by all Nations, and in all Lan¬
guages; and truly it is not without caiise thathe is termed so, it being certain, that a man
which is asleep cannot with reason be said to be living, since we see thathe is deprived ofall
ths sunstions of a reasonable lite, which alone is thelise ofman: I consess indeed how in
that estate he still enjoys the lise of plants, but not that of man, which consists not but in the
use of Reason, whereof he is wholly berest in that estate. Sleep equals Kings and Shepherds
as well as Death, the stupid and the witty, thehappy and the unhappy, good raen and bad ;
and there IS no disserence seen between them, buc chacsl;epis aihoct death, and death an
eternal sl;ep. Wherefore it being evident, that a m^n asleep cannpt (to speak reasonably)
be said to be living, I conclude from thence, that thy Highness, without breaking thy word
may take away Ibrahim'^ lise when as sleep hach throughly benummed thy sense and Reason!
^».rs/4«4 sailed not to approve of this advice, and maintained thac he had spoken judiciously]
mioxSoltmrn, he yielded notwith so much sacility; he made many objestions to the
Mnphti, whereunto he still answered, with as much cunning as wickedness.

<p>Thas, although this Prince hid a very piercing wit in all other things, yet the desire which
he had to mtke^my Ibrahim, perswaded him that the yl/a;)!;^* had Reason; and that he
might put the grand Visier to death when he was asleep. For, this wicked man said to him
thy Highness hath not absolutely promised him, not to put him to death, but only, that he
Jhould not dye a violent death, as long as Soltman lives, and Soliman (hall not lire,' when as
the Bassa (hall dye. This design being conduded, it was resolved, that they stiould tarry till
night was come for the executing of it. For whereas sleep is not a voluntary ast, they thoueht
it requisite to attend till the time of sleep was come.
</p>
<p>In the mean season Ibrahim had been broughc back to the place which served him for a
prison, not knowing whether grace would bc shewed him, or whethei bis execution was but
deserred. This incertainty was almoft: as displeasing, as the assurance ofan approaching death
had been grievous to him; yet did he not ask any thkig that regarded himsds direstly, but only
enquired aster Isabella, who on her part was not without a wodd of gries, siie had under¬
stood, thn Ibrahim had been lead to a place, where oftentimes thegrandSisiers hiibtm
deprived of their lives, and that made her to be as much asslisted, as is slbe had already seen
him breathe out hts last. It may be, said (he, that now whil'st I am speaking su/iiniano is
desending himsds against his Executioners; it maybe he is yielding up his last breath, and is
thinking of me once for all. Ah I is it be so, ayed she, I beseech Heaven at leastwise to spare
me the asslidion that I may not hear of his lofs, and by my death to keep me from the gries
of limeating his. Howbeit I sear, said she, that my prayers will not be heard, and that So¬
liman's Csuelty will let rae live to persecute me: But let him arm his Executioners, let hiin
invent torments, I will complain no more aster this forrow; he that shall acquaint me with
the lofs oi Justiniano, shall render me insensible to all others. Alas I what say I ? added stie,
it seems in hearing me speak, that I will conserve my lise aster he shall be deprived of his; no,
no, Isabella ^'^notiwiKVii'iustinianox; and that which the rage oi Soliman will not do,
gties jdonc shall execute: Let this unjust Prince do what he will, I hope, that I shall get out
ofhis power, by getting out ofmy lise; Heaven is interessed in the prayer which I make unto
it; I beg this grace of it to preserve mine innocence j and is my despair be a sault, I hopeic
will pardon it in regard of the greatness of my misfortane, of the parity of ray assedion, and of
mine own weakness.
</p>
<p>In this deplorable estate, Isabella having understood, that Ibrahim had been brought back
to his quarter, hope began again to sind some place in het Soul; and stie beleeved that.yo-
liman having desired to see him, had peradventure been moved to compaslion: Sophronia,
mpalita, Leonida, Emilia, and the rest of their Troop, which were in another place, had
the same hope, hearing what had past: But the matter went otherwise; for as soon as nighc '
was come, Rusian, who wholly governed this deadly ceremony, went himsels a second time
to ietch Ibrahim by ±z Grand Signior's Command. He led him then into thesame HaU,
where formerly he had been; and having lest him in the company of sour mutes, which were
to strangle him, as soon as ^('//w-iw was asleep, he returned to this Prince, whohadatthat
time no greater a longing then to make away Ibrahim. As for him, although he did not seat
death, and was exceeding peaceable, yet had his Soul g'^e^ag.tanons. Ah saidhe o h.m.

</p>
<p>Hereat Ibrahim redoubkd his gries, and his mind seeking for new occasions to torment him,
he was taken wich a remorse ot Conscience for having solong a time worn a Twr^jTZ-habir.
He was perswaded that the misery whereinto he was talkn was a punisliment for this disscm-
bling. He thought he had been ill counselled, and though his intention had been pure, and
that he had not done it but out of a design to setve Christendom, to whom it had been very
proficable, and that his saith had never been sliaken, yet he beleeved notwithstanding thathe
was saulty. This reslexion made him list up his spirit to Heaven; crave pardon for his levity j
repent him of his misdeeds; and then pray that Isabella's innocency might not be involved in
the chastisement of his crirae.
</p>
<p>The list thing that yet asslided Ibrahim was, that in his misfortune he could not sind any
that would tell the Sultan that which he had resolved to request of him in the savor oilsa¬
bella, iot Rusian had taken order to the contrary. He had also by the power of Roxelana
kept every body from going ouc ot the Serraglio, ascer/^r^^/Vw was enered inco it; sothat
akhough it was known in Consiantinople, that there was some great diforder between Soli¬
man and Ibrahim, yet the people did not susped, that the Sultan could hate him with so
much violence -, for it they had been of that opinion, loving Ibrahim as they did, they would
withouc doubt have set sire on the Serraglio, rather then not have succored hira.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Ruslun being returned to SoLman, whofe mind was ^ull of nothing but
deadly thought?, this Prince, to satissie that santastick scruple, which obliged him not to be¬
leeve the death of Ibrahim to be unjust, but becanse he had promised him, that he sliould not
dye as long as he lived, commanded him to keep at his beds head, and to be sure not to go to
put Ibrahim to death, till he was sast asleep. Alter tliis order given, Soliman layd him down
with an intention (isone may be permitted to speak so) as it were to summon sleep with si¬
lence and'quietness. He did what he could to divert his raind srora all kind of objeds j to
the end that ceasing to think, hc might the more easily let himsds be vanquished by this invi-
sibk Enemy, who-always surmounts thofe more easily which resist him, then thofe which
setk him.
</p>
<p>The Sultan, being thus recolleded within himsels, remained a while with so much tran¬
quillity in appearance, as RaSlan beleeved that he was asleep, and that he might go and put
Jbrahim to death j But he had scarcely made one step, when as this Prince rising up in his bed.
Stay, siid he unto him, I am noc asleep; and I will not have thee part from hence, till thou
art certain I am so. Rusian, not daring to contradid the GrandSignior, and searing to
make him more awake then be was, ishe talked longer to him, only promised him not to ofser
any more to go ouc ot his chamber, till he was wtll assured that he could hear nothing. Aster
this Solman did yet all that he could to sleep j howbeit he had no sooner clofed his eyes, but
his unquietness augmented; he was vexed that he could not be master o s his thoughts, and
thac chat which he did to provoke sleep, was that which awakened him the more. He turned
him on one side, and then on the other, and yet was not able to sind any rest. One might
have said that hc met with chorns every where; that the change of place redoubled his un¬
quietness; and whtn of purpofe he forbore from speaking, and complaining aloud, his sighs
gave Rustan but too many signs thac he was not asleep. Soliman'^ impatience growing
stronger, he thought is he walked a white, chat it may be he (hould become drowzy wittt
weariness: He got ouc ofhis bed chen, and walking somecimes wich violence, and sometimes
with less precipicanon, it might have been said, that he was the cause of as much unquietness
to Rustan, as he s U himsds, to see that he gave him not the means to execute the desires of
the cruel Roxelana. He stood still many timej, and then began again to walk saster then he
had done. Asterwards he leaned down in one place, and then in another, scarcdy knowing
what he did, nor what he would do. When as he had walked a long tirae, and that through
weariness he had layd himsds down again upon his bed, he sound yet less dispofition to sleep
then before; forhis agitation having disljpated some vapors, which peradventure might have
lulled his Reason, and charmed his displeasure, he no sooner had a mind to clofe his eyes, but
t'.is imagination represented things yet more lively unto him j And whereas a long time before

<p>he had had none but violent paslions, such then too were all his thoughts. How unhappy am
I, saidhe to himsdtl I sind an impofsibility in all that I desire; the least things are forbidden
me; evensl-ep, which asl my Subjeds enjoy, is to me a prohibited good; that which I do
to get it, IS that which deprives me ofit; and though I change place, yet still is it all one with
me ; sur( ly I must be separated from my sds, is I will sind the rest which I seek for. h Le
I am more an enemy to my sds, then Ibrahim is, yea and I am more unhappy then he.
</p>
<p>Aster his onqaietness had made him change pbce an hundred times, Ruilan, seeing day ap¬
proach, would have persvvaded him not to amuse himsds about this scruple, and to permit
him to go and strangle Ibrahim with his own hands, to punisli him,said he,for the unquietness
which he givrs thy Highness: But SoHmart spake unto him with so much sury, as he was con.
strained to hold his peace.   This crud motion oi Rustan's, struck this Prince wich horror, and
whereas ic is a way co compassion, leaning on a table, which was near to his bed, his imagi¬
nation insensibly presented him with other objeds.   He saw Isabella all in tears for the death
oi Ibrahm; yea it represented to him thedeplorableestate wherein he was; he remembred
the time when he was his Slave; and that glorious day, wherein loaden with chains hehad
saved hitn his Empire and hislise: And comparing ic with that wherein he was then, he could
not chuse but be moved at it.   Aster this, tne sight of Rustan brought to his memory all the
miseries of his house, and all the violences which he had done by his, and Roxe Una's counsel.
The deith of Musiapha, that oi Sarraida, oi het son, oi Gianger, the forcible carrying
zw^y oi Axiamira, her imprisonmcnt, theWitoi Per(ia, the things vihich Ibrahim hid
performed therein, the denhoi Zele bta, and many other such like things, which silled his
mind with so many deadly ideas, as the love which he bore to Isabella began to be too weak
to dissipate them.   He sdt some repugnancy in his heart for that which he did; and his Reason
being suddenly untangled, What do I, said he to himsds, sensless that I am, not to consider,
that the impofsibility which 1 sind to destroy a disarmed man, whom I hold in my bands,
who is loaden with irons, and who is without desence in the midst of his Executioners, is
wichoat doubt a sign that Heaven proteds him. For is it were not so, I had destroyed him
ere this; I had not promised him so long ago that I would not put him to death; I had not
remembred it so precisdy ; this Artisice, which they have sound out for me to be revenged,
had succeeded ; I had slept, and Ibrahim had been dead.   But I see plainly, as I have said,
that Heaven guards him, and that it will not let me bc revenged.  But ahs! said he still to
himsels, sot whit crime, for what in/ury, for what outrage will I be revenged ? No, no,
continued he, i^r^^iw is not guilty, and I alone am the ofsender; for I owe all things to
him, and he owes nothing to me.   It is true, that he would have gone out of my Empire
without my leave, but it was to save his Mistress; and this generous man, who might have
overthrown all my State, to secure himsels, and to be revenged of the insidelity which I have
used to him, was contented to sly away like a simple Slave. Let us harken to Reason which
speaks to us; let us barken to the voyce of the Prophet who holds our hand; and let us barken
no longer to this un/'ust love that pofsesscth us.
</p>
<p>Here Soliman could not retain his tears, and the love which he bore to IsdelU made him,
that he still sound some dissiculty in resolving to be deprived of her: But is«/?rs»'s endevoring
once more to carry him to violence, made him indine wholly to Vertues side. No, no, laid

<p>resolutions; and during the agitations of his Soul, hecryed our sometimes, O Heaven 1 must
Jbrahim be destroyed ? then sudd-^nly checking himsds; but also,said he, can I resolve to lofe
JsabelU! Aster this, he sat him down on sour Cusliions, and hiding his sace with both his
hands, leaning on a table, as it were the better to think of that which he would resolve of,
Rusian reraained in strange pain.
</p>
<p>In the mean tirae Ibrahim could not comprehend, for what reason they made him attend
solong for his death. He seared kst some vic^ence (hould be done to IsabelU; he doubted
lest they stiould be so cruel as to put her to death before his eyes; and in this pain, death no
doubt would have been a remedy unto hira, had not the thought of never seeing IsabeUa again
rendred it raore grievous to him, for that consideration, then for the lofs ofhis lise. The dis¬
orders ofhis Soul for all that appeared not in his sace; and one would hardly have bdeeved in
looking on hira, that he did think he should dye every rainutsi. Isabella, on het part, was
not without trouble; tor having understood, that they came to setch Ibrahim, slbe certainly
beleeved that he was loft, and was already preparing to sollow him, when as they, who had
order togo for her, entred all into her chamber. As soon as slie saw them, and that they had
told her how they had order to carry her before Soliman; is it be to put me to death in his
presence, answered slie, I will give him thanks: But acquaint me at leastwise, whether /-
trahim be living, and whether we shall dye together or no. These men, not knowing So¬
liman's inrenrions, durst scarce answer her; only they assured her that she (hould see the
^rattd Sister very suddenly, as indeed they led her into the Hall where he was, attending the
time ot his execution. There were seen about him his Guards weeping, and sour Mutes that
were to strangle him, and that having in their hands Bow strings of black silk for that purpofe,
seemcd also to haue some compassion ofhim.
</p>
<p>This dolesul objed having touch'd the heart of Isabella, (he could not forbear giving a
great skriek: Alass, sakl slie, how do I repent me of my wish I and how much more support¬
ablc had it been for me to dye alone, then to dye with you ? Ibrahim leeing and hearkig her
speak thus; What, Madam, said he unto her, will they attempt upon your Ise? Abl no,no,
continued he, turning him to thofe that invironed him, it is a thii^ I sliall never endure:
when they stiall meddle with none but me, I will tender my neck to them without resistance;
but is they attempt any thing on this Princess, I prc^est that I will strangle him with mine
own hands that sliall ofser any outrage to her. This is not that which I will have, answered
slie; desend not my lise, is they attempt upon yours, since they are to be inseparable. I
have not wiOi'd to live, but onely that I may not see you dye. As they would have continued
speaking, they thac came for them told them, that they had nothing else in charge but to car¬
ry them before the C^r^iw^ Signior. Let US go then, said the Princess to him, let us go my
dear Justiniano; I repent me of my weakness, and since I must dye, provided that I dye in
your presence, I sliall be glad that we may dye together: Let us go then and beg for death of
Soliman as a grace. Ah ! Madam, cryed the illustrious Bajsa, speak not of your death, is
you will not have me dye in despair. Let us go, Madam, let us go rather to beg your liber¬
ty of Soliman, and obtain of him that the lofs of ray lise may be the price of it. I will not
have it without you, answered sbe, wherefore persist not in wishing to save me.
</p>
<p>In the mean rime||)ey an-ived it Soliman's Chamber, whom they sounci still leaning on a
Table, and in a poftuVe, that they could not see his sace. As soon as they were there, Ibra-
/i/w and//4^s//«j cast themselves at his seet; My Lord, said thePrincess, is I may obtain the
grace of thee, that I may dye with Justiniano, I will not complain of thy Highness; but
contrarily I will praise thy justice. I am guilty, my Lord, and of an horrible crime against
thee. I have made thee despise the sriendsliip which thou barest to Jusliniano; I have made
thee abandon Reason ; I have put a stam on thy lise; I have blemistied thy glory; I have
troubled thy rest; and I have constrained the greatest Prince of the Earth to oppofe all his in-
dinations, which carry him to vertue, for to solbw an unjust passion. Thou plainly seest, my
ford, that wrath ought to have a more just soundation in thy soul, then this Love, which as-
slidsthee, and persecutes me. Change thy passion in my savor, but in such fort, that as I
have been the objed of thy love, so I may be likewise of thy hate. Think of revenging thy
sels on the true cause of thy unquietness; think of destroying, and not of gaining me • the
last IS impofsible, and ttie other is very easie for thee. It isnot because, is my tears could
move thee, I can yet assure thee that hate sliould have a place in my soul: For know, my Lord,

<p>that tNenJusliniano, from whom thou wilt takeaway, both his honor, his lise and mv
personwhich is as dear to him as both the other,yet cannot hate thee. 1 have seen it m his eve?
I have known .t by his discourse; he complains of fortune; he accuses that which thv Hieb^
ness calls beauty in me; he names that weakness, which another would name injustice •!«
pne, my Lord, being ready to dye innocently by thy diredions and command, yet am I well
aslured, that he will dye without hatred; and that even in dying, he wisl make vows toob
tain of Heaven an advantageous change for thee. Judg aster this, whether thou oughtest to
rduse me the grace that I may dye, andthat he may be saved, since I am guilty and he is in¬
nocent.
</p>
<p>My Lord, said Justiniano interrupting her, barken not to tbe vertuous IsabelU, but to ad¬
mire the greatness of her courage, and sussernotthy sess to be perswaded to tha: which stie
desires of thee. I will not stand to examine whether I am culpable, or whecher I am not
sincc to be hated of thee, is tobe so j but, my lord, I will onely tdl thee, that is the
sentence of my death sliaU be pronounced by thy mouth, I will not murmur at it. I
consess my weakness to thee, my Lord; I cannot yet believe, but that all that which
I have seen since my return, is an inchantment, and noc a truth. For bow can it be
imagined, that great Soliman, who hath loved me so tenderly, and given me so glori¬
ous marks thereof, can be carryed at this present to such unjust designs? That with the
same hand, wherewich he broke my chains, and put the reyns ot his Empire inco mine, he
can puc about my neck the string which is to strangle me. Doth thy Highness no longer re-
member tbe thoughts which thou hadst, at such time as, seeing me ready to enter into the
grave, rather then displease thee with craving my liberty of thee, thou resolvedst to have the
incomparable Isabella be brought away by force. Was it then, my Lord, out of a design to
ravish her from me, to persecute her, to blemish thy glory, and to take away my lise, in ha¬
ving unjust thoughts sot her ? Think not, my Lord, of, the services I have done thee, but of
thofe which I purpofed to do thee; yet think noc of them, my Lord, for to pardon me, bat
think of them ro i^ve Isabella. Restore herto her liberty, make not me ihe cause of het
undoing, send her back into her Country, and aster that put me to death here. But grant me
at leastwise the grace to pronounce my sentence unto me; for I conless to thee once more,
that I doubt whether it be pofsible, that thou sliouldst be the same Soliman which hath so
dearly loved me.
</p>
<p>It is in vain for you to desire, did Isabella, that we sliould be separated; that thought is
unjust, and does wrong to our assedion; ic is a motion whereof I repent me, and whereof
you ought to repent you. Beg then of Soliman, that we may dye, or that we may live toge¬
ther ; for provided he will grant of this, I will attend bis sentence, without gries, and
wishout unquietness. You sliall live, said i'o/j&gt;w&lt;i» then to ber, discovcring his sace, which
he had all bathed with tears; yon sliall live, generous Princess, Ibrahim's vertue bath sur¬
mounted me. Approach, said he unto him, and is it be so that thou doft not bate me still,
believe for a certain, that the good-wiH which I have born thee is recovering its place in my
Soul: Repentance, which was a motion unknown tome, chases the love of IsabelU hom
it, therein to rcestablisli my sriendsliip to Ibrahim ; I sed it coming, my Reason re-assumes
its use; I see my injustice and my violence with consusion; I see tbe vertue of IsabelU, and
no longer see her beauty; slie strikes mc with admiration, and no longer strikes me wuh
love; Iwislilcould imitate her generofity, and no longer desire the pofsession of her. /«

<p>Doubt not of that which I say, replyed Soliman, and the better to assure you thereof, I
permit you, said he unto her with a voyce interrupted wich sighs, to go out of my Empire
when you please: I should also be generous enough to share it with Ibrahim, to whom it
appertains more justly then to me, is I could insase into the hearts of my subjeds the thoughts
which are in mine.
</p>
<p>During this di'course/?«/is&lt;e» was in a strange unquietnese; and when as he believed that
Soliman had bib minde busied, and did not think ot him, he would have slipt out of the
Chamber, to go and advertise Roxelana of that which was doing: But Soliman perceiving it,
Stay, said he unto him, insamous wretch ; and then he commanded him to be turned out oi
the Serraglio, without permitting him to speak to any body; and charged him with a great
deal of sury never to sliew himsds more before him. Aster this, he sent for the vertuous
Achmat, vnd ths Sultana Asteria. It isby these two persons,'said he to Jbrahim, thatl
will be counselled, to know what way we may take, that Jusliniano may cease to be Ibra¬
him, without making a noise amongst thepeople, which mighc prejudice my State: For as
for my sels, continued he sighing, it isso little a while since my Reason hath recovered its
place, as I dare not yet rely upon ic. Ibrahim, whom we will call moft commonly hereas¬
ter Justiniano, answered the Grand Signior with as much generofity as joy; for wheras he
had exceedingly loved this Prince, how great soever that was which he sdr, to (ee Isabella
escaped from so great a danger, yet was he not a little glad also to see in Soliman the marks
of his ancient vertue again.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, aster thst the Sultan had acquainted the sage Achmat, and the generous
Alleria with the business in question, in such terms, as well declared the repentance of his
soul; and aster they had commended the resolution he was in, and mightily consirmed him in
the design which he had to restore Jttsliniano and Isabella to their liberty ; Achmat, who ne¬
ver knew of Justiniano's disguising till then, counselled^ since the matter was so sar advanced,
that the people (hould be made to believe, how the Grand Signior had put Ibrahim to death,
upon some discovcry that he had held intelligence with the Emperor Charts, and savored
the Christians in all things; yea and that some leccers too sliould be forged, which should be
said he had been made to consess, by which means the matter would easily be credited, be¬
cause it was true that every one knew, how the illustrious 'Bassa had always proteded ihe
Christians. He said moreover, that is the business was not carryed in that lore, it would be
impofsible to sinde out a plausible pretext to keep the people from suspeding some trick in the
:^{enceoi Ibrahim, which might produce dangerous consequences.
</p>
<p>This advice being approved of, yet because Justiniano and Isabella could not be sent a-
way towards Genoua presently, it was thought requisite to have them secretly conveyed to
Pera, and there to remain concealed with thofe Greel^ Pnests, whom Jusliniano had so much
savored, until such time as a vessel could be made ready for them. This sarewell could not
be taken without sliedding ofa world of tears; Solimatt craved pardon oi Justiniano and Isa¬
bella, who aster they had answered him with tenderness and submission, and assured him that
they would forget what was past, desired him he would be pleased to give their sriends theic
liberty, which the Sultan having granted them, they were sent for and conduded along with
them to Tera. The Sultana Asieria and Isabtlla said to one another all that a moft slrid
sriendstiip could make two generous persons say in such like encounters. And the ptudentyscA-
)w&lt;«/,charging himsels with the condud oi Justiniano and his Misiress, conveyed them with all
dieir Troop aboard a Barque, whrch arryed them to Pera. Soltman could not for all that lee
Isabella part, without soHowing her with his eyes, nor could he see Jbrahim go away with¬
out forgetting//&lt;«^s//&lt;i; it being moft certain, that never was there a truer repentance, then
that of this great Prince.
</p>
<p>In the mean time to make it be beleeved that Ibrahim was dead, a black Standart was set up
before the gate ofhis Palace: Achmat, searing a sedition, put all the ^&lt;j»&lt;i«ri« into arms,
and gare them to understand, that Ibrahim was a Traytor, that he bad gone about to over¬
throw the Empire, and that his death had been absolutdy necessary for the preservation of the
StA\e. He sliewed them also certain forged Letters, to give the mote credit to that which he
said But whatsoever he could say, no sooner was the black Standart seen before the gate of
bis Pilace, but all the people began to murmur; There was nothing but weeping and crying

<p>Thofe Janizaries that had been the best perswaded, lest not for all that tobe exceedingly
asslided; for he was so universally beloved, as there was not any body which did not lament
and commend him. Some said, that Roxelana wichout doubt was the cause of this mischies
and that slie still remembred, how he had been the Protedor of Prince Mustapha. Somt
cryed out to have at leastwise the body of their Desender given unto them; others, that his
Executioners might be delivered into their hinds; and all of them together agreed in thebe^
lies, that Soliman had loft the force of his Empire, and tbe support ot his State.
</p>
<p>During this tumult, /?»/?&lt;!» passing through a street, thepeople, who bad understood bv
some thathad been in the Serraglio, how it was be which bad been made use of for this
deadly Ceremony, and that he had put Ibrahim to death, sell upon him with so many impre¬
cations, and with soch sury^ as they tore hira in a thousand pieces. Sroni thence they went
to his Palace, to set it on sire; but at length the prudent Achmat, having appeased this sedi.
tion, tetatnedto ihe Serraglio, where hesound that Heaven had made an tnd of revenging
Jusiiniano on his enemies. For Roxelana having understood that he was not dead, and that
Rustan had been torn in pieces by the people, this sierce and proud spirit, was so sensibly
touched with sp'ght for that she could not exercise all her whole sury, that aster she bad con.
tinued three hours together without speaking aword, slie dyed for very rage and tnadness;
and Justiniano had the satissadion to know, that he was lamented of all the world, and th«
the only persons which could rej&gt;yce ac his death had been punislied for their in-
just.'ccs.                                                                                         -.y,

<p>In the mean t\mt Achmat hy Soliman's Commmdczuied the same Christian Vessel tobe
made rr3dy,which Justiniano had formerly used to get from Constantinople; and in one night
l^esent aboard her all the riches of/^r&lt;»scj»»'s Palace, and agreat dea\moj:e, which hewa
constrained to accept of against his inclination. The Sultan Wrote also with his own hand
to tbe illustrious Bassa, and again assured him of his repentance and assedion, whereunto Ju-
stiniano and Isabella answered with a great deal of generofity. The dtzihoi Roxelana touch,
ed Soliman less, then it would have done at any other time. For as he could not but remera¬
ber that slie had been rhe objed of his assedion; so could he not but much more remember,
that slie hsd been the cause of all bis misfortunes, and ofall his crimes, and that slie would have
carried him to put to death the only man of the world whom moft he loved.
</p>
<p>This sdgned death of Ibrahim was carried with so much address by the prudent Achmat,
that every body bdeeved it tobe so; and that is it which hath made Taulm Joviw, and alt
thofe which have spoken of the raign of Soliman, to lay, that the grand Sister ^etxiiiedh

as they sliould come to genoua, they would render their fortunes inseparable, as indeed
they did. The wind having been extreamly savorable to them, they arrived'in a sew days at
Monaco; where the Princess was received of her Subjeds with as much astonishment as joy.
The brute of their return being presently got to Gs«e«^, the chies of the Senate came thither
to vilit them.

<p>Ttiesc illustrious persons concealed so much of their adventures, as they thought was not
sit to be spoken of; and having been intreated by their sriends, that they would aster so ma¬
ny misfortunes celebrate the cereraony of thdr nuptials at Genoua • Isabella yielded thereunto
with blulhing: for which essed they parted away tbe next day, and sliortly aster the lAsx-
ia^tsoi Justiniano ind I/^bella, oi Haratto and Hipolita, oi Daria ind Sophronia, and of
Alphonso and Leoni&amp;i, v/ere solemnized with all pofsible magnisicences.   The Srench Mar¬
quiss and Emilia promtsed anew an inviolable sriendship to one another, with an oath that
neither of them would ever marry: and during certain days there were nothing but Balls,
unning at the Ring, and publique Seasts.   Aster which Justiniano and IsabelU bling re-
;ntred into the pofsession of all that belonged unto them, they were conduded with a great
leal of state to Monaco-, where the|||jircd with as much satissadion, as they had had mis-
haps; y»^»«w«o esteeming himsels raSrc happy inthe pofsession oi IsabeHa, then is hehad
reconquered the Empire of his Sathers. But by a revolution which commonly arrives in all
things, it is come to pass, that the Principality of Monaco is retiujned into a branch of the
House of the Grimaldies, which pofsesseth It at this day, under the protedion of
Spain; nothing remaining of Justiniano but the memory of his glorious
adions; which certainly are great and samous enough, to oblige
Pofterity never to lofe the remembrance of
