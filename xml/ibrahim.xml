<head>THE PREFACE.</head>
<p rend="italic">I Do not know what kind of praise the Antients thought they
gave to that Painter, who not able to end his work, finished
it accidently by throwing his pencill against his Picture; but
I know very well, that it should not have obliged me, and
that should have taken it rather for a Satyre, than an Elogium. The operations of the spirit are too important to be left
to the conduct of chance, and I had rather bee accused
for fayling out of knowledge, than for doing well without minding it. There is
nothing which temeritie doth not undertake, and which fortune doth not bring
to passe; but when a man relyes on those two guides, if he doth not erre, hee
may erre; and of this sort, even when the events are successfull no glory is
merited thereby. Every art hath its certain rules, which by infallible meanes
lead to the ends propofed; and provided that an Architect takes his measures right, he is assured of the beauty of his building. Beleeve not for all this,
Reader, that I will conclude from thence my work, is compleate, because I have
followed the rules which may render it so; I know that it is of this labour, as
of the Mathematicall Sciences, where the opperation may fail, but the art doth
never fail; nor doe I make this discourse but to shew you, that is I have lest
some faults in my Book, they are the effects of my weakeness, and not of my
negligence. Suffer mee then to discover unto you all the resorts of this
frame, and let you see, is not all that I have done, at leastwise all that I have
indevored to doe.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Whereas we cannot be knowing but of that which others do teach us, &#x0026; that it
is for him that comes after,to follow them who preced him, I have beleeved, that
for the laying the ground-plot of this work, we are to consult with the Grecians,
who have been our first Masters, persue the course which they have held, &#x0026; <sic>iabour</sic> in imitating them to arrive at the same end, which those great men propounded to themselves. I have seen in those famous </hi>Romanzes<hi rend="italic"> of antiquity,that
in imitation of the Epique Poem there is a principall action whereunto all the
rest, which raign over all the work, are fastned, and which makes them that they
are not imployed, but for the conducting of it to its perfection. The action in</hi> 
Homers Iliades <hi rend="italic">is the destruction of</hi> Troy<hi rend="italic">; in his</hi> Odysseas <hi rend="italic">the return of</hi> Ulysses <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Ithaca<hi rend="italic">; in</hi> Uirgill <hi rend="italic">the death of</hi> Turnus<hi rend="italic">,or to say better, the conquest of</hi> Italy<hi rend="italic">; neerer to our times, in</hi> Tasso<hi rend="italic"> the taking of</hi> Jerusalem<hi rend="italic">: and to passe from the Poem to the</hi> Romanze<hi rend="italic">, which is my principall object, in</hi> Heliodorus <hi rend="italic">the marriage of</hi> Theagines <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Cariclia. <hi rend="italic">It is not because the Episodes in the



<pb n="[xi]     The Preface."/>


one, and the severall Histories in the other, are not rather beauties, than defects; but it is alwaies necessary, that the adress of him which imployes them should
hold them in some sort to this principall action, to the end, that by this ingenious concatenation, all the parts of them should make but one body, and that
nothing may be seen in them which is loose and unprofitable. Thus the mariage of my</hi> Justiniano <hi rend="italic">and his</hi> Isabella<hi rend="italic">, being the object which I have proposed unto my self, I have imployed all my care so to doe, that all the parts of my
work may tend to that conclusion; that there may be a strong connexion between
them; and that, except the obstacle which fortune opposeth to the desires of my</hi>
Heros<hi rend="italic">, all things may advance, or at lestwise indeavor to advance his mariage
which is the end of my labor. Now those great Geniusses of antiquity, from wh&#x014D; I borrow my light, knowing that well-ordering is one of the principall parts of
a piece, have given so excellent a one to their speaking pictures, that it would be
as much stupididitie, as pride, not to imitate them. They have not done like those
Painters, who present in one and the same cloth a Prince in the Cradle, upon the
Throne, &#x0026; in the Tombe, perplexing, by this so little judicious a confusion, him,
that considers their work; but with an incomparable adress they begin their History in the middle, so to give some suspence to the Reader, even from the first opening of the book; and to confine themselves within reasonable bounds they
have made the History (as I likewise have done after them) not to last above a year, the rest being delivered by narration. Thus all things being ingeniously
placed, and of a just greatness, no doubt but pleasure will redound from thence
to him that beholds them, and glory to him that hath done them. But amongst
all the rules which are to be observed in the composition of these workes, that of
true resemblance is without question the most necessary; it is, as it were, the
fundamentall stone of this building, and but upon which it cannot subsist;
without it nothing can move, without it nothing can please: and if this charming deceiver doth not beguile the mind in</hi> Romanzes<hi rend="italic">, this kind of reading
disgusts, instead of intertaining it: I have labored then never to eloigue my
self from it, and to that purpose I have observed the manners, customes, Religions, and inclinations of people : And to give a more true resemblance to
things, I have made the foundations of my work Historicall, my principall personages such as are marked out in the true History for illustrious persons, and
the warres effective. This is the way doubtless, whereby one may arrive at his
end; for when as falshood and truth are confounded by a dextrus hand, wit
hath much adoe to disintangle them, and is not easily carried to destroy that
which pleaseth it; contrarily, when as invention doth not make use of this artifice, and that falshood is produced openly,this gross untruth makes no impresion in the soul, nor gives any delight: As indeed how should I bee touched
with the misfortunes of the Queen of</hi> Gundaya<hi rend="italic">, and of the King of</hi> Astrobacia<hi rend="italic"> when as I know their very Kingdomes are not in the Vniversall Mapp, or,
to say better, in the being of things? But this is not the only defect which
may carry us from true resemblance, for we have at other times seen</hi> Romanzes <hi rend="italic">which set before us monsters, in thinking to let us see Miracles; their Authors by adhering too much to wonders have made Grotesques, which have not
a little of the visions of a burning Feaver; and one might demand of these




<pb n="[xii]     he Preface."/>
Mesieurs with more reason, than the Duke of</hi> Ferara<hi rend="italic"> did of</hi> Ariosto<hi rend="italic">, after he had read his</hi> Olando, Messer Lodovico done diavolo havete pigliato tante coyonerie? <hi rend="italic">As for me, I hopd, that hte more naturall adventures are, the more satisfaction they give; and the ordinary course of the Sun seemes more mervailous to me, than the strange and deadly rayes of Comets; for which reason it is also that I have not caused so many Shipwracks, as there are in some antient</hi> Romanzes<hi rend="italic">; and to speak seriously</hi> Du Bartas <hi rend="italic">might say of these Authors,</hi>
<q><lg><l>That with their word they bind,</l>
<l>Or loose, at will, the blowing of the wind.</l></lg></q></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">So as one might think that</hi> &#x00C6;olus <hi rend="italic">hath given them the Winds inclosed in a bagg as he gave them to</hi> Vlysses <hi rend="italic">so patly doe they unchain them; they make
tempests and shipwracks when they please, they raise them on the Pacifique Sea,
they find rocks and shelves where the most expert Pilots have never observed
any: But they which dispose thus of the winds, know not, how the Prophet
doth assure us, that God keepes them in his Treasures; and that Philosophy, as
clear sighted as it is, could never discover their retreat. Howbeit I pretend not
hereby to banish Shipwracks from</hi> Romanzes<hi rend="italic">, I approve of them in the workes
of others, and make use of them in mine; I know likewise, that the Sea is the
Scene most proper to make great changes in, and that some have named it the
Theater of inconstancie; but as all excess is vicious, I have made use of it but
moderately, for to conserve true resembling: Now the same design is the cause
also, that my</hi> Heros <hi rend="italic">is not oppressed with such a prodigious quantity of accidents as arrive unto some others, for that according to my sense, the same is
far from true resemblance,the life of no man having ever been so crost. It would
be better in my oppinion to separate the adventures, to form divers Histories
of them, and to make persons acting, thereby to appear both fertile, and judicious together, and to be still within this so necessary true resemblance. And
indeed they who have made one man alone defeat whole Armies, have forgotten
the Proverb which saith,</hi> not one against two<hi rend="italic">, and know not that antiquitie
doth assure us, how</hi> Hercules<hi rend="italic"> would in that case be too weak. It is without all
doubt, that to represent a true heroicall courage, one should make it execute some
thing extraordinary, as it were by a transport of the</hi> Heros<hi rend="italic">; but he must not
continue in that sort, for so those incredible actions would degenerate into ridiculous fables,and never move the mind. This fault is the cause also of committing another; for they which doe nothing but heap adventure upon adventure, without ornament,and without stirring up passions by the artifices of Rhetorique, are irkesome, in thinking to be the more intertayning. This dry narration, and without art, hath more of an old Chronicle, than of a</hi> Romanze
<hi rend="italic">which may very well be imbelished with those ornaments, since History, as severe and scrupulous as it is, doth not forbear imploying them. Certain Authors, after they have described an adventure, a daring design, or some surprising event, able to possess one with the bravest apprehensions in the world
are contented to assure us, that such a</hi> Heros<hi rend="italic"> thought of very gallant things
without telling us what they are; and this is that alone which I desre to know:



<pb n="[xiii]     The Preface."/>
For how can I tell, whether in these events fortune hath not done as much as
he? whether his valor be not a brutish valor? and whether he hath born the
misfortunes that arrived unto him, as a worthy man should doe? it is not by
things without him, it is not by the caprichioes of destinie, that I will judge of
him; it is by the motions of his soul, and by that which he speaketh. I honor
all them that write at this day; I know their <sic>persous</sic>, their workes, their merits; but as canonizing is for none but the dead, they will not take it ill is I doe
not deifie them, since they are living. And in this occasion I propose no other
example, than the great and incomparable</hi> Urf&#x00E9;<hi rend="italic">, certainly it must be acknowledged that he hath merited his reputation; that the love which all the earth
beares him is just; and that so many disserent Nations, which have translated
his Book into their tongues, had reason to doe it: as for me, I confess openly,
that I am his adorer; these twenty yeares I have loved him; he is indeed admirable over all; he is fertile in his inventions, and in <sic>inventious</sic> reasonable;
every thing in him is mervailous, every thing in him is excellent; and that
which is more important, every thing in him is naturall, and truly resembling:
But amongst many rare matters, that which I most esteem of is, that he knowes
how to touch the passions so delicately, that he may be called the Painter of the
soul; hee goes searching out in the bottom of hearts the most secret thoughes;
and in the diversity of natures, which he represents, every one findes his own
pourtrait,so that</hi>
<q><lg><l>Is amongst mortalls any be</l>
<l>That merits Altars, <hi rend="italic">Urs&#x00E9;'s</hi> he</l>
<l>Who can alone pretend thereto.</l></lg></q></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Certainly there is nothing more important in this kinde of composition,
than strongly to imprint the idea, or (to say better) the image of the</hi> Heroes
<hi rend="italic">in the minde of the Reader, but in such sort, as is they were known to them; for
that it is which interesseth him in their adventures, &#x0026; from thence his delight
commeth, now to make them be known perfectly, it is not sufficient to say how
many times they have suffered shipwrack, and how times they have incountred robbers, but their inclinations must be made to appear by their
discourse: otherwise one may rightly apply to these dumb</hi> Heroes<hi rend="italic"> that
excellent mot to of Antiquity,</hi> Speake that I may see thee.<hi rend="italic"> And if from
true resemblance, and inclinations, expressed by words, wee will pass unto
manners, goe from the pleasant to the profitable, and from delight to example, I am to tell you, Reader, that here vertue is seen to bee alwaies recompenced, and vice alwaies punished, is he that hath followed his owne unruliness
hath not by a just and sensible repentance obtained grace from Heaven; to which
purpose I have also observed equality of manners in all the persons that do act,
unless it be whereas they are disordered by <sic>passious</sic>, and touched with remorse.
I have had a care likewise to deal in such sort, as the faults, which great ones
have committed in my History, should be caused either by love, or by ambition,
which are the noblest of passions, and that they be imputed to the evill counsell
of flatterers; that so the respect, which is alwaies due unto Kings, may be preserved. You shall see there, Reader, if I be not deceived, the comliness of things
and conditions exactly enough observed; neither have I put any thing into my



<pb n="[xiv]     The Preface."/>
Book which the Ladies may not read without blushing. And if you see not my</hi>
Hero <hi rend="italic">persecuted with Love by Women, it is not because he was not amiable ,
and that he could not be loved, but because it would clash with civility in
the persons of Ladies, and with true resemblance in that of men, who rarely
shew themselves cruell unto them, nor in doing it could have any good grace:
Finally, whether things ought to be so, or whether I have judged of my</hi> Hero
<hi rend="italic">by mine own weakness, I would not expose his fidelity to that dangerous tryall,
but have been contented to make no</hi> Hilas<hi rend="italic">, nor yet an</hi> Hipolitus<hi rend="italic"> of
him. But whilst I speak of civilitie, it is fit I should tell you (for fear I be
accused of failing therein) that if you see throughout all my Work, when as</hi>
Soliman <hi rend="italic">is spoken unto, thy Highness, thy Majesty, and that in conclusion
he is treated with thee, and not with you, it is not for want of Respect, but
contrarily it is to have the more, and to observe the custom of those peope,
who sbeak after that sort to their Soveraigns. And is the authority of the
living may be of as much force, as that of the dead, you shall find examples
of it in the most famous</hi> Othomans<hi rend="italic">, and you shall see that their Authors
have not been afraid to imploy in their own Tongue a manner of speaking,
which they have drawn from the Greek and Latin; and then too I have made
it appear clearly, that I have not done it without design, for unless it be
when as the Turks speak to the Sultan, or he to his inferiors, I have never
made use of it, and either of them doth use it to each other. Now for fear it
may be objected unto me, that I have approached some incidents nearer than
the History hath shewed them to be, great</hi> Virgil <hi rend="italic">shall be my warrant, who in
his divine</hi> &#x00C6;neads<hi rend="italic"> hath made</hi> Dido <hi rend="italic">appear four Ages after her own; wherefore I have beleeved I might do of some moneths, what he hath done of so
many years, and that I was not to be afraid of erring, as long as I followed
so good a guide. I know not likewise whether some may not take it ill, that my</hi>
Hero<hi rend="italic"> and</hi> Heroina <hi rend="italic">are not Kings; but besides that the generous do put no
difference between wearing of Crowns, and meritiing them, and that my</hi> Justiniano <hi rend="italic">is of a race which hath held the Empire of the Orient, the example of</hi>
Athenagoras<hi rend="italic">, me-thinks, ought to stop their mouthes, seeing</hi> Theogines<hi rend="italic"> and</hi> Charida <hi rend="italic">are but simple Citizens. Finally, Reader, such Censors may set their
hearts at rest for this particular, and leave me there, for I assure them that
</hi>Justiniano <hi rend="italic">is of a condition to command over the whole Earth; and that</hi> Isabella <hi rend="italic">of a House, and Gentlewoman good enough, to make Knights of the
</hi>Rhodes<hi rend="italic">, if she have children enough for it, and that she have a mind thereunto. But setting this jesting aside, and comming to that which regards the
Italian names, know that I have put them in their naturall pronounciation.  And if you see some Turkish words, as</hi> Alla, Stamboll, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Egira, <hi rend="italic">and some others, I have done it of purpose, Reader, and have left them as Historicall marks, which are to pass rather for imbellishments than defects.  It is certain that imposition of names is a thing which every one ought to think of, and whereof nevertheless all the world hath not thought; We have oftentimes seen Greek names given to barbarous Nations, with as little reason as if I should name an English man</hi> Mahomet<hi rend="italic">, and that I should call a Turk</hi> Anthony<hi rend="italic">; for my part I have beleeved that more care is to be had of ones labour, and that upeon this subject men and bookes are to be consulted with;


<pb n="[xv]     The Preface."/>
and if any one remarks the name of</hi> Satrape <hi rend="italic">in this</hi> Romanze<hi rend="italic">, let him not imagine that my ignorance hath confounded the antient and new</hi> Persia<hi rend="italic">, and that I have done it without Authority, I have an example thereof in</hi> Vigenere<hi rend="italic">, who makes use of it in his Illustrations upon</hi> Calchondila<hi rend="italic">; and I have learned of it of a</hi> Persian<hi rend="italic">, which is at</hi> Paris<hi rend="italic">, who faith, that by corruption of speech they call yet to this day the Governours of Provinces,</hi> Soltan Sitripin. <hi rend="italic">Now lest some other should further accuse me for having improperly named</hi> Ibrahim<hi rend="italic">'s House a Palace, since all those of persons of quality are called</hi> Seraglioes<hi rend="italic"> at</hi> Constantinople<hi rend="italic">, I desire you to remember,  that  I have done it by the counsell of two or three excellent persons,
who have found as well as my self, that this name of</hi> Seraglio<hi rend="italic"> would leave
an</hi> Idea <hi rend="italic">which was not seemly, and that it was fit not to make use of it,
but in speaking of the Grand Signior, and that as seldom as might be.
But whilst wee are speakjng of a Palace, I am to advertise you, that such
as are not curious to see a goodly building, may pass by the gate of that
of my</hi> Heroe <hi rend="italic">without entring into it, that is to say, not to read the description of it; it is not because I have handled this matter like to</hi> Athenagoras<hi rend="italic">, who playes the Mason in the Temple of</hi> Jupiter Hammon<hi rend="italic">; nor like</hi>
Poliphile <hi rend="italic">in his dreams, who hath set down most strange terms, and all
the dimensions of Architecture, whereas I have imployed but the ornaments
thereof; it is not because they are not beauties sutable to the</hi> Romanze<hi rend="italic">, as
well as to the</hi> Epique Poem<hi rend="italic">, since the most famous both of the one and the
other have them; nor is it too because mine is not grounded on the History,
which assures us that it was the most superb the Turks ever made, as shall appears by the remains thereof, which they of that Nation call</hi> Serrau Ibrahim.<hi rend="italic"> But to conclude, as inclinations ought to be free, such as love not those beautifull things, for which I have so much passion, may (as I have said) pass
on without looking on them, and leave them to others more curious of those
rarities, which I have assembled together with art and care enough. Now,
Reader, ingenuity being a matter necessary for a man of Honour, and the
theft of glory being the basest that may be committed, I must confess here for
fear of being accused of it, that the Hstory of the Count of</hi> Lavagna,<hi rend="italic">
which you shall see in my Book, is partly a Paraphrase of</hi> Mascardies<hi rend="italic">; this
Adventure falling out in the time whilst I was writing, I judged it too excellent not to set it down, and too well indited for to undertake to do it better;
so that regard not this place but as a Translation of tlut famous Italian, and
except the matters, which concern my History, attribute all to that great
man, whose Interpreter onely I am. And if you finde something not very
serious in the Histories of a certain French Marquis, which I have interlaced
in my Book, remember if you please, that a</hi> Romanze <hi rend="italic">ought to have the images of all natures; that this diversty makes up the beauties of it, and the
delight of the Reader; and at the worst regard it as the sport of a melancholick, and suffer it without blaming it. But before I make an end, I must pass from matters to the manner of delivering them, and desire you also not to forget, that a narrative stile ought not to be too much inflated, no more than that of ordinary conversations; that hte more facile it is, the more excellent it is; that it ought to glide along like Rivers, and not rebound up like

Torrents; that that the less constraint it hath, the more perfection it hath; I have endeavoured then to observe a just mediocrity between vicious elevation, and creeping lowness; I have contained my self in narration, and left by self free in orations, and in passions, and wihtout speaking as extravagants, and the vulgar, I have laboured to speak as worthy persons do.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Behold, Reader, that which I had to say to you, but what defence soever I have implyed, I know that it is of works of this nature, as of a place of war, where notwithstanding all the care the Engineer hath brought to fortifie it, there is alwayes some weak part found, which he hath not dream'd of, and whereby it is assulted; but this shall not surprise me; for as I have not forgot that I am a man, no more have I forgot that I am subject to erre.</hi></p>

<p>SCarcely had the first beames of the Sun dissipated the darknes of
the night on the <hi rend="italic">Bosphorus</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Thrace</hi>, when as a great voyce of
Trumpets and Atabales awaked every one in the Imperiall Citie of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, and made them known that the Triumph
of great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was then beginning. All the people ran instantly to the <hi rend="italic">Hipodrome</hi>, and the least curious would see the
magnificent entry of that Prince, who returned conquerer from
<hi rend="italic">Persia. Roxelana</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Sultana</hi> Queen, followed by all the rest
parted from the Seraglio in Chariots of Scarlet imbroidered with gold, and went
to the stately standing prepared for her. All the Christian Princes Ambassadors
took their places there; first that of the Emperor; then that of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>; next to
them sate those of <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Poland</hi>; and after them the <hi rend="italic">Baglioes</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Venice</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">Rhagonsa</hi>. But those of the <hi rend="italic">Mahometan</hi> Provinces; as being of the same belief with <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, were on the left hand, which amongst the Turkes is alwaies the place
of honour: That of the <hi rend="italic">Tartars</hi> appeared there with a barbarous pomp in a Cap
and Roab of Sables, all his Train clad with the skinnes of Beares, Foxes, Wolves
and Tygers: And those of <hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Fez</hi>, were there too, with all the magnificence, and gallantry that Moores make profession of. As soone as each one had
taken his place, the Governor of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, whom the Turkes call <hi rend="italic">Capitan Bassa</hi>, and as one of the four prime Officers of the Empire, went out of the City to the Seraglio Daut, an house of pleasure of the Grand Signiors, some two miles off, for to
advertise his Higness, who was come thither the night before, that all things were in a readiness to receive him. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> gets imediately to horse, and this great Emperour after so glorious a conquest goes to revive the stately seat of his Empire. Fifty Trumpets, and fifty Atabales, attired in Cassocks of Damask, imbroidered with gold, appeared first in the <hi rend="italic">Hipodrome</hi>, and made all the Cittie to ring with

<pb n="2" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="2     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
the warlike harmony of their silver instruments. They were followed by two thousand Archers on horsback, in liveries of carnation sattin, laid thick with gold lace.
Bowes of ebony in their left hands, and ivory quivers hanging on skarfes. Fifty
Hoboys, and fifty players on Cimballs, followed this first troup, habited after the
Greek fashion, in blew velvet imbroidered with silver. The <hi rend="italic">Aga</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Janizaries</hi> marched on foot alone after them in the head of six thousand of his companions,
having on a robe of cloth of gold, a Jewell of rich stones, and a plume of Hearons
feathers in his Turbant, with a China battoon in his hand, which is the marke of
his Charge: All this Troop was clothed in that kind of roabe by them called <hi rend="italic">Doliman</hi>, with scymitars by their sides, and muskets on their shoulders. They were
followed by fifty Drummes, and fifty Fyfes, attyred in short coates of white taffeta,
wrought with lively flowers set out with gold. After them an hundred black
Slaves, with chaines of silver, and braslets of the same about their armes and leggs,
carried <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> the Sophy of <hi rend="italic">Persines</hi> Throne of massy gold, which had been found
in <hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi>; and all the rich vessell of Agate, and Turqueys, wherewith that Monarch
was served. Next to them were twelve Elephants, and twelve Camells led, laden
with silver, gold, jewells, and precious stones, which had been taken out of the Sophyes Treasure. A great Chariot, drawn by twelve Barbes followed, where hung
an hundred displayed colours, which the Turkes had gained from the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>; in
the midst whereof was a stately Trophey, composed of Curiaces and Murrians of
silver engraved; Targets of gold and Turqueyses; Seymitars and Poignards,
whose hilts and scabbards were of Agates and Cornalines; Bowes of Ebony inlaide
with gold; Quivers of gold set with pearl; Pikes Darts, and Arrowes of Cedar
wood, and Indian Cane; all intermingled with a disorder so agreeable, &amp; so full of
art, and a confusion so rich and beautifull, as nothing could come neere to the magnificence of this Trophry. Thirty Satrapes, sumptuously apparelled after the Persian
manner, with their Cuselbas, or red Turbants, went after that Chariot, tyed two
and two with golden chaines, their hands behind their backs. These illustrious
wretches were followed by five hundred Voluntiers, which the Turkes call <hi rend="italic">Dellis</hi>,
mounted on horses barbed and caparisoned with Lions skinnes, having the tail of
that generous beast on the frontstalls of them, in stead of a feather; their habits were
of the skin of a Bear, their bonnets of that of a Leopard exquisitely spotted; in
those bonnets the trayne of an Eagle, and on their Targetts the wing of the same
bird; they had scymitars by their sides, battelaxcs at their saddlebowes, and
Launces in their hands, at the end whereof was an Eagles feather in stead of a pennon. This fantastick troop was followed by a mixture of Trumpets, Attabales,
Hoboyes, European Drummes, Cimballs, and Fyfes, which composed a musick little less extravagant, than the equipage of those that preceded them. An hundred
Pages rode after these same, mounted on white Barbes, and suited in white velvet,
studded with silver. Behind these Pages twenty Azapes lead in their hands ten
Horses, royally harnessed, whereof the last, which was called the Horse of the Body, or the Horse of Battaile, had the bitt of the bridle, and the stirrupps of massive
gold, all beset with precious stones; the Saddle vvhite all over vvith pearles, and
sparkling with diamonds; the Sultans Target hung at the Saddle bovv by strings
of gold, at the ends wherof great tasselles of Orientall pearles trailed to the ground.
Next to these horses marched even together the <hi rend="italic">Tubenter Aga</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Chiodar Aga</hi>,
vvho carried the Turbant and Mantle Imperiall. Behind them <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim Bassa</hi>, the the
Grand Visior, rode alone, mounted on a black Barbe, vvhose furniture vvas of velvet
of the same color, as vvell as the habit of that illustrious <hi rend="italic">Bassa</hi>, all imbroidered with
great pearles, he carried in his hand, &amp; vvithout a Scabbard, the Scymitar Imperiall.
The hundred Peiker, or footmen of the Grand Signior, follovved next, but in order,
with bonnets of massive silver on their heads, in the midst wherof white feathers of
an extraordinary greatness stuck in a quill covered with precious stones. Fifty Archers on foot went after them, with bovves &#x0026; arrowes in their hands, <sic>i nthe</sic> midst
of whom was <hi rend="italic">Sultan Soliman</hi>, arrayed in a roabe of cloth of gold, imbroidered with
pearles, and diamonds; his Turbant was ardorned vvith five plumes of Hearons,
and as many great jevvells of rich stones; and the furniture of his Horse vvas all

covered over with Emeraulds and Rubies. He was followed by all the Bassaes and Beglierbies of the Empire. After whom a Boluch Bassa marched in the head of two thousand Janizaries, which were the last Troops of this stately Entrie. After that this marvelous Triumph had made a turn about the Hipodrome, all ranked themselves on the right and left hand, and the Sultan went and lighted at the Tent 
of cloth of Gold, which had been pitched for him under the windows
Sultana Queen. All the Grandees of the Port stood on both sides; <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> alone
was set at his Highness feet, on a Cushion of cloath of Silver. When every one had
taken his place, the Bassa of the Sea, who that day exercised the Charge of the
Master of the Ceremonies, advertised the Ambassadors that they might go to
the Baise-main, and offer their presents, which they had no sooner done, and were
returned to their seats, but the Mufti appeared, sitting on a Throne that was carried on the back of a Cammell, and holding in his hands the Book of the Alcoran.
He was waited upon by all the Alfaquis, Calenders, and Dervis of the City of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>; all these Religious men cried and howled with a dreadfull noise, and to
accompany their voices, and their dance,they beat upon kettles and basons, and rung
little bels; so that this modest Clergy resembled not a little the Orgies of antient
<hi rend="italic">Greece</hi>, and the Bacchanals of old <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>: When they were before the Sultan they stood still, made prayers for the prosperity of his Highness, offered him a Book of their Law, covered with Gold and Turquesyes; and after they had slashed their arms and
their faces with great knives, for the love of their Prophet, and the Sultan, they retired, and gave place to those that were to succecd them. The Turkish, Christian,
and Jewish Merchants appeared then richly attired, and in the midst of them a Chariot drawn by twelve <hi rend="italic">Cupids</hi>, crowned with flowers, upon the which was erected a
shop of cloth of Gold, and Persian Tapestry, which they presented to the Sultan.
The Goldsmiths followed them with a Cupbord of Gold Plate ingraven, upon a
frame of unpolished Silver, dravvn by four white Horses, which they gave to his
Highness. Every Trade appeared one after another, each of them making shew of
some rich piece of workmanship of their profession; but with so extraordinary a
diligence, that before the turn of the place was finished, the Present was in estate to
be offered to great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. He received them all very graciously, and instantly
gave them to his dear <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to whom he said they were justly due, since it was
by his courage and conduct, that he had obtained the Victory, and this Triumph.
After that all these liberall Troopes were past, as <hi rend="italic">Turkie</hi> is the onely place
in the World, where the most Juglers and Tumblers are, there appeared above tvvo thousand of them, vvho in the presence of the Grand Signior did
all, that the slight of the hand, and all, that the address and force of the body,
could naturally permit men to. Next to them was seen the great Frame, representing the City of <hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi>, vvhereof the Tovvers were covered vvith Pesian Colours, as vvas knovvn by thei antient Images of the Sun, vvich they all had; it vvas follovved by tvvo hundred Slaves, belonging to the Bassa of the sea, half of them armed after the Turkish, and half after the Persian manner, vvith scimitars and bucklers of Silver; vvho to the sound of fifty Hoboys danced that which the <hi rend="italic">Greeks</hi> called the Pirrhique dance, and that vvich might be termed an armed dance; the blovvs vvere given and received in due cadence; the changing of figures therein, represented the advantages, and flight vvich fall out in battels; and the noise of bucklers and scimitars marked out the measure of paces vvith as much even time, as the instruments. Amongst these Slaves there vvas one in the Turkish Troop, vvhich by his good aspect and behaviour, drevv the eys of all the beholders upon him; the Grand Visier no sooner perceiving him, but he trembled vvith amazement and joy, no way doubting but that it was he whom he thought he knew: In the mean time the Frame, the two Troops, having made a turn about the place, the City was set down just against the Grand Signior, and the Persians cast themselves into it; Then at the sound of all the Trumpets, Atabales, Drums, Hoboys, Fifes, and Cimbals in the Assembly, the Turks gave an assault to that feigned City of

<pb n="4" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="4     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>
<hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi>: If the assault were vigorous, the defence was no less; the Persians were seen
to give ground; the Turkes were also seen to be repulsed; and this false Image of
of war had all the apparences of a true fight: But at length, after a great resistance,
the well-made Slave forced the gates, mounted first on the walles, and plucking
down the Sophyes Colours for to set up those of the Sultan, his valor and address
were the cause, that the Moon made the Sun to be eclipsed; his victory was seconded with a great shout of the Janizaries, and of all the people, and nothing was
heard over all the Hipodrome, but long live Sultan <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. In the mean time
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> Bassa, who knew his friend no less by his address, than by his face, was
ravished to see, that all the glory of this action could not be disputed with him.
When the noise of so many voices was dispersed, there appeared a Troop like to
Christians, and observed for such by the Crosses,  which were seen in their Colours; they represented certain Christians, who living under the Empire of the
Sophy thought they were obliged to defend that Prince, though he were not of
their Reigion, and indeed had fought so generously for him, as they had been
the first in the war, and yet the last that were vanquished. This feigned Troop
had order from the Bassa of the Sea to resist for some time that of the Turkes,
which came at that very instant out of the Citty, and then to suffer themselves to
be vanquished; and they that vvere attired like Turkes were commanded to chain
them, and to trail their Colours on the ground. But when the fight began, that
generous Slave, vvho had drawn the eyes of all the Assembly upon him at the
taking of the feigned Citty of <hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi>, fell suddenly from jesting into a more serious
thought, and being carried away by the zeal of his Religion, he passed from the
Turkish Troop into that ofthe Christians, and by changing of party made the
face of things to change: The Turkes, whom he had left, laboured to vanquish him
with the rest, but he beat them back to the very gates of the City; and albeit they
made three sallies more upon him, he repulsed them all the three times, even
to the same gates.  All the world was surprised with this adventure, and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>,
not being able to comprehend the matter, demanded of the Bassa of the Sea, what it
meant? But the Bassa, casting himsels at the feet of his Highness, assured him that
this criminall action came not from his order, but that it proceeded from the insolencie of his Slave; whereupon a motion of choler seizing on the mind of the
Grand Signior, he commanded that this Slave should be instantly impaled.
But the grand Visier, rising from the place where he sate, and falling on his knees,
besought the Sultan that he would not mark the day of his Triumph with blood;
but remember that clemency is properly the vertue ofthe Victorious; that in
saving the life of this inconsiderate he should be assured, that he would lose it for
his service; and that he was of a birth and humor never to be ingratefull; that
knowing him as well as himself,  he would be responsable for <sic>hlm</sic> to his Highness; and that being so far obliged unto him as to dye for to save him, he besought
the Sultan to take his life instead of his, is his fault could not obtain pardon.
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> reached out his hand to the illustrious Bassa, and in raising him up, said
unto him, that were the Lightning in his hand, his prayers should arrest it;
and that  being unable to refuse him anything, he granted him both the life and
the pardon of that rash man. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> cast himself again at the feet of the Sultan
for to render him thanks, and after he had obtained of the Bassa of the sea that
this slave should come and pass the night with him, he sent him a commandment
to attend him. All the magnificences of this Triumph being finished, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
was going to rise, and to prepare himself for his return unto his Seraglio, when
as he perceived <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, the Bassa of the seas onely sonne, who breaking through
the press, and leading a woman in his hand, came and threw himself together
with her at his feet. I know well, my Lord, said he unto him, that my presumption is extreme, but withall I know too, that thy goodness is infinite; nevertheless I have no other need of it in this encounter, than that thou wilt be pleased to
permit me to acknowledge thee for a Judge, and to obtain of thee, that in a day
wherein thou receivest such glorious marks of thy Valour, thou wile render us



<pb n="5" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="5     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>

one of thy Justice. The Bassa of the sea knowing that he was the most interested
in the matter in hand, approached near to the Grand Signior for to beseech him
with a great deal of earnettness not to give ear to the complaints of a man, who
had been so bold as to come and interrupt his Triumph; that for his part, although he were his sonne, he would crave no favour of him for his fault, but contrarily he should be obliged to his Highness is he would give him a chastisement,
that might punish him, not only for his crime, but for all others whereof he was
also culpable. A discourse so violent, and so far distant from the apprensions of
a father, made <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> willing to cleared therein, being loth in a day of his
glory his people might say, that he had refused to hear the complaints ofthe oppressed. Howbeit he would first demand the advice of the grand Visier <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>,
who having no other aim but the glory of his Master, said unto him, that in a
time wherein Heaven had done him justice in giving him the victory over his Enemies, he should in some sort be unjust to deny it to them that craved it of him.
The first fence of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having been confirmed by the counsell of a man, who
might do all things with him, he commanded the Bassa of the sea to hold his
peace, and the woman whom <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> had brought to his feet, to tell him what interest she had in the fortune of that man; to the end that understanding the matter from a person that seemed least capable of disguising it, he might also give a
more equall judgement therein. That woman then having heard this commandment, could not for all that resolve to obey it, before she had looked on <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>,
as it were to demand permission of him to answer unto it; but he having made a
sign unto her that he desired it, she turned her self towards <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, with both a
modest, and a confident countenance, which began already to obtain for her the
good-will and attention of all that could hear her. <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, so was this vvoman
called, was young and fair, and one might have said that her beauty had been
without compare, is her complexion had not been a little tanned with the Sun;
she had a stately look, but without pride, and such ingenuity in her face, as
could not permit one to doubt of her words. After that by <hi rend="italic">Osmans</hi> countenance
she knew he had permitted her to speak, she began in these terms; for though she
was originally of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, yet spake she perfectly the <hi rend="italic">Turkish</hi> tongue, which she made use of in this occasion.

</p>
<p>I doubt not, my Lord, but thy Highness will find it strange, said this woman, her
eyes full of tears, that in a day wherein tears of joy are to be shed, I begin my
discourse with tears of sorrow; but the cause of it is so pressing, that it is impossible for me to retain them; for, my Lord, thou seest before thine eyes, sayd she,
shewing <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, two of the most infortunate persons that ever were; we have enemies whom we cannot, whom we ought not hate; to whom we ow respect; to
whom we ow obedience; to whom we ow affection; enemies, I say, to whom we
ow our lives, and for whom also we would lose them with joy if there vvere occasion for it: Nevertheless it is against such dear persons, my Lord, that I am to speak at this time; and for obtaining the justice which we demand of thee and
whereupon depends the happiness or unhappiness of our lives, I must discover the
cruelties of my father, and <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> must accuse his: Judge then, my Lord, whether
my tears be not just and whether loving our enemies, as we do, we be not explosed to an extreme misfortune in being thus constrained to publish their shame, to accuse them, and to demand justice against them.  <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> found her self so oppressed vvith sorrow, that she stood a good while unable to speak.  But <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having commended so sweet a resentment in her, and having commanded her once again to let him understand their differences, she continued her discourse. Since I must, sayd she, obey, and that I cannot conserve my husband without discovering the misfortunes of my father, I must, I say, let thy Highness know, that his name is <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>; that he was born the subject of the Sophy of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>; and that in

<pb n="6" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="6     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>
the time he was in that Court he was Satrap of <hi rend="italic">Aderbion</hi>, and so considerable with
<hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, as there was not any person in that Empire, vvho was more than he;
but whereas his humour hath been alwayes violent in every thing, being become
desperately in love with a maid of excellent beauty, of great vertue, and of much
spirit, he espoused her, though she were of base condition: And whereas the Laws of the State do not permit a Gentleman to marry a wife that is not noble, they also will that the great ones, which commit such like offences, shall lose the honors and charges they possess, and be declared ignoble, and uncapable of all manner of dignities. My father was not ignorant of this custom and law; but he was perswaded that
<hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> would have infringed it for his sake; and is he would not, that want of
affection would be a reason strong enough to oblige him to make the Province revolt, where he commanded,and whereof he believed he was absolutely the Master;
howbeit the matter succceded not so, for the enemies which my Father had made
him by his violences, meeting with so fair an occasion to hurt him, they represented unto the Sophy, that if he pardoned him this fault, it would make him the
more insolent for the future, yea and that it would even overthrow all that Empire, the glory and force whereof consisted in the valour of noble persons, wherewith it is replenished; at length they wrote in such manner, that my Father was
declared guilty,as contravening the fundamentall Laws of the State, and constrained to undergo the chastisement, which I shall come to speak of, by reason that
the Province, where he commanded so absolutely when he was in grace, revolted
against him, and left him not scarcely the liberty to seek a resfuge otherwhere; for
I forgot to tell thy Highness, that the same Law which commanded the utter ruine
of my Father, commanded also that he should pass his life in a perpetuall prison, and the person whom he had maried in another, for fear that living together,
and having children, it might one day cause disorders in the State. My Father
seeing himself in so pitifull a fortune, went not about to move the heart of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> with payers and submission, but contrarily sent him word, that deserving not
to be served by a man of his courage and valor, he would go out of his Estates,
with an intention never to re-enter into them again , but to bring war along with
him. Being then in <hi rend="italic">Mingrelia</hi>, he bought a Man of War, wherein he imbarqued
himself on <hi rend="italic">Mare major</hi>, with his wife, who as she was the cause of his misfortune, so would she not abandon him in his exile. They continued some time in
this sort, not knowing what resolution to take, nor having any other design in the
course that they held, than to eloign themselves from <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>; my Fathers great
heart not permitting him to go and seck unto the enemies of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> for a place
of retreat; for though he be somewhat cruell, yet is he notwithstanding generous;
neither would he likewise address himself to the Princes that were allied to our
Empire, for fear he should not be favourably received by them. In the mean time
these irresolutions having no end, the provisions of the ship diminished daily:
The Pilot was well hoped up to ask him where he would land, vvhen as he found no
place in the whole universall Map vvhither to go. Six moneths past avvay in this
sort in running over all the Seas of the <hi rend="italic">Levant</hi>; and whereas my mother was with
child of me, at such time as she imbarqued her self, she was not far from the term
wherein I was to see the light, when as <hi rend="italic">Arsalons</hi> victualls utterly failed him; and
having imployed all his money in the buying of the Vessell, and such provisions
of War, and for the mouth, as he had laid into her, he knew not what part to repair unto for the supplying of himself in so adverse an adventure. The souldiers and Mariners consulted together, and having gained the Pilot, they wrought
so with him, that maugre the command my Father had given him to the contrary,
he steered directly to an Iland which they had discovered; whereupon <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>
being in a rage to see his authority contemned, went and pushed away the Pilot so
rudely for to make him abandon the helm, as the poor wretch fell into the Sea;
and my Father becoming his own Pilot, he took his scimitar in his right hand,
and the whip of the rudder in his left, and menacing them that would oppose his
will, he made his Vessell take a quite contrary course, choosing rather to die by

<pb n="7" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="7     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>

famine, than expose his misery to the eyes of the world, fearing nothing so much
as that <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> should come to understand his misfortunes. He had already lost
sight of that Iland, which he had beheld as a rock, and his souldiers being no longer retained but by the tears of my Mother, might at length peradventure have
been carried to some strange resolution, without an adventure that befell them,
which was, that my Father discovered a Vessell comming towards his, which bare
a flag of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> in her top, as he thought, and as indeed it proved to be: Upon the
sight of her he began to think, that he should be revenged of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> in revenging himself upon his Subjects; and this desire of revenge, joyned to the present necessity, made him propound to his souldiers the attacquing of that Vessell, who 
animated more by the fear of famine, than by their courage, resolved to obey his
pleasure. After my Father had shut up my Mother in the Captains Cabbin, where
with fright she was brought to bed of me by the assistance of her Nurse, who had
never abandoned her, they set upon the Vessell, and after two hours fight rendred
themselves absolute Masters of her, wherein they found extreme riches, and abundance of Victuall. This victory gave new life to his souldiers, who for the valor
which my Father had shewed in this occasion, grew so devoted unto him, as they
craved pardon of him for resisting his will, and swore never to forsake him; he
to win them the more, divided the booty amongst them, reserving nothing for himself but the glory of having vanquished. After this, my Lord, he took a resolution to have no other Countrey but his ship, and to pass all the rest of his life upon
all the Seas of the world, to seek out all occasions of fighting, and to take all
the Vessells that should carry the Colours of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, or all that belonged to the
Enemies of our Religion, which are the Christians: He propounds this design
to his soudiers, who approve it, and albeit my Mother withstood it, he setled this
resolution at last. Behold, my Lord, in what sort my Father hath lived for the space
of eighteen years that I have been in the world, and that which hath gotten
him so much same under the name of <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> the Pirate throughout all the Seas
that are known to us. I have not for all that been always brought up in so wild
an element, for whereas he divers times arrived at Ilands to sell off the commodities
which he had taken, he left me from the age of six years untill fourteen, at which
time he took me to him again, under the government of a woman of the Isle of
<hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>, who truly had a great deal of care of me. Thy Highness may be pleased
to dispence with me for the relating to thee all the sad victories which my Father hath obtained in so long a time, and withall wilt pardon me if I have extended my self in this discourse more than I ought, for to make it appear, that the
life which my father hath led, hath rather been an effect of his great heart, and of
his despair, than of the baseness and viciousness of his mind: But, my Lord, to
come unto that which directly regards me, it was not full six dayes after my Father had taken me away from the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>, whenas my Mother fell sick, and
died in my arms; this loss no doubt was very sensible unto me, and <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> was
so afflicted with it, as no man could be more; howbeit this grief produced very
different effects in us; I shed tears, and he spilt blood, for melancholy being joyned to his violent humour, he sought no other remedy for his affliction than to
make others miserable like him self. We ran then over all the Archipelago, and
all the Sea of <hi rend="italic">Tuscany</hi>; and during that voyage he made many fights and took
many prizes, amongst the rest a little Barque, where a man of a good aspect, and
that was an <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi>, defended himself so couragiously, that <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>, vext at his resistance, had peradventure caused him to be slain, is I had not obtained his life. When he was in the hands of my Father, he was chained amongst those whom
he judged were handsome enough to be sold in places where he had accustomed to traffique; but he soon changed this design, for this new Slave having given him to understand by an Interpreter, which my Father had, who spoke most languages, for the commodity of his Commerces, that he was a man of quality, he agreed with him on a price ofr his ransom, and gave him his word, that if the sum which he had promised, were paid him at the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>, he would set him at liberty:


<pb n="8" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="8     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

This Slave having confirmed this promise unto him, my Father permitted him to
write unto the place whence he said he was of, and so going to the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>
he gave this Letter to Merchants, with whom he held correspondence, that undertook to cause it to be delivered; my Father promising this Slave, that within three
moneths he would return thither for an answer of it; but in the mean time that
he must for his security go along with him: This man not knowing what to do,
but to follow the Law of the Vanquisher, resolved to submit to that which he
could not avoid. Not long after we encountred a great man of War, in whose
flag my Father observed half Moons; and whereas all his prizes were seldom
or never made of any save of <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>, or Christians, he purposed not to meddle
with her, but contrarily commanded his Pilot to quit his course, that so he might
decline her; but whereas <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> was taken for a Pirate, and this change of course
seemed to be a slight unto him who commanded that Vessell, he made up with
full sayls unto us, the better to discern ours, and having well discerned her, he
came presently and grapled himself fast unto us. I cannot say, my Lord, what
this fight was, because the fright I was in kept me from marking it, howbeit I know
that at the very first, they of that Vessell leaped into ours; and whereat there were
many of my Fathers souldiers sick, they might peradventure have rendred themselves Masters of her without the valor of the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Slave, who seeing that they
which attacqued us were not Christians, demanded leave of <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> to fight, who
having given him arms, gave him wherewithall to gain us the victory; for he performed such marvellous things in this fight, as after he had repulsed the enemy, he
leaped into their Vessell, followed by my Father, and some of his, put very neer
all that he met with there to the sword, rendred himselfe Master of her, and
with his own hand, after a long resistance, took <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, who commanded her, and
who by his Fathers order was going to <hi rend="italic">Alexandria</hi>. After this brave exploit,
this Slave was the favourite of <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>, of which grace notwithstanding he was not
much sensible; for though my Father caressed him extremely, yet left he not to
be exceedingly afflicted, when as he knew that the reward of his victories should be
a perpetuall slavery; for albeit my Father had promised to give him his liberty,
when as he should have received his ransom, he had resolved nevertheless to break
his word with him, for that he might not, said he, part with a man which could
make him invincible by his wonderfull valor. In the mean time, my Lord, <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>
finding himself wounded, and my inclination having always carried me to the
comforting of others miseries, I visited him whilst he was ill, and more for the
care that I had of his person, as long as he was so, than for any beauty was in my
face, he bare an affection to me; and is I dare say it, the knowledge which I had
thereof, together with his merit, and the compassion I had of his misfortune, very
much disposed me to accept of it; the constancy which he shewed was partly the
cause of my weakness, is at leastwise one may call affection so, which hath no
other object but vertue. As soon as <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> was taken, he told <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> what he
was, who gave him the means to let the Bassa of the Sea understand what ransom
he was set at, and how he might deliver him; in the mean time, his hurts being cured, he contracted a great friendship with that generous Slave, speaking a certain
corrupted Italian unto him, which, they say, is very much in use here in <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. As for me, after I parted from the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>, my chiefest entertainment was to talk with the Interpreter, whom my Father carried always along with
him, and by the continuall conference which we had together, touching the diversities of Languages, I had almost learned two or three, is not for to speak them
well, at leastwise to understand them perfectly; and whereas the <hi rend="italic">Turkish</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> were of that number, I did also many times converse with those two infortunate ones, thinking I had passed away the day exceeding well, when I could avoid
the company of those men of blood and slaughter that followed my Father. Thus
I spent most of my time, either in the Captains Cabbin with my Mothers Nurse,
or in their conversation. They knew well enough by my sadness, that the life
which I led was grievous unto me, yet had they the goodness not to speak to me



<pb n="9" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="9     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

of it but modestly, nor to complain of their own misfortunes in consideration of me: This compliance and advisedness of theirs made me to esteem much of them both; and the belief I had that I was beloved of <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> possessed me both with joy, and with unquietness; for I perceived sufficiently, that his heart yielded not without resisting, and that he was ashamed to wear the fetters of a Pirats daughter: This generous disposition of his for all that displeased me not, and mkaing great account of him already, I interpreted every thing to his advantage; I found that he had reason to revolt against himself, and not to give way to a passion unworthy of him, yet forbore I not to make vowes in secret, that he might know how far my disposition was form that of my fathers, but yet I durst not bring any care to justifie my self therein, because I could not do it without blaming him that gave me life.  Wee lived in this sort with some delight, and a great deale of of unquietness; the Italian Slave was afflicted to see my father break his word with him, and seemed also to be so for that he could have no tydings of a friend of his whom he
infinitely regretted; as for <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, and my self, we knew not what to wish for; he
was grieved for that he could not hear from his father, and yet feared to quit me;
I likewise made vows for his liberty, and yet feared nothing more. What, said I
to my self sometimes, shall I pass my whole life with men, whose cruelty is all their
vertue? shall I alwaies be exposed to tempests? Shall I never see other than miserable wretches? And it may be too after that I shall die the Slave of a Pirate. I vow
to thee, my Lord, this thought was a torment unto me; and albeit the conversation
of <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> gave me some pleasing houres, yet could I say that I was most unhappy:
But I was a great deal more a little after, because the term, which my father had
given the Bassa of the Sea for the redemption of his sonne, being past, he was treated more harshly than before, and kept in the rank of those Slaves, which he meant
to sell in Christian land. This resolution, being known to <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, and me, wrought
a strange effect in us, and the love which we bore one to another, and which we
had both of us concealed as much as we could, began then to break forth. I could
not speak to him of my fathers designs but with tears in mine eys, nor could he talk
to me of eloignment, which he believed to be inevitable, without declaring his
affection openly unto me; I believed, my Lord, that it was true, thinking it was
not a time fitting to to dissemble in; he assured me that his irons did not seem heavy
unto him, as long as he was with me, but the thought of being separated from me
for ever, and to be constrained to carry chaines otherwhere, was insupportable to
<sic>to</sic> him; he sware to me further, that he had not desired his liberty but to obtain of
his father, against whom he had never so much as once murmured, the meanes to
deliver me out of the hands of mine. A discourse so obliging found not an ingratefull soul, and I resolved to do what I could to keep my father from executing so ignoble a design; I cast my self then at his feet, I begged this grace of him with teares,
but for all the effect of my request I got nothing, save an express inhibition
never to  speak to him more of it. After that he alwaies treated  me ill;
I had no longer the libertie to entertain <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> as before; and wee were
all three for a long time together the most unhappy persons that ever were.
This constraint for all that kept me not from letting him know at length, that if he
would promise to mary me I would undeavour to deliver him,  so as he would be
ruled by me: <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> answered thereunto very obligingly, that loving me so much,
as to hazard his life for to make me his, I was not to doubt, but that meeting with
two such great benefits together, he would do whatsoever I would have him for to
obtain them. After he had sworn more than once to me, that if I would procure him
his libertie, and would follow him, he would receive me for his wife, I required
some time for the execution of my design; but whereas I could not finish it without betraying in some sort my father, it is certain that I almost repented me of my ingaging my self therein: I was perswaded notwithstanding that vertue and reason were of my side, and that regarding <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> as my husband, I might be permitted to follow him, desiring nothing of all my fathers riches, than this only Slave, which I robbed him of. Being well confimed then in my design, I examin, I consi-



<pb n="10" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="10     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>
der the difficulties of it, and find no other way to execute it, than to stay till we
came to the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Chio</hi>, whither my father was to goe, and there to cast anchor;
for whereas he had caused the Captains Cabbin to be divided in the midst, to
the end that I should lie on the one side, and he on the other, and that <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> also
was every night locked up with a key, which <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> himself alwaies kept by him,
I resolved to steal it as sofly as I could from him; but the difficulty was, that ever
since he purposed to retain the Italian Slave, he for to favour him, but indeed
to assure himself of him, made him to lie with him. I resolved then to propound
unto him his escaping out of my fathers hands; at first he doubted it was but to
try him, that I spake so to him, and withall his own generosity withstood it, but
having acquainted him with the truth of the matter, he believed me, and said, that
seeing my father had broken his word with him, he might fail in his fidelity to
him also; and on condition that <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> would promise him his freedom, he would
expose himself to any thing for my sake. I assured him of what he desired, and having so good a second it was not hard for me to finish my enterprise. But without importuning thy Highness, my Lord, by a long relation, let it suffise to say,
we were no sooner at the road of <hi rend="italic">Chio</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> had some acquaintance, but
night being come, and my father asleep, I went and stole away the key of the
Cabbin, wherein <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> was locked; and the generous Slave, having shut up my father
in his, where he soundly slept, came along with me to unlose his friend, snatched
away a sentinells armes that would have cryed out, and having killed him, as
well as the Pilot, we got into the skiff, and for the more surety, the generous Slave
with a blow of his scimitar cut asunder the cable that held the vessell at anchor,
which by the light of the Moon we saw sall away from us, and float at the pleasure of the wind, without a Pilot, or any man awake in her. In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> and that Slave rowed with such speed, as wee soon approched to land, where
we happily arrived; and meeting with a sanctuary in the house of one, who knew
<hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Clio</hi>, we in a little time found the meanes to come unto <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, leaving <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> no doubt in an extreme rage at our slight, which was made with
much the more security, for that my father seldom suffered his great Vessell to
enter into any Port that was suspected unto him, but sent a Barque in for
the dispatch of such business as he had to do there, and upon that it was that I had
grounded my enterprise. Now, my Lord, after I had delivered <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> with the
help of the generous Slave, and had brought him back to his paternall house, when
he would have made good his word  which he had given us, this incensed father
hath intreated me as an infamous person, and a vagabond, and hath put that Slave
into irons, to whom his sonne oweth his liberty, since that without him I could
not have executed that which I had promised; it is that Slave, my Lord, whom
thou hast so lately pardoned, and of whom the Illustrious <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> hath undertaken the protection. Behold, my Lord, the difference that is between the Bassa of
the Sea, and his sonne, whole sense I will not deliver, for fear I stiould be suspected
to interpret it too advantagiously for my self; wherefore it is for thy Highness to
understand it from his own mouth, and absolutely to dispose of my happiness, or
of my unhappiness, of my life, or of my death. <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> having given over speaking, a confused noise was heard, which seemed to judge the matter for her advantage; but <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, desiring to render equall Justice, commanded the Bassa of
the Sea to speak his intentions. I have no other, my Lord, said he, than to chace
from my house a woman, that ought to be driven from all the earth, and whose
disposition is so base and unjust, that she could love a captive, when she knew him
not for that which he was, and betray her father; a woman descended from a Pirate, nourished amidst blood and cruelty, brought up amongst wicked villaines
whom the earth cannot bear, and the daughter of a Persian thy Highness enemy:
Behold what this woman is whom my sonne will mary, and for all her estate
brings nothing with her but infamy; he will tell me, it may be, that he owes his
liberty to her, and I will answer him, that it is a good which she hath not done
him but to doe it for her self, she knew he was the sonne of a Bassa, that he had

<pb n="11" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="11     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>

Palaces, that he was rich, and that he was honored with thy Highness favors; she
betrayed her father to possess them, and hath not so much followed my sonne, as
she hath sought after his good fortune; and then who knowes whether her hatred
to <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> is not rather the cause of her flight, than her love to <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>? She was
weary of living in a continuall prison, and to speak truly of things, she owes her
liberty rather to <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, than my sonne doth ow his to her, since that at length
a ransom might have redeemed him, whereas nothing could have drawn her out
of her fathers hands. What assurance can one place in a person, that gives no markes
of her affection but treasons; that stifles all the motions of nature, to follow those
wherewith she is inspired by a disordinate love; and that begins her mariage with
an impiety? Believe me, <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, said the Bassa beholding him, she that hath been so
audacious, as to betray her father for to follovv a Slave, may yet more easily betray an husband for a man of free condition; she that could so cunningly steal avvay the keyes of a sleeping father, may peradventure, being become the more
daring by the happy success of her former designes, stab a dagger into the heart
of an husband, when as she shall be as weary of him, as she vvas of her father. And
then, my Lord, said he, turning himself to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who knows whether all that she
hath said be not a trick, and that being the daughter of a Persian, she comes not hither to observe what is done here, and seek occasion to hurt us? Howsoever it be, I find that she ought to be suspected of us, and that in this incounter my particular interest is the same with the publique. As for the freedom of the Slave, whom
thy Highness hath been pleased to pardon, I have no more to say, for to make it appear, that I am not obliged to render it unto him, than that he is the cause of all the pain I am in, seeing that he alone, 
as this woman her self saies, made <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> the 
slave of <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>; let my sonne keep his word with him, if he can, but as for me, I
have promised him nothing; I will retain him in irons, not only as a Christian, not
only as a Captive, but also as an enemy. Behold, my Lord, what my sense is in this occasion, which, as I think, is not far from reason. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> seeing that the Bassa of the sea had done speaking, told <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> that he was to declare his mind. I am very sorry, replyed he, that I must be constrained to contradict a man to whom I ow my life, and to have that cross confirmity with the vertuous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, as to have a father as inexorable as hers is cruel; but, my Lord, since the prime duty ought to prevail over all others, and that reason will have me speak without fear in this occasion, I will beseech thine Highness to consider, whether I can without ingratitude, and without being the basest of all men, abandon a person, who hath abandoned all for me, and that, as one may say, hath made herself a slave to deliver me, since that remitting her self to my conduct, and relying on my word, it was no longer in her power to alter her mind, but was necessarily to follow my will. Can I consider, that even at this present I should be loden with Irons, exposed to the insolency of Pirates, and the cruelty of <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>, if this woman had not broken my chains, and not have for her all the affection, and all the acknowledgement whereof I am capable? As soon as I was a captire, she began to do me good; I was wounded, she had a care of me, with her charitable offices she healed the wounds which her father had given me; I no sooner saw her, but I knew her vertue; she comforted the afflicted, took care to relieve them; and to say all in a word, she bewayled the Victories of her father, because she beleeved them not to be just. I confess ingenuously, that the beauty of her mind moved me more, than that of her face; and finding my self surprised by the lustre of so great a vertue, I engaged my self in such sort unto her, as nothing can be able to change it: But if vertue be the foundation of the love I bear her, that which she bears me hath had no less noble a cause: She saw me constant enough in my misfortune, she saw me wounded, a captire, and ready to be sold into a strange Country, and knew, though she seemed to be ignorant of it, that I loved her much; the gorgiousness of my clothes did not win her; for they were all torn in the heat of the fight; I was wan and disfigured; she saw me abandonded of my father, of whom I had no news; ill-entreted by <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>, because he had lost the hope of my ransom; and finally,


<pb n="12" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="12     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

in a more deplorable estate than ever man was seen: Love then did not enter into
her heart by voluptuousness, but I can say it was introduced thereinto by goodness,
acknowledgement, and compassion; for if she had not been pittifull, she had not assisted me when I was ill, she had not loved me; if she had not been acknowledging,
she had despised the love of a slave, that had not the liberty to do her any service; 
and is her heart had not been tender, she had not been moved with my misfortunes,
nor given an end to them. It is true, that she is the daughter of the Pirate <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>;
that she hath quitted her father to follow me; that she hath been brought up amongst cruell and bloody men; and that she is the daughter, not only of a Pirate
but of a <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>. But, my Lord, all this, which seems to make against me, makes
for me in this occasion: for what greater mark can one desire of a solid and immoveable vertue, than to see a woman of eighteen years of age, whose inclinations
are not corrupted amidst somany vices, and whose innocencie is preserved so entire, as she could not so much as excuse cruelty in her father? It is true, that she
hath followed me, but it was to see no more murthers, nor fights, and because she
saw a juster temper in my mind: She hath not betrayed her father to follow a slave,
but she hath quitted the Pirate <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi> to deliver a husband; for having promised
to be so unto her, nothing but death alone can keep me from it. Moreover, my
Lord, she is not to be suspected of thy Highness, for though she be the daughter of a
<hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>, it is of a <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> the enemy of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, who hath for these eighteen years
waged War against him. I will not stand to say, that this woman, albeit the daughter of a Pirate, is for all that of a noble extrastion, because the <hi rend="italic">Mussulmans</hi> make
Nobility personall, and beleeve that it ought not to pass unto children; but I will
only say, that in the estate wherein my fathers fortune now is, all that can be desired
in a woman is contrasted in this same; she is fair, she loves me, and she is vertuous.
It is true, that she is without wealth, and without parents, but she hath lost them
for the love of me; and whereas by thy bounty my father hath no need, either of support, or of riches, what can I wish for more in a wife? If I take one that is rich, it
may be she will abandon me if I should happen to fall into misery, but this that I
have chosen wil be the companion of all my misfortunes, without any fear that ever
she will quit me. I know that I ow a great deal of respect to my father, but I
know that I ow my life and my liberty to this woman; I must then love both the
one and the other, or keep my word which I have given her; for if my father will
not suffer himself to be perswaded, we will go voluntarily into banishment; we
are already accustomed to misfortune, and the misery that we shall endure together will no doubt be more supportable to us, than greatness and riches would
be if we were separated. As for the generous Slave, to whom I have promised liberty, I know not by what reason my father can pretend any right to deprive him
of it; he is neither his slave nor mine; and by the severest law of War he can lay
no claim at all unto him: He is a Christian I acknowledge, but all the Christians
here in <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> wear not fetters; he is a captive, but that is to <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>
and not to him; and a captive too, who after a breach of promise might with Justice break his chains; nor hath he sought for liberty but to give it me, and that
is it peradventure that hath made my father his enemy. It is true also that he took me, but it was in a just fight; by that reason I am his slave, rather than he is mine. Let thy Highness so order it, if it be possible, that I may acquit me as I ought. Behold all the crimes, my Lord, that I have committed; my father would have me
perfidious and ingratefull, and I had rather my father should hate me with injustice than love me unjustly. The generous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> seeing that <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> had made an
end of speaking, and having observed by the Bassa of the seas countenance, that
the discourse had rather incensed, than perswaded him, turned her self to <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>,
with tears in her eyes, and conjured him to obey his father; I will not, sayd she
unto him, have you faulty for the love of me; and since our affection cannot be innocent, extinguish it in your heart, and leave me the care of conserving it in mine;
remember that you are the sonne of the Bassa of the sea, and that you are not yet
my husband, you cannot dispense with your self for that first duty, and fortune doth


<pb n="13" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="13     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>

dispense with you for the other; I hold you acquitted of the promise which you
cannot perform to me without a crime, and I desire nothing of you but a will to
obey your father; when I shall see you resolved so to do, I will get me away alone.
Alas! said <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, interrupting her, in what part of the World couldst thou find
a place of refuge? All the Elements are contrary to us; the sea hath no security
for us, nor is the land more favourable unto us; thy father and mine do banish us
from them both, and nothing but death alone can finish our miseries. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> being touched with the pitty of such tender apprehensions, would not leave them
long in pain; and though the Bassa of the sea would have replyed, he forbad him
to withstand his pleasure; but whereas he knew, that the true reason wherefore
he opposed the passion of his sonne, was avarice, so ordinary amongst the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi>, he told him, after he had consulted with <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that the vertue of <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> had
charmed him in such sort, as he would adopt her for his daughter, and how in
that quality he would give her three hundred thousand Sultannies in mariage with
her, commanding him to receive her for the wife of his sonne, and to intreat her as
if she were his daughter, assuring him that he would hold the place of father unto
her, and that he would interess himself in all that regarded her. That for the Slave
whom he had already pardoned, it was his pleasure, that he should remit him into the hands of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to dispose of him as he would. The Bassa of the sea, who
indeed had found no other defect in the vertuous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, than poverty, seeing her
to be rich by the bounty of the Sultan, changed his choler into giving of thanks,
and assured <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> that he should be obeyed. <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> rendred him
such acknowledgement as was answerable to the favour they had received, and went
away with as much satisfaction, as they had had sorrow: But it was <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi>
pleasure, that <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> should first go and kiss the Robe of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi>, who was still
at the standing, where she had seen the Triumph. In the mean time, the day being
near to an end, the magnificences of this Triumph ended also by a volley of Musket-shot discharged by the Janizaries, which was answered by all the great Ordnance of the seven Towers, and that of all the Gallies. Great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> then retired to the Seraglio, with the Sultana Queen, attended upon by all the Troups, 
which afterwards conducted the Grand Visier to his, he that by his valour and 
prudence had been the only cause of <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> Triumph.</p>

<p>IBrahim Bassa, being unable to vanquish the secret melancholy
which he carried in his breast, could not amidst all his Victories, and all the honours he had received, keep it from being
as visible in his eyes, as it was sensible to his heart. The Conquests which he had made of the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>, the Battails which
he had won against the Rebels of <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>, had indeed filled
the whole extent of the Empire of the <hi rend="italic">Mussulmans</hi> with
gladness: but this generall rejoycing made not his particular;
neither were utility and glory considerations strong enough to give unto his mind
only that first motion which precedeth joy. He was not ignorant, that fortune had
not abased him, but to raise him infinitely; howbeit he knew likewise, that she
had given him that which he desired not at all, and that she had taken from him
the only thing which made up all his desires, and all his ambition; he perfectly
knew, that the more happy he was for another, the more infortunate he was for
himself; and a news which he had heard the day before from <hi rend="italic">Arsalons</hi> slave, had
stirred up so great a trouble in his mind, and agitated it with so much violence,
as forgetting all things to abandon himself to grief, he remembred not that he was
obliged to be present at the rising of great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, of whom he was beloved with
so much tenderness, as he alone had permission to enter into the Seraglio as often
as he pleased, a favour so extraordinary, that it had never been granted to any person. He had also made choice of our Illustrious Bassa to be not only his Grand
Visier, but to repose himself upon him for all the affairs of the Empire. It was he
that commanded the Armies; it was he that made the Sangiacs, and gave them the
Government of Provinces; it was he that presided in the Counsell of State, and
that alone formed the resolution thereof in the Sultans Cabinet: <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was so
powerfull, that he wanted nothing but the sole name of Emperor, to be the chief
of all the Orient. In the mean time these favours of fortune could not keep him
from holding himself the wretchedest of all men; it was in this irksom thought
that the Aga of the Janizaries found him, when as he came to tell him, that the
Grand Signior complained of his sloth, and that it was his pleasure he should come
away unto him. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, surprised with this commandment, which made him see
the fault he had committed, did what he could to conceal his grief from the Aga;
howbeit he perceived that there was some unquietness in his mind; <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> told
him notwithstanding that he would go straightway and justifie himself to his Highness, and that if he durst he would rejoyce for having committed this offence, since



<pb n="15" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="15     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>
thereby he received so notable a favor. After this complement he went to the Seraglio, where at first when the Sultan saw him, he observed some extraordinary matter in his face; and whereas the Bassa had past the night without sleeping, his countenance seemed to him to be changed, he appeared to him very melancholick, and his humour being more unquiet than usuall, he pressed him to let him understand the cause thereof; but perceiving that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> answered not precisely, he demanded of him whether he had any ill news to tell him? Whether the Provinces which he had conquered were revolted? Whether the forces which he had left in the Frontiers of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, were defeated? Or whether he had discovered any conspiracy against the State, or against his Person? To all these things the grand Visier answered from point to point; that thanks be to Heaven, he had nothing to tell him that could be displeasing unto him; that the Provinces which his Armies had conquered were peaceable; that his Camp had nothing to fear, it being unlikely that the relicks of two Battells, which the Enemies had lost, should be of so sufficient power, as to dare to present themselves before an Army victorious, as his was; that for the Conspiracies whereof he spake, he besought his Highness to believe that his Empire was so well setled, as there was no force able to shake so
great a Body; that for that which regarded his person, his Government was so
just, as all strange people beheld it with envy, and all his Subjects with joy. The
Bassa had no sooner made an end of speaking, but the Sultan said unto him very
obligingly, Why then, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, since thy melancholy proceeds not from any thing
that regards me, it must needs be something that concerns thee in particular, and as I am no less sensible on that side, than on the other, I
will know absolutely of thee, what it is that troubles thy minde; for
though thou hast laboured to put on a joyfull countenance in answering
me, yet hast thou not for all that destroyed the opinion which I have conceived.
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, seeing himself so neerly prest, could not forbear blushing, and thinking
on vvhat he vvas to say, he cast down his eyes, and seemed to be strucken dumb,
which the Sultan having observed, imbraced him, and said. No, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, do not
seek to disguise the truth unto me, I vvill know it of vvhat importance soever it
may be: Look not on me in this confidence, as on thy Soveraign, but as on <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, that is to say, as on a man that vvill partake with thee in all the good, and in
all the evill that can arrive unto <sic>thte</sic>; thy courage hath made thee shed blood enough in my service to oblige me to pay it vvith some tears, is it be so that I cannot bring other remedy to thy grief. The Grand Visier casting himself at the
Sultans feet, rendered him thanks for all the bounty he had shevved him; and
vvhereas he had leisure during <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> discourse, to invent a pretext for his displeasure, he besought him to pardon him, if in obeying his Highness he should
say something, that vvould clash in some sort with the respest which he owed him.
After that the Sultan had made him to rise, and had sworn to him, that he would
not be offended with any discourse he should use to him, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> began to speak in
this manner; I know well, my Lord, that my melancholy is criminall; that the
cause of it is unjust; and that thy Highness cannot know it without condemning me; but since thy Majesty hath commanded me to discover it, I must confess that I never turn mine eyes to behold the baseness from whence thy Almighty hand hath drawn me, but I tremble with amazement; the place where thou hast set me is so high, as it is not altogeher without reason that I fear to be precipitated from it; and I find my self in the view of so many people, as I hold it almost impossible, but that the malice or envy of some should make me lose that which thou alone hast given me; nevertheless I am not ignorant that the same hand, which hath lifted me up, can sustain me; but, my Lord, if the respect which I ow to thy Highness, would premit me to represent unto thee the most remarkable changes which have hapned in this Empire, thou wouldst acknowledge, that having received far more than I have merited, I have reason to apprehend that that may be one day taken from me by justice, which thou hast given me by bounty. The pitifull adventure of <hi rend="italic">Achmat</hi> under <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi> the second, hath furnished matter for all those that


<pb n="16" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="16     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

have succeeded in his dignitie, never to think themselves secure: He had confirmed the Throne of <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi>; he had been the only man that mounted him into it;
in the mean time for a recompence of all his services he was strangled by two
Slaves. But, my Lord, not to go so far to seek for examples, that of <hi rend="italic">Chassan</hi>
Bassa, Visier under the reign of an Emperor, who could not be but great, seeing
he hath given birth to thy Majesty, is not he able to strike fear into the firmest and
most innocent soul? since for giving good counsell, which had not been successful
if it had been followed, he lost that life which he had so many times hazarded for
the safety of this Empire: I should not have been so bold, as to have spoken of this
adventure in this occurrence, had I not remembred, that I have heard thy Highness bemoan the misfortune of that great man: Now therefore demand no longer
of me the cause of my grief, seeing thy Majesty knows it as well as my self; but
is it be true that I am beloved of thee, as I cannot doubt of it without a crime,
pardon only my weakness, and believe not that the discourse which I have made
is an effect of my ambition. I know too well, my Lord, that I cannot go higher,
and for that reason it is that I fear the inconstancy of fortune, who being unable to
raise me more, shall be constrained to destroy me for to follow her naturall inclination; it is an order which she hath kept in all ages, and I dare not hope that she
will break it in favor of me. But, my Lord, were I assured that she would be
contented with bereaving me of all the honors, which I have received from thy
Greatness, and that she would leave me heavy laden with chains, as I was when
it pleased thy Highness to free me of them, provided (I say) that she would not
deprive me of thy Grace, I should be untroubled, and live more happily being
thy Slave, than now I do being full of glory and favors. The Sultan having
hearkened to this discourse with a great deal of patience, could not at length
forbear interrupting him; I thought, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, said he, that I had opened my heart so well unto thee, and so thorowly shewed thee my Love, as there
rested nothing more for thee, either to fear, or to desire; but since I am deceived in
my conjectures, I will pardon thy weakness, and if it be possible I wil cure thee of it. I
could, if I would, find some excuse for the violences which my predecessors have used
during their reignes, and tel thee, that in an Empire which was not as then well
setled, it was in some sort convenient to lean rather towards rigor, than towards
clemencie; but I will not undertake to make their apologie serve my turn against
thee; that which was just in their times, would not be reasonable in these; wherefore I will imploy other remedies, which, if I be not deceived, will make thee
know, that <sic><hi rend="italic">Sliman</hi></sic> can tell how to chain up fortune when he pleaseth, and that he
is resolved, to measure thine with his life. The Bassa would have answered to so
obliging a speech, but the Sultan staying him said; I think, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, thou hast not
forgotten, that it is by the meanes of the Sultana, my daughter <hi rend="italic">Asteria</hi>, that I have
the commodity to see thee in my service. I should be too ingratefull, replyed the
Bassa, if I should not remember, that I ow my life unto her, and that which is
yet more precious unto me, I  ow her the honor of serving the greatest Monarch
of the world. That being, said <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, thou needest not doubt, that the design
which I have, should not please her; seeing that in a time, when as she knew thee
not but by thy good aspect, she judged thee worthy of her care; but to clear my
thoughts unto thee, and to dissipate the fear that masters thee, know, that I am resolved to place thee in our illustrious alliance, by making thee mary <hi rend="italic">Asteria</hi>; and
to leave thee yet a more precious gage, receive the word which now I give thee,
(thou knowst, being what I am, that it is inviolable and sacred) remember then,
that I swear to thee by <hi rend="italic">ALLA</hi>, that as long as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> shall be living, thou
shalt not die a violent death; judge now whether I can doe more, and whether
thou hast not been too blame to doubt of the firmness of my affection. It is true,
my Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that I am the most ingratefull, and the most faulty of all
men; but,my Lord,&#x2014;and as he would have proceeded, he was suffocated in such
sort with grief, as it was impossible for him to speak in a long time. The Sultan,
surprised with this unexpected emotion, knew not whereunto to attribute the



<pb n="17" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="17     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

cause of it. In the mean while <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, being somewhat come to himself again, resolved no longer to conceal the truth of his History; casting himself then once again at the feet of great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>: I know well, my Lord, said he unto him, that if thy Highness be just, thou wilt hate me as much as thou hast loved me; for after I have been so daring, as to disguise my thoughts unto thee; after I have been yet more in now telling thee that, I am not in a condition to accept of the honor which thou presentest unto me, I dare not hope for so much patience from thy moderation, as to hear that, which might render me excusable. It seemes to me, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, ansvvered the Sultan, that after all the graces vvhich I have conferred on thee, thou oughtest to expect any thing from me, and yet ot add one more to that which thou hast craved of me, I promise thee to suspend my judgement, and not to think any thing to thy disadvantage, till I am forced therunto by thine own confession; prepare thyself then no longer to conceal anything from me, that concernes
thee: Thou knowst that I have divers times endeavoured to oblige thee, punctually
to recount unto me, both thy birth, and thy adventures; but having alwaies observed how that discourse did not please thee, I have had so much goodness, as to
speak to thee no further of it; but now that there is question of thy rest, and my satisfaction, thou must make a recitall to me of it with as much truth, as thou hast used
dissimulation heretofore. It is true, my Lord, replyed <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that all that I have
told thee hitherto is but a fable; but it is true also, that all that which thy Highness is now to understand is the very truth: I cannot chuse but blush to think, how I am going to discover all my weaknesses; and is I did not know, that Love doth
oftentimes become the tyrant of the greatest spirits, and that thy Highness hath
not been alwaies insensible of that passion, I should not be so inconsiderate, as to
acquaint thee with my miseries. The Sultan, desiring that none should come
to interrupt this narration, went from his chamber into his Cabinet, where
liting down on Cushions of cloth of Gold, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> began to speak in these
tearmes.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">The History of</hi> Iustiniano <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Isabella.</p>

<p>THe City, where I took beginning, and that gives name to our Republique, is
situated on the bank of the Sea, which the antient Romanes called <hi rend="italic">Ligustique</hi>, and is at this day termed the River of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>; this goodly City, I say,
whereunto for the magnificence of Palaces of marble, Jasper, and Porphirie, is given, and that with reason, the title of Superb by all the people of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, is built
on the bending of certain high and barren Mountains, which are so unfruitful, as
all the industry of agriculture, joyned to the heat of the Sun, the serenity of the
air, and the sweetness of the dew, cannot make one tree to grow, one flower to
spring, or so much as one herb to come up there. But is as nature had taken
pleasure to shew contraries opposed, there is leading toward <hi rend="italic">France</hi> a Coast, all
alongst the which, <hi rend="italic">Final, Savonna</hi>, Saint <hi rend="italic">Reme</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, are seen, whose fertility is so great, that it produceth abundantly Dates, Oranges, Pomegranads,
Iasemine, and Mirtle. The many Rivers, and Fountaines, which are there, make
not the lest beauty of those places, for those waters are so pure and quick, as they
furnish sufficient coolness to temper the extreme heat of the Sun. It is on that Coast, about tvvo miles from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, in going out of a Gate called the <hi rend="italic">Lanterns</hi> that a
Borough stands, by the Italians named <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi>, where one may say that winter never comes, since it is certain, that the Spring, and Autum, reign there alwaies together; the first causing flowers continually to spring, and the other fruites to ripen in it: But before I ingage my self to a mare particular description of the deliciousness of a place, that hath been the occasion of so much misfortune unto me,
it vvill not be from the purpose to make an abridgment of the Government of
<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, to thy Highness, to the end thou maist the more easily comprehend what
the persons are, of vvhom I am to speak in my History. It is to be knovvn then, that about two hundred yeares since the <hi rend="italic">Genoueses</hi> elected a Duke, according to

<pb n="18" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="18     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

the manner of the Venetians, who after he had conquered the Island of <hi rend="italic">Ciprus</hi>, taken the King and Queen thereof prisoners, and performed many other brave exploits, died at length in the warres. After him they elected two more, whereof
the first acquired by his valor the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Meteline</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Genoueses</hi>; but at length
after the death of the last they put themselves into the protection of <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> the
seaventh King of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, of whom being weary, they not long after chose the Duke
of <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> for their Defendor, who having not given them full satisfaction, it obliged them to chuse a Duke once again; but that proceeding being not equally agreeable unto all, because some held the party of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, and others that of <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>, it hapned that this disorder returned them absolutly under the Dominion of
the French, which commanded them,  untill the time that <hi rend="italic">Andrea Doria</hi>, who is
of one of the most illustrious races of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, put our City into the estate which
now it is, namely under the Government of the Nobility. I have made known
unto thy Highness the divers mutations which have befallen our Republique, to
the end thou maist with the less difficulty comprehend that, which hath made all
this Commonalty be divived a long while since into two principall factions;
the Heades of these two parties are the <hi rend="italic">Fregozes</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Adornes</hi>, ingaged, as
well as all the rest of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, in two opposite factions, so known and famous under
the name of the <hi rend="italic">Guelphes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gibelius</hi>, with whom the <hi rend="italic">Fiesques</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi>,
the <hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Grimaldies</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi>, and all the other illustrious Families of<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> have taken part. But to come to that which regards me directly,
I will not fear to tell thy Highness what my birth is, being consident of thy generosity: Thou maist be pleased to understand then, that I am of the illustrious
race of that infortunate prince, from whom the valor and fortune of <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> the
second, thy great Grandfather, took his Empire, and his life, and who interred
himself with all his glory, and with all that of the <hi rend="italic">Paleologues</hi> under the ruines
of this famous City of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. Thou art not ignorant, my Lord, that after
so great a subversion of that State, and in so generall a destruction, all that remained of the Princes of the Imperiall House were dispersed over all the earth, and
not able to conceal their unhappiness in generall, some of them concealed themselves by changing a too famous name for their present fortune; <hi rend="italic">Justiniano Paleologue</hi>, of whom I descended, was of that number; for seeing he had saved out of
that shipwrack wealth enough for a particular, but not enough for a Prince of so
illustrious a blood as his, he retired to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, retaining but the name of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>,
which since hath been the surname of our House, the very same with that of a Popular Family, which was before in the same City: And that poor Prince desiring to accommodate his quality to his misfortune, shut up that secret within his
Family, and in this sort, though we be in effect Princes, yet have we past ever
since for Gentlemen. That which obliged him to chuse <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> for his retreat, rather than any other place of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, was, for that he knew how the <hi rend="italic">Genoueses</hi> had
alwaies been well affected to that Empire; how they had mightily succoured
<hi rend="italic">Michaelo Paleologue</hi>; and hovv in case it should happen that he should be known
for that which he was, he should be in a place of safety: And truly he had some reason to fear it, for he had  rendred himself so remarkable by the gallant actions
vvhich he had performed, and had so signalized himself on the day of the taking
of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, as he was the last that vvas seen to defend the breach; but at
length beholding the City taken, the Emperor <hi rend="italic">Constantino Paleologue</hi> dead, and the
whole Empire subverted, he stole away his person from the victory of his Enemies; and being retired almost alone he took the resolution which I have delivered. I know very well, my Lord, that it is too much temeritie, in the estate wherein things are, for me to let thee understand, that I am of a blood, which gives me
some right to pretend to the Empire that thou possessest at this present; but, my
Lord, I am to tell thee, that in the disposition wherein I am for thy Highness, I
would prefer my former chaines before the Empire of my Ancestors; and that is
I were the distributer of Crownes, I would set them all upon thy head, reserving
nothing for my self, but the onely glory to obey thee. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, not able to indure



<pb n="19" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="19     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

that a discourse so generous should continue longer without an answer, took <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> hand, and wringing it with a great deal of affection; I have alwaies indeed believed, said he unto him, that thy birth was as high as thy mind, and I am glad that I have not been deceived in my conjecture; and without knowing the right which thou couldst pretend to this Empire, I have at least rendred thee
all the justice that I could render thee; for I protest unto thee by all that is most
holy, and most sacred unto me, that if the conveniency of things would permit me
to yield thee up the title, as wel as I have given thee the power of it, I would do it
with joy out of the knowledge which I have of thy vertues, and out of the affection I bear thee. But continue, I pray thee, the relation of thy adventures unto me. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> would fain have answered to these civilities of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, but being kept
from doing so by him, he proceeded in this manner. That last of the <hi rend="italic">Paleologues</hi>,
and that first of the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi>, had a sonne, called <hi rend="italic">Philippo</hi>, who retaining something of his birth, had an imperious spirit, that would give place to no man; this
<hi rend="italic">Philippo Justiniano</hi>, my great great Grandfather, finding himself alwaies opposed
to one <hi rend="italic">Astolpho Grimaldi</hi>; the one having ever followed the party of the <hi rend="italic">Fregozes</hi>,
and the other that of the <hi rend="italic">Adornes</hi>; it was his hap also to be a pretendant to the
Charge of the Generalissimo, as well as he, so that their secret intentions breaking
forth in this occasion, they fell to quarrelling so outragiously, that they ingaged
all their kindred, and all their friends in their interests; and as their ambition was
extreme, so also was their violence. But without amusing my self in recounting
this troublesome History to thy Highness, it shall suffise me to say, that following
the detestable custom, which is observed over all <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, that particular and persosonall hatred passed even to my father, who yet could never approve of that habit in his heart, that will have one receive with his life, the hatred of his Predecessors enemies, which being just for them, becomes unjust in their children, since
it is addressed to innocency; but at length to follow the custom, rather than his
inclination, <hi rend="italic">Ludovico Justiniano</hi> (so was he called that gave me being) had never
any commerce with <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho Grimaldi</hi>, the chief of that other Family; contrarily
knowing that his enemy was of an haughty humor, and that he might draw some advantage from his goodnes, he alvvays took care to conceal it from him, and both on
the one, and the other part, they did all that an irreconcilable enmity could suggest to two vindicative and powerfull men. Behold, my Lord, the order wherein
I found things at my comming into the World; but without speaking of my infancy to thy Greatness, I will only say, that as soon as I had attained the age,
wherein strength began to permit me to travell, I obtained of my father the means
to content the extreme desire I alwaies had of going to admire the pompous ruins
of the antient <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, and the grandeurs of the new; away I went then with an Equipage answerable to my condition; but my curiosity not being limited by the
view of one only City, I resolved to give no obedience to the commandment
which I had received to return unto <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> within six moneths after my departure;
and as if fortune had taken pleasure to favour my design and inclination, she
wrought so, that the Emperor of the Christians came to <hi rend="italic">Lucca</hi>, where I then being for to see the interview of the Pope, and that Prince, I understood that preparation was making for the War of <hi rend="italic">Algier</hi>; I will not fear, my Lord, to confess
unto thy Highness how joyfull I was to meet with an occasion, whereby I might
learn a trade, which I was resolved to exercise all my life; I will therefore acknowledge freely, knwoing thy generosity, that he, who would now spend all his blood for thy service, was thine enemy in that action. This resolution taken, I had not much ado to execute it; for whereas <hi rend="italic">Andrea Doria</hi>, Prince of <hi rend="italic">Melphi</hi>, was powerfull wtih the Emperor <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>, he did me the honour to make me known unto him, and promised me to write unto my father, for to get him to be pleased with my design; the care that he took thereof was not in vain,for as soon as
he was advertised of it, being good and generous, he furnished me with means to
perform that voyage with magnificence. I will not tell thee the lamentable success of that War, because the tempest which shipwrackt our Army, was not of so

<pb n="20" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="20     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

small importance, but that it may be imprinted in thy memory; the loss of tvvo
hundred vessels, and above fifteen thousand men, that were all swallowed up of
the waves, or dashed in peeces against the Rocks, was so dreadfull an adventure,
as the only remembrance of it strikes horror into me: At length, my Lord, I escaped that danger, after I had an hundred times seen death, for which I have been very
sorry I know not how often since; but whereas we had scarce any leasure to have
other enemies to fight with than the winds and the seas, I could not resolve to return to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> before I had found some opportunity, that might make me known,
whether I was worthy to carry the name of the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi>; so that the relicts of
our Army parting from <hi rend="italic">Bugia</hi>, where they had sought for a shelter, I would not
follow them that were discharged; contrarily I imbarqued my self with the Emperor of the Christians, who took the way of <hi rend="italic">Majorica</hi>, and from thence went and
landed at <hi rend="italic">Carthagena</hi>. But hardly was he arrived there, when as he saw himself
constrained wholly to quit all his designs of <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> for to think of defending himself
from the <hi rend="italic">French</hi>. It would be unjust to abuse thy patience with the recitall of a War
which no way servs to my discourse, it wil suffice then that I say, how I followed him
three whole years together, except when he was at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, whither I would not
go for fear of being retained by my parents. But at last, after I had been a witness
of all the brave actions which he performed in <hi rend="italic">Navarre</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Germany</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Luxemburg</hi>
against the Duke of <hi rend="italic">Cleves</hi>, and in <hi rend="italic">Guelderland</hi>, I received express order from my
father to come home to him, which I presently did, though the Emperor was
loth to let me go. But, my Lord, what cause of misfortune hath that return been
unto me? Ah! how much better had it been for me that I had dyed in the Wars,
than to have gone to a place where so many grievous adventures were to befall me?
It was not, for that I was not received with joy, caressed by my kindred, imbraced by my friends with all kindness, and is I dare say it, regarded by the enemies
of our house with more esteem, than that inveterate hatred, which had been long
between us, would permit; but contrariwise it seemed, that the Fates had resolved to let me tast all the content of a quiet and delicious life, for to make me feel
at once, both the privation of the good, and also the evill which was prepared
for me. After I had then bestowed some time in receiving the caresses of our family, and that I had answered all the questions which my father made me touching
the War, and my Voyages; after, I say, I had recounted unto him an hundred
times over all the occasions wherein I had been present, I desired to make it appear, that War and Gallantry were not incompatible, and that after having been
three years in slaughter and blood, I was not returned from thence, nor more wild,
or more uncivill; I took care then to inform my self from my friends, whether
there were not some Assembly shortly to be, where I might make comparison between the Beauties of our Ladies, and those which I hud seen in <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi>? Thereunto they answered me, that I might in a little time content my curiosity, for that
in three or four dayes the Nuptials of two persons of quality in our City would
be solemnized. I further demanded of them whether a Niepce of <hi rend="italic">Andrea Doriaes</hi>
held not still the Empire of beauty? Or whether since my departure some other
had not bereaved her of that advantage, which had been given her with so much
justice? They told me, that she was fair, as I had seen her, but as for the prime
place, she had been constrained to yeeld it up to a springing beauty, which made all
that came near it to dy for love; and that they accounted me most happy for not
being exposed to that danger. But when as I demanded of them by what false consequence they conjectured that I was insensible of love? they answered me then, that
<hi rend="italic">Isabella Grimaldi</hi>, the only daughter of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, was that same admirable person,
who could not be sufficiently praised, and of whom they had spoken unto me; and
that knowing the terms wherein we stood, they beleeved that I was so generous,
as I would not suffer my self to be vanquished by mine enemy. This discourse stirred up such an emotion within me, as hath made me to understand since, that there
is a supreme power which forceth us, whether we will or no, and without the aid
of our knowledge, oftentimes to love a person whom common reason forbids us

to regard. And consider, my Lord, the extravagancy of my adventure, I took a resolution then carefully to seek out all occasions to see the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; and to shew that there was already something extraordinary in this motion, I concealed my curiosity, and my design from my friends, and made a secret and a mystery of a matter, wherein according to all likelyhood there would never be
any; and indeed soon after I quitted them, and without farther delay I went and
passed two or three times before the windows of mine enemy. It was not because I
knew not well enough that I should not see her; for it is the custom of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>
well as of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, that all the windows of the Ladies have an iron-grate before them, which permits them to see, but suffers them not to be seen, unless they
will dravv up the grate, which is a grace they seldom shevv, and vvas not to be expected of me; howsoever I went thither, because I could do no othervvise. The
next morning I failed not to be more diligent than I vvas vvont, and I did all
that possibly I could to incounter her, for knowing her mother, I was certain that I
should have no need to ask her name; but whether it were, that whilst I was in
one place, she was in another, or that fortune would defer my captivity, I
could not meet with her any where, how carefull soever I was to do it. I demanded of my reason an hundred times over, what aim I had in this design; but
after I had reflected on this unquietness, I condemned my self, and resolved patiently to attend the hap of incountring her, vvho vvas to content my curiofity.
I past some dayes then after this manner in all the entertainments of a man of my
age and quality; the conversation of my friends, walks, and musick were my occupations, and the last quiet pleasures that I have tasted in my life. But, my Lord,
since I must recount my undoing to thy Greatness, and let thee see the field of my
defeat. I must say then, that <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi>, whereof I have already spoken, is a Burrough
vvhere all the persons of eminent cpndition have houses of pleasure, the least
whereof may stnke admiration into them that understand gallant things; for all
that is beautifull in Architecture, all that is excellent in Painting, and all that is
marvailous in Sculpture, arc there to be seen in such perfection, as neither the eye
nor the vvit of the most skilfull can find any thing to reprehend therein. The
Terraces, the Grots, the Water-vvorks, the Galleries, and Balustrades, are there
so superb, as one can hardly beleeve the first time that one beholds such vvonders, but
that they are of those inchanted Palaces, vvhose descriptions, though fabulous,
leave not for all that to please our imagination. To conclude, all that Art, and
Magnificence can adde to a place, vvhereunto Nature hath given all her beauties
are eminently found in this same. It is here so near unto the City, vvhither all
the vvomen of quality use to go and walk; their liberty being far greater at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>
than in all the rest of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, the neighborhood of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> having contributed
a part of their customs to it. It hapned then one day, that one of my dearest
friends intreated me to go and hear a consort of Lutes and Voyces, vvhich vvas
to be the next day at an house he had in that delicious abode; and vvhereas I have
alvvaies been touched very sensibly vvith Musick, I failed not to be there accordingly: it is certain nevertheless, that I came thither vvith a secret melancholly vvhich doubtless advertised me of the misfortune that vvas to betide me there; but I vvas not able to make any profit by this involuntary motion, vvhereof the cause vvas unknovven to me; I suffered my self notvvithstanding to be charmed vvith the svveetness of the harmony, and as it vvas at that time the only passion that mastered my mind, me thought it had dissipated my heaviness, and rouzed up my joy; this agreeable transport vvas the last moment that preceded my ruin: For, my Lord, when as the Sun was so low, as it could no longer incommodate either with his rays, or with his heat, the Master of the house told me, that before I went dovvn into the Garden, he vvould let me hear a marvellous Eccho, vvhich he had found out a little before, and which one of his neighbors had given him without thinking of it; hovv he had done him that good office, but causing a Grot to be made just against the windows of his Cabinet, and hollowed in the mountain in the form of a half Moon, which collected, and returned back the voice so admi-

<milestone n="22     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

rably, that the seventh repetition which the Eccho made, was distinguished perfectly. Scarcely was this discourse ended, but that devancing all the company I entered alone into the Cabinet, resolving to try the Eccho first of all; howbeit my
Lord, I had no sooner opened the windovv, but insteed of obliging the Eccho to
answer me, I my self lost the use of my voice, by the rapture vvherewithal! I
was seized, in beholding the fairest creature that ever Nature made; she was
leaning on a Balustrade of Jasper and Porphirie, which formed a Quadrant in
the midst whereof stood a Fountain, wherein four Nymphs of white Marble seemed to play together in bathing themselves; for by a marvellous artifice there parted from their hands in different actions, an abundance of water, which wetted
them, and made one believe that they cast it upon one another, making withall a
very  pleasing noise. If I had never seen this Fountain but in this incounter, I
should not have heeded it so much, as to be able to describe it; for I vvas so surprised with the charms of this unknovvn fair one, as I had no eyes but for her: I
changed colour twenty times in a moment, and hiding my self for fear of being
perceived, I considered her with all the attention that a man could have, who from
admiration was already passed even to love; it being most certain, that from the very
first instant I savv her, I felt my self forced with so much violence to love her as I
then fully resolved to dye, or to possess her. As I was in this estate all the company arrived, and shewed me that they were sorry I had quitted them so soon, because there had been a dispute about the nature of the Eccho, which would have
pleased me very much; after I had heard this discourse, vvithout answering unto
it, I asked whether there were any that could tell me the name of that fair one,
who sate musing on the brim of the fountain, which I saw in the midst of the Garden; in saying so, I softly opened the window, which I had half shut, and praying
them to make no noise, I shewed them that prodigy of beauty: I had no sooner
made an end of speaking, but by an hidden knowledge, which prevented their
answer, I felt something within me, that told me how it was the divine <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>;
scarcely had this thought excited some trouble in my mind, when as one of my
friends confirmed this truth unto me, and demanded of me, is it was possible that
I should not know mine enemy? Why, said I, interrupting him, is she that I see,
the daughter of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>? I spake this so loud, that I made her turn her face towards the place where we were, so that having perceived us she pulled down her
veil, and began to go away unto two women that were walking in an Alley a good
way off. To tell, my Lord, what became of me in this occasion, would be a difficult matter; my reason proved so weak, and my passion so strong, as little wanted,
but that forgetting all kind of good manners, I had at the very instant departed
from a place  that had been so fatall unto me, as to let me see in one onely person
the object of my hate, and of my love: But at length, the spight and the shame of
being seen with so much weakness, made me resolve to try to conceal it; I said
then to him that had spoken to me, that I was ravished with having so fair an Enemy, and that though she had arms which would easily render her victorious of
all them that she would subject, yet was I generous enough, for to combat a person by whom one might be vanquished without shame. After this they amused
themselves in seeking out the beauties of the Eccho; those of the company who
had the worst and the hoarsest voyces, forbore not forcing this Eccho to reproach
them with their defect, in imitating them: As for me, who had it not unpleasing at that time, it was impossible for me to sing, and howsoever I constrained my
self, I could not call to mind so much as one air, albeit I knew many. This entertainment lasted so long, that at length, the hour of our departure being arrived,
I returned to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, but so sad and melancholick, that to conceal my unquietness
from my Father, I resolved not to see him all that evening: I retired then to my
chamber as soon as I was come home, and gave my people order to say,that finding
my self somewhat ill I was gone to bed, having first expresly charged them to make
no noise: After this I went into my Cabinet, where I was no sooner alone, but
the pourtrait of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> presented it self again before mine eyes; my imagination



<pb n="23" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="23     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

figureed her so perfectly unto me, as I began to believe, that this adorable Phantasm appeared to me by the force of some charms; but after I knevv that it vvas pure effect of my memory, and of my love, I past from that thought to another, and regarding her no more as my Mistress, I considered her as the daughter of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>; What, said I, to my self, shall I love mine enemy? Shall I choose for the object of my affection, her, who ought to be the object of my hatred? Shall I be so unworthy as to give all my services and my cares to a person, whose father imployes all his for the ruine of my house? No, no, I am more sensibel of mine honor, than of my passion; and how charming soever <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is, glory is yet more. When this resolution seemed to me to be well enough setled in my minde, I called a Groom of my chamber, whom I had stayed to attend me, and letting my self to be made unready, without knowing what I did, I laid me down in my bed; but alas! it was in vain that I sought for rest there, for whereas my thoughts were divided all the day by the diversity of objects, silence and obscurity made them amass all their forces to persecute me; and the same reason that had opposed me love, began to speak in favour of my passion: It represented unto me, that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, was not guilty of her Fathers crimes; that there was injustice and cruelty in going about to eternize hatred; that a more 
noble occasion to make it cease could
never present it self; that my design would be always approved of by wise men;
that after all it concerned my content, and not that of others; that we live not
for another, but for our selves, and that by consequence I vvas not to forget any
thing that might give me satisfaction. This reasoning seemed so just unto me,
that I spent the rest of the night in thinking on the means to execute it; but the
more I considered this enterprize, the more I judged it impossible; the arrogant
humour of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, and the generosity of my father, seemed two obstacles very
difficult to be forced; but that which put me into further despair, was the thought
that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> her self would be inflexible to my Love: For, said I, is it possible,
that a maid, who hath been brought up with the hate of the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi>, who no
sooner opened her eyes, but she beheld my house as her enemie, can resolve, I do
not say, to love, but only to indure that I should adore her. These divers agitations troubled me in such sort, as I could not form any design; but whereas love
cannot subsist without hope, I think that in the end I had surmounted my passion,
and broken my chains, if that fatality which will have me ruined, had not exposed
me once again to a new danger. I was scarcely out of my bed, when as my people told me, that I was invited to the Wedding of one of my Fathers friends, who
was to be married to a maid allied to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; this news filled me with extreme
joy, and preparing to go thither, I took more care of my self, than ever I had
done in all my life before: But being resolved to see the arrivall of mine enemy, I
got me in good time to the place appointed for the Ball; I was no longer there
than to make the complements, which are usuall in such like occasions, whenas I
saw <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> enter with such a dazeling Majesty, as imposed silence to all the company, and it seemed that she had inspired every one with modesty and respect. After
that this dumb admiration had continued a while, there was a confused noise heard
of acclamations and praises, which were given to her beauty; and the truth is
that envy it self could not find any thing in her to be amended. She hath a stature
so antagious, and a port so majesticall, as never was there woman seen of a better presence. Her hair is of colour brown, but so beautifull, as all those threads
of burnished gold, wherewith our Poets use to describe such, cannot represent
them; they fell that day carelesly upon her cheeks, and thence descended in thick
curls down her neck and bosom, but with a negligence so replenished with address,
that it defaced the handsomest curiosity of all the women of the Assembly. She
hath a complexion so white and vive, as there is no whiteness that seems not sallow unto it; but the same is mingled with so dainty a Carnation, which is shed a
broad in her checks, that the mixture of Lillies and Roses, of Cynoper and Snow,
could make but a slight <hi rend="italic">Idea</hi> of her beauty. Her eyes are black, but so full of spirit and sweetness, as it is impossible to behold her, and not be taken with them;



<pb n="24" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="24     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

yet are her looks so modest, and so far from all artifice, as it is very easie to know
that they are innocent of all the evills which they make one endure. She hath a
mouth neither too great nor too little, but so composed, and of so Vermilion a
hew, as there is no corrall that comes neer it. Her teeth are so evenly set, and so
white, as never were smiles so full of charms as hers; and her bosom so delicate
and so comely, as imagination cannot represent it to it self such as it is: There
is also a gracefulness mingled amongst all these marvells, which cannot be exprest,
and which renders her more amiable than all that which I have delivered. To
conclude, be it for the whole form of the face, or for all the features of it in particular, or for the air in generall, it is the most perfect beauty that ever Nature
produced. But, my Lord, had the souldiers that took me, left me the picture
which I had of her, and the Letters which she had written to me, I could have
made thy Highness see the truth of my words, and that the graces of her mind do
no whit give place to those of her beauty: It was then, my Lord, that Isabella
with all those allurements, appeared in that Assembly. She was apparelled in a
Gown of Carnation Sattin, imbroidered with gold and pearls, whereof the sleeves
were buttoned up with great Diamonds; the rest of her habit was of cloth of silver, imbroidered with Pearls and Emeraulds intermixt. She appeared so charming
unto me in this estate, as I could not for all that evening take mine eyes from off
her; and as I carefully observed her, me thought she perceived that I did not behold her as an enemie, and to render my joy yet more accomplished, I marked
how she blushed every time that we met together in the same Brawl, but in a fashion which perswaded me, that it was neither for hate, nor for anger. And whereas it is the custom of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> not to converse with the women of an Assembly, but
in leading them to dance, I took out one of my kinswomen, whom I had seen all
the evening with <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and that I might oblige her to speak to me of her, I said
unto her, that I found it very strange she should hold such intelligence with mine
enemy; but without giving me leave to finish my speech, she answered me that the
talk they had together was so advantagious for me, as I had no reason to complain of it; and that as the praises which are given us by our enemies, are more
glorious for us, than others, because they cannot be suspected of flattery, I was no
longer to doubt of my good meen and address, since <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> her self had judged
of it in favour of me, upon speaking of the grace and dancing of every man of
the Company. This discourse ravished me in such sort, as I could not forbear
looking on <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, as if I would thank her for so favourable a judgement; and as
she hath a quick and piercing wit, she knew both by my demeanor and joy, that
my kinswoman had given me an account of their talk, which possest her with so
much confusion, as it was impossible for me all the rest of the evening to incounter
her eyes. At length, my Lord, the company being separated, I returned home, but
so full of joy and hope, that my reason found not it self any longer strong enough
to oppose my passion. But not to stand on the recitall of these first proceedings
of my affection, wherewith I have already but too much importuned thy Highness,
it will suffice to let thee understand, that in the continuance of this happiness I
saw <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> in two or three Assemblies more, from whence I alwayes went still
better satisfied; and after I had been so hardy, as to write divers times unto her,
and ready enough to finde the means to do it, I knew at length that my vows were
not rejected, and that my temeritie should not be punished. I obtained then the
permission to serve her, provided I were discreet, and that neither by my actions,
nor by my discourse, I should give any cause of suspecting our intelligence: I observed this order so religiously, that albeit there passed not a day wherein I saw
her not at her window, or an evening wherein I had not a Letter from her, or she
from me, yet was no body ever aware of our commerce. And to render my
good fortune more accomplished, it hapned that the people being fallen into a mutinie in the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Corsica</hi> for some Contribution that should have been established
here, the Signioria deputed <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> for to go and appease that disorder; but
whereas his wife, named <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, had been extreme sick, he would have her for the

<milestone n="25     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

recovery of her strengh to pass the time of his absence at the Borrough of <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi>, where the purity of the air would restore her to her health sooner than at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>. I was advertised of this resolution the very same day that it was taken; but at first this news so grieved me, that I could not answer <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, who had sent it to me, for I imagined that I should be deprived of all the means of seeing, and of being seen of her: As I was profoundly musing on this adventure, all on a sudden I began to call to minde the window of the Cabinet where I had lost my liberty, which
made me think, that if <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would permit me to discover one part of my design to the Master of that house, who, as I have already said, was the dearest of my
friends, I should be the happiest of all men, since I might not only see, and be seen, but talk with her as long as she pleased. I wrote instantly unto her then to
propound her my design, but with tearms so full of love, and with such strong
resons for the prevention of all might happen to us thereby, as at length she consented unto it, though, as she told me afterwards, it was not without much repugnancy. I no sooner received her answer, but I went to seek out my friend, of whom
I desired leave to go and pass some time at that house of his; but whereas he
pressed me to tell him, whether his presence would not be necessary for me there,
I believed, that for the obliging of him to be faithsull and secret, I was to confide
in his discretion and fidelity; wherefore I acquainted him that I desired his house,
only to receive <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> Letters by the Cabinet-window, which opened towards
the Grot of the Eccho, and that in the same place I hoped to see and speak with
her. He was so surprized with this discourse, that he stood a good while beholding
me without making any ansvver; but to keep him from indeavouring to oppose
my passion, I intreated him to give no ear to any reason that could speak to him
against me, but to hearken to my request; and seeing that it vvas by his means
that I vvas undone, he was obliged to have pity of the evill which he had caused;
I likevvise recounted unto him all that had befallen me, so that judging by the violence vvherevvith I spake to him, that I was too far ingaged in this design to be
diverted from it, he promised to yeeld a blind obedience to all that I vvould desire of him. In this sort we parted, and albeit <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had not permitted me to
make use of the Cabinet, but only to give her Letters, to receive hers, and to speak
to her at such times as vve could not be heard, yet I purposed not to rest there,
and vvithout advertising her of it, I caused a ladder of silk to be made, that thereby I might descend into the garden vvhen I thought fit, being out of hope of ever
meeting vvith a more favourable occasion to talk vvith her of my love. But not to
lose time, as soon as I knew that <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> vvas departed, and that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> vvas
at <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi> vvith her mother, I resolved to go thither the same evening; novv to do
that secretly, I told my Father, that having made a match with <hi rend="italic">Casar Doria</hi>, (for
so was that friend of mine called) we intended to go and pass away some time
at an house which he had neer to <hi rend="italic">Gaui</hi>, to hunt the wild Bore, and to injoy all the
delights that the fields and solitude could give us. He approved of my resolution, told me that the season was too fair to be passed wholly in the City, and permitted me to go away that very day; I went then and found out <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who for
his part had taken care to make the same thing to be believed; and having but
one Groom of the chamber with us, we took the way of <hi rend="italic">Gaui</hi> but as soon as we
were out of the sight of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, we crossed the Mountain to get to <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi>, where,
notwithstanding all the hast we could make, we did not arrive till ten of the clock
at night; for whereas we kept no way, we strayed three or four times. As soon
as I was come into <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s house, and that he had commanded the Keeper thereof
to silence, I left him in his garden, for to go with much impatience to his Cabinet,
where I no sooner was, but I heard the voyce of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, who indeed imagining
that I would not fail to be at the window, had for a pretext to get thither, and be
alone there, taken a Lute, saying that she vvould at leisure study an air, vvhich she
had not very perfect, therevvith to divert her Mothers melancholy. She vvas then
leaning on the same Ballustrade,vvhere I had seen her before; but if at the first time she charmed me by the eyes, at the second she charmed me by the ears; I vvas


<pb n="26" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="26     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

so ravished to hear her, that notvvithstanding the desire I had to speak to her, yet
would I not interrupt her, though I infinitely feared lest she should be called away
before I had been seen of her; but in the end the fruition of a present pleasure
prevailed over the fear of an uncertain evill. I heard her then with all the admiration I was capable of: For, my Lord, she hath a voice so strong, so clear, so
sweet, and so charming, as she inspires the minds of those that hear her, with
the same passions which she expresseth by the airs she sings; and whereas night and
silence are the friends of Musick, there rested nothing more to make my contentment persest, than to adde to the delight of hearing, that of seeing distinctly: I
was not long without enjoying that happiness, for the Moon, which had been a
pretty while up before, made an end of dissipating of the shadow that had reigned all over the Garden, and in rendring me that good office, she made me also
to be perceived of her, so that she presently gave over singing, and approached to
the place where I was, but with so much circumspection, and so much fear, as
made me greatly to pitty her. She prayed me with a trembling voice to give
her a Letter if I had any, and that the next day, if I would let her down a string,
sbe would fasten her answer to it. After I had laboured to assure her as much as
possibly I could, she made me to understand, that we could not have any long conversation in that same place without being discovered, because if we spake softly
it would be unprofitable unto us, not being able to hear one another; and if we
raised our voices,it were to be feared that we should be over-heard from a close ally
that was not far off. I consented then to be contented with seeing her, and receiving her Letters by the way she had propounded unto me; but whereas I had my
design concealed, I besought her to tell me in what part her lodging was, to the
end I might at leastwise have the pleasure to imagine to my self the place where
she would be writing. But before she answered me, she looked round about, to
observe whether she might not be over-heard; after which she demanded of me,
if I did not see on my left-hand a Turret athwart the trees, which was joyning to the end of a Gallery, that made up one front of the Garden, and that answered to another altogether like unto it? and having told her that I saw it, she
added that her chamber was of an even floor with that same place; and that the
perron of it was just against the end of the close alley, from whence she feared to
be over-heard; and that if I would advance forth my head a little, I might see
the grate of her window. As soon as she had said this, she went away, having
first assured me, that such evenings as she could not come her self to receive my
Letters, she would send a mayd to me that lay in her chamber, in vvhom she
absolutely confided. After she was retired, and clean out of sight, I vvent presently and found out my friend, to whom I gave an account of our conference.
But, my Lord, seeing I must obey thy Greatness, in recounting all my adventures
unto thee, I must say, that after I had been three or four dayes obedient to <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> pleasure, one evening she sent me that mayd which she made use
of, with a Letter, desiring me to excuse her if she came not her self; for
that being somewhat ill in the morning, she could not invent a pretext  to
obtain permission to come into the Garden according to her custom. This
news grieved me exceedingly, and so throughly confirmed me in my design,
that to execute it, I enquired whether <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> were retired to her chamber? The
mayd told me, that she had left her at her windvvw, staying till she returned, which
she was instantly to do, because the doors would suddenly be shut, for the keys
were to be carried to her mother, who had commanded that to be exactly observed.
I threw her down my Letter then, and having dismissed her, I went and desired
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to assist me in the resolution I had taken to descend into the Garden. He
did all that he could to hinder me from it, but after I had told him, that I exposed my self to no danger, seeing that <hi rend="italic">Rodolpho</hi> was not there, that <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> was
sick, and that in conclusion, I should enter into an house where there were none
but sleeping Women, the rest of the train being at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, or gone with <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>;
I entreated him that he would only attend for me at the window, to the end
that if by ill fortune I were seen, I might save my self before they had time to open


<pb n="27" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="27     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

the door for to follow me. Our contestation lasted long enough to perswade me
that it vvas shut, but yet I believed that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was not gone to bed, and that my
Letter would entertain her untill such time as I should come unto her, because by
good hap it was very long. So I began to fasten my Ladder and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, more vanquished by my intreaties, than by my reasons, set himself also to help me; and
whereas I feared nothing in this enterprise but <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> displeasure, I never
thought of mine own safety, hovvbeit <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> made me take a brace of Pistols, and
my sword with me, whereupon I descended into the Garden, and calling to mind
that the close alley was corresponding to <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> lodging, I went along through
it, for fear of being perceived, either from the Gallery, or the mothers chamber;
when I was arrived at the end of the alley, I observed that there was no light in
all that Turret, but in one window that had a grate, which I imagined to be <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> Cabinet; I approached thereunto then as softly as possibly I could, and
whereas the vvindow was low, I might easily see all that was done in the room
through the glass, so that I perceived <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, but with so much grace in the negligence wherein I saw her, as I knew well, that art added nothing to her beauty. She
was leaning on her left elbow upon a little table, where my letter lying open before her, she had her eyes fixed on it, whilst <hi rend="italic">Feliciana</hi> (so was the mayd that served
her called) undoing of a string that tyed up her headgeer, covered her almost all
over with her hair; but <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, coming as it were out of a dead sleep, and puting
it aside with her hands told her she would not go to bed yet, for that she was resolved to write unto me first. It were better, said I unto her, pushing the casement
that was not shut, that you would grant me the honor to entertain you a vvhile.
She vvas so surprised with seeing me in that place, as she could not forbear screeking out, whereupon she would have passed into her chamber, but not able to open
the door thereof so quickly, I had leasure to tell her, that is she put me into despair, I was apt enough to kill my self before her window: She fell down then
upon the cushions not able to speak, which gave me time to crave pardon of her
for my boldness; I besought her to remember the discretion I had always used
since the day she had permitted me to serve her; that this was the onely disorder
whereunto my passion had carried me; and that if she would take the pains to consider it, she would not judge this fault irremissible. Do you believe then, said she,
in approaching to the window, that to put my glory and your life in hazard is a
crime of small importance? But at length, after I had made her to comprehend,
that there was less danger in speaking with her, when all the World vvas retired,
than at such time as she of her goodness had granted me, I got her to consent, that
from thenceforward I should alwaies see her in that sort. Our conference was
so long, as the awaking of the birds made me know, that it was time to let her go
to sleep; but before I left her she gave me her picture, which she had drawn in imitature, by beholding her self in a glass; for this divine person is skilfull in all excellent Arts and Sciences: She also permitted me to kiss her through the grate, a
favour which I may well say, was the onely privacy that ever she accorded me during all the nights which I have past in entertaining of her. I vvithdrew then
by the same way I came, but so satisfied with the wit of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, that I began to
love her more for her vertue, than for her beauty. I found my friend in an extreme impatience for my return, and ready to come and seek me out for to know
whether any misfortune had befallen me; but to recompence him for this pain, I recounted unto him all that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had the most obligingly said until me; the vovvs she had made to love me everlastingly, and absolutely to renounce the world rather than be any others than mine; and that whereas I would have perswaded her to suffer herself to be carried away for the avoyding of our fathers tyranny, who would be forced to agree together rather than lose us, she had withstood it with so much prudence and sweetness, as I was constrained to confess, how strong soever my passion was, I could not merit <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. It was in this manner then, my Lord, that I past away that lucky absence of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>; but at length his return changed the order of things, and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> went back to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> with her mother, as me-

lancholick, as I was afflicted; we had been so accustomed to see and speak to one another, that the privation thereof was insupportable to us; and although I went
every morning to receive a Letter at her vvindow, and to give her one of mine;
yet could we not comfort our selves against the constraint wherin vve lived. And as
if it were not enough that we vvere persecuted by our own misfortune, <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> saw
her self also troubled for a mishap of her fathers, who in executing the Commission which he had to go into <hi rend="italic">Corsica</hi>, had procured unto himself the enmity of the 
family of the <hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi>, by saying at his return, that the Governor, vvho vvas of
that house, had contributed in some sort to the mutiny of the people, and that if
he vvould he might have hindred the sedition that was raised there: This report
obliged the Signiora to cite the Governor to come and give an account of his
action, which made <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to fear that this mans revenge vvould fall heavy upon her father. As for me, who had no other interest than that of the incomparable
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, I was even mad for that I durst not offer my sword to <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, vvho
was at that very time plotting my death; for whether it were, that he vvas advertised how I went every night about his house, or that he knevv of my being at <hi rend="italic">Arena</hi>
by some way unknown to me, one evening, as I was alone with my sword under
<hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> Window, he came thundring upon me, with eight men armed, in such
fury, as I had hardly the leasure to put my self into defence; now though it was
very dark, yet chanced I to know him, and thereupon resolved, rather to be
killed, than dip my hand in the blood of the father of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>: I did nothing
therefore but ward the blows which he laid at me; but tvvo of his advancing towards me, I had not for them the same respest that I had for him, so that collecting all my forces together to oppose their violence, I extended them dead at my
feet; the rest, who saw this so sudden an execution, made a little stand, during the
which I got me to the end of a narrow street, that was not above tvvo or three
steps from me, for fear of being inclosed, where I fought a good while without receiving any more than two vvounds, which I got because I would not strike <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>; but at length I should have fallen in this unequall combat, had it not been
for a succour that arrived unto me. And consider, my Lord, the strangeness of my
adventure; that which should have been the cause of my undoing, was the cause of
my making: for it hapned, that at such time as I was pressed most by mine enemies,
the same offended Governor, of whom I have already spoken to thy Highness
came, accompanyed with fifteen or sixteen, and assaulted them behind. In this disorder I never stood doubting which part I should take, but siding my self with <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, I said unto him, that I was come to lose that life for him, which he would
have taken from me. And whereas I fought then for <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, since it was to save
her father, I found my forces redoubled, and my courage increased; whereupon
being to imploy my best indeavour in the action, I attacqued the chief of the enterprise with such ardour, as albeit he were one of the valiantest men of our age,
yet by the good fortune of arms I surmounted him. As soon as he fell, one of his
followers cried out, that his Master was slain; this voyce put all that troop into
such disorder, as they thought of nothing but of flying, although they were in a condition to have destroyed us; for whilst I was engaged with their Chieftain, they
had killed three of <hi rend="italic">Rodolphoes</hi> men, who in the heat of the fight had observed how
I had guarded him with mine own body, and that by my hand his enemy lost his life.
After I had pursued them that fled a good way off, for to keep them from making
head again, I saw <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> come towards me with open arms, and as soon as he
could imbrace me, he demanded of me, whether after I had been so generous as to
save his life, I could be so likewise for to pardon him; and how, if that might
not be, he judued himself unworthy to live; how he knew well enough that he
had committed a barbarous and cruell fact against me, but how I knew also that
he was the father of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>:  He said this to me with so much resentment and
tenderness, as being no longer able to keep me from interrupting him, I assured
him, that I should never be mindfull of any thing hereafter but of the goodness
which he had showed me; that the grace which he did me in promising me his

friendship, was far greater than the outrage I had received; and htat on the contrary one might say, he had done an act of justice in going about to punish my temerity; and that now he did one of clemencie, in accepting of the service which an enemy had rendred him. This while <hi rend="italic">Rhodolphoes</hi> people would have carried away their dead men, hoping that they which were in this fight, should not be discovered, if no mark thereof were left in the street; but <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> commanded that 
they should not touch them, for that he was resolved to complain
the first; and observing that I did not bear up very well, he asked me whether I
were hurt? I answered him that I thought I was, but it was slightly, and that
when I had put him into a place of safety, I would go home and see how it was
with me. No, no, my sonne, said he imbracing me, it would be unjust, that the
father of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> should be the cause of your hurts, and she not be your Chirurgion. In saying this he made me enter in at his gate, where I no sooner was, but, the loss of blood having extremely weakened me, I swooned in his armes, whereat <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> cryed out so loud, as I understood afterwards,that his wife and daughter
believed his enemies were still pursuing him into his house; they ran in then
affrighted in all hast: but whereas they knew not the particularities of that which had past, they were mightily astonished to see me in that place, and in that estate. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> believed at first, that her father, having gotten some notice of our love, 
had brought me thither to put me to death before her eyes, but she was mightily
surprised, when as she heard him give order for the speedy fetching of Chirurgions, and beheld me led to his chamber, and he himself helping to sustain me. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
was so skared with that she saw, as is her mother had not held her up, she had fallen
down by me. Her father seeing her in that case, said to her weeping, as I was told
afterwards, you have reason, daughter, to love the most generous of men, and if I
be so unfortunate as to be the cause of his loss, I consent that you shall hate me as
much, as I have hated him; but without further lamenting, let us indeavor to succor
him. The voice of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> having brought <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to herself again, she would have
made some excuse, but enjoyning her to silence he commanded her to follow him
to his chamber, whither I had been carried before. As soon as they had laid me on
a bed I began to open mine eyes; and consider, my Lord, what my apprehension
might be, when I saw my self between <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho, <sic>J</sic>sabella</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, who came to
know, by one of those that were in the action, that I had saved her husbands life,
it was so great, that I thought I should have swooned again, but the Chirurgians,
being arrived, applyed remedies that kept me from it. After they had searched my
wounds, they assured them that there was no other danger in me but loss of blood, so
that if I were suffered to rest they hoped to cure me very speedily. As soon as I was
drest, and that <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> had been acquainted with their report, he came to me
with a smiling countenance, and said, that seeing he was assured of my life, he
was not in despair of recompensing me for the service I had done him; that in the
mean time he would go and advertise my father of all that of all that had past, to the end that
after they had imbraced one another, they might conjointly think of what they
had to doe. But having told him, how I held it not fit, that he should go forth, I
besought him to permit me to write two or three words to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> for to come to
me, and that when he was come we would send him to my father. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> approved this counsel, so as it might not incommodate me; and having assured her that
I found my self strong enough for it, she gave me paper, wherein I wrote, without
seeing that which I did, so weak I felt my self, when I tryed to lift up my head. But <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, desirous exactly to observe what the Chirurgians had enjoyned, gave order to <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> and his daughter to keep me from speaking, to draw my curtaines for fear the light should annoy me, to have as great care of me as of him, and not to leave me till I was in a better estate. I besought him then to permit me to say one word more unto him; whereupon he approched to me, and pressed me to give him some occasion to serve me. I answered him, that the grace which I desired to obtain was, that he would not speak, either to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, or to my father, of our first incounter, but would be pleased to say onely, that good fortune had brought me by


<pb n="30" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="30     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

chance into the street where he was set upon. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> was so ravished with this
discourse, as he could not forbear imbracing me, and saying alowd, that as the
conservation of his honor was more dear unto him, than that of his life, the care
I took to deface the stain  which he had made in it, obliged him more streightly,
than the blood I had shed to save his. As I would have answered, he stayed me, and
went away to give order for all that he thought was necessary, both for his safety,
and mine. And whereas <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> dwelt not far off, he came not long after into the
chamber where I was, but so surprised, and so amazed, to hear that I was wounded, to see me in <hi rend="italic">Rhodolphoes</hi> house, and to find <hi rend="italic"><sic>J</sic>sabella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> siting by my beds
side, that he was a long time in a doubt, whether he was well awake, or no. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, having been advertised that he was arrived, came and entertained him with
so much civility, and spake so advantagiously of me, as I was constrained to pray
him to change his discourse, and to think rather of the necessity of our affaires,
than of praising me unjustly. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was instrusted then in the estate of things, and of
our intentions; <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> desired him to tell my father, that he would have gone
home to him, if I had not hindred him, to crave pardon for all that had past betwixt them, and to intreat him to think well of it, that his daughter might be the
reward of the combat, which I had so happily undertaken for his defence; how
he was not ignorant, that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had been more equall than he, in esteeming of
me as soon as she knew me; and that for him he was not so ill informed of my designs, but that he had been advertised of those which I had for his daughter; in
the end so to do, said he to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, that the Families of the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Grimaldies</hi> may be united with an indissoluble knot: More than this I have not to
say, <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> knowes the Nobility of my House, understands the riches of it, and
cannot doubt but that the Principality of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> will one day be <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> promised to imploy all his address to make the matter succeed according to
our desires. <hi rend="italic"><sic>Rodolpho</sic></hi> instantly requested him, I earnestly conjured him, and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
with her eys only intreated him thereunto. He went then to my Father, who was so
surprised with every thing that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> imparted unto him, as he divers times asked
of him, whether he had not lost his understanding: what, said he, as I knew afterwards
by <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, in one very hour hath my sonne saved the life of his enemy? hazarded
his own by the wounds which he hath received? killed the enemy of <hi rend="italic"><sic>Rodolpho</sic></hi>?
made peace between the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Grimaldies</hi>? and for a conclusion, hath
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> and the Principality of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> been offered him by <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>? No, no, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, all that you tell me is far from all likelyhood; you talk to me of blood,
of murther, of slaughter, of reconciliation, and nuptials all at once; how doe
you think that I can accord all these things, and can joy and grief be compatible?
But in the end, my Lord, that first transport being over, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> assured the matter so
seriously unto him, as he was constrained to make no longer doubt of it. I confess that in this incounter I was more happy than I hoped; for as soon as my father was perswaded to this truth, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> found his mind in the terms that I desired. I think, my Lord, I have already told thy Highness, how <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> never approved of that unjust hatred, which passeth with the succession of Kinsmen, and
that was the reason why he was so easily carried to what I wished. He came then
accompanied with <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> and some of his servants; to the house of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, who
received him with a free and open countenance, and with such strong protestations
of acknowledgement and amity, as it was easie to observe, that his eyes and his
mouth expressed the meaning of his heart; and as my father would have been very sorry that his antient enemy should have surpassed him in curtesie and generosity, returned his complements with so much civility, as it would have been
hard to imagine, that those two men, who so kindly embraced one another, had
been mortall enemies all their life-time before. <hi rend="italic"><sic>Rodolpho</sic></hi> having brought <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> to my bed-side, said unto him, that he was much grieved to render him his
sonne in that estate wherein he saw him; but to repair that misfortune, he besought him to accept of a present that he would tender him; whereupon he caused
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>to approach, and presented her to my father, who beheld her with so much


<pb n="31" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="31     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

admiration, as I doubted not but that he approved of the choice I had made of her; and presently speaking he assured <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, that though he and I had hazarded our lives a thousand times over for her service, yet could not all that countervail the price and merit of so fair a maid. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> interrupting him, said, that giving himself, together with <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and all his estate, yet should he be infinitely indebted unto me, that my modesty forbad him to extend himself on the obligations wherein he stood ingaged unto me, but how that could not hinder him
from resenting them as he ought; in the mean time he requested him to receive
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> for his daughter-in-Law, upon such conditions as he pleased, to the end
that after he had his word for it, they might think of that which was necessary to
be done for their safety. My father turning himself then to me, said, that
hee held it superfluous to ask my advice in a matter that vvas so glorious for me, and that I had so happily resolved upon without him; so that,
said he, taking <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> by the hand, it is on you that the conclusion of this important affair doth depend. But <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> seeing her blush, without daring to
answer, told <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi>, that his daughter could no better express her consent, than
by that shamefastness, which made her to blush and be silent; the modesty of her
sex, and of her disposition not permitting her to testifie her joy, but in such a manner. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> and my father then promised an inviolable friendship one to another, and ordained us to do the like in their presence; and for a gage of this promise, <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi>, who ordinarily wore a rich ring on his finger, took it to me for to
give to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, as a pledge of the faith which we had promised to each other. I
observed this ceremony with so much pleastire, as spight of my miseries and hurt
I never felt the like before, nor since; but at length, after this happy accord, they
retired into another chamber to think of what they should do: My Father was
of the opinion, as well as <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, that he should send to make his complaint as
soon as the Concell should be assembled; but that he held it not fit either for him
or me to stay in his house; that the Family of the <hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi> were powerfull enough
to keep themselves from having any manifest injustice done them; and that albeit
their kinsman had been the agressor in that fight, yet the Laws would have the
dead always to be favoured, and that he which had killed any one should be always punished; that for this reason he was to retire to his Principality of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, where he might attend safely and commodiously the success of things; that
place being in a situation so advantagious, and so well fortified, as it could keep
out a Royall Army; that as for me, I should finde an inviolable sactuary in the
Army of the Emperor <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>, whom I had already served; but whereas I was
not in an estate to travell, by reason of my wounds, which peradventure would
keep me a long time in my bed; and for that also he could not go out of the City presently, because the gates were shut, he advised that without further delay,
and before the day appeared, I should be transported into some other house,
whereof the Master was so much respected, as no violence might be feared there.
<hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> approved of this proposition, and began to bethink them what
place would be proper for the same; but <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> told them, that he was not
troubled about it, for that the Palace of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>, Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi>, chief of
the Family of the <hi rend="italic">Fiesques</hi>, would be an assured retreat for them; that the high
rank which those of that House had held in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> for so many ages, would not
permit that either the insolency of their enemies, or the rigor of justice, should
enterprize any thing upon them; that for the rest he doubted not but that he
should obtain that grace ot them as soon as he should demand it; that they had
alwayes favoured him in all things; and that generosity was so naturall unto
them, as in all times their Palaces had served for a retreat to all worthy persecuted persons. It was then resolved, that <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> should go immediately and intreat him thereunto, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> went also along with him, and they found him fast asleep; but my Father having told his people, that he was necessarily to be awakened about an important affair, they knowing <hi rend="italic">Lodowico</hi> made no difficulty to do it. As soon as he saw my Father by his bed-side at such an hour as then it was, he


<pb n="32" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="32     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

doubted that some urgent matter had brought him thither; wherefore he demanded of him, whether he vvere so happy as to be able to serve him? Then my
father recounted unto him in few vvords all that had befallen me, wherevvith
he vvas so strangely surprised; but without giving him leave to make his request
he to told him, that he was too blame in not causing him to be brought to his
house. And when my father answered him, that he durst not doe it before he had
intreated him thereunto, <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> seemed to be offended vvith that circumspection, but since the fault vvas done, he vvould pardon it upon condition, that himself might go and help to convey me thither. And so calling to his servants he commanded them to make him ready vvith all speed. My father did all that he could
to stay him from going, but could not prevail, for <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> told him, that the
<hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi> were violent, and that peradventure meeting them in the street a second
misfortune might happen, that when he should be present with all his train, he
could not believe they would be so daring, or so <sic>stroug</sic>, as to set upon us. My father then consented to what he pleased, and he being quickly ready, they parted
instantly to go to <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, who in the mean time had setled his domestick affaires.
When <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> was arrived, and had represented to <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> how glad he was
of our reconciliation, be prayed my father and him to arm all their people, and to
give order for whatsoever was necessary for the transporting of me, during the
which he approched to the bed where I lay, exceedingly afflicted to see them going to separate me from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, who was withdrawn to the other end of the chamber, when as <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> entred; but as soon as he perceived it, he told me that he
would not deprive me of an happiness, which I was so suddainly to forego, and that
he should have leasure enough at home to commend my valor; that is he durst he
would have desired <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to return thither again, but that he thought it fitter to
leave us at liberty together; herewith he went forth without giving me time to
answer him; and he was no sooner out of the chamber, but putting by the
curtain I saw that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was alone there; for the confusion, wherein
the house then was, had so busied <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, as she never thought of that civilitie;
I besought her then to come nearer unto me, that I might bid her adew; at that
word the teares came into her eyes, and my speech failed me; she came then and
sate down by my bed side, with so much sadness painted in her face, as much augmented mine; but after I had inforced my self to speak, I said unto her: At length,
my dearest <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, fortune hath joyned us, and fortune doth separate us, but
what rigor soever she doth exercise towards me, she cannot longer keep me from
dying with glory, now that I have the honor to be yours; she may indeed separate
our persons, and it may be for a long time, but she cannot disunite our hearts, if
so it be true, that your affection is answerable to mine. You may judge, said she interrupting me, whether a maid, that hath not feared to offend her glory, in loving
her enemy against the will of her Parents, be capable of change to a man that exposeth his life for her sake,  and to save her fathers; believe then, and without ever
doubting, that all the powers ofthe earth, opposed against my design, shall not so
much as make me waver; and that <sic><hi rend="italic">Jsabella</hi></sic> will be absolutely yours, or never will
be any bodies. Her sighes suffocated her in such sort, as it was impossible for her to
say more; and as I was about to give her thanks for so obliging a speech, and mingle my teares with hers, <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo, Rhodolpho, Julia, Doria</hi>, and my father came again into the chamber, so that all I could do, was to say unto her, wringing her
hand, that she should alwaies remember her promises, and that then she should be
most assured, that nothing but death should separate us. Immediately hereupon
they, which had order to carry me away, approched to my bed, and by the commandment of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>, seated me in a chair, that was prepared for me. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>,
who most tenderly loved his wife, and daughter, began then to bid them farewell:
<sic><hi rend="italic">Jsabella</hi></sic>, who till that instant had kept her self from weeping, seeing she had a fit
oportunity for it, shed so many teares, and fell a crying in that manner, as moved
all the assembly to  pitty: I knew for all that, mauger my sorrow, that I shared
therein with her father; who, willing to shew some constancie in this occasion,

<pb n="33" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="33     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

bad her to come unto me, and give me her hand. To tell thee, my Lord, what I
felt in the moment of our separation would be impossible for me, since it is certain that I had never so much grief, as I had at that time, in eloigning my self from
<sic><hi rend="italic">Jsabella</hi></sic>, but in the end I was to resolve for it; and after I had kissed her hand
without speaking to her but with my eyes, I was carryed away, so lost,
as I do not remember the order that we held in the streetes; howbeit I was told
afterwards, that <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> divided his men into two parts; and that I was placed
in the midst of them, where <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had in charge not to abandon me,
whatsoever should arrive; <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> put himself into the head ofthe Troop, and
my father marched in the rear, to the end that on what side soever they were assaulted, a man of command and courage might still be there. But whereas the
<hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi> knew not that we were retired to <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>es house, they never thought
of lying in wait for us, so that we got to <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldoes</hi> without any bad incounter;
After I was laid in bed, he and my father advised, that it would be easier for <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> to get away to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> as soon as it was day, than is he stayed longer, because his enemies had not had leisure yet to think and consider of all, that might
hurt, or help them; to that purpose they judged it fit to disguise him like a Mariner, and to put him into a Feluca, which might easily carry him to that place of
safety. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> consented to whatsoever they thought good, and <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> took
upon him the care of dispatching the business: He sent then to the Port as soon
as day began to appear, to hire a Feluca, upon condition it should part presently; and that the Master of it should lend one of his habits; the money which was offered to this man, was so much, as ravished with this incounter, and without further inquiry, he said that he was ready to part, and that for one of his habits he
would lend it, so as he might be permitted to goe home to his house, because he
had none there. He that made the bargain agreed he should do so, but for fear he
should discover any thing he would goe with him. The Master ofthe Feluca, who
thought of nothing but his gain, was contented with it; away they went together
to fetch that habit, and that done, he left that man in the guard of one of his fellowes, whom he had brought thither with him, and came and rendred an account
of his voyage. Immediately <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> disguised himself,  and seeing it pretty far
day he took his leave of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> and my father, who both of them promised him
to doe in his name all that they had resolved on, and whatsoever else they judged
would be requisite to procure his liberty. <hi rend="italic">Lodovico</hi> and he shewed so much generosity in this separation, and spake so obligingly one to another, as <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>
could not forbear telling them, that <hi rend="italic">Spinola</hi> could not have been lost more profitably for the Common-Wealth, seeing his death had served to make two so great
and excellent men become friends. When they had answered to this civility, <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> came to me, with so much kindness, and such testimony of acknowledgement and friendship, as I was sensibly touched therewith: He assured me once again
with oathes, that his daughter should be the reward of the blood which I had shed
for him, provided I did not change my resolution. The weakness wherein I was,
did not keep me from rendring  him thanks, as I ought, for so obliging a discourse; but at length he went away to find out the Master that waited for him:
<hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> did not let him go without a guard; he caused six of his servants to follow him a loof of, and he himself went to the Port for to see him part. <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>
was so fortunate, that he crost through the City without meeting any one that
knew him; he imbarqued himself then with all possible speed, and in a little time
arrived safely at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, where he was received by his subjects with joy. As soon
as the Councell was set, they vvould have complained in <hi rend="italic">Rhodolphoes</hi> name, but
they found themselves prevented by the space of a quarter of an hour onely; and
that the father of him vvhom I had killed, had accused me for the death of his
sonne: for though our fight vvas in the night, yet vvas I knovvn by my voice    and
the follovvers of him that vvas slain had marked, hovv he and I vvere ingaged in
a particular combat. This accusation appeared at first so unlikely to the Judges, as they gave no credit at all unto it; and vvhereas they vvere not ignorant of that

inveterate hatred which was between the <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Grimaldies</hi>, they could
not comprehend how I should be induced to fight for mine enemy. As they were
in this pain, my Father presented himself to demand justice of them for the violence had been done me, and to colour the matter he told them, that passing by
chance along the street, I had seen <hi rend="italic">Spinola</hi> set upon <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi> with so much advantage, as my generosity not able to indure it, I presently resolved to labour the hindring of that mischief, or is I could not, to side with the weaker party, as I have
done; that in this occasion I had been dangerously hurt; that nevertheless knowing the power of the <hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi>, and fearing lest the Senate should be misinformed
of the truth of the matter, I had absented my self till such time as justice was done
me. My Father made this discourse with such earnestness, and so advantagiously
for <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, as it was easie to discern that he was no longer his enemy. But
whereas the affair was important, in regard it concerned three ofthe principall
Families of the City, they resolved nothing for the present, but referred the matter to the next day, with order notwithstanding to the <hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi> to cause their witnesses to be examined the day following. This news was instandy spread over all
the City, with so much admiration and astonishment, as no body could believe
it the first time they heard it; contrarily all those of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> said openly, how it
could not possibly be, for that the hatred which passeth successively into the minds
of men cannot be extinguished in a moment,and that by consequence it was not credible, that I could pass from one extremity to another in an instant,and that I should
render to the greatest of mine enemies all that the dearest of my friends could expest
from me. But as nothing can be long concealed, it was quickly known, that love had
begot friendship, and that the passion which I had for <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, was the noble cause of
this adventure. In the mean time the whole Common-wealth was divided; and although the faction of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> were the stionger and most considerable, and that
it was absolutely for us, yet could it not hinder the passing of an express order for
the searching out, and apprehension of us. And whereas the dead party is alwayes regarded, all the grace we could obtain was, that the affair should not be
precipitated, and that it should be prolonged as much as the forms of Justice
would permit. Whilst things past in this manner, I wrote every day to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>,
who answered me with so much wit and sweetness, as I could not be but happy
in the constraint wherein I lived. But at length my wounds being cured, I was ashamed to remain shut up in a house at a time wherein I might make use of my
courage, and shew my Judges that I was not a man to be cast away; howbeit I
felt an extreme violence for the executing of this resolution; for though I were
deprived of the sight of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, as well within <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, as if I had been further off, yet found I for all that some content, in thinking that we were within the <sic>iuclosure</sic> of one and the same City; but sense was to give place unto reason, and I
was to follow the will of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, which served much to make me depart the rather, for knowing the violence of my passion, she imagined that being thoroughly
well, I would have much adoe to keep my self from stealing unto her some evening, according to the proposition I had made her to that purpose; so that to avoid the mischief that might arrive to me thereby, she pressed my departure: I
propounded it to my Father, who approved of it; the difficulty was to get forth of
<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> without danger; but whereas <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> never found any thing difficult to
serve his friends, he told us, that he had an infallible means for to do it; that I
should but only get me in the night to his Galley, which being ready to set sail,
to go and joyn with the Squadron of <hi rend="italic">Corsica</hi>, should for my occasion take the
course of <hi rend="italic">Sestra</hi>, where I should be received as in a place that depended on him,
and from thence I might easily go to <hi rend="italic">Ligorne</hi> in a Tartana. This order was exactly observed, but before my departure I desired to confer with <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> in private;
I conjured him then to take a speciall care to send me news of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, as often
as possibly he could; and that he should not fail to write me punctually even the
least things that concerned her. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> promised to satisfie my desire all that he
might, and to forget nothing that he thought would content me; I intreated



<pb n="35" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="35     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

him also to go from me to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, for to give her my last farewell, and to receive her caommands to me, foreseeing well that <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> would make me depart as soon as it was night, without permitting me to go to <hi rend="italic">Rhodolphoes</hi>. He so worthily acquitted himself of his commission, that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had leasure to write me a large Letter, wherein she represented the necessity of my voyage so well unto me, and gave me such assurances of her affection, and of her fidelity, as I departed almost without grief, such an absolute power hath she ever had over my mind. I took my leave then of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>, and of my father, and followed the order they had prescribed me; as soon as it wsa night I was conducted to the Galley in the habit of a simple souldier; and whereas the Captain was acquainted with the business, he made me enter into his Cabbin, from whence I came not forth till he had cast Anchor at <hi rend="italic">Sestra</hi>, under pretext of taking in fresh-water. I was no sooner ashoar, but I went a delivered a Letter, which I had for teh Governour of that place, who presently provided me a Tartana, that carried me to <hi rend="italic">Ligorn</hi>, where I was so fortunate as to encounter a vessell ready to set sail for <hi rend="italic">Cap d' Istria</hi>; there I quitted the sea to cross through the Country of the <hi rend="italic">Grisons</hi>, and having put my self in a fitting Equipage in a reasonable good Town, vvhere I stayed certain dayes, I past into <hi rend="italic">Germanie</hi>, where the Emperour <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> the fifth was then employed in the War against the Protestants. I speak of all these things to thy Highness, without further clearing them unto thee, knowing
well enough, contrary to the custom of the <hi rend="italic">Othomans</hi>, thou understandest the
Universall History; that there are no people so far distant, of whose Religion, Interests, Warres, and the least particularities of their Countrey thou art ignorant; nor any Prince whose Exploits or Designes are unknown to thee. To
conclude, my Lord, I can tell by long experience, that thy Greatness hath extraordinary lights for all that may be comprehended by a humane spirit; and
it is out of this knowledge, that I have have not explaned my self more at large
in many places of my narration, which certainly are not intelligible in all the extent of thy Empire, but which cannot be ignored by the most knowing, the most
mighty, and the most victorious Monarch of the World.  <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, not able
longer to endure these praises, given him by <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, sayd unto him smiling,
that hee had not permitted him to speak, but onely of his Adventures, and
that to obey him exactly, he was to pursue his discourse without flattering him.
The Bassa, returning no other answer, but a low obeysance, continued the course
of his History in this sort: I came then my Lord, to the Emperor of the Christians,
vvho received me, I dare say, with joy and kindness; he remembred still the services
I had him, and in consideration thereof vvould have given me imployment
in his Army: But whereas I was uncertain ofthe continuance of my voyage, and
was rather well assured, that if my business was dispatched at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, I should
instantly be gone, I excused my self the best I could, and went and served amongst
the Voluntiers. I lived then after this manner without any other unquietness,
than what absence brings along with it, which though it be somewhat harsh to a
man that is passionately in love, yet tollerable t ome through the pleasure that
I had done in receiving Letters from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>: but I was not long in this condition; for three moneths after my departure I understood the death of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>; I
knew that <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> and her daughter were at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; and to take all comfort from me, my father wrote me, how that all the grace that could be obtained of the Senate, was the banishing of me for ever from all the Territories of the Republique, and that upon pain of losing my head if I were found in any part of them.
I received the news with so much angish of mind, as I thought I should have dyed wiih grief: but of all these things, that whereof I was most sensible, was the
affliction of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, which I saw so well described in a Letter that she wrote me,
as I forgot mine own misfortune to lament hers. I knew the sorrow she was in for
her faher; I knew the haughty humor of <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>; I knew that my banishment destroyed all our hopes; and even then I found her tears so just, and mine flowing in
such abundance, as there was no room left to obey the commandment she had layd

<pb n="36" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="36     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>
ing to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, till I heard from
her; but at length, after I had a while deferred writing unto her, I sent her word
that I would alwaies very exactly follow her directions; that I besought her for
all that to consider, how I could not do better, seeing she could not dispose of her
self, than to come to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, where, without fearing the violence of our enemies,
we might live and rest in safety; that the <hi rend="italic">Spinolaes</hi> were not powerfull enough to
raise an Army for to set upon us there, and that the Republique would not of a
particular interest make a generall caus ; that for the rest, time, it may be, would
change the order of things; that sometimes sentences had been revoked less unjust
than that which banished me, and for men that were not of the family of the
<hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi>, and that peradventure were not more profitable for the publique
good: In the end I did all that I could to obtain permission to come unto her; I
wrote also unto <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, with so much resentment of that loss, which was more considerable to me, than it was grievous unto her. As for my father, I sent him word
that I would buy out my liberty with my blood, being resolved to perform such
brave things in the Wars, as my Judges, and mine enemies themselves should wish
to see me again; but that for the executing of so noble a design, he was to permit me first to go and mary <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> at<hi rend="italic"> Monaco</hi>; and that if my life were dear unto
him, I prayed him to sollicite <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, when her tears were dryed up, to accomplish
<hi rend="italic">Rhodolphoes</hi> promise. For <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, I conjured him again to be carefull in curiously
informing himself whether <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> mind were as firm in this incounter as she
had made me hope it would be; for I well foresaw, that <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, who, notwithstanding our reconciliation, had never loved me, would bring some obstacle to my design. After I had dispatched away my pacquet, I remained in so extraordinary
an unquietness, that I could not settle my mind on any object, but such, as being
ingenious to persecute me, offered every minute to my thoughts the image of a
new misfortune; but how intentive soever it was, I could not foresee that which
arrived unto me. As I was in this deplorable estate, I understood by a Letter from
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, that my father being infinitely afflicted for my banishment, was dead of a
Feaver, the very same day that he wrote this to me; and that to secure his estate
unto me, he had past it over to the Count of <hi rend="italic">Lauagna</hi>, who questionless would conserve it faithfully for me. I must confess, my Lord, that the loss so shaked my constancy, as it was ready to fail, and I proved in this occasion, that the apprehensions of Nature are more powerfull than all others; and to leave no place for
me to doubt of it, I had almost forgot <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> in this my first transport; but after that reason had combated with grief, and that I was able to look upon my distemper with a Calmer eye, I found it yet far greater than at first I had believed it
to be: I saw all at once, both the loss of my Father, and that too of my Mistris;
no way doubting but that it would be hard for me to carry <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> to that I desired,
there being no body now that had any interest to make her keep her word. Certain daies after this sad news I received onely a ticket from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, wherein contrary to her custom I perceived some confusion, with an absolute command not
to hazard my self as yet to come to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, because her mother had told her, that
having much wealth in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, she would give some order to her affairs, for fear
of losing it, if she should so soon receive me into her State and alliance; after this
she made me a protestation of fidelity, but in such tearms, as made me judge that
she had not expressed all her thoughts: Yet was it not this ticket, that begot my
dispair and my fury; a Letter from <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, which I had received the same way,
cleared this &#x00E6;nigma most cruelly for me; by it I learned, that the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, whose state is situate between <hi rend="italic">Piedmont, Montserrat</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Millanese</hi>, being
imbarqued at <hi rend="italic">Villa-Franca</hi> to pass unto <hi rend="italic">Naples</hi>, where he had means, and business,
had been caught by so furious a tempest three Leagues from the Port, that all the
Pilots skill could not keep him from suffering shipwrack before <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, where
this Prince had been so fortunate as to save himself by leaping into the boat, just
at the same instant when as his vessell was beaten to peeces against the point of a
Rock: It told me further, that this Prince having gotten to some houses vvhich



<pb n="37" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="37     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

were on the sea-shore, had sent to demand permission of the Princess, that he
might stay a while in that place, for to gather together as much as he could of
the remains of his vessell, which was not sunck, and whose men for the most part
had escaped with swimming, or by the assistance of a Barque, that by chance was
then near unto them.  Moreover <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> advertised me, that <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> had received him
magnificently; that not long after it was bruted in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, how that Prince vvas
become inamored of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; and how the very same day that he wrote me this,
he was told that he had put himself into mourning for to please the Princess.  All
this troubled me not so much as <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> conclusion, how that the Letter he had sent
me from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, had been delivered to him by an extraordinary way, and how
by a note which she had written unto him, she ordained him to send her no more
Letters till such time as he had a new order from her. I no sooner read this displeasing circumstance, but my mind was possest with so much fury, as I was no
longer capable of reason; I found my self seized at once, with love, jealousie, anger, grief, and revenge: I would at one instant reproach <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, complain of the infidelity of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, revenge my self of the treason of <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>, and punish the temerity
of my Rivall. Amidst the divers passions wherewith my soul was agitated, I framed an hundred designs, whereof the execution was impossible; but after I had
disputed with my self, I resolved to go in person to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and demand a reason of her, why she had not acquainted me with her new conquest; for in the end,
said I, I will have the satisfaction to adore her innocent, or to hate her guilty.
But as the body and the mind are so straitly allyed together, that the one cannot
suffer without the other, I fell sick the very same day I was to depart, and so violenty, as the Emperors Physicians, who by his order visited me every day, were out
of hope of saving me; and verily had I not had a spark of hope remaining, that
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was not inconstant, I had refused all the remedies vvhich vvere given me,
and that were powerfull enough to recover me throughly.  But as is the health of
the body had not been bestowed on me, but for the better supporting the evills of
the mind, I received my deaths wound by a Letter from <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, which gave me to understand, that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had maried the Prince of<hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, and that to put it out of all
doubt, he had learned it from <hi rend="italic">Felicianaes</hi> own mputh, who not enduring her
Mistresses infidelity, without shewing her resentment thereof, had been turned
away out of the Princesses service; he vvrote me also, that since the last Pacquet which he sent me, he never had received any news from that inconstant one; that
<hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> had made a journy to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> a little before that unlucky wedding,without her
daughter in her company, where she had publiihed that that mariage should suddainly be solemnised; that having been advertised of it, he had gone to her for to demand
of her,  whether she would dishonor her self in rendring so little respect to the
ashes of her dead husband, as to fail the promise which he had made me? That her
daughter was no longer hers, seeing I had bought her with my blood, and the life
of <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>; that it was a payment, and not a grace, which he required of her; and
that at last he was resolved to carry things to extremity rather than indure to have
this injustice done me; that to all this she had answered peremptorily, how her
daughter should never mary a man that was banished from his Country, and that
if I would have promise kept with me, I should come and solicit the performance
of it at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>; and that after she had said so, how she had left him, and would not
hear him speak a word more. I leave it to thy Highness to imagine the deplorable
estate, whereinto this adventure put me, it was so strange, that all my passions reducing themselves into one, I had nothing but fury remaining;  and despair so
fully seized upon my soul, as I thought no longer of revenging my self of <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>,
nor resenting the outrage which I had received from the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, nor
of punishing the infidelity of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, but my design was wholly then to make away self, and to exercise upon mine person all the cruelty which the crimes of others had deserved. This deadly thought was so deeply setled in my heart, as if my
Religion had not with-held me, I had killed my self; but at length I resolved to
go and die like a man of courage, and in a place where I should never hear <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>

<pb n="38" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="38     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

named, and where <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> should not find me: I concluded then to pass into <hi rend="italic">Swethland</hi>, whose King was at that time in War vvith the <hi rend="italic">Done</hi>, vvith a purpose to expose
my self to so many perils, as I might dye nobly in some one of them; resolving yet
further, that is fortune should work a prodigie in preserving me, to go and confine
my self into the horrid deserts of <hi rend="italic">Finland</hi>. I stole away then secretly, and without
taking leave of the Emperor I imbarqued my self upon the Baltique Sea, where
I had not been three daies, but they of the Vessell, wherein I was, discovered the
Fleet of that valiant King of <hi rend="italic">Algier, Chairadin Barbarossa</hi>, whom a dreadfull tempest had driven into that Sea. This incounter gave me as much joy, as it caused
fear in them with vvhom I vvas; for I verily believed that I should soon set a period to my paines, by finding on the Sea that, which I went seeking for on the land:
And whereas I perfectly spake the German tongue, I represented unto them, that
since there was nothing left to our choice, but death, or slaverie, being not able
to fly, for that the wind vvas contrary to us, it vvas better generously to resolve for
the first, than to submit our selves to the other; that the loss of liberty being more
grievous and shamesfull, than that of life, they were at the least to sell it dearly: In the
end, my Lord, I animated them in such sort, as against all apparence they resolved,
not onely to fight, but to goe and boord the first vessell that should advance. This
resolution was no sooner taken, but <hi rend="italic">Chairadin</hi> loosed two of his Fleet to come
up unto us; when they were within cannon shot we discharged one against another
vvithout much effect, but suddainly they separated themselves to inclose us, which
observed by us we vvould have retired, but the swiftest of the tvvo having fetched
us up, I presently boorded her; it was there, my Lord, that I sought against my
own good fortune, and that I laboured to lose a life, vvhich thou hast rendred
precious unto me, in preserving it since by a goodness that never had example,
and which thy power hath made happy in despight of the malice of my destinie:
I did then, my Lord, all that I could in this occasion to deprive me of the honor
of being thy Highnes creature; but fortune, being resolved to save me, was adverse
to us, for to be favourable to me; for <hi rend="italic">Chairadin</hi>, <sic>whon</sic> was unwilling to have this
victory cost him dear, and that saw well how we fought like desperate men,
advanced with all his Fleet: As soon as those of our Vessell perceived it, their
weapons fell out of their hand, and I was he alone that did not render my self,
though it be true, that I left not for all that to have the same fate, for having been
wounded in four places, the loss of blood weakned me in such sort, as I fell down
like one dead on the hatches; my swooning lasted so long, that I came not to my
self again till I had been carried to another Vessell, where all the hurt men were
laid; there I was drest amongst the rest, and intreated after the same manner, untill
we came to <hi rend="italic">Algier</hi>, where soon after I was sold to the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>, together with
three hundred others, which were destined to thy Highness; and so within a few
dayes we were imbarqued for <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, where I had the honor to be made thy
slave, and to wear chaines, which have been more glorious to me, than the possession of an Empire, and which I would alwaies prefer before liberty. After this, my
Lord, I have nothing else to say unto thy Highness concerning that which regards the rest of my fortune, seeing it is the work of thy hands, and that I could
not bring it again to thy remembrance without offending thy modesty, knowing
well enough by experience, that the image of thine own vertues makes thee cast
down thy lookes, and change colour: I will not tell thee then by what meanes
thou hast drawn me out of irons for to raise me up to the greatest commands of
thy Empire, but I will onely say, that in the midst of this pomp, and of this glory,
I am in one day become the most wretched of men; and not to keep thy Majesty
any longer in suspence, may it please thee to know, that the generous slave, to
whom thy Highness hath given his life, is the same <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, whom thou hast heard
so often mentioned in my adventures, that dear confident of my loves, and the most
faithfull of my friends; <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, having interrupted him, demanded, whether he
had not set him at liberty; but <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> answered, that he alone could give it him,
and that because he would doe nothing of his own private authority, after he had

<pb n="39" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="39     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

talked with him a little, he had returned him to the Bassa ofthe Sea, intreating
him to use him kindly till such time as he heard further from him, not knowing
whether his Highness did intend to grant him his full liberty. The Sultan then
commanded him to break his chains forthwith, and to prosecute his discourse.
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> would have fallen on his knees to have thanked <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> for that grace,
but he not suffering him injoyned him once again to satifie his desire;
and therefore exactly to obey him, the Bassa continued in this sort. The
triumph being finished, I was no sooner in my Palace, but I shut up my self in my
Cabinet with that dear Slave; I will not tell thee, my Lord, the taking that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>
and I were in, since it is a thing that may be more easily imagined than spoken:
<hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> amazement was so great to see me alive, to find me in the habit which I
wear, and to observe me in the rank which I hold, as his reason above an hundred
times gave his eyes the lie: As for me, I was no less surprised to see him at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, and to imbrace him in the habit of a Slave, than he was to behold me
with a Turbant. Our first motions of joy being over, I confess, my Lord, that my
first thought was for <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; well now, said I unto him, my dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, hath the
Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> triumphed over all my hopes, and hath he rendred himself
possessor of an happiness which he did not deserve, and which I thought I had
been Master of? I had not so soon made an end of speaking, when as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> fell to
demand pardon of me, to accuse himself of too much precipitation, to commend
the constancy of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and to blame my despair; but because this discourse was
obscure, I requested him to clear it unto me: Whereupon he told ma, that <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>
was no longer amongst the number of the living that the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> was
dead, and that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was never his wife; but to particularize this unexpected
event, thou mayest be pleased to understand, that as soon as <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> perceived the
Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masserans</hi> love to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, she resolved, seeing the authority wholly in
her self by the death of her husband, to make that secret hatred she had alwayes
born me to flash out; whereunto also may be added, that this woman being ambitious, it may be the Title of a Soveraign blinded her, and carried her to that cruell design of destroying all our pleasures; to attain the more easily thereunto, she
thought it would be fit utterly to break off our commerce, which was not very
hard for her to do, for <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> is seated on the height of a great Mountain, almost
inaccessible on the three sides; the other which looks to the Sea is so steep, as one
cannot behold it without horror; there rests then but one winding way which
leadeth to the Port, so that whereas this Town hath but one onely avenue, and
hath alwayes a Garrison in it, it was easie for her to keep the Princess from receiving any intelligence from me, or giving me any; without doubt it was the fear
of this rigorous proceeding that obliged the Princess to write unto <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to
send her no more Letters. In the meantime <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> said openly to all the world, that the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> was going to marry <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; and whereas the Princess suffred her self to be seen of no body, so no body was aware of the deceit; for I have been informed by <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, that as soon as she observed the passion which she had begot in the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, and that she perceived how her mother would force her to this unjust marriage, she feigned her self sick, to the end she might with the more civility decline the visits of this new Lover, who divers times was upon the point of renouncing his pretensions through the rigors of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; but <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> assured him so effectually, that she would vanquish her obstinacy, provided he would be ruled by her, as he resolved to yeeld her a blind obedience. He went then to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> by her counsell in that manner, which the Grandees of <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi> do often make use of, whenas they travell, and which they call <hi rend="italic">Incognito</hi>. This custom permits them to live as they will, and dispenseth others from rendring them the honors which are due to their quality; it was then in this sort that the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> was at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, to the end, that being freed from receiving, or rendring the ceremony of visits, he might only make some believe, that he was the husband of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, not in precisely saying that he had maried her, but in giving way for them to think so, that spake to him of his abode at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>: For that design of



<pb n="40" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="40     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

<hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> was to perswade every one that this mariage was accomplished, to the end
that is I were advertised thereof, I might be capable of some extreme resolution,
either upon mine own person, or on that of the Princes, or on hers, which I could
not execute without going into a place where I should lose my head if I were
found there. This design was so well carried, that all they of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> beleeved
it themselves, and made others to beleeve it. This universall error, it may be, had
not for all that been fastned on <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, if <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> had not taken a particular care to
make him beleeve what all the world beleeved; and indeed to speak the truth, no
body could have exempted himself from this imposture: For this woman, having
suborned <hi rend="italic">Feliciana</hi> with gifts and great hopes, made a shew of chasing her away
with violence, and to make the matter be published the better, she sent her back
to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where she was no sooner come but she repaired to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> all in tears. I
think thy Highness remembers, that this mayd had alwayes been <sic><hi rend="italic">Jsabellaes</hi></sic> <sic>confifident</sic>, thou wilt not find it strange then if <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> did not doubt of her discourse,
when the assured him with a feigned sorrow, that the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> having maried the Princess with her own consent, and not being able to forbear
telling her of the promises vvhich shee had made to mee, she had been ill-intreated both by the Mother and the Daughter, vvho had driven her away outragiously. It vvas by this artifice, my Lord, that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was deceived; and whereas this newes troubled him, and possest him with fury, he
wrote it unto me as soon as he heard it, as I have already declared unto thy
Highness. But this man, whose high and generous spirit makes the interests of
his friends more sensible to him than his own, understanding that the Prince of
<hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> was at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, resolved to punish him, and revenge me; and for this effect he carefully informed himself of the place where most commonly he was, but
fortune, that intermeddles with all things, favoured his enterprise, by leting him
know, that the day following he was to go and see the stately Palace of <hi rend="italic">Andrea
Doria</hi> his near Kinsman, and whereas it was out of the City, he judged this opportunity too advantagious to be neglected, imagining rightly that he would go
thither with little company, since, as I have before delivered, he was at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>
unknown. The matter failed not to fall out even as he had conceived it; for he
was advertised that the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> was in this walk attended but with
two of his servants; he went forth then speedily with the like number, and overtaking him in a place where few persons could be witnesses of his action. As
soon as he was so near him, as he might speak to him, he asked him whether he
knew my name, and whether it were possible he should be ignorant that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
could not lawfully be his, because she was mine? but since the thing was done, he
must at least render himself worthy of so noble a conquest by the loss of his life,
as I had bought it with my blood; in saying so they both drew out their swords,
and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> without attending the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masserans</hi> answer, attacqued him so vigoriously, as he was constrained to give ground: They that accompanied him
would have opposed themselves to this fury, but they that followed <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> would
not suffer them so to do; and whereas they were equall in number, they began a
just combat, whereof the modesty of my friend kept him from telling me the particulars; but in the end, notwithttanding whatsoever the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> could
perform, the victory sided with reason, and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, after the receiving of a slight
hurt pressed his enemy with so much courage, as he ran him into the body in
four severall places, which made him fall down as if he were dead: A minute
after, Nature doing her last devoir, he opened his eyes, and seeing <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> coming
from parting their followers, and giving order to his help to carry him to
some place, he had yet so much strength, as to call him, and before he expired to
crave pardon for the outrage he had done me, and to pray me to consider the power of <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> eyes for the excusing of his fault; moreover he conjured him to
tell me that the Princess had kept her faith inviolable to me; then he acquainted him
in few words with all the violences of her mother, with all the resistances which
shc had made thereunto, and at the last swore that he was not her husband, but that



<pb n="41" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="41     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

<hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> had used this artifice, in hope to make me away, as I have already told thy
Highness, not doubting but that if I were dead she should have carried her
daughter to all that she had desired. Scarcely had that infortunate Prince made an
end of speaking, but he dyed in <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> armes, who with sorrow remitted him into
the hands of his servants, to goe and provide for his own safety; so that without losing time, and before this combat was divulged, he sent to hire a Feluca, and
without returning into the City he imbarqued himself for <hi rend="italic">Naples</hi>; for
in the uncertainty of the event of the combat he had brought mony enough
about him to mak his retreat into that place, and had left a letter in
his Cabinet; which instructed one of his friends with the order hee would
have taken in his affaires. He departed then safely away in this sort, but the
next day he incountred the Pirate <hi rend="italic">Arsalon</hi>, and in the manner, which thy
Highness understood yesterday, he came to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. But my Lord, to make
all the rigor of my destiny known to thy Majesty, I am to tell thee further, that not
long since <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> hath met with a slave of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, who hath related unto him, that
as <sic>sooon</sic> as <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi> knew of the death of the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, anger and grief seized
so upon her, as she died therewith in a little time; so that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, seeing she
was Mistress of her self, had sent a man into <hi rend="italic">Germany</hi> to desire me to come and take
care of her State, and to receive her person for a reward of my fidelity: For she
knew nothing, either of my jealousie, or despair, which having carried me far enough from the place, whither she had sent to seek me, beguiled all her hopes, and
destroyed her felicity, by the fruiteless return of him she had imployed unto me;
since that she lived in a very austere and melancholick solitariness, saying openly,
that she was resolved to renounce the world, as soon as she knew, that I was no
longer in it. And whereas there ran a bruit in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> about a year ago, that I had
been seen in <hi rend="italic">Naples</hi>, she dispatched away this man for to goe and see if it were so;
having made a vow, if his voyage proved vain, to shut herself in a Cloister for
all the rest of her life; but whereas fortune hath never done any but <sic>extraodinary</sic>
things in my adventures, she so wrought, that this man, putting himself into a
French Barque to pass over thither, was taken by a Pirate, whose vessells lay under
the covert of a Rock, which is near to a place by the Italians called <hi rend="italic">Porto Hercoles</hi>.
And whereas he had a grat number of Slaves, he stayed not long from going to sell
them at one of the Islands of the <hi rend="italic">Archipelago</hi>, from whence by divers accidents
this man came to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> by chance knew him, as having at
other times seen him in <hi rend="italic">Rhodolphoes</hi> service. After all this, my Lord, it will not be
difficult for thy Highness to imagine the deplorable estate wherein I find my self by
thy bounty, and by the proposition which thou hast made me concerning the Sultana <hi rend="italic">Asteria</hi>. I should not be so hardy as to speak to thee in these termes, if I did not
call to mind, that the charmes of the divine<hi rend="italic"> Roxelana</hi> have been of sufficient force
to vanquish the most victorious Monarch of the world; and that for this reason I
may hope to see thee sensible of my misfortune, to obtain pardon for my ingratitude, and to be heard in my justifications. It is true indeed, that to excuse my fault
I need no more than to beseech thy Highness to consider, that if I could even banish
from my heart the image of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, forget her affection, her oathes, and her constancie; become the most ingratefull of men to his Princess; cause her death by my
change, which she would quickly know; prefer my Master before my mistress, and my duty before my love; the Religion I profess, prohibiting me the plurality of wives, which that of the Mahometans doth permit, I could not dispose of a faith, which I have already given, seeing I am a Christian under the habit of a <hi rend="italic">Mussulman</hi>, although I be not believed to be so in all the extent of thy Empire: But whereas for all that it is not just that my temerity should be vanquished, deprive a man of thy favor, who refuseth an alliance, which a great King ought to receive on his knees: Banish from thy sight and Court a man, whom so many benefits, whom so many greatnesses, and to say all, whom thy affection cannot make perfectly happy; and to satisfie the Sultana <hi rend="italic">Austeria</hi>, I am ready to reenter into the irons from whence she drew me, and to die her Slave, since I cannot live her husband: Or if thy Highness




<pb n="42" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="42     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

will render my end more profitable and glorious, command me to seek out death
in the midst of thine enemies, aud I shall not be long without testifying by the loss
of my life, that I am not ingratefull, but because I cannot be acknowledging.
And to incense thy just wrath, I will say further, that the chastisement, which
I demand, will be instead of grace to me, since that in depriving me of light, I shall
no longer be sensible of all the misfortunes wherewith I am so heavily oppressed;
I shall cease to live, but I shall cease also from being rebellious to thy pleasure; I
shall restore the life which I ow to the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Asteria</hi>; and I shall dye for
the glory of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. In brief, my Lord, since I cannot be <hi rend="italic">Asteriaes</hi>, because my
love doth oppose it, and my Religion doth forbid it; and since I cannot likewiie
live for <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, because my duty doth tie me to thy service, both by a generall
right, and by a particular obligation, death is the onely remedy that remains for
me to get out of so many miseries. If thy goodness had not broken off my setters
and that I were still thy slave, now when that I know that the constancy of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
hath triumphed over the artifice of our enemies, that I reign still in her heart, and
that on me alone her felicity or her happiness doth depend, I would employ all
my endeavour to free me of my chains by a ransom: But, my Lord, I am tyed to
thee by stronger bonds; the obligations wherein I am ingaged to thy Highness, the
benefits which I have received from thee, the honours thou hast done me, and the
last degree of glory whereunto I am mounted, are too certain proofs of thy love,
and of thy considence, for me not to be retained in my duty: It is then by these
sacred bands that I am tyed unto thee, and which I cannot break witliout sacrilege. Finally, my Lord, the thoughts of liberty, which pass for a just desire in the
minds of all men, were an horrid crime in me; and I may well promise thy Highness, that I will never so much as dream of it: And as I am generous enough not
to doe any thing that may blemish my love, so am I yet more not to doe
anything that may wrong my duty. There is no need then of guards to keep
me from going out of thy Empire, being fully resolved to sacrifise all my
pleasures, rather than doe any thing unworthy of the name which I carry,
and the choice which thy Highness hath made of my person, for to be the first in
thy favour, as I am in thy Estates. But without further deferring pronounce the
sentence of death, so just, and so much wished for. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> having given over
speaking, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> rose up, fell to walking a great pace, and with his eyes fixed
on the ground continued in so deep a muse, as the Bassa doubted that he should
obtain the effect of his request; but he was not long in this uncertainty; for the
Sultan standing still, and beholding him in a manner that testified more grief
than anger, and more compassion than wrath, said unto him with all imaginable
kindness that he held himself infinitely unhappy, in that possessing so great an Empire, that being so victorious and triumphant, and that being able to give felicity to so many people, yet could not render the onely man whom he could love, happy. Upon this so obliging a disconrse, <sic><hi rend="italic">Jbrahim</hi></sic> would have fallen on his knees,
but he would not suffer him, saying unto him, that he would fein have obtained
so much resolution of himself, as to part for ever from a man, who was so dear unto
him; that he had debated the same in his mind, when as he walked in that manner,
as he saw; but that at last the affection which he bore him had surmounted his generosity, and that it was impossiblc for him to resolve on so grievous a separation;
that he conjured him to excuse the effects of his friendship, as he excused those of
his love; and to testifie unto him, that as well as himself he did all that he could, he
would permit him to goe and see <sic><hi rend="italic">Jsabella</hi></sic>, provided he would pass his word unto
him to return again within six monthes; with this promise also, that is during his
absence he could accustom himself to this privation, he would give him his liberty
wholly and intirely. The Bassa was so surprised, and so transported with joy, as
having cast himself at the feet of the Sultan, he was a good while without speaking, but at length, after he had recovered the use of his tongue, he rendred him
thanks for so notable a favor,and told him, that none but <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> could vanquish <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; that this victory which he had gotten over himself, was so glorious to him,



<pb n="43" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="43     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 2." ed="1652"/>

as all that he had done till then, was nothing in comparison of it; that battailes were
gained by the valour of Captains and Souldiers, but in this occasion he owed this victory to none but his own proper vertue. As for the rest, if he would permit him
to go to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, he would ingage his faith to render himself at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> within the time that he had prescribed; and that he was not to fear that he would break
his word with his Highness, since he would keep it with his very enemies. After this
assurance, the Sultan told him, that he did not doubt of it, but that which obliged
him to require an oath of him fot it, was the knowledge that he had of the force of
the passion which reigned in his heart; and that his friendship would be secured against this enemy of its content. <sic><hi rend="italic">Jbrahim</hi></sic> swore then solemnly, that nothing but
death alone should keep him from accomplishing his promise. That done, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
told him, that he would not have consented to his voyage, knowing that his affairs
were not composed at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, had he not had the means to have the sentence
revoked, which had been given against him. And when as <sic><hi rend="italic">Jbrahim</hi></sic> besought
him to to let him understand, how he thought to perform so unexpected a
a thing, the Sultan told him, that to comprehend his design, he was but to
remember, how one of his <hi rend="italic">Chaoux</hi>, returning out of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>,  and staying at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, had been murthered in the streetes by a popular commotion; so that
having been advertised thereof by one of them that accompanied him, who
instantly imbarqued himself away, he had caused all the Vessells of the <hi rend="italic">Genoueses</hi>, that
were found in his Ports, to be arrested; and that for the better favouring of his design, an Ambassador was the day before arrived from his Republique,  whom he
had caused to be put in prison at <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>, being perswaded that he had done nothing
unworthy himself therein, since the <hi rend="italic">Genoueses</hi> had first violated the Law of Nations in the person of his <hi rend="italic">Chaoux</hi>; how it was for to comnmnicate this affair unto him
that he had sent for him in the morning, but the sadness which he had observed in
his countenance, had hindred him from it, and carried him into another discourse.
The Bassa then cast himself at the feet of the Sultan, to assure him, that he would
never establish his content on the ruines of his Country. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> told him, that his
generosity would not contradict his intention, and that so favourable an occasion
might not be lost, he would send back this Ambassador with all the Vessells
which he had caused to be stayed, for to redeem his liberty, and that of <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who
had suffred so much for him.  That he would write a letter to his Republique,
which should be conceived in such express tearmes, as they would without doubt
be inforced by fear to accord him more difficult thinges, than those which he desired of them; besides that, giving them back the life of their Ambassador, and returning them so great a number of the richest, and most pretious commodities of the Levant, they would be yet far more indebted unto him; But in the end he was glad,
that the blood of one of his servants might at least serve to restore <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to his
Country. The matter being thus resolved, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> commanded the Bassa to go and
deliver <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and the Slave of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and not speak of this design, for he would have no inckling of the matter; but for the better concealing of it, he ordered him to say, that he was going upon a secret expedition, to the end they should not mervail if they saw him no longer at the Port. After this <sic><hi rend="italic">Jbrahim</hi></sic> withdrew himself for to give order to his affaires; and although the pasing of his word for his return begot some melancholick thoughts in him, yet joy held the Empire of his soul, and the onely imagination of seeing <sic><hi rend="italic">Jsabella</hi></sic> against dissipated all his heaviness. At last his passion was so strong, that if he had been even sure to die, as soon he came at her, yet would he not fo all that have left to goe. He returned then to the Palace, followed by those multitude of Courtiers, whom the favor of Kings renders inseparable with them which possess it.</p>

<p>THe grand Visier was no sooner at home, but he sent the command ofthe Grand Signior to the Bassa of the Sea, to return
him the Slave, with whom he had talked the day before; but
as he was generous and liberall, he caused twelve Watches,
the fairest that ever had been found in all the shops of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> to be carried unto him; for besides the difference
of the inventions of them, their cases were so marvellous, as
the Emeraulds, Rubies, and Diamonds, made up the least
part of their beauty, the art far surpassing the matter: And
whereas this curiosity is the greatest with persons of quality amongst the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi>,
having met with an hundred of them in a certain shop, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> could not choose
any thing that was more gallant, more beautifull, or more agreeable to him, who
was to receive them; but to render this present yet more magnificent, he put these
twelve Watches into a little coffer of Nacre, garnished with Gold and Turqueises,
and sent them unto him by six Slaves: As for that of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, because he was not a
man of any great quality, he sent him a thousand Sultanins for his ransom. After
which he shut himself up in a lodging apart, that was a good way from his own,
which was too much frequented with people, there to receive <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> at more liberty:
The Palace of the Bassa of the Sea was not far from <hi rend="italic">Ibrahims</hi>, so that it was not
long before they brought him his dearest <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, to whom that Bassa in requitall of
that gallantry which had been used towards him, had in exchange of his fetters
given him a chain of Diamonds. It was in this interview, that these two friends
felt all those joyes and pleasing raptures, which true friendship causeth in the soules
of two persons, who for so many years had been in despair of ever seeing one another; their hearts were at one instant so replenished with pleasure and admiration, as not able to express together their amazement and their joy, they remained
a good while embracing one another, without the ability to speak; but at length,
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahims</hi> passion being the stronger, it obliged him to open their first discourse by
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, in calling <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> his Preserver, in giving him thinks for exposing his life
to deliver her, and revenge him; and craving pardon of him for the pains he had
suffered in his captivity, as counting himself the innocent cause thereof. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>
answered to all those things with as much kindness as could be; but whereas love
is more powerfull than friendship, and as this passion reigns imperiously over all
the rest, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> returned still to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, he would have <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> particularize again
that which he had already told him the day before; he demanded of him whether


<pb n="45" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="45     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

it were true indeed that the Princess loved him still? He would know of him, whether the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> was an handsome man? And as if his friend could have
divined what was done over all the earth, he conjured him to tell him, whether
he did not believe that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would be turned Nun when they should arrive at 
<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>? In the end, after he had asked an hundred questions, whereunto <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had no leisure to answer, he perceived his error, and desired him to pardon him for it
with so much earnestness, as he could not choose but smile at it. But amidst all
these mutuall caresses,there were some moments wherein <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was surprized with
marvell, and whenas reason began to repossess its place in the mind of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, he
was aware of it; and seeing his eyes fattened on his habit, he easily apprehended,
that he did not express all his thought; wherefore not to leave him any longer in
this uncertainty, he said unto him, that for the renewing of their friendship in as
strait a manner as formerly it had been, it was fit to tell him in few words, that
he was still <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> under the name of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and that although he were the
servant of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, yet was he for all that the enemy of <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi>; that he desired
him therefore not to suspect him lightly, since he could not do so without wronging him; that is he had not been too much pressed by the affairs which he vvas to communicate unto him, and which required speed, he would have recounted to
him, even at that very instant, the wonderfull progress of his fortune, but he would
do that at leisure whilst they vvere in their voyage together; that in the mean
time he should firmly believe hovv nothing was able to shake his faith, and that he
would live and die in the Religion of his Fathers.  Upon this discourse <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>
confessed unto him ingenuously, that he had been strangely surprized vvith finding
him Grand Visier, and the Sultans Lieutenant-Generall throughout all the extent
of his Empire, since to be that and a Christian seemed to be tvvo things incompatible; but in regard of that vvhich he had told him, he vvould aftervvards forbid
his reason to judge any more upon apparances: Hovv it vvas notvvithstanding true,
that he had believed that he vvas not absolutely culpable, but hovv it vvas certain
also, that being unable to concive this adventure, he had been troubled to think
in what terms he should dare to inform and clear himself therein. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> answered, that he would easily forgive him this injury, seeing he himself could not
in a manner conceive by what means, or by what wayes fortune had conducted
him to the point wherein he then was: That in the mean space not to lose time,
which was to be so precious unto him, it was fit he should tell him, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
had been so good as to permit him to go and see <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; and that he might do it
with glory and safety, the Sultan had found out an undoubted expedient to cause
the Sentences which had been pronounced against them, to be revoked. But
whereas <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> could not easily believe that which he heard, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> recounted every thing unto him from point to point, just as it had been resolved in the Sultans
Cabinet; but he did not discover unto him, that he had ingaged his word for his
return within six moneths, for fear he should be afflicted at it; for as for his fidelity he no way misdoubted it.  <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> finding that he purposed to return out of
hand to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, told him, that he had lost a very affectionate friend in the person
of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>, who was dead of sickness, as the Slave of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> had informed him,
but that he had left a sonne behind him, the heir of all his vertues and one that
promised great matters. Is he not called <hi rend="italic">Giovanni Lodovico</hi>, replied <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, after
he had bemoaned the death of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>? Yes, said <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and he was not above a dozen years old when you went away, and yet then there was great hope of him. Hereupon one brought <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> word, that the Slave of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> was come, which made <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> represent unto him, that being to return to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, he held it not fit that this Slave should see him in the habit he wore, because he could not possibly forbear publishing of it, which might prejudice him much, or at leastwise oblige him to make a publick manifestation of his adventures. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> agreed with him therein, so that he charged him, who brought him that message, to carry this Slave to the quarter where the Officers of his house were lodged, which was a great way off from his own, with order to use him well, and not to let him go

out of his chamber without his express command. That done, he turned himself to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and desired him to work in such sort, as he might have the Letter
which the Princess had wrote to him by this man, to the end he might be assured
of her fidelity. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> told him that the matter was not very difficult, and
that to oblige him to deliver it, he need but let him know, hovv he was
still alive;  and  because also hee vvas to see him during their Voyage, it
was requisite to tell him, that hee had been a slave as well as they, and
freed in the same manner, that he might not be surprised when he should see him abord the vessell. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> approved of this counsell of his friend, and prayed him
to go instantly and labour to bring him that preticus treasure, which was able to
make him happy. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> condiscending thereunto, the Bassa caused him to be conducted by four slaves to the place where that of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> was, who a good while
would not part with <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> Letter, till he saw <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, because he could not
beleeve, that a man whom he had gone to seek for at <hi rend="italic">Naples</hi>, should be at <sic><hi rend="italic">Constannople</hi></sic>; but <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> swore so seriously unto him, that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was alive, and that
he should see him within a few daies, as at length, knowing him to be a man of
great quality, and <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> friend, he suffered himself to be perswaded, and delivered him <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> Letter, which he had with much ado preserved all the time
of his captivity; presently whereupon <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> returned to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, who attended
him with extreme impatience; as soon as he perceived him, and that they which
conducted him were retired, he lovingly imbraced him, and conjured him no
longer to defer his happiness, but <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> without answering him rendred him that
precious gage of <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> sidelity, which possesscd our Illustrious Bassa with such
joy, that he could hardly obtain so much tranquillity from his mind, as to read this
Letter: But at last, after he had kissed it with transports that cannot be imagined but
by those who know the force of this noble passion, which reigned in his heart, he
opened it, and saw that it was thus.

<p>Hardly could <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> retain his teares in reading <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> letter, which had
made him change colour more than once, according as it was either more or less
obliging; and as jealousie and fear are undoubted markes of strong affection,
that which the Princess testified unto him gave him at one instant both grief and
joy; he was grieved that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> should suspect him of infidelity, he was not sorry
that she was affraid to lose him; and as is he had not read it weil, he began to run
it over again, and after he had made an end of reading it, he looked on all sides of
the paper, to see if nothing else were there written:  He read the superscription of
it, he considered it even to the very seal; and in the end bethought he should have
committed a crime if he had lost so much as one sillable of that pretious pledge
of <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> love. This letter so mightily increased his flame, that his unquietness
grew to be half so much more than it was. The discourse of the Princess seemed
so pressing unto him, as he began to fear in good earnest, lest she should take some
extreme resolution before he could get to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; he concluded therefore to forward the matter as much as he could, and for a beginning he left <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, after he
had caused bookes to be given him to entertain the time withall, and commanded
some of his servants to wait near unto him for to serve him; the rest of the day
he bestowed in giving order for all things necessary for his voyage; he commanded
a Christian Slave, in whom he much confided, to cause an habit after the Italian
fashion to be secretly made, and gave him more money than need, both to pay for
it, and to procure the fidelity of the Jewes, who should sell it unto him; for it is
from those kinde of men, that the great diversity of Nations which people <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>, are furnished with all things necessary for them, be it household-stuffe, apparell, or jewells. That done, he caused the principall Officers of his
house to be called unto him, and having told them, that theGrand Signior sent
him upon a secret expedition, from whence he should not return in six monthes,
he commanded them that during his absence they should obey, as himself, a man,
who was as it were the Steward of his house; and that they should cause all the rest
that depended on them, to obey him in like manner; he assigned meanes also for
the maintenance of his Train, as it used to be; and after he had promised them recompences if they continued in their duty, and chastisements if they did otherwise
he went to his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and being somwhat late, they separated themselves; <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, not willing that his people should observe so strict a union betwixt them
got away to bed, after he had made a light supper, though he had eaten nothing
all the day before; As for <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, he was served in private, but with a great deal of
magnificence. The next morning, according to the order he had received for it,
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> went to the Seraglio; and whereas he had a particular permission to come
thither at all times, whensoever he would, he went into the Sultans chamber, who
was not ready. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, seeing him come in, said unto him, how he was glad to observe
in his countenance that the remedy, which he had found out for his grief, was
not in vain; but to make an end of healing him speedily he had commanded over night that the Ambassador of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> whom he had caused to be made a prisoner at <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>, should be brought unto him; the Sultan told him further, how he had given order, that the Ambassador should come without ceremony, because if the ordinary custom had been observed, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> then, as the chief Bassa, must have presented him, which he not thinking fit, for that so he would have known him, he chose rather to hold this course; besides also that sending to have him received at the gate of the City, and causing him to be presented with an horse, and roab of cloath of gold, according to the use, he ingaged himself consequently to give him publique audience, which he would not doe, to the end he might speak more openly to him concerning the matters he desired of him. The Sultan was no sooner ready, but he was advertised by a Capigibassa, who is one of the Captaines of the Port, that this Ambassador was arrived, whereupon he commanded, that a Bassa should go to receive, and bring him unto him; and that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> might hear what he said unto him he made him enter into his Cabinet. A little after this Ambassador appeared with a Turkish roab on, which had been given him without any ce-

<milestone n="48     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

remony at his departure from <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>; for it is the custom ofthe Sultan to receive no
Ambassadors but such as have one of them on, according to the manner of the Country. He was sustained under the arms by two Capigibassi; the Bassa that conducted
him, marched two paces before him to present him to the Sultan, who received him
with some civility: when as he had saluted the Grand Signior, he delivered the Letter
that the Republique had written to him,which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> gave unto a Dragoman, who
interpreted it unto him for forms sake only, for he understood it better than he. No
sooner had he done hearing him,but he caused the same Interpreter to tell the Ambassador, that the injury which he had received in the person of his <hi rend="italic">Chaoux</hi>, was so
great, that is he had followed his just fury, his head had answered for that violence; how it was for that he had caused him to be arrested, but that he had since
changed his mind at the intercession of a Christian slave, who had been a sutor to
him for it, and that had found grace before his Highness; but that for returning him
back, as he was going to do, together with all the vessels which he had caused to be
stayed in his Ports, and for forgetting also the outrage that he had received from
his Republique, they were to accord him one thing, which he desired of them.
And when as the Ambassador had answered him, that the thing should be impossible if they did it not, he told him, how all that he would have was, that the Senate should revoke the Sentence which they had pronounced against <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, and
that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> should be no more troubled for the death of the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>; that
it was <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> to whom <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> owed her safety, and to whom he was to render
thanks for his life; that he remitted both him and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to his conduct, for the
putting of that in execution which he desired; but that he should take good heed
they fayled not therein, because if that should happen, nothing should be able to
keep him from making War upon <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> it self with all the forces of his Empire:
This Ambassador was so surprised with hearing the Sultan speak of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, as it had divers times like to have made him forget the respect which he owed him, for to interrupt him, but at length after <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had given over speaking,
he answered him, that the thing he desired was so beneficiall to the Republique,
as his Highness need not fear to be refused; that the merit of those two excellent
men was so generally known, as the Senate had not obeyed the Laws but with grief,
and that doubtless they would be extremely joyfull of so just and specious a pretext to infringe them. After this <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> dismissed him, and told him yet once
again, how he should remember, that in this occasion they were to satisfie him, or
to have him their enemy; howbeit he somewhat caressed him in bidding him fare¬
well, and excused the not receiving him with all requisite Ceremonies for some
reasons which he might not tell him; that in the mean time he should prepare
himself for his departure, and that he should have his dispatch. When he was retired according to the custom, that is, without turning his back to the Sultan, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> came forth of the Cabinet, and cast himself at his feet, to give him thanks
for so many testimonies of the affection which he received every minute from his
Highness. But <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> took him up, and told him, that eight years service well deserved that acknowledgment; that withall likewise in labouring for his good,
he should establish his own felicity, which would never be persested till he saw
him contented; that the impatience he was in for his departure, was occasioned
by the desire he had of his return, and that it might no longer be deferred, he
was to go and make an end of taking order for his affairs, and that immediately
after noon he should come and bid him adieu, and bring <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> with him. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> answered to all these things with as much generosity, as kindness; and for a
conclusion, he deeply protested never to think himself acquitted of the infinite
obligations wherein he was ingaged to his Highness, but in sacrifising his life for
his service. He would have proceeded further, but the Sultan interrupted him,
and once more commanded him to have no other thought than of going to see the
incomparable <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and of giving life again to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. After this the Grand
Visier durst not make any reply, but retired homewards to go unto his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> whom he had not seen since the evening before, and he encountred him in the

<milestone n="49     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

Hipodrome, so intentive in observing the stately structure of his Palace, as the
Bassa was fain to speak to him before he would heed him, or be drawn out of so
sweet a contemplation: But when as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> seemed to be unwilling to stir from
thence, till he had at leasure considered that Master-peece of Architecture, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>
told him he was contented he should, so as he stayd not long about it, for
that having goodlier things to shew him, and not having much time to spare,
they were to mannage so much as they had, till dinner was made ready, in letting
him see all the beauties of the Palace which he had caused to be built: That whereas he was skilfull in Painting, in Perspective, in Architecture, in rarities, and in
all parts of the Mathematicks, he should be glad to know, whether according to
his judgement all the rules of those fair Arts, and of those excellent Sciences, were
found to be observed there, as according to his they were. But first, sayd <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to
him, I would fain know, how in so little a time you could make up a building,
which for its greatness, and for the magnificence of its strusture, would require
the whole life of a man, and the treasures of a great Prince. This last, replyed
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, is the only necessary thing, for with it is done in a small time, what whole
Ages, and all the industry of man could not do without it; and both to answer
you, and to take from you the means of troubling me with new objections, I am to
let you know, that having a purpose to build this Palace, I easily found out a way to
do it, as well speedily, as magnificently: For disposing of all the Revenue of the
Empire, I could want nothing save Artisans to execute my design, but fortune sent
me them; for good luck would, that a great Architect, two Painters, and two
Sculptors, having put themselves in company together for to pass out of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> into Spain, from whence they had been sent for to make a stately Palace for the Emperor, were taken by Pirates, who afterwards sold them here at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>; and
whereas I have alwaies been very carefull to inform my self of places where any
Christian slaves were, that I might relieve them, I met with these same, knew
what they were, and employed them for two whole years together; after which I
sent them back in a vessell laden with riches. You have peradventure heard say,
that the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi> do not suffer the image of any living thing to be made, and that the
<hi rend="italic">Alcoran</hi> seems to forbid it; but as in all Religions heresies do from time to time
arise, this same, which is composed of nothing but absurdities, hath not been wanting therein; for some remedy whereof they one day cast into the River of <hi rend="italic">Adezelia</hi>, that runs by <hi rend="italic">Damascus</hi>, two hundred Camels lading of Books of the different
opinions of their Religion, retaining but six of them, which since have produced
many others, whereof one maintains upon this Article, that the rest have misunderstood that passage, where their Prophet had no other meaning, but to forbid
them the worshiping the images of men, of beasts, and of plants, and not the making of them for the ornament of houses: And indeed this opinion hath been followed chiefly by the Grandees. The Seraglio hath its Galleries full of Masaique work, where are seen great store of interlaced foliage, and birds represented by suitable peeces of differing Marble. The Emperor <hi rend="italic">Selim</hi> could paint himself, and he sent a Battel, drawn with his own hand, to the <hi rend="italic">Venetians</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> his son hath his Fathers Picture alwaies hanging by his bed-side; so that after such illustrious examples I have adorned this Palace, but with pictures and statues, wherein it may be you will find wherewith to satisfie the knowledge which you have in those excellent arts.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The description of</hi> Ibrahims <hi rend="italic">Palace.</hi></p>
<p>WHilst the Bassa was talking in this sort, he and his friend came still nearer to the Gate; where <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> stayed to consider the superb front of a great Paviglion, which rose up into a Dome over the Gate, and that equally divided a long wall of white Marble, which made the inclosure of that great and marvailous fabrick. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> could not sufficiently admire three orders of columns of different Marbles, which adorned that Portall, whereof the basis and capitall, were of Brass,

<pb n="50" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="50     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

but wrought with so much art, that neither the <hi rend="italic">Greeks</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">Romans</hi> have ever
shewed any fairer; some were wreathed, some fluted, and others so artificially
twined about with fillets, as they seemed to press down the foliage, wherewith it was
inriched; over the Corniches and Frizes of half relieve, which were garnished with
leaves of <hi rend="italic">Acanthes</hi>, were nothing but Chaplets of Triumph, Cornucopiaes, and
Trophies ofArms. Finally, the magnificence of the Palace was so great, that the very
gates of it were of Ebony, with mouldings so curiously proportioned, as the great
silver nails wherewith they were studded all over, made the least part of their beauty.
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was not yet resolved to quit so rare an object, had not the Bassa forced
him to enter, that he might observe the Vaulting which sustained the Paviglion,
whose key-stone was an Onix of a prodigious bigness, and whereof the Artist had
so well contrived all the colours, and made such use of them, as he had thereof
formed a Coronet of flowers, so admirably well done, that it beguiled the sight:
The rest of the Vaulting was all of white Marble, the better to set off so fair a
work, but so well joyned and polished, as it seemed to be made of one entire stone.
After he had sufficiently considered so rare a thing, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> caused <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to observe,
that opposite to the Paviglion, which he so much admired, was another just like
unto it; but before he went further <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> stayed to consider a great low covered
Gallery which compassed the Court about, and whereof the roof served for a Terrace, with a rail and ballister of a leaning height; it was sustained with pillars
of white and red Marble, and paved as the Court with white and black. But
whereas <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> knew that there was somewhat yet more marvellous to be seen,
he  made his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to pass along under the second Paviglion, and although
the vaulting of it was fairer than the other that he had already seen, yet did he not
make any stay there, so much was he ravished with the magnificent Fore-front
of<hi rend="italic"> Ibrahims</hi> Palace, which wholly discovered it self from thence; and truly
I must confess, that he had reason so to be, since all that art and materialls can
contribute to the beauty of a work, was eminently found in this same. There appeared a great Building that took up the whole bredth of the Court, which was
retrenched some thirty paces from the House by a Ballustrade of Jasper and Porphirie, and raised on the Palace-side the height of four steps, which formed in the
middle an half pace of the same matter. The pavement of this Court was gray
and white Marble, and in the midst of it was a Fountain, whereof the bole was of
Orientall Alablaster, transparant as Christall, and six foot Diameter, born up by a
pillar of divers-coloured Marble; the outside ofthe bole was inriched with
little Sea-Monsters of half relieve, admirably well done. Round about the
pillar were four Harpies of Brass, their paws reaching to the depth of the Cistern,
and their backs turned opposite the one to the other to uphold the pillar; the tips
of their wings extended also to the bottom of the Alablafter bole, as seeming to
bear it up; they had womens faces, but Serpents writhen tails finishing in antick
foliage, which met together on the top of the pillar just against the Center of the
bole, whereunto likewise it served for an ornament: In the midst of this bole was
a Vase reverst, made also of Orientall Alablaster, which on its foot sustained a
round basis, whereupon were set the three Graces, almost quite naked, made of
<hi rend="italic">Corinthian</hi> metall; they stood back to back, ejecting Water out their breasts, and
each of them holding a Corniucopia, which met all together a little above their
heads; out of the flowers and furits, which were represented there with suitable
pieces, made of Agates, Onixes, Turqueises, Carnalines, Topazes, and Emeraulds,
issued six spouts of water, which fell down into the bole, and disgorged themselves
into the Cistern through the muzzels of six Lions that were seen on the outside
thereof.  As for the six others, which issued from the breasts of the Graces, and
that did not spin out, they fell just into the heads of six Dragons of brass, which
were on the brim of the bole, and that rendred them; again through their mouthes:
These Dragons seemed to strive to get out of it, holding the brim with their tallons, the rest of their bodies, except their heads, and the tips of their wings, seeming to be hidden therein<unclear>,</unclear> so that those twelve spouts of water, comming to cross

<milestone n="51     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

one another, made so pleasing an object and murmure, as both sight and hearing
found at one and the same time wherewithall to be <sic>satifitd</sic>. The Cistern of this
Fountain was of Marble, but vvrought vvith such art in Mosaique vvorK, as there
appeared in the bottom through the vvater fishes, so admirably well represented,
that one might be deceived by them at the first light; this Cistern had also round
about it a little Balustrade of Jasper, for one to rest, and meditate upon. After
that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had well admired this Fountain, he gave his whole mind and attention
to observe the beauties of this marvellous frame; he saw then, that from each side
there went a vving of building, vvhich extended even to the Balustrade of Jasper
and Porphirie, and whereof the structure and symetrie was suitable to the
middle front: Each of these wings, as well as the grand fabrique, had a Copola, covered over with sheetes of brass, whereof the moity having received
an impression of fire, it had rendred then of a mixt colour between purple
and blew, which the Painters cannot well represent, and which shewed a
wonderfull object, being opposed to the other sheetes, whereunto had been given a tincture of gold. The rest of the roof was covered in the same manner,
as well as the Paviglions, whereof I have spoken; but when as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> came to
cast his eye a little lower, and to observe that all the ornaments of this Fabrique
were of Jasper, Chalcedonie, Agate, and Onix, he was so surprised, as he could
not forbear demanding, whether this which he saw was not inchantment: But
though the abundance of Festons, of Trophies of Armes, Arabesques, Vases of incense, Frizes, Corniches interlaced with Drapery, extinct Torches, Cornucopiaes, and Chaplets of triumph, gave him a world of admiration,  yet was he far
more surprised to behold four and twenty Columnes of Touch, which seemed to
sustain the first Order, and which were placed by two and two in equall distance,
between each window; the basis and capitalls of them were of white and red
marble, in correspondencie to the body of the building, which was wholly constructed thereof; but to preserve these Columnes, and to render them withall the
more magnificent to the eye, they were twyned about with the leaves of Achanthes
of brass guilt, which yet was no hindrance, but that one might distinstly discern
of what stone they were made, so as the beauty of them might be admired for their
prodigious greatness.  Over the Entrata was a statue of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> on horseback in
base relieve; and on each side between those Columnes were six Niches, filled with
six great statues of women, habited <hi rend="italic">a L'antipue</hi>, and representing the divers Natitions subjected to <sic><hi rend="italic">Solimon</hi></sic>, who with one hand seemed to offer him their Crowns,
and with the other leaned on the Scutcheons of the armes ofthe Kingdomes, which
they represented. After he had well observed all these marvailes of Art and Nature, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> told him, that having yet many things to shew him, which it may
be deserved his approbation, as well as those he had already viewed, it was requisite they should make a turn in the Garden, that all the outside might be considered before he let him see that the inside was not ill understood; he made him pass
then under a great Vaulting, which traversed the whole body of the House, from
whence one descended to the Garden by a large half pace of Porphirie. This Vaulting was all of Mosaique work, composed of different Marbles and Jaspers, upon
a ground of Alablaster, but so wonderfully wrought, as an excellent Painter could
not with a pencill interlace a foliage more artificially, better observe the lights,
and the shadowes, nor make a fairer piece with liquid colours, which by his mixture of them he renders such as he pleaseth, than this excellent Artisan of so beautifull a work had done with suitable pieces, whereof the colours were all simple
and naturall, and the joyning of them together imperceptible to <sic>he</sic> clearest sighted
eyes. <sic><hi rend="italic">Jbrahim</hi></sic>, whose impatience was extreme, and who imagined, that every
moment imployed by him any other way, than in thinking of his departure, was
an outrage to his love, and a crime towards <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, pressed <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> so much, as he
made him descend into the Garden; howbeit he stayed a little on the top of the
half pace the better to consider the beauty and extent of it. He saw upon the first
sight of it four preat parterres, in the midst whereof was a Round of an extraor-



<pb n="52" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="52     IRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

dinary bigness, about the which were seen upon the bases of green Jasper six figures
of fisher-men, as big as the life, whereof there were three that held each of them
a Trident in his right hand, with the arm lifted up for to dart it; and the other
three testified by their action the joy which they felt for having hurled theirs so
rightly, as that they had therewith struck a Sea Monster, which was represented
in the middle ofthe Round, lying half along on his side, his head and his tail out
of the water, and with so much art, as he seemed to be somwhat pained with the
hurts which the three Tridents had given him, and from whence issued three
ejects of water, that were in stead of blood to him. Just opposite to the half-pace
and the Round was a Grot, admirably fair, both for the matter whereof it was
formed, and for the art wherewith it was made, so that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, being much taken with this object, seconded the grand-Visiers design, and went on as fast as he
desired him; the Bassa, not to lose time, caused him to observe in going along,
that on each side of his Garden was a close arbor, erected vvith porticoes of verdures, where the Gardiner had made it well appear, that he was not ignorant of
all the beauties of Architecture, since it had not any ornament there, which was
not of the same proportion, and of the same symetry, as was observed over all that
stately Palace. He made him also cast his eye to both the sides of the Grot, from
whence there ran a Balustrade of Jasper, beyond the which was seen on the right
hand a Laberinth, so artificially contrived, that it might be called a prison without
a gate; it being most certain, that without at the least a prodigious chance, or being taught by him that made it, one could not get out of this <hi rend="italic">Dedale</hi>, what care
soever a man took to mark how he went into it: <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> would fain have gone and
made tryall of it; hovvbeit <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> would not suffer him, but obliged him to
look toward the lest side of the Balustrade, where vvas seen a Grove of Orange,
Citron, Pomegranate, and Mirtle trees; and although the prospect of this place
was delectable, and the sent of it odoriferous, yet <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> past by them to admire the
mervailes of the Grot, whereunto they were then near; but whereas the description
of it would be too loug, it shall suffice to say, that it was of an Octangular form;
that although it was of a just depth, yet it was for all that so lightsom, as all
which the Orient hath of most rare was there to be seen: And to conceive a light
Idea of it, one must imagine, that he beholds together all the master-pieces, or to
say better, all the miracles of Nature; one must then figure unto himself great rocks
of Christall, of Emeraulds, and of Rubies, where there was seen in some of them,
that the Sun had not leisure to finish his work, being without colour in divers
parts; one must also paint forth to his imagination that wonderfull ennamell of
Orientall Shells, whereof the diversity is so agreeable, be it for their formes, or
for their lively colours, so well mingled, and so well sorted, that of all naturall
things they are the fairest, and most perfect; one must likewise conceive that in his
mind, which all the Painters cannot represent, I mean those great Conques of
<hi rend="italic">Nacre</hi>, where the beames of the Sun leave so beautifull an impression of their
light, as neither Opales, nor the Rain-bow have any colours that are not surpassed
by the luminous Argent whereof they are formed, and which makes me name
them with reason the favorites ofthe Sun. But after all these things one must
imagine yet an infinite number of great branches of Corrall, of all colours which
Nature hath produced, namely of all the Carnations, white, black, and of the colour of fire. There must be further added to all these mervailes the fairest congelations and the rarest petrifications, whereof Philosophers, or Historians have ever
spoken to us: After this, I say, one may conceive part of those things which <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>
beheld in this Grot, vvhere all the artifices of vvater vvere seen admirably vvell
executed; there vvas a fall vvhich ran from a rock of Christall, and vvhich lost it
self presendy under another, whereof the noise vvas so charming, as there is not a
heart so light, nor a humor so sullen, in vvhom this murmure vvould not have excited a pleasing fancie; and that there may no doubt be made of the agreeableness ofthis inchanted Grot, I will say no more, but that <sic><hi rend="italic">Jbrahim</hi></sic> himself, howsoever he was pressed by his passion, could not chuse but be surprised by a thought



<pb n="53" ed="digital"/>

of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, which gave <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> the more leasure to see all that I have spoken of, and a thousand other rare things, which would be too long to relate. At last, after <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had cried out an hundred times miracles, miracles, and that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was come
out of his amorous contemplation, they went out of the Grot to return to the Palace, but still <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> looked to the place from whence they were parted, and his imagination was so taken up with that he had seen, as he was at the Round before he
ever thought of considering the front of the Palace on that side; he saw then that
it was wholly like the other, unless it were for a Balcone, which projected from
the rest of the work, and whereof the Balisters were of Copper gilt. Having seen
this they re-entred into the Palace, and ascended by a great stair of white and red
Marble, that had a rail and balister of the same; at the top they found a Lobby,
whole seeling and walls were adorned with an Arabesque of Gold and Azure,
inlayed with little peeces of Christall, like to Mosaique work, which yeelded both
a goodly and magnificent object. From thence they went into a spacieus Gallery,
which was on the right wing of the Palace, where <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had made a Library of all the curious Books of the Orientall Languages, and of all the choicest and rarest
in the Greek, Latin, Spanish, and Italian; but whereas the grand Visier did alwaies joyn magnificence to curiosity, all his Bocks were bound up in plates of
Gold, enammelled with white and green, and placed in order upon shelves of Ebony, which were bordered with a dentile of Goldsmiths-work, enammeled with
the same colours. There were also in this Gallery between the windows a great
number of Maps, both universall and particular; and upon a Tablet over the
Books a many of Globes and Spheres, different from one another, according to the
divers opinions of all them which have treated of such matters. In the same order likewise he had placed all sorts of Mathematicall instruments, the fairest and
the best made that ever were seen; as concave Mirrors, Clocks, Olomestres, Circles of proportion, and Astrolabes. But whereas <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> contented not himself
with necessary things, but would also have those that were for delight, he had
there a number of those paintings, which by opticall reasons do make such excellent and charming illusions; for that purpose then he had Cilinders of severall
greatnesses, and to refresh the sight of them which read, he had of those Christall
Triangles, which by the effect of a marvailous reflection do take and give all at
one time the colours of the Rainbow to all the objects that are seen through them.
He had also divers magnificent Desks, Prospective-glasses, and before the middle
window a Table of Ebony, garnished with Gold, and enammeled as the shelves,
with a Standish upon it covered all over with Emeraulds, some dark, some clear,
which made a foliage admirably well represented. At the end of this Gallery that
looked upon the first Court, was a door which opened to the Terrace, whereof I
have spoken, and which answered to the Paviglion in the middle, where the
Grand Visier had made a Cabinet of Arms, which he would needs have his dear
friend to see; he led him then by the way which I have noted, but <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> at his
entrance into it was exceedingly amazed and surprised; for the very first object
that his eye met withall, was a Trophy of Arms, sustained in the air by the prodigious vertue of a great Adamant, which was the Key-stone of the roof of this Cabinet, wherein were seen together, and in order, all the different Arms, both antient and modern, of all the Nations of the World; but so fair, so magnificent,
and so enriched, each one according to its use, as one would have sayd, that they
were the Master-peeces of all the excellent Artisans that ever wrought in Arms:
But amongst the rest those of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> were the richest, and most sumptuous; all the
Scymitars had their Hilts and Scabberds of Gold, all covered over with pretious stones; and whereas that Country doth abound with Turqaeyses, there were Targets and Quivers set all over with them, and Bows and Arrows answerable to the glittering beauty thereof. Now though the sight of all these things were wonderfully pleasing to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, yet gave he over beholding them, as soon as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> shewed him three Harquebuses of a miraculous artifice; whereof the first, which he caused him to make tryall of, shot off without fire, by the means of an in-


<pb n="54" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="54     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

closed wind which coming to issue forth expelled the bullet with the like impetuosity; the second performed the same thing with water; and the third, but the
most marvellous, by the means of that powder which is called white, shot off, not
only vvithout fire, but also vvithout noise. If <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had followed his humour
he would have stayed a long time in Philosophying on all these secrets, by maintaining, that neither vvater nor vvind, could ever have the same activity vvith fire and
so by consequence that vvhich he savv could not be vvithout inchantment; but <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> told him they vvould speak of it at leisure during the voyage they vvere
going to make, and vvithout harkening to him further, he made him go forth
at a door opposite to that vvhereby they had entred, and vvhich gave upon
the same Terrace that ansvvered to the end of the Gallery on the left vving
vvhere the Illustrious Bassa had caused all the Turkish Emperours to bee
dravvn, from <hi rend="italic">Othoman</hi>, vvho vvas the first, to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> then reigning.
But whereas he was not contented with having their faces represented but would
have the<hi rend="italic"> Othoman</hi> History also painted, there was in this Gallery fourteen great
Tables, in each of which was an Emperor as big as the life, and within the same
frame all the principall actions of his Reign; but the same so well done, so distinctly, and so well ordered, as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was ravished therewith, and plainly swore to
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that he would not stir out of that Gallery till he had considered all these
Pictures attentively, and that he had expounded them unto him. The Bassa declined it as much as he could, but at length seeing his friend persist in his obstinate
curiosity, he resolved to satisfie him, upon condition nevertheless, that he should
not stand to particularize all that he saw in those Tables: And whenas <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>
had shewed him that he was contented therewith, he requested him to pardon him
if in the prosecution of those painted Histories he saw a number of victories gained over the Christians, which much against his mind he had suffered to be there,
but that in the end he durst do no otherwise. This said, making use of an Indian
Cane, which he ordinarily carried in his hand, the better to make <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> observe
what he was going to shew him, he began to speak in these terms.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Othoman <hi rend="italic">the first Emperor of
the</hi> TURKS.
</p>
<p>YOu see, my dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, in this first Table, which you shall not see above once
again in all the rest, I mean a Prince repleat with all vertues, and absolutely
exempted from all vices, who owed his fortune to his own proper valour, and
who alone laid the foundations of this great Empire: And indeed his memory
hath been so reverenced, that even to this day all his Successors have held it for a
glory to carry his name. You may observe in his Physiogminy that he vvas a Prince
as prudent, as the rest of the Table vvill shevv him to be couragious. This battell
which you see afar off, is that which he obtained against the <hi rend="italic">Teggiur</hi> of the Town
of <hi rend="italic">Prusia</hi>; but mark a little how the industrious Painter hath so done it, as all
these figures seem to move, and that in this disorder one may know the victorious
party; he hath done it so too, that <hi rend="italic">Othoman</hi> is easily discerned there: But is this
fight be well represented, this affault of that Town of <hi rend="italic">Prusia</hi>, and where he afterwards established the seat of his Empire, wil not seem less marvellous unto you.
This pane of the wall, which you see fallen down, and which lets you perceive them
plainly that defended it, is it not admirably well done? These other Towns
which you behold so distinctly, are those of <hi rend="italic">Sinopa</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Galatia</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Angauri</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Phrigia</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Sebasta</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Capadocia</hi>; and these which you see further off towards those
Rocks, are the rest which he gained on <hi rend="italic">Mare major</hi>. As for this Land-skip, set
thick with Towns which you see beyond <hi rend="italic">Prusia</hi>, it is of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, that he wholly
conquered; and this Army which seemeth to march, and whereof all the souldiers
are laden with booty, is the first that ever passed into Europe,and that made strange
havock under this excellent enemy. But without staying to consider the rest, let us
pass on to this other Table.</p>



<pb n="55" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="55     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Orchan <hi rend="italic">the second Emperor of the</hi> TURKS.</p>
<p>THis Prince was the truly worthy sonne of <hi rend="italic">Othoman</hi>, continued <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, <sic>infor tunate</sic> nevertheless in this particular, that he was forced to be the first, <sic>who-began</sic> to make war on his Brothers, and wholly to exclude them from all pretension to the Empire; but if he were unhappy in this encounter, fortune recompensed him otherwayes; his conquests having extended their limits on the one side to
the <hi rend="italic">Helespont</hi>, and on the other to <hi rend="italic">Mare major</hi>. These Towns which you see neerest
hand, are those of <hi rend="italic">Nicea</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Nicomedia</hi>; and this Army in disorder, where the
Painter hath so well represented fear and amazement, is that of the Emperor <hi rend="italic">Paleologue</hi>, which was routed by <hi rend="italic">Orchan</hi> neer to <hi rend="italic">Philocratia</hi>, as you may discern afar
off.  As for this great extent of Countrey, and this number of Towns, which
take up all the rest of the Table, it is <hi rend="italic">Misia, Licaonia, Caria,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phrigia</hi>, except
the Towns of <hi rend="italic">Gallipolis</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Philopoli</hi>, which you see on the right hand, and which
were his last conquests, for he died soon after.  But let us behold the next.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Soliman <hi rend="italic">the third Emperor
of the</hi> Turks.
</p>
<p>IF the life of this Emperor had been longer, he would have yet surpassed his Father, both in valor, and in prudence, and we should have seen the Table of his
victories filled up more than it is; but whereas his reign indured but two years,
he had no more time than to take <hi rend="italic">Andrinople</hi>, conquer a great part of <hi rend="italic">Thrace</hi>, and
bring also under his subjection the Towns of <hi rend="italic">Pergamas, Edrenuta, Zemeniqua,</hi> and
some others, as well on this, as on the other side of the <sic><hi rend="italic">Helespout</hi></sic>, which you see
here running athwart this Table. But this other piece will furnish us with more
matter to speak of than this same.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Amurath <hi rend="italic">the fourth Emperor
of the</hi> Turks.
</p>
<p>TO describe unto you the humor of this Prince, before I speak of his Triumphs,
I must tell you that he had together both force and weakness, curtesie and cruelty, and agility in his age; that he was both terrible and loving; that he was insatiable in shedding of blood, and that nevertheless he never put any one to death
but most justly. It was as well by these according contrarieties that he rendred himself admirable to Posterity, as by his valour, which being seconded by fortune made
him take <hi rend="italic">Pherea</hi>, the capitall Citie of <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi>, conquer <hi rend="italic">Misia</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Dragus</hi>, and
Mount <hi rend="italic">Rhodope</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Pogdan</hi>, two valiant and mighty Princes, and the most
part of <hi rend="italic">Armenia</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> Emperor. <hi rend="italic">Carathin</hi> a great Captain, conquered for him also the Towns of <hi rend="italic">Cherales, Seres, Marolia,</hi> and the renowned <hi rend="italic">Thessalonica</hi>,
which the Painter hath made to be seen more distinctly, than those I have already
shewed you, as being of more importance. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> could not then forbear interrupting <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, for to pray him to let him know whether those millions of armed
and fighting men which he saw in this Table, were not the picture of all the Battells that were given during the reigns of all the Emperors. You have reason my
dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, answered the Illustrious Bassa, to be amazed at the prodigious number
of men which this Table doth shew you, where the Art of the Painter hath as well
eternized his own glory, as that of <hi rend="italic">Amurath</hi>, by representing seven and thirty battells which he won: And that which is yet more marvellous therein is, that he
died triumphing in the last. See you not, continued <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, this Army discom-

sited? And this great heap of armes in the midst of the place of battail, upon the
which a dead man appeares, holding nevertheless a scymitar still in his hand, and
upon whom Victory, which you may see here represented in the air, throws down
Crownes; it is the body of Victorious <hi rend="italic">Amurath</hi>, whose death was worthy of envy,
and whose life would have defaced the glory of all them that preceded him, had
it not been blemished with cruelty: But is the death of <hi rend="italic">Amurath</hi> deserved to be
envyed, that of <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi> will give you cause of pitty.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Bajazet, <hi rend="italic">the fifth Emperor of
the</hi> TURKS.
</p>
<p>THe nature of this prince cannot be well represented but by the lightning, which
terrifieth universally, which ravageth indifferently, passeth in a momant, and
perisheth in an instant; all of them qualities admirably befitting <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi>, surnamed by his subjects <hi rend="italic">Guilderum</hi>, that is to say, the lightning of Heaven. But
whereas the remembrance of his life strikes me with horror, by reason of the unheard-of cruelties which he exercised, it shall suffice to tell you, that after he had
gotten some battailes, which you see presented in this Table, taken the Town of
<hi rend="italic">Eritza</hi>, and those of <hi rend="italic">Hisipolis, Iconium, Casura, Migdia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Assara</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Caraman</hi>; and gained also by armes from a Greek, named <hi rend="italic">Theodorus</hi>, the Town of
<hi rend="italic">Damacia</hi>, and that of <hi rend="italic">Delphos</hi>, which you see here near hand; after he had, I say,
sacked all <hi rend="italic">Hungaria, Bossina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Croatia</hi>; defeated the French, Burgingnians, and
Hungarians, in that memorable battail of <hi rend="italic">Nicopolis</hi>; after he had, I say, filled the
whole Universe with terror, put all the Provinces where he passed to fire and
sword, he lost in one onely battel his Empire, and his glory, serving <hi rend="italic">Tamerlan</hi>, who
had vanquished him, all the rest of his daies; and at last was constrained, for his
geting out of misery, to make his tomb of his prison, by beating out his braines as
against the iron barres of the cage, wherein he was inclosed; An action so strange,
it is impossible not to bc moved with it. But let us see how the eldest of his children
began to reestablish the disorders of his father.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Iosue, <hi rend="italic">the sixth Emperor of
the</hi> TURKS.
</p>

<p>IT is easier to conquer, than to reestablish; to increase ones felicity, than to retire
from a misfortune; of a petty Soveraign to become a mighty Monarch, than to remount into a Throne from whence one is descended. It is no little glory to <hi rend="italic">Josue</hi>,
after the utter dissipation of his fathers Sate, to have been the first in raising up again that mighty Empire, by regaining from <hi rend="italic">Tamerlan</hi> the City of <hi rend="italic">Prusia</hi>, which
you have already seen, as having been before the chief seat of their Empire, and
very near all that his Predecesfors had possessed in <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>. He did the like in
<hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>, as you may see in this Table; and when he was returned into <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>, his
brother<hi rend="italic"> Musulman</hi>, fortified with the succor of the Greeks, incountred him in
<hi rend="italic">Cappadocia</hi>, gave him battail, which he wun, and taking him prisoner caused him
to be strangled, after he had reigned four yeares. But this cruelty was repaid unto
him, as you will quickly understand.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Musulman, <hi rend="italic">the seaventh Emperor
of the</hi> TURKS.
</p>
<p>ALthough that <hi rend="italic">Musulman</hi> shewed himself exceedingly couragious before he
vanqnished his brother, yet shall you see but two battailes in this Table:



<pb n="57" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="57     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

That which you see a far off is the same, whereof I have spoken; and the other
which you see near hand, is one that he obtained against a brother of his, called
<hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi>, who had established himself in <hi rend="italic">Greece</hi>: And truely the History doth declare,
that <hi rend="italic">Musulman</hi> did in his own person perform miracles at that battel, <unclear>I</unclear> whereof
he had all the glory, and all the advantage; but as soon as he saw that he was peaceable in his State, he abandoned himself in such sort to voluptuousness, as he became more cowardly, than he was valiant before, so that <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi> having rallied his
forces, which were dispersed by his deafeat, gave battel again to <hi rend="italic">Musulman</hi>, who
shamefully fled, was taken, and brought to his brother, that quickly revenged the
death of <hi rend="italic">Josue</hi> by taking away his life. But let us behold the sequel of the History
of this third Sonne of <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi>, which will not be long.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Moyses, <hi rend="italic">the eighth Emperor of the</hi> TURKS.
</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">Oyses</hi> having reigned but three years, you may not expect the fight of many
conquests, in this Table; all that he could doe was to give some rest unto
<hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>, to spoil the Country of the <hi rend="italic">Bulgarians</hi>, take the Town of <hi rend="italic">Spenderovia</hi>, reduce
the <hi rend="italic">Pogdan</hi> to his obedience, and win the battel which his Nephew <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> presented him with, who not long after rallied his forces, and came upon him with
a fresh charge, where <hi rend="italic">Moyses</hi> had the worst, by being abandoned of his Souldiers in
this fight, so that he was taken in a marish with one of his hands cut off, whereof
they soon cured him by putting him to death. Now though this Table be not
much filled, yet certainly it is none of the meanest; the colours of it are so Vive,
the digesting of it so beautifull, this order of the Architecture so well understood,
as it may be said in viewing this piece, that the art of the Painter hath supplyed the
defect ofthe matter.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Mahomet <hi rend="italic">the ninth Emperor of
the</hi> TURKS.
</p>
<p>AT length after so many Losses, Captivities, Sackings, Massacres, Fratricides,
and civill dissentions, the Turkish Empire began to reassume its antient
lustre under the conduct of <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi>, who after he had repulsed all them that had
atttacqued him, conquered <hi rend="italic">Pontus, Cappadocia</hi>, and all those other Provinces, which
the Painter hath so well represented a far off; his armes were also victorious in
divers incounters under the leading of <hi rend="italic">Amurath</hi> his Eldest sonne. <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> subdued likewise <hi rend="italic">Servia, Valachia</hi>, a great part of <hi rend="italic">Sclavonia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Macedonia</hi>; chaced all
the petty Kings out of the lesser <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi> to establish a Beglierbey there, which is as
much to say, as a Vice-Roy; at last, after he had performed a thousand brave exploits, for a recompence of his vertue, he reigned a long time, and dyed peaceably
in his State of a naturall death, exceedingly regretted of all his Subjects. But before we pass on I must cause you to mark one address of the Painter, that peradventure you have not heeded, which is, that to make one know the diversity
of Provinces, and Armies, which you have seen throughout all these Tables, he
hath alwaies observed the attire, armes, standarts, and briefly all the particular
things of every Nation: After this advertisement the rest of these pieces will give
you more contentment yet, than the other have done. Let us see then, whether <hi rend="italic">Amurath</hi> was the worthy successor of his father.

<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Amurath <hi rend="italic">the second, the tenth Emperor of the</hi> TURKS.
</p>
<p>THe Physiognimy of this Prince is not deceiving, and although it doth promise
us much, wee shall yet find more: After then that this Prince had defeated
<hi rend="italic">Mustapha</hi>, the last sonne of <hi rend="italic">Bajazet</hi>, whom the Greeks had made to rise up against
him, as also another <hi rend="italic">Mustapha</hi> his brother, whom the same Greeks had likewise
protected, he turned the fury of his armes against them; taking from them the City of <hi rend="italic">Thessalonica</hi>, which the Painter hath represented unto us as fair as the
Historians have described it, and whereof the perspective is so marvellous, as one
hath much adoe to believe that the running in of this gate is not effective. But let
us return to the Victories of this Prince, who spoiled the higher <hi rend="italic">Misia</hi>, took the
Town of <hi rend="italic">Senderovia</hi>, conquered the Countries of <hi rend="italic">Sarmian</hi>, and of <hi rend="italic">Sarcan</hi>, two
mighty Princes of the lesse <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>, and the Town of <hi rend="italic">Coni</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Caraman</hi>: The
Hungarians having in the mean time broken the peace  which they had contracted with him, he returned into Europe, and was so fortunate, that the Christian Gallies, which lay at the streight of <hi rend="italic">Helespont</hi> to hinder his passage,  were constrained by foul weather to retire; he in the mean while came to that memorable
plain, which gave name to the famousest battel that ever was heard spoken of. And
see you not how the Painter hath been pleased to represent it? Mark this Squadron
a little which gives ground, and this other which is broken; consider the left wing
which is routed; observe this close Battalion, which is going to attacque this other
that is ready to fly: As for the body of the Battail, where you see so great a disorder, and such a confusion of dead horses, men overthrown, blood spilt, and armes
broken, it is here in this place,  where the Painter would represent the death of
<hi rend="italic">Ladislaus</hi>, which arrived in this battel, with the loss very near of  all the Nobility of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi>; some fighting to revenge the death of their Prince, and others to
recover his body; but to shew clearly that the victory was on <hi rend="italic">Amuraths</hi> side, the
Painter hath represented Renown, which seemes to fly over his Troopes for to
advertise them of it. Howbeit not to stand longer hereupon, it shall suffise to say,
that after the battel of <hi rend="italic">Varnes</hi> he conquered <hi rend="italic">Peloponnesus</hi>; that he dismissed himself
absolutely from his Empire, which to took upon him again soon after, for to obtain a battel against the valiant <hi rend="italic">Huniades</hi>; he made the King of <hi rend="italic">Bosnia</hi> also his
Tributary, which was his last victory: For the couragious <hi rend="italic">George Scanderbeg
Castriot</hi>, King of <hi rend="italic">Albania</hi>, who had been his Slave, and that had acquired unto himself with so much justice the glorious title of the Buckler of Christendom, oposed all his enterprises with such valour, as this great Prince, seeing himself forced

</p>
<p>IT was not without some cause that this Prince would be surnamed <hi rend="italic">Bovi</hi>, which
is to say, Great, or the Terror of the World, seeing all his actions have been so
great, and high, that if his excellent qualities had been without blemish, this
Prince had been incomparable. He was great in his enterprises, great in courage,
great in conduct, great in prudence, a great Politician, great in conquest, great in
beauty, and in subtilty of wit; but he was also great in impiety, in dissoluteness,
in revenge, in perfidiousness, and in ambition. The greatness of his courage, and
of his enterprises,carried him against the <hi rend="italic">Greeks, Hungarians, Trebisondsans, Misians, Valachians, Transilvanians, <sic>Bosniaus</sic>, Albanians, Rhodians, Venetians</hi>, and divers
other people. In conclusion, my dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, this Prince had to do with all the
Warlike Nations of the World; but this Table contains too many things to he

explaned particularly unto you, wherefore it shall suffice, that you only do admire
the exquisite ordering of it, and that I tell you in generall, how <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi> conquered, in two and thirty years that he reigned, twelve Kingdoms, and two Empires,
that of <hi rend="italic">Trebisond</hi>, and that of the <hi rend="italic">Greeks</hi>, together with this mighty and renowned City of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>; as also that of <hi rend="italic">Croya</hi>, and all <hi rend="italic">Albania, Valachia, Bosnia,
Scodra, Peloponesus</hi>, and the Town of <hi rend="italic">Otranto</hi>. He reduced the <hi rend="italic">Caraman</hi> under his
obedience, <hi rend="italic">Stiria, Carinthia, Synope</hi>, the Hand of <hi rend="italic">Metelin</hi>; and after the battell
which he gained against <hi rend="italic">Usuncassan</hi>, he constrained him to seek his amity. Howbeit
he was not equally fortunate, for the valiant <hi rend="italic">Haniades</hi>, and the valorous <hi rend="italic">Scanderbeg</hi>, vanquished sometimes in him the Vanquisher of all others. And whereas ambition was the predominant passion in the heart of <hi rend="italic">Mahomet</hi>, it followed him
even to death, ordaining that upon his Tomb there should be set, after a long narration of all his Victories,in the Turkish tongue, this subscription in Latin,
<q><hi rend="italic">He had a purpose to ruin</hi> Rhodes, <hi rend="italic">and superb</hi> Italy.</q>
But the divine justice extinguished his desires with his dayes.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Bajazet <hi rend="italic">the second, the twelfth Emperor of the</hi> Turks.
</p>
<p>The life of this Prince is so replenished with divers adventures, as it cannot be
defined certainly, whether he had more good than bad fortune. The begining of his Reign was established by three Battels which he obtained against a
Brother of his, who was constrained to fly unto <hi rend="italic">Rhodes</hi>. When he was at peace he
conquered <hi rend="italic">Caramania</hi>, did great spoyl in <hi rend="italic">Moldavia</hi>, took the Town of <hi rend="italic">Chillum,</hi>
together with the Castle, and that of <hi rend="italic">Moncastro</hi>, the chief of the Province; he took
also <hi rend="italic">Lepanto, Modon, Coron</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Junqua</hi> from the Christians, whom he defeated in
a Navall-fight, as you may behold in this Table, where the Painter verily hath
done prodigies. See you not, continued <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, these two vessels grapled together? consider a little with what ardour the assailants seem to go to the fight,
and how one of these Janizaries striving to leap aboord this small vessel is repulsed
by this Christian, how in falling he hath seized on his enemy, whom he drags along with him. Behold also on the left hand this vessel, which the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi> had invested, and how that rather than they would yeeld, they have blown up themselves; observe withall these flakes of fire, which light upon this other vessell,
whose tackle and sayles already begin to burn; and how this great cloud of smoak, which steals away the rest of the Army from our eyes, is an address of the Painter, who waiting room hath repaired that defect by this invention. But without standing on the last disorders of this Prince, which were strange, whether for the violent deaths that he caused, or for that which he received, let us pass on to this other piece.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of</hi> Selim,<hi rend="italic"> the thirteenth Emperor of the</hi> Turks.</p>
<p>THis gloomy physiognomy, and this haughty look, do not ill paint forth unto, us the ambition and cruelty of <hi rend="italic">Selim</hi>, but they conceal from us his vertues which certainly were very great. He was prudent, and advised amidst dangers, prompt and vigilant in his enterprises, indefatigable in War, of an invincible courage, a reasonable Justicer mauger his cruelty, extremely liberall; and that which is of most marvail in this Prince is, that he was never vanquished after he

<pb n="60" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="60     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

was Emperor. He loved the reading of History, he made verses in his own tongue,
was very skilfull in Painting, and even to the point, that he sent, as I have already
delared, the Battell which he obtained against the Sophy, drawn with his own hand,
unto the <hi rend="italic">Venetians</hi>, who conserve it still unto this day in their Treasurie. There is
also a great number of his works to be seen in the Seraglio: He was very Eloquent, and nothing curious of the magnificence of Apparell; and that which I
most admire in him, is, that he alwayes refused those adorations which are accustomed to be rendred to the Turkish Emperors, never suffering any to cast themselves on the ground in speaking to him, nor to do him reverence on their knees.
And truly is this Emperor had not blemished his glory by that prodigipus desire
of reigning, which carried him to take away the life of him, from whom he had
received his; to cause two of his Brothers, eight of his Nephews, and as many
of his Bassaes to be strangled, he had been excellent in all things. But to pass over his Victories lightly, because time doth press us, I will onely tell you in few
words, that he won a famous Battle of the Sophy at <hi rend="italic">Zaleran</hi>; that he took <hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi>, which he kept not long; and <hi rend="italic">Keman</hi> at his return; he rendred himself Master
of <hi rend="italic">Aladulia</hi>, after he had vanquished King <hi rend="italic">Ustagelu</hi>; he passed into <hi rend="italic">Siria</hi>, where
he defeated <hi rend="italic">Campson Gauri</hi>, Sultan of <hi rend="italic">Cairo</hi>, in a battel neer to <hi rend="italic">Aleppo</hi>, which was
rendred unto him, as well as <hi rend="italic">Damascus</hi>, and all the rest of <hi rend="italic">Siria</hi>; from thence going to <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem</hi>, he conquered all <hi rend="italic">Palestina</hi> by the valour of <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> Bassa, who obtained a Battel neer to <hi rend="italic">Gaza</hi>; whereupon <hi rend="italic">Selim</hi>, having passed the deserts of <hi rend="italic">Egypt</hi>,
fought a battel vvith <hi rend="italic">Thomombey</hi> hard by <hi rend="italic">Matharea</hi>, and constrained him to retire
to <hi rend="italic">Cairo</hi>, where was given the most memorable battel of our Age, for it lasted three
dayes and three nights in continuall fight; but in the end <hi rend="italic">Selim</hi> was victorious
and forced the <hi rend="italic">Mamelucks</hi> to abandon the City unto him; and having recovered
new forces, they were utterly defeated, and <hi rend="italic">Thomombey</hi> taken prisoner.  After he
had given the pillage of <hi rend="italic">Cairo</hi> to his souldiers, as you may see in this Table
where this dreadfull disorder is so well exprest, he went and took also <hi rend="italic">Alexandria, Damiotta, Tripoli</hi>, and all the rest of<hi rend="italic"> Egypt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arabia</hi>: One of his Bassaes
obtained likewise a great Victory against the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>. But at last, after he had been
in so many fights, won so many battails, and conquered so many Provinces, in
less than two years, as he thought to return triumphant to the seat of his Empire
he dyed at <hi rend="italic">Chiourli</hi>, in the very same place where before he had given battel to his
father, after he had reigned only eight years.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Pourtrait of </hi>Soliman<hi rend="italic"> the second, the fourteenth
Emperor of the </hi>Turks.
</p>
<p>THe Victories of great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> are so universally known of all the World, that
upon the least considering of this Table, you will bring them unto your memory again, it being impossible but that same hath acquainted you with them: You
will easily then knovv <hi rend="italic">Belgrade</hi> and the Isle of <hi rend="italic">Rhodes</hi>, where this Emperor stood
in need of all his conduct, and of all his valour. This Battel which you see a
far off, is that of <hi rend="italic">Mohacs</hi> vvhich he gained against the <hi rend="italic">Hungarians</hi>, wherein dyed
<hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi>. This City, which here I shew you (continued <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>)
is <hi rend="italic">Bagadet</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was crowned King of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>; but though I have some
share in this War, as well as in that of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, which you may see also in this
Table, I will refer this narration to another time, that may be more opportune
for us. I know, my deai <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, that this proposition displeases you, but you must
obey me, for you will not be the strongest at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>; and though you may
absolutely command <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, yet must you at this time follow the pleasure <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>. Let us make an end then of running over the Victories of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> again,
and without particularising every one, it shall suffice me to tell you, <hi rend="italic">Assyria</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Mesopotamia</hi> do obey him; that he hath taken <hi rend="italic">Strigonia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Alba Regalis</hi>; that he hath made six expeditions into <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi>; that he hath subdued <hi rend="italic">Aladulia</hi>


<pb n="61" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="61     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

and the Kingdom of <hi rend="italic">Aden</hi>, with many other Towns on the red sea; that he hath
rendred <hi rend="italic">Argier</hi> Tributary; that he hath also subjected <hi rend="italic">Pialli, Tripoli</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gerbes</hi>:
But after all these things, that which I find to be most excellent in the life of this
Prince is, that he conquered a Kingdom for to restore it unto him to whom it appertained, by rendring unto him again all the strong places that he had in his
hands, which he performed in the person of <hi rend="italic">John</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi>; and I more
esteem of him for having surmounted this ambition vvhich is naturall to all Monarchs, than I commend him for all his Victories: And whereas I make more account of the gifts of Nature than of the presents of Fortune, I had rather make
you an Elogium of his person in particular, than speak further to you of his Conquests, which are already but too great on Christendom side. Behold then, my
dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, this Majesticall face, and this vertuous physiognomy; did you ever
see a more goodly man? or one of a better aspest? There appears in his eyes a
vivacity of spirit, and a sweetness which charmeth hearts, and in the air of his
face a certain tranquillity, which sufficiently shews that this Prince is master of
his passions, and that without doubt he hath no interior trouble; I know not whether my affection to him doth blind or dazle me, but I see something of such state
in his port, and of so much majesty over all his person, as I hold it impossible for
one to look upon him, and not to love him; Furthermore this goodly apparance
is not deceitfull, and the qualities of this Princes soul are so noble and vertuous,
that if he were a Christian he would be of all men the most perfect. He hath together, both much valour, and much conduct; he is infinitely just towards his own
people, and exceeding clement towards his enemies; he is so rigorous an observer
of his vvord, as he vvould resolve rather to lose his Empire, than not to
keep it, when once he hath given it: He is great in spirit, great in judgement, and great in memory; he understands the Mathematicks, and the universall History, so admirably, as nothing can be propounded to him touching
those matters which he resolves not upon the place. Finally, he is a Prince that
possesseth all vertues, and that hath never been vanquished save by one only passion; but whereas it is the nobleft of all others, I think you will pardon him this
weakness; he hath been then passionately amorous of divers women, but amongst the rest of the Sultana <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi>, whom he would needs espouse, to the end she might partake with him in that surpreme greatness which the <hi rend="italic">Othoman</hi> Princes do not lightly bestow, and which to conserve wholly to themselves, they never, or seldom marry; howbeit love was stronger in <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, than either reason or State, or the example of his Predecessors. Behold, my dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, a simple draught of this great Emperor, whom ere it be long you may compare with the originall, that so you may judge, whether I have robbed him of any thing, or flattered him; for this great Prince hath commanded me to bring you to the Seraglio, when as I go thither to take my leave of him; in the mean space, since we are pressed with time, let us make an end of viewing this house.</p>
<p>In saying so, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> opened a door, which gave upon the Lobbey, whereof I have already spoken, but before they past on, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> testified to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> hovv glad he was of the hope he had given him that he should present himself to the Grand Signior; he rendred him thanks also for having so punctually explaned all those peeces, by abridging unto him the History of so great an Empire, which he had never understood but very confusedly before. He would have said more, if our illustrious Bassa would have suffered him, but his impatience appeared so visibly in his eyes, that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> without further stay went out of the Gallery smiling into the Lobbey, from whence they past through three outward chambers, which were all of a floor, before they came to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahims</hi>: the seeling of them were very magnificent, and the meanest of the Hangings were of cloth of Gold, of Tinsell, or Persian Tapestry; the floors, as of all the rest, vvere made of suitable peeces of severall Marbles, and in proportionable divisions. After he had stayed a vvhile to consider all these things, they entred into the Bassaes chamber, vvhere <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> vvas surprised vvith the furniture of it, both for the richness, and fashion thereof; for it was



<pb n="62" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="62     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

hanged with black Velvet, set all over with tears and flames imbroidered in pearl:
Here it was where <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> desired his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to remember the things which he
should see in this chamber, more particularly than all the rest of the Palace, to the
end he might testifie to the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>,that she had always reigned in
his heart, and that to conserve the memory of her, he would never open his eys in
waking, without beholding some marks of his love; he caused him then to observe,
that in the seeling of this chamber were five great Ovals,in each of which was a Table, &amp; between every of them hung festons of flowers and fruits, all gilt; the rest of the
seeling being done with cornishments, whereof some were of azure, some of burnished gold. In the middle piece, which was greater than the rest, was a woman represented, whom <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> presently knew, because she had somthing of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> in her, although
it was a very imperfect resemblance; for <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> having lost her picture, could do
no more but instruct the Painter with the colour of her hair, with the form of
her face, with all the features of it in particular, with the vivacity of her complexion, with her stature, and with her bosome; for as for the air and gracefulness, which cannot be exprest, but in calling it the soul of beauty, it is a thing
that cannot pass from our imagiiption to that of another, and that consequently
did not permit <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s Painter to make any marvellous picture of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; but
in conclusion it was resembling enough for to cause them, who knew her, to judge
that she was thought of when this piece was made. This imperfect resemblance
having entertained them a while, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> considered all this Table, and saw (as I have
already declared) a woman sumptuously apparelled, who trampled under her feet
honor, vertue, and love, which were seen represented with the marks whereby they
are known; and that with her right hand, lifted up on high, she took from fortune, who appeared over her in the air, a little Crown, which she seemed to receive very contentedly, with this Motto, <hi rend="italic">All for her.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> easily comprehended
this Embleme, and no way doubted, but that the Bassa had caused it to be made
out of the opinion he had, that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had despised her love, her promises, and
her constancy, to espouse the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, who was but a petty Soveraign.
After he had commended the art of the Painter, and the invention of the design,
the Bassa leading him towards one of the corners of the chamber, the better to
view the second Ovall, demanded of him whether this other Table would be as
intelligible to him as the first? <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> approaching to it, and considering it,
beheld a Love, in whose face choler and fury were so well painted, as it was easie
to imagine that he himself had burst his bow, broken his arrows, thrown away
his quiver, and torn his head-band, which were seen scattered about him; and that
which better expressed his despair, was, that having nothing left him of all the
marks of his Divinity but his torch, he plunged it, all flaming as it was, into a
fountain to extinguish it, with this Motto, <hi rend="italic">I cannot</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> vvas so ravished with
this Table, as he could not forbear considering all the beauties of it, and vvhereas
the explication of it vvas easie, he told the Bassa, that he vvould pardon him for
that he vvould have extinguished so fair a fire as that vvherevvith he was inflamed,
at such a time as he thought it to be unjust, but that he held him happy for that he
could not do it, and for having conserved a flame, vvhich he could not put out
vvithout a crime: After this he admired the Art of the Painter, and principally
of the torch, which this Love plunged into the fountain, where the excellent
Workman had so vvell represented that naturall antipathy betvvixt vvater and
fire as never did any one behold a thing better imitated: This fountain seemed to
boil vvith choler to see her enemy so neer her; and this flame desiring to eloign
it self from that which would destroy it, seemed exceedinglv to strive to get from
it, and rising up on high in wreathing about the torch, melted so great a quantity of
wax, as all the fountain seemed to be covered over with it. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> not suffering
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to admire this piece any longer, constrained him to look upon the third, desiring him hovvsoever not to bestovv much time in it, because that Table did outrage <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, as vvell as another vvhich he should see aftervvards: He shevved him
then the same vvoman he had seen before, but in a different habit; for here the



<pb n="63" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="63     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

Painter had given her a robe of changeable Taffeta, vvhere all colours reigned equally; this vvoman was on the brink of the Sea, the agitation vvhereof she beheld vvith delight; in one hand she held a Crescent, vvith the other she seemed to
point at a Camelion, vvhich vvas at her feet, and that leaning his body on a part of
her robe had assomed all the colours of it; the rest of that creature vvas grayish
like to the earth vvhereon it stood, vvith this Motto, <hi rend="italic">Yet more.</hi></p>

<p>After that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had seen this piece, he told the Bassa, that he had reason to say
it did outrage <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, in accusing her of inconstancy, but since this crime had been
committed through the malice of fortune, he should one day obtain his grace
for it: This said, they passed to the other end of the chamber, and beheld in
the fourth Table, a proper man, and of a good aspest, that seemed very sad; he
had on the one side the same <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, whom they had seen before, and on
the other, death, with this Motto, <hi rend="italic">The one, or the other.</hi>
</p>
<p>Now although this piece was admirably well done, yet would not <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> stay to
consider it, but onely told the Bassa, that the noble despair which he had shewed
in this Table, rendred him vvorhy to be put, at his return to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, into the possession of an happiness, which he could never lose again but by death alone;
hovvbeit in the mean time he vvas most assured, that albeit this picture did not
fill the imaginination vvith a fair Idea, yet vvould it be more pleasing to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
than that other, vvhere the Painter had given her a roab of all the colours of the
Rain-bovv. The Bassa then pushing him to the other side of the chamber, told him,
that this, vvhich he was novv going to shevv him, would not like enough please
her ere a vvhit more, if she had not the goodness to consider, that his love had
hovvsoever been so strong, as to make him conserve vvith some delight the very
marks of her contempt, and inconstancie, vvhich he had believed to be true; he
caused <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> then to behold the last picture of this seeling. It was a Land-skip, vvhere the Princes vvas seen again holding an heart in her hand, that vvas all of a
flame, and not far from her a great fire of stravv, where the Painter had so well
imitated nature, as it vvas easie to perceive, that hovv vive soeyer this flame vvas
yet could it not long indure: There vvere also flashes of lightning seen darting at her head, vvith his Motto, <hi rend="italic">Less durable</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> then accused <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> of injustice, and told him, that if this piece had been less excellent, he should hardly have pardoned him the wrong he did <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, but he vvas so ravished to see those vvaving flames, <sic>vvvhich</sic> came out of a cloud, and that spread themselves over all the piece, leaving an impression of fire and light, vvhich seemed even to redouble, and lessen, as if the cloud had opened, and shut it self, that he ceased to accuse him, for to praise the Painter, vvhich he did vvith so much aggregation, as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> vvas constrained to urge him more than once to view a picture, which he had cause to be set over his Chimney: Now he had no sooner cast his eye upon it, but he vowed it was the best of them all; the ordering of it was rare, the design extraordinary and new, the colours most agreeable, the prospective excellent; in conclusion this Table was drawn with so bold an hand, as it might well be called a Master-piece of this art. A rock was seen there in the midst of an inraged Sea, which the Painter had done so well, as those foaming waves, that brok themselves against the rock, seemed to have some motion: There was seen also a little from thence the wrack of a Vessell, whereon the thunder fell, which was seen to issue like a torrent of fire out of the cloud, that seemed to rive asunder with such violence, as little lacked but that one sense deluded did not deceive the other, in making it to imagine that it heard that, which was seen so well represented. This mervailous Artisan had likewise so well painted that confused mixture, which is seen in the air during a great tempest, where rain, wind, snow, hail, flashes of lightening, and obscurity, reign all at once, that one could not behold it without some terror: Vpon the top of this rock was an open tomb seen, whereunto a man, weary, and wet all over, advanced in great hast, holding a Love in one hand, and with the other pointing to the tomb, vvith this Motto, <hi rend="italic">Let us save our selves there.</hi></p>


<pb n="64" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="64     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

<p>You will without doubt find another sanctuary, said <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to the illustrious
Bassa, who, answering him no otherwise than with a sigh, made him enter into his
Cabinet, the door whereof was on the right hand of the chimney, not far from
his bed, which after the custom ofthe Country was rolled up in a great <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> tapestry Counterpoint of silke and gold. But if <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had admired all that he had
seen in this Palace, he beheld with astonishment the magnificence of this Cabinet
whereof the embowed roof and walles were inriched with a foliage of pretious
stones, upon a ground of black marble, where birds, flowers, and fruites, were seen
so admirably well done, that the art surmounted the matter, although Topazes
Jacints, Opales, Emeraulds, Rubies, Diamonds, and Carbuncles were the colours
wherewith all these things were represented. Round about this Cabinet were
shelves of Ebony, sustained by curtroses of gold, which projected out of the <sic>wall
wall</sic> by equall distances, the edges, and uper part of these shelves, were enriched
with Orpheury, enammeled onely with white and black, the better to set off those
things which were upon them; but to speak that in few words, and confusedly,
which would be too long to describe in order, one might see there Caskets of
different Ambers, great Vases of Christall of the rock, of Cornaline, and Agate,
with branches of Corrall, which might rather be called trees, by reason of their
prodigious greatness: Finally, all that <hi rend="italic">Persia, China, Japon</hi>, and all the Orientall
Countries do produce of most rare, rich, and beautifull, were found amassed together in this place. After that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had said all, that admiration, and amazement
can make them say, who love, and know rarities, they repassed through the chamber, to go unto a door that was opposite to that of the Cabinet, whereby one entred into <hi rend="italic">Ibrahims</hi> Bath, who, being accommodated with all exterior things, according to the custom ofthe Country where he lived, did not fail in having a
goodly and magnificent one. It was a place spacious enough, in form Octangular,
invironed about with seates, whereunto one ascended by four steps of Jasper, and
Chalcedony,  whereof the two lovvermost vvere covered vvith vvater even up to
the brim of the third, the fourth being vvholly out of the vvater: At each of the
eight angles vvas a Colum, after the Corinthian manner, of Jasper mingled vvith
divers colours; the Columnes were planted on the fourth step, which served them
for a pedestall, with their Bases, Capitalls, Frizes, and Corniches; the Frize was
carved in half relieve, where naked children were seen, who seemed to combat in
the water with little Sea Monsters, and to wrastle with them, with efforts so agreeable to their yeares, as the workman deserved no little glory for the same.
All these sigures were so lively set forth, as they seemed to move, so easily may the
imagination be deceived by things that are well represented; over the Frize was
the Cornish, and above that just perpendicular to every Column rose up a twyning wreath of Oaken leaves, laid one upon another, made of green Jasper, and
bound with filets of gold, mounting up on the ribbs of the vaulting, and meeting
the middle in the form of a Chaplet of Triumph. All the walls were overlaid with
a compound stone, called <hi rend="italic">Aventurina</hi>, and whereof they seemed to be framed, so excellently was this work contrived. But amongst all the beauties of the place the greatest was, that between those eight Columns, whereof I have already spoken, there
were as many Niches, four of which were filled with great Vases of gold, that
served to lay the perfumes in, and other things necessary to the Bath; the other
four which separated those former, were filled with four Nimphes of white marble so admirably fair, as Nature hath never made any thing more beautifull, than
the Idea of this excellent workman:  These figures were all in different actions;
some of them seemed to uncloth themselves for to enter into the Bath; others to
come out of it, putting on their cloathes again; but all with such art, as<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>
confessed, that Sculpture had never shewed any thing more perfect. He considered
also that the water, which was seen in the Bath, fell into it through two
Vases of Christall, which were held by two men, laid along on the brim of the
Bath and represented as Rivers use <sic>to to</sic> be painted: Out of one the Vases issued
hot water, and out ofthe other cold, to the end one might by that mixture find

that just mediocrity requisite for those that bath. After he had seen all these things,
the grand Visier made <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> go forth at a secret door, and pass down by a back
stair to one of the doores of the Hall; and though it be the custom ofthe Turkes
in generall not to be very costly in their dyet, yet as the Grandes do not use to follow the common fashion, so <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> left not to be in that particular, as in all other
things. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> saw in the middle of the Hall a great Persian Carpet extended on the
ground, with a Table-cloth after the manner of the Country, upon which were
set a many of silver Chargers, where in each of them were seen twelve great dishes
of that which we call the essence of porcelain, replenished with divers sortes of
meates; for it is the custom of the Turkes never to eat in any mettall; howbeit they
are not without great store of silver vessell, onely for magnificence; and indeed the
grand Visiers Cubbord of plate was so sumptuous, as <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi> hath not a King that
can shew so fair a one. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> then beholding that prodigious amass of Basons of
gold engraven, great Vases of sundry formes and of divers bignesses, Flaggons,
vvater Pots, and Cisternes of gold, vvith Lions muzles and Dolphins half imbost,
could not forbear telling <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> vvould dye for joy, if she certainly
knew at what rate he bought the possession of her; but the Bassa returning him no
other answer thereunto than a sigh, told <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> it was time to dine, that they might
afterwards go and take their leave of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; that in the mean space, whereas
their exterior ceremonies were different, although their minds were not, he had
given order that he should be served in his chamber. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> went out then of this
Hall, after he had observed, that the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> Carpet was set all about with great
Cushions cloth of Gold, upon Carpets of the same stuff, for <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> and the
Officers of the Empire which did eat with him, to sit upon. The Bassa would
have conducted his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to his lodging, but he would not suffer him, so
that he was constrained to leave him in the hands of an <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> slave, in whom he
confided for all things. These two friends were not long at meat, for at this time
love and friendship produced the same impatiency in them both; the Bassa came
into <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> chamber just as he was going out, having taken a resolution together
to go immediately to the Seraglio, that they might part away the night ensuing. The <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> slave assured the Bassa, that in the evening he should have
such an habit as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> wore; for <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had caused him to quit that of a slave,
as soon as he was at liberty, and by the means of those Jews, of whom I have
already spoken, procured him one of the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> fashion. They vvent avvay
then to the Seraglio, where being arrived, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> made <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> put on a
Turkish robe, no stranger being permitted to speak to the Sultan but with this
ceremony. The Bassa entred in first, to let his Highness know, that according to
his order he had brought his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> shevved himself much satisfied therewith, hovvbeit though he vvere somewhat impatient to see him, yet
would he for all that speak once more to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> without witnesses, wherefore he
caused him to pass along with him into his Cabinet, vvhither he vvas no sooner
come, but looking on our illustrious Bassa with eyes where generosity combatted
grief, and retaining the tears which kindness and amity would have shed in this
hard separation, he spake unto him with such obliging terms, as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was not
long without partaking with him in his melancholy, so certain it is that passions
do easily pass from one spirit to another, as well in friendship, as in love. The Sultan having observed by the change of the Bassaes countenance, that his soul was moved, desired his pardon for having troubled his pleasure, and accused himself of inhumanity for not letting him part without shewing his grief, to the end he might not have excited his; but to excuse him in this encounter he was onely to consider, that the love he bare him was so strong, as he would with less pain divide with him his Empire, than be separated from him; that nevertheless he was generous enough not to repent him of the grace which he had granted him, albeit the execution of it was more difficult than he had thought it to be; but to comfort him in his absence, he prayed him not to take it ill, if he desired one oath more form him, which might assure him he would within six moneths return to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople. Soliman</hi> had no sooner done speaking, but the Grand Visier, 




<pb n="66" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="66     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

who never gave place to any man in generosity, cast himself at his feet, and protested unto him, that he would not depart before his Highness had testified that
he would rely on the word he had given him to return precisely within the time
prefixed; that he esteemed himself very unhappy in not being known to his Highness for that which he was, and that being neither base, ingratefull, nor a lyar,
he was for all that suspected of those three crimes by a Prince, for whom he
would sacrifise his life with joy, who reigned in his heart far more absolutely
than over his people, and who touched his soul with so much tenderness, as he
plainly felt that he could not turn his steps towards <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, without turning his
eyes towards <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> pronounced these last words with such earnestness, as the Sultan no way doubted but that he had truly expressed his heart;
he raised him up then in imbracing him, and promised him that he would live in
some quiet of this assurance of seeing him again; that in the mean time it was
not just to let<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> stay any longer without, and that therefore he should go and
fetch him in. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> obeying this commandement, called him at the door of the
Cabinet; as soon as he appeared <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> spake to him in his own language for
I have already said, this Prince understood it perfectly, and made him such an
Elogium of our Illustrious Bassa, as caused him to blush more than once; he spake
of his valour, of his prudence, and of his conduct in great matters; finally he assured him, that he was as good a Generall of an Army, as he was a good and faithfull friend; he told him further, that he desired him to receive his friendship as
he already possessed his, having begun to love him as soon as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had made
known to him, by the recitall of his adventures, what his merit was, and the affection which he bore him; moreover, that as all the interests of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> were his,
so he gave him thanks not only for all the services he had rendred him, but for
all those which he should render him in time to come; and for a mark of the obligation wherein he would stand ingaged to him for it, he conjured him to accept of a Scymitar which he gave him, whereof the hilt and scabberd were all
covered over with Diamonds. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> answered to all these things with all the respest that he owed to so great a Prince, and being fallen on his knees to receive
that precious gage of <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> liberality, he was with a great deal of sweetness
and civility taken up by the Sultan, who prayed him to assure <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, that the
constancy of her <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had been so firm during the time that he beleeved her to
be unfaithfull, as he durst swear for him, that he had never sought after, nor affected glory, but out of the hope of dying more nobly; he entreated him also to present her from him with a box of Gold, set with Emeraulds, which was filled
with two Chains, the first was of Diamonds of an excessive greatness, and the second of Pearls, so big, so round, so even, and so clear, that the Orient hath never
shewed us fairer. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> would have spoken to render <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> thanks, and to
have made himself the bearer of that Treasure, but he imposed silence on him,
and sayd, that it would be enough for him to entertain <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> with his own affairs, without charging himself with a complement from another. But at last
the Sultan being unwilling that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> should see him capable of any weakness, and
feeling that this conversation could not long endure without his falling again into melancholy, he told the Bassa that he had given order unto the Tesqueregibassi, who is the Grand Signiors principall Secretary, to make up the Ambaassador
of <hi rend="italic">Genouaes</hi> dispatch; that his Letter was conceived in such pressing terms, as that
Republique durst not refuse what he desired of it; that in the mean time, since he
must resolve to see him depart, he thought it fit that he should go and give order
to his affairs, to the end he might as soon as it was night repair to the Ambassador of <hi rend="italic">Genouaes</hi> vessell, which he had caused to come from <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>,
and would attend for them at the Port. This sayd, he dismissed <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, after he
had testified much affection unto him, and retained <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> for one moment more
to take his last farewell of him; it was at this instant that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> shewed the
greatest marks of his good-will to the Grand Visier, since it is most certain,
that silent sorrows, though they be not so eloquent as others, yet are they at the
least more perswasive. When <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was gone the Sultan imbraced <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, but

<pb n="67" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="67     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

howsoever he forced himself, he could say no more, than go my dear <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, restore <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to life again, but when you shall have revived her, come and preserve mine. This discourse touched the Bassa so vively, as all the answer he could make was, that his return should quickly justifie his departure; after which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> made a sign to him to be gone. He went avvay then to his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who stayed
for him in another chamber; in their way back they talked of nothing but great
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was so satisfied of him, as he was constrained to confess, that he 
should want common sense if he were not charmed by the rare qualities of so excellent a Prince.  <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> answered hereunto with so much melancholy, as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>,
was fain to speak of the Princess to him for to draw him out of it; wherefore he
dextrously told him, that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would be astonished at the present which she
should receive from him. At this sweet name <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> began to take heart again,
and somewhat dissipating his heavyness, he turned all his thoughts to his departure.
As soon as he vvas at his Palace, he entred with <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> into his chamber, where having sent for the Italian slave, he understood by him, that his habit was ready;
whereupon he called the principall Officers of his house once more before him, and
told them that he was going to depart away upon that occasion wherewith he had
acquainted thera before, and therefore they should give order to the Porter of his
Palace, that he might not be troubled for the rest of the day, but to send such as
came about generall affairs to the Bassa of the Sea, who during his absence was to
deal for him: After this he commanded them to withdraw, and remained alone
with <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and the slave that had brought him his habit. Now the night beginning to approach, he held it time to think of parting, and this slave being of
counsell with them, was appointed by him to go and take that other of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and conduct him to the Port, whether they would come to them. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>
having put on his habit, took some Jewels with him, in case hee should
stand in any need upon the way by some unexpected incounter, and  perceiving it to be dark enough for them to go forth without discovery, he caused
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to descend by a back-stair, which brought them to a door that opened into
the Garden, the passage out of the which not being far distant from the Port, gave
them the commodity to get thither easily without being seen. And whereas <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> knew precisely whereabout the Christian vessels lay, and espccially those of
Ambassadors, he went directly to the place, where he was attended for by the order
of the Tesqueregibassi, who when he gave the Ambassador his dispatch, had ordained him to be as soon as it was night at the Key, there to receive the two slaves
of whom he had been spoken unto him at such time as he had audience from his
Highness: According hereunto, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> (whom we will hereafter call <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>) after he had overtaken the slave of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, found out the Ambassador, who waiting for him, received him and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> with transports of joy that cannot be exprest; he could not comprehend how two men, who were beleeved to be dead so long before, should be met withall at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>: But if his joy were excessive, that of our two friends was not less, for they knew him exceeding well, as being of the Illustrious family of the <hi rend="italic">Lomelines</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> thought then that he began already to breath the air of his country; but the place being nothing commodious to complement in, they embarqued themselves, and a little after, when the Moon was up they weighed Anchor, and hoisting up their sayls, they made towards the West, with so favourable a wind as the Art of the Pilot was almost unprofitable in this encounter. This prosperous beginning of Navigation made the Mariners to shout for joy, and gave them hope, that they should see the coast of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> ere it were long. But amidst the common gladness, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> could not forget that he went from <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> without quitting it utterly, and that by an invisible chain, which retained him there, he was to return unto it a slave from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; this troublesome thought for all that lasted not long, and his imaginations flattered him so sweetly, in making him see that he was every minute drawing near unto the Princess, as losing the sight of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, he also lost the remembrance of all his misfortunes, and abandoned himself wholly to joy.</p>

<p>NEver was voyage more prosperous, than that of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, <sic>ne- never</sic> did the winds more justly second the desires of the Pilot,
and never was the Sea more constant in calmness of weather,
than it was in bringing this Lover back again to the Haven,
from whence the tempest had driven him. But to favour the
impatience he was in to be with <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, let us only say, without particularizing his course, that after he was come to all the
Vessells, which the Grand Signior had caused to be arrested,
and drawn out of <sic>captiviy</sic> all the Christian Slaves which were found in the severall Ports where they touched, by vertue of an absolute power that he had from
the Sultan; after, I say, that he had passed the Archipelago, and left <hi rend="italic">Ciprus</hi> on the
left hand, this prosperous Fleet arrived in a few dayes within sight of the Land of
<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>: There it was where the Ambassador began to reap the fruit of his voyage,
by the pleasure he took in thinking that he was going to enter into his City, as it
were in triumph, by bringing thither again those so many Vessels which restored to
the People their kindred and friends, to the Nobility their children and their
riches, and to the Senate the Grace ofthe Grand Signior, and the lives of two Illustrious Citizens.  As for <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, he felt that motion in his soul, which Nature
gives to all those who see their Country again after a long exile, and that not troubled by the unruliness of passions following without resistance the thoughts wherewith she inspires them; he had then an extreme pleasure, but yet it was a quiet
pleasure. But for <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, it was not so with him, he did not look upon this
Land as the place of his birth, but as the residence of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and in an instant
he passed over again in his memory all that had arrived unto him there; and his
transport was so great, that joy produced some effects of grief in him; he changed colour divers times, he was unquiet and musing, and if <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had not forced
him to speak, and express his minde by his discourse, it was to be doubted in beholding him, whether it were hope, or whether it were fear, that agitated his
soul; whether he regretted <hi rend="italic">Constaninople</hi>, or desired <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>; so certain it is that
violent passions pervert the use of the senses. Tears, which ought not to be but
the marks of sorrow, serve sometimes for joy; and silence, which seems so proper
for sadness, is often the effect of an extreme pleasure; but as we come to one and
the same place by divers wayes, they were made contented by different causes,
and expressed their joy in severall manners. In the mean time they came still
neerer to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, but not holding it fit that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> should enter into

the City before the deliberation of the Senate was known, the Ambassador caused
his Vessell to cast anchor three miles from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, and going to pass into another,
after he had assured them that he would obtain their liberty, or be exiled with
them, he observed that <hi rend="italic">Alphonso Spinola</hi>, Captain of one of those redeemed Vessels, and brother to him whom <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had slain in defending <hi rend="italic">Rhodolpho</hi>, hung
back, and would not follow him, whereupon he would needs know the cause of it;
but <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>, whose generosity was extreme, seeing himself obliged for his life, and
for his liberty to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who during the voyage had testified unto him with
much resentment the grief he had had for the misfortune wherein he had been
ingaged; and knowing likewise that the death of his brother had hapned with
some justice, he besought the Ambassador not to think it strange if he did not attend upon him to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, being absolutely resolved never to enter into it without
his Deliverer; that knowing his Father, as he did, he was well assured that he
would with all his power oppose them that would revoke the Sentence which had
been given against <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; so that to hinder his violence, he purposed to write
unto him, that is he would have his sonne again, he must pardon his enemy; that
his fortune was conjoyned with his, and that he would never have such a reproach
laid upon him, as that a man, who had drawn him out of fetters, and brought
him back into his Countrey, should not injoy the liberty which he had given him.
<hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> pronounced this speech with so much earnestness, as all that heard him
were ravished with his resolution; and <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was so charmed therewith, that
not able to forbear imbracing him, and not suffering him to say more, he conjured
him that he would not force him to be ingratefull; that is nothing but his blood
would satisfie the revenge of his kindred, he would be most ready to shed it for his
sake, but having some hope to serve them more profitably in his person, when occasion should present it self, he would spare no care nor good office for it, so as it
might be done without offence to his honor; that he had performed a gallant action in desiring to stay with him, but that he should do an unworthy one, and full
of inhumanity if he should consent unto it; and that therefore it was more just,
that he should go and dry up his fathers tears, and moderate his fury by the joy
which his light would bring him, than to do a thing that would procure him his
hatred. <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> did not yeeld at first to the desire of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, but the Ambassador and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> siding with him, he was constrained to submit to their sense, and to let
his inclination be overcome by anothers reason. These illustrious friends parted
with so much adoe, as if <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had not perceived by <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> watch, that the
time of the Senates Assembly pressed the Ambassador to depart, is he would have
audience as soon as he should arrive, they would have spent a great part of the day
in this noble contestation, whereof all the glory consisted in obliging his enemy.
But whilst this Fleet reasumed their course to aboard <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, let us go to the Port,
and see what the people think of it, and whether this agreeable surprize will make
them send forth shouts of joy in answer to those of the Mariners. As soon as these Vessells began to appear, a confused noise was heard amongst those that were present on the shore, whereby it appeared that they expected not so happy a success of their Ambassadors voyage; the one said that the Senate was to be advertised of it; others, that Merchants Vessells came not in so great a number together; some, that Pirats durst not approch in that manner if they were not followed by the body of an Army; and all of them together, that the best was to give intelligence thereof, to the end some might be sent to discover them; there were those likewise whose imagination was so troubled with fear, as they verily believed that they distinctly saw Turkish Galleys, and half Moons. In the mean time, whereas the Fleet came still neerer, they might easily discern, that it was the Standard of the Republique which these Vessells carried, the sight whereof dissipated their fear, but it took not from them their amazement, being not able to imagine how they should be so neer unto them, whom they believed ot be in chains and slavery; but at length the first of these Vessells being come to the shore, and the Ambassador, who was seen on the poop, being known of the people, which were already ga-

<pb n="70" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="70     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

thered together in a very great number, and they no longer doubting but that
these vessells, which now they knew, brought them back both their brethren, and
their children, such a noise of acclamations arose on the suddain, as they all spake
without understanding what they said themselves, and without being understood
of others; wives called for their husbands; fathers inquired after their children;
some ran into the City to advertise their friends of it; others ran out of it with
their whole families; they in the Vessells cryed to let them know whether all were
well at home; at last so great a noise was formed of all these cries and murmures,
as the Ambassador had much adoe to make his orders be understood: He commanded all the Chieftaines to Accompany him to the Palace, and particularly <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> not to be far from him; they traversed the City in this sort, followed by the popular multitude, who ceased not from testisying their joy, both by their teares,
and by their acclamation. When they were at the Gate of the Palace, the Ambassador advanced three or four steps before his Troop, that he might the better surprise that honorable Company. At his first appearing they sought to know the success of his voyage in his face, but as soon as they perceived all the Commanders of
their Vessells, the gravest and most moderate amongst them could not chuse but
shew signes oftheir amazement, and joy; and when this first emotion was appeased, the Ambassador, having made a low obeisance to the Duke, and the like to the
whole assembly, began to speak in this sort.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Oration of</hi> Antonio Lomelino <hi rend="italic">to the Duke and
Senate of</hi> Genoua.
</p>
<p>IF the prosperous succcss of my voyage had been an effect of my conduct, of my
care, and of my address, I should without doubt have had so much modesty
as to declare in few words the estate of things, for to attend from so honorable
an Assembly the praise which a service of such importance would have deserved,
without giving them to my self; and I should also have been so generous, as to
have been fully satisfied with the onely thought of having been profitable to my
Country; but whereas I have no part in the glory of this action, but contrarily I
my self am obliged for my life to the Deliverer of so many illustrious Slaves as
I have brought you back, and which are all, either your kinsmen, or your
friends, it behoves me, both that I may not be ingratefull in my particular, and
that also I may keep you from being so in generall, to report fathfully unto
you how the matter hath past, to the end that by understanding all the circumstances you may the better know, how it is the interest ofthe Republique, which
makes me speak with so much earnestness.
</p>
<p>You are to understand then, my Lords, that whereas the Emperor <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> believed, that the Law of Nations had been violated in the person of his Chaoux, he
thought that he might doe the like in that of your Ambassador, so that as soon as
I was arrived at <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>, and that according to the custom I had demanded audience
of his Highness, I saw my self constrained to pass by his order from my Vessell into
a streight prison, without telling me the cause therof, in such sort as he that came
to obtain the liberty of others, saw himself deprived of his own, and laden with
chaines. I was two dayes intreated in this manner with a great deal of rigor, and
I very well perceived by the countenance of them which guarded me, that they
believed my head was the onely price of my liberty. As I was in this unquietness I
saw the Aga of the Janizaries enter, who caused me to be told by Dragoman ofthe
grand Signioes, whom we call an interpreter, that his Highness willing to give me
audience had commanded him to conduct me to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> without any ceremony; this mutation surprised me somuch the more, for that I could not imagine the
cause of it, having been well enough informed, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> doth not easily change
his resolutions, and that repenting is a motion of the soul which is almost unknown to him: In the meantime I beheld my fetters broken off, without seeing

<milestone n="71     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 3." ed="1652"/>

the hand that delivered me, and in this uncertainty I attributed that to the inconstancy of Fortune, which I owed her not at all. But, my Lords, why should I longer conceal this mighty and generous hand which hath delivered me? The impatience which I see in your looks, to know the name of our Deliverer, invites that 
also which is in me to tell it you; wherefore I must interrupt my order, and without going to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> to paint forth unto you the resentment,the choler &amp; the
menaces of the Sultan, I say unto you, that he unto whom you ow the return of
your vessell, the lives of your children, and the peace of this Republick, was not
carried to this brave action by a sense of <sic>acknowledment</sic>; it is a man who could
have revenged himself, instead of serving you, without committing an injustice;
it is a man whom you have exiled because he withstood a violence; it is a man
whom you have chased away because he had been so generous as to save his enemies life; it is a man whom you have banished because he shed his blood to take
part with the vveaker, and vvho by misfortune killed one of your Citizens, not
only to secure his ovvn person, but to assist an undefended man; finally, my Lords,
it is by <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> that vve are living; it is by him that vve breath the air of our
Countrey; it is by him that vve do not see an Army of an hundred thousand men
at your Gates; and it is also by his liberty, and that of <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, vvho is conjoyned
to his fortune, that you may pay our ransome, as the only price which great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> hath set to redeem us: It is in preserving this illustrious person that you may
preserve the glory of the Senate; and it is upon this condition, that according to
the power which I had for it, I have ingaged the Publique Faith for the revocation of a Sentence which you signed with regret, and which you accorded rather
to the tears of <hi rend="italic">Philippo Spinola</hi>, whom I see here in this renowned Company, than
to Soveraign equity: It is not because I will condemn in him the apprehensions
of Nature, but contrarily I purpose to stir them up in his heart, by letting
him see that if by misfortune <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> hath deprived him of one sonne, the same
<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> hath restored him another, in bringing him back <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>, who
with tears in his eyes begs of him by my mouth the grace of his Deliverer.
They which are sensible of outrages ought to be so likewise of benefits, especially
when injuries have not been done by a premeditated malice, and the services are voluntary: one may tell me peradventure, that the satisfaction should at leastwife be
equall to the crime, for the defacing of it out of an incensed spirit, and that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> having taken away the life of a child of <hi rend="italic">Philippoes</hi>, it is not enough for obtaining the pardon thereof, that he hath restored his only sonne to his liberty; but
grant it were true, that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had done no other thing that break the chains of <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>, this objection could not be received but by base and weak fouls; it being most certain, that a generous man will always prefer the conservation of his liberty before that of his life: It is a good so generally known of all the world, as there is no Nation that hath not made war to conserve it. The most honourable
Servitude hath ever found some rebellion in the minds of those who have imbraced it; and if the Religion which we profess, did not prohibit us, from disposing of our selves, there is not a Slave amongst the Turks that would not make himself away with joy, to get out of the miseries which he indures; for if one hath seen at other times both men and women to have recourse to this extreme remedy, because they were for one day only to follow the Chariot of the Victorious, bound with chains of gold, what ought not men do, who laden with irons are sent to the prisons of the black Sea, where it may be said that they enter alive into their graves, being put into deep holes where horror and darkness, which always reign there, are the least of their pains? They feel the rigor of hunger, they are beaten and tormented in their bodies, yea and persecuted in their minds by the injuries and blasphemies which they daily hear from the mouths of their torturers: It is, my Lords, from this dreadfull place that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> hath drawn out <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> to bring him back into his Countrey, for to speak the truth, he could not avoyd the feeling of the miseries which I have represented unto you, or of dying cruelly; his Sentence was pronounced, as well as of that of his companions, and if we had

tarried but one day longer before we arrived at the place, where he was retained,
<hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> Order had come too late to work that which he had formerly given, and
the succour of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had been in vain; Now I leave it to be judged, whether
the reparation be equall to the crime, and whether <hi rend="italic">Philippo</hi> hath reason to oppose
the return of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>. But not to conceal one important thing that may lead
him to a good sense, I must say further, that <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>, who cannot be worthily enough praised, and whose presence keeps me from speaking more of it, knowing
how far he is obliged to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, is absolutely resolved to follow the fortune of
his Deliverer; it is by his order that I speak, and his silence doth sufficiently prove
this verity unto you; it is not but to confirm what I say that he is come hither, &amp; to
obey<hi rend="italic"> Justiniano</hi>, who would not let him stay with him as he desired. At last, my Lords,
is <hi rend="italic">Philippo</hi> will preserve his son he must joyn his prayers to those of all the people,
who conjure you to accord the grace of him who hath filled your City with abundance, &amp; all the families of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> with joy; all the acclamations of gladness, which
you hear at the Palace gate, speak to you for pardon and mercy; but if you oppose the
severity of the Laws to prayers so just, so pressing, and necessary for the publick tranquility, I have to answer you, that it is not to offend them, but to satisfie justice,
which ought to be the rule of them; and that the same Lawes, which will have
a crime punished, will also have vertue recompenced. Is there be need of examples of Sentences that have been revoked, all antiquity will furnish us therewith:
<hi rend="italic">Aristides</hi> was banished by the Ostracisme, and repealed within three yeares after;
<hi rend="italic">Cimon</hi> was exiled from <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi>, and intreated to return, even by those that
had driven him away; at <hi rend="italic">Sparta</hi> one <hi rend="italic">Leontidas</hi> was used in the same manner; amongst the <hi rend="italic">Lacedemonians</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Philoxenus</hi> had the same fortune; and if we will go to
<hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, we shall find, that <hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi> was banished by <hi rend="italic">Claudius</hi>, and called home again by
him for some praises which he had given him in a letter of consolation, that he
wrote to <hi rend="italic">Polibius</hi> his favorite; judge now my Lords, whether flattery spoken
with a good grace may enter into comparison with the service that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> hath
rendred you. But to pass from antiquity to the modern age, have we not
seen amongst the Venetians <hi rend="italic">Hortensio Contarini</hi> condemned to a perpetual banishment, who returned into his Country a little after with the same honors which
he formely had there? And without going to seek for authorities amongst our
neighbors, which we may find amongst our selves, hath not one seen<hi rend="italic"> Antonia Fregoza</hi> exiled for ever from his Country, who nevertheless was by a decree from the
Senate restored to his former liberty in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>? I could also find many other
particulars in History to confirm my proposition, but I think it may suffice, that
<hi rend="italic">Greece</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> have marked you out the way, which you may follow without
fear of sailing, after so many Illustrious examples. Howbeit you will peradventure
say, that albeit you could infringe your Lawes in favor of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, because  he
hrth done you such great services, yet <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> cannot pretend to the same grace, seeing he himself oweth his liberty to our Deliverer; but I am to answer you for the
glory of this disinteressed friend, who hazarded his life, by a generosity without
example, to revenge the outrage which the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi> did to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>,
that this action scemed so gallant to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, when as <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> recounted it unto
him that he hath judged <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> worthy of his protestion: Besides do you not imagine that the interests of these two illustrious persons can ever be separated. And
to tell you all that I think in this incounter, prepare your selves to execute what
I have promised, or resolve to lose at the same instant all the commanders of your
Vessells, who have every one, as vvell as my self, solemnly sworn never to enjoy
the liberty vvhich <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> hath gotten us, unless he be partaker of it vvith us.
As for me, vvho doe certainly knovv of vvhat importance this affair is for the publique good, I should think that I should betray my Country, is I should conceal the
eagernes vvhich I observed in the mind of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, when as he told me that one of
his slaves having found grace in his fight, had besought him to pardon us; and that
he had consented thereunto, provided that you should revoke the Sentences, which
you had given against <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>; wherein isfyou failed, he swore in fury,



<pb n="73" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="73     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 4." ed="1652"/>

that he would come with all the forces of his Empire to destroy our Republique. It is no longer then, my Lords, a partiuclar interest; it is no longer the merit of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, htat is to be considered in this occasion; it is not for the hope of brave things that he will do hereafter, that this grace is to be accorded him; it is not for our ransom that he is to be received with joy; it is not because I have promised it that it is to be resolved on; it is not because reason doth counsell it; it is not because justice doth ordain it; but it is because necessity will have it so. You will say to me, it may be, that the success of this War would still be doubtfull, but, my Lords, if you consider the inequality of your forces you will not doubt at all, especially in a time wherein all the Princes of Christendom are not in a condition to assist their Allies. Shall it be from the Emperor that you will be protected in this occasion, who finds himself too much intangled in the War with the Protestants, and in the affaires of the Councell of <hi rend="italic">Trent</hi>, for to think of yours? Shall it be from the Kingdomes of <hi rend="italic">Naples</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sicily</hi> that you look for succor, that they are exhausted both of men and money for the Emperor their Master? Shall it be from the <hi rend="italic">Switzers</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Grisons</hi>, that we shall be assisted in this incounter, they that are ingaged in all these Warres,   
and that are more likely rather to side with the
stronger party, than to succor the weaker? It may be that the French will furnish
us with that vvhich we cannot find elsewhere, but, my Lords, were they not in War
with the emperor, yet would they see us perish with joy, and the Armies of the
Turks could not doe that amongst us, which they would not do here with theirs, if
they were in an estate to be revenged on us for our changing. You will tell me further, that the Republiques of <hi rend="italic">Florence, Siena</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lucca</hi> are not so far of,
but that one
may be succoured from them, but they are so ingaged in those two parties, as they
have not the liberty to dispose of their forces. The Duke of <hi rend="italic">Savoy</hi> might also do
something for you if he were peaceable in his State, but he himself is so busied
in preparing to hinder the passage of the French, as he cannot minde the extremities of his neighbors. I know very well in like manner, that <hi rend="italic">England</hi> is full of
armed men, but, my Lords, it is not to defend us, nor will Queen <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi> abandon
the siege of London, which is to put her in pofsession of her Kingdom, to come
and oppose our enmiies. Neither will <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi> disfurnish her self of her men
<sic>or</sic> War, having such mighty Armies at her frontires, wherefore we are not to turn
our eyes that way. <hi rend="italic">Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Moscovy</hi>, are too near unto the Turk for
to imbroil themselves with him. And <hi rend="italic">Sweathland</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Denmark</hi> are too far off for
any succor to be hoped from thence. At last, my Lords, to leave nothing unsaid,
the death of <hi rend="italic">Julius</hi> the third, and of his successor, salling out in so little a time,
permit not his Holiness, who is not yet well established, to think of affaires abroad.
And to take all hope from you, the <hi rend="italic">Venetians</hi>, desiring to conserve that which they
hold in the Archipelaglo, will not break the Treaty they have made with the Turk
to succor you. You see then, my Lords, that all Christendom doth abandon you,
and that there is nothing <unclear>resting</unclear> in <sic>you</sic> choice, but the burning of your City, and
the utter destruction of this State, or the return of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>. But to
justifie the ardor of my Zeal, and to mak it appear, that my fear is not without
ground, I do here deliver into your hands the Grand Signiors letter, which it may
be will carry you more easily to my sense, and reason.
</p>
<p>This oration was heard by the Senate with a great deal of attention, amazement and joy; and when the Duke had taken the Grand Signiors letter, he commanded an interpreter to come and expound it; in the mean time a confused voice
arose in this Assembly, which made <hi rend="italic">Philippo Spinola</hi> conjecture, that the grace of
<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> would soon be granted: Never was there heart agitated with so much
violence, and whereas this man was sensible and generous, the designes of pardoning or punishing so equally divided his soul, as not knowing vvhich side to turn him
to, hee seemed to seek for in the eyes of <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> vvherevvith to fortifie his reason.
He vvept all at one instant both for grief and tenderness, the remembrance of the dead, and the return of the living, excited in his mind, both a calm and a tempest, and in this disorder of passions, and apprehensions of nature, vvhich combatted

one with another, and successively destroyed themselves, he was going to be the
prey of despair and sorrow, had not the sight of his Sonne been at length found
more powerfull, than the image of his past misfortune: He knew so distinctly the
sense of <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> by the motions ofhis face, as being ashamed to be less generous
than he, he let his resentment be surmounted by so noble an example, which presently appeased all the troubles of his spirit; so that feeling himself in a more
peaceable estate, and seeing the Duke about to speak, he to prevent him besought
him with teares in his eyes to restore that unto <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, which his prosecutions
had taken from him; it being just, since he had rendred him a sonne, that he should
render him his liberty. This discourse so ravished the whole Assembly,that contrary to their custom, and the respest of the place, they sent forth cries of joy,
which did not cease very soon; but amongst the rest the young Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi>,
together with <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>, who were present, thought they should never have been
silent again; the first could not sufficiently commend this action, and the other
could not forbear saying, that he was more obliged to his father for vanquishing
himself, than forgiving him life. But after every one had praised <hi rend="italic">Philippo</hi> as
much as he deserved, they betook them to their places and gravitie again, for to
hearken to the Letter, which the Interpreter expounded in this sort by the <sic>commaandment</sic> ofthe Duke.

<p>This Letter inspired all them that heard it with fear, justified the Ambassadors
zeal and confirmed all the Assembly in the resolution to receive <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, as the
Deliverer of the Republique; so that when the Duke had propounded the matter,
and that according to the custom he should have gone to collect the voyces in particular they sayd all, that in affairs where opinions might be divided, it was
good to hold that course, but now, that the whole company had but one and the
same voyce they were not to amuse themselves about this superfluous ceremony;
it being fitter to go with all speed, and assure <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, that they were
still Citizens of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, for fear left they should by this retardment imagine, that
they had been hardly drawn to sign their grace. They advised then what order



<pb n="75" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="75     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 4." ed="1652"/>

they were to hold, and they judged, that to take away all suspition from <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, they were to send him a publique Act, signed by the Duke and all the Senate, whereby he should be assured of the recovation of his sentence: but the Ambassafor having told them, that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> would rely on his word, they changed their purpose, and commanded <hi rend="italic">Jannetin Doria</hi> to take a Galley in the Port, for to go and receive him as far from the Citty as possibly he could: They ordained also that the Ambassador should put himself in a Feluca, to the end he might go before, and advertise <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> that he was attended with impatience, and should be received with joy. And whereas it was resolved that some should accompany <hi rend="italic">Jannetin</hi> who represented <hi rend="italic">Andrea Doria</hi> his Uncle, that was Generalissimo, and absent from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> at that time, the Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi> would be one of them, that he might renew his acquaintance, for he was not much more then a child when <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> went away. The Commanders of those vesself whom he had redeemed, would
not go home to their houses before they had conducted their Deliverer into their
Citty, to the end that as in the antient Triumphs, the Victorious were followed by
the Princes whom they had vanquished, so <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> should be accompanied with
the Citizens which he had delivered, but with this glorious difference, that the one
touched them with compassion which looked on them, and that the others inspired
all them that beheld them with joy, the former were freemen that were made slaves,
and these were slaves to whom liberty was given: And if heretofore at <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> he was
crowned with glory that saved the life of a <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Citizen, what crown, and what
glory was not<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> worthy of, who by his generosity hindred not onley the
death of so great a number of men, but the utter destruction of his country?  And
indeed he was received with so many acclamations, as never was so universall a joy
seen in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> before.  This while the Ambassador being set forth in a Feluca with
<hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> and some others, and having a good way out-gone <hi rend="italic"><sic>Jnnetins</sic></hi> Galley, made
with all speed to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who since they parted from him had scarcely spoken
to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, so much was he taken up with the thought of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. As soon as they
were near enough to be understood, they began to talk to him of triumph and
glory, not having the patience to stay till they were aboord the vessell to let him
know the happy success of their voyage. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> answered this interrupted discourse
with cryes of joy; but <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> made it appear by the moderation of his, that
his liberty was not the term of his desires; he received his friends for all that with
a great deal of civility, and without attending their further relation, he would
have rendred them thanks for their care and affection, but they had too much to
say to permit him to speak. The Ambassador would have discharged the Senates
Commission; <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> would have acquanted him with the generosity of his father; another would have described unto him the extasie of the people; and mauger the coldness of the Nation, the impatience they were in to speak all together,
made a confusion amongst them, which yet kept not <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> from clearly perceiving, that his generosity was acknowledged, and his grace signed. But whereas the Galley still approached, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> sayd, that it was not just they should stay
from going to meet those Illustrious friends, who came to restore him to life, in
restoring him to his liberty: He commanded them to weigh Anchor, which being
presently executed, they made towards the Galley, that, carryed along with sayls
and oares, reached them in a little space.  There it was where <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> felt an extraordinary emotion upon the sight of the young Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi>, whom the
Ambassador shewed unto him; he whose father had alwaies been the protector of
his house:  This sight gave him a great deal of joy, but mingled with grief, by
the remembrance of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldoes</hi> death:  Now as soon as his vessell came close to
the Galley, he instantly, without attending <hi rend="italic">Jannetins</hi> order, leaped form the hatches into her, and after he had complemented with the Delegates of the Senate, he embraced the Count with so much testimony of affection, as it was easie to know, that absence destroyes not a friendship, which is solidly established in a generous soul; for at the very time when he rejoyced to see him, he lamented his fathers death. The Count on his part assured him that he would have the same respect


<pb n="76" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="76     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

for him as <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo </hi>had had; and conjured him to shew him the same favour. On
the other side <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, though he were not well satished with <hi rend="italic">Andrea</hi> Prince of <hi rend="italic">Melphi</hi>, nor with <hi rend="italic">Jannetin</hi> his Nephew, yet carryed he himself curteously unto him,
and then went and received the civilities of his friends. During all these caresses,
<hi rend="italic">Jannetin</hi> desiring to give some mark of esteem and joy to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, caused a largess to be distributed amongst the slaves, to the end they might row with the more
speed. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> received this gallantry very civilly, and withall assured the
slaves, that when he came home he would remember that they had brought him to
the Port, as accordingly he sent them the next day two thousand Crowns. As
soon as they approached to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, all the vessels that were in the Port, having
received a commandment to shoot off all their Cannon when <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> should appear, failed not to salute him; the Galley answered them with four peeces of
Ordnance, and a volley of Musket-shot, and the like did all that were on the
walls. If one would describe the number of Citizens that were at the Port, the
acclamations of joy, the thronging that was there to see these resuscitatcd men,
the tumult that was amongst them in striving who should come nearest to their
Deliverer, it would almost take up a volume that should treat of nothing else; it
were better then, that amidst this popular crowd we should conduct <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> to
the Senate, followed by the Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna, Jannetin, Doria, Alphonso,</hi> and all
the Commanders of the vessels, as also the slave of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, whom <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had
enjoyned not to budge from him.  When first they appeared, the Duke out of more
than an extraordinary favour advanced to receive him, after which he appointed
all the Senators to take their places, and then commanded the Register of the Senate to deface the Sentences which had been pronounced against <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and to read the abolition of them, which was conceived in such gentle and
advantageous terms, as it plainly appeared, that even their crime deserved more
glory than punishment: The reading whereof being ended, the Duke began to assure <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> in the name of the whole Assembly, that after they had satisfied the
pleasure of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, yet held they not themselves for all that acquitted towards
him; that the Senate in generall, and they all in particular, were resolved not to
stay there, but to testifie unto him with more utility,  that they were not worthy of the benefits they had received from him; that they desired him also to raze
out of his memory, as he was razed out of their Records, the remembrance of
the sentences which had been given against him and his friend. To this <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>
answered, that in banishing him they had satisfied Justice, and that in repealing
him they had rather shewed their clemency than their equity; that the service
which he had rendered to the Republique, was not considerable, seeing he had
done it but to satisfie his duty; and that also, in acknowledgement of the grace it
had done him, he swore solemnly alwaies to hazard both his fortune and life for
the interest and glory thereof, so often as occasion should present it self for it:
This sayd, he turned him to <hi rend="italic">Philippo Spinola</hi> and intreated him to pardon <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> for his friendship towards him, and to beleeve that it could never have
found place in his heart, had he not perfectly known during his voyage, that the
death of his brother had made him shed more tears, than he had lost bloud; that if
his generosity would permit him utterly to deface out of his mind the resentment
of that unlucky accident; he besought him to adopt him for his sonne, and to attend from him the same services, and the same obedience, as he could have desired
from him of whom he was so unfortunately deprived; but is that contrarily
the apprehensions of Nature did still invite him to revenge, he promised to banish
himself voluntarily; and if that were not yet enough, he would submit to the
greatest rigor of Justice.  <hi rend="italic">Philippo</hi> was so moved with this discourse, as is he had
not already signed ihe grace of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> in consideration of his son, he could not
have forborn doing it, and embracing him; so true it is that vertue hath powerfull
charmes for a generous soul. That venerable old man answered him with teares in
his eyes, that he would never oppose <hi rend="italic">Alphonsoes</hi> friendship to him<unclear>;</unclear> that it was too just to be condemned; that owing him his life, and his liberty, he owed him all
 things; &#x0026; that not being so unreasonable as to remember an injury, &amp; not remember



<pb n="77" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="77     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 4." ed="1652"/>

benefits, he assured him that these last should take from his minde all the bitterness of the other; that he would receive him: for his sonne; that he would have all the tenderness of a Father for him; and that all the satisfaction he desired of him was, that he would forget his prosecutions, and his hatred, and pardon them to an afflicted Father. There past besides so many obliging speeches between them, as all that were present had much adoe to retain their teares; but at the last the Duke arising, all the Assembly did the like: Then it was that they imbraced <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, every one striving who should come soonest unto him to testifie his joy; after which the Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi> carried him home to his house, there to abide till his own was made ready to receive him, for he had been Administrator of it ever since the death of <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi>, unto whom the Father of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had left his
estate to conserve it for his sonne; and though all the world beleeved that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was no longer alive, yet had not the Count changed the order of his affairs, being absolutely resolved not to confer his estate upon his heirs, before he vvas certainly assured that he was dead. As for <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, theCount could not get him to go
along with him, though he would have been glad to have past the rest of the day
in the company of his friend, but his kinsmen carried him much against his will
away with them, having first conducted <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> as well as all the rest, to the
Counts Palace, where every one departing, except some few whom he retained at
dinner with <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, he led him to the chamber of <hi rend="italic">Leonora</hi> his wife, who received him with a great deal of curtesie, and so did <hi rend="italic">Sophronia, Leonoraes</hi> sister, which
was there with her. But as soon as civility permitted him to retire, he turned
all his thoughts to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; and vvhereas he saw that the neccssity of good manners
would hold him three or four days at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> to receive and to return the visits of
his friends, he resolved to send thither the same day, the rather for that he judged
it fit to understand the Princesses pleasure before he went to her; he proposed his
design then unto the Count, and desired him to let him have one of his servants
for to execute it, and to put into his hands the Princesses Officer, whom he had found
a slave at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. The Count could not refuse him so just a request, but only told him that he vvas to dine first; Whilst they vvere at table their conversation
vvas no other than asking <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> questions concerning his fortune, vvhereunto
he still ansvvered vvith so much address, as without saying any thing against the
truth, he discovered nought that might prejudice him; hovvbeit he recounted unto them his grief and despair, vvhenas he believed in <hi rend="italic">Germany</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had
maried the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, as also that having taken a resolution to die , he
vvent and irabarqued himself upon the Baltique Sea; that there he was made a slave
was carried to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>,and given to the Grand Signior, vvhere <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> arrived afterwards by an adventure almost like to his; that his good fortune had so
vvrought, as his Highness having found something in his person, which touched
his inclination, his slavery had not been very hard, is his Friends, his Mistress
and his Religion had not been obstacles to his felicity ; but he would not let them
know that he had been Grand Visier, nor how in that Charge he had mightily served Christendom, for fear lest this action should have been ill interpreted by them,
that could not dive into the bottom of his heart. Dinner being done, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>
desired the Count to permit him to go and write in his Cabinet before he was
hindered by company, which no doubt would be with him ere it were long. The
Count, who was not willing that his own pleasure should destroy that of his
friend, opened him the door, and told him, that he was insinitely obliged to the
Princess of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, who, ever after she had power to dispose of her self, had been
sought unto by all the Princes of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, without so much as once harkning unto
them; but that contrarily she had openly published, how she had resolved to renounce
the world as soon as she certainly knew that he was no longer in it; that
she had often had business at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where her presence was necessary, but would never come thither, so much did she fear the sight of them that might condemn her resolution. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was so ravished with the constancy of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, that if the Count had not left him for to return unto the company, this talk had kept

him a long time from drawing up his Letter; but in the end after he had written
all that which his respect, his joy, and his passion had inspired him with, he gave
his packet to a Gentleman, whom the Count had assigned him for it; he prayed
him to go, and come again from <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, with all the speed that possibly he could;
and to add moreover to that favour the observing the actions of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> at such
time as she should understand of his return, and that she should see him, whom
he had sent her back; that Officer of hers too he caressed exceedingly, and assured him that he would acknowledge the pains which he had suffered for his consideration. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had no sooner ended his dispatch, but that all the illustrious persons of the City came to visit him, with an extreme impatience to learn
from his own mouth the success of his adventures. But whilst he is satisfying the
curiosity of so fair an Assembly, and telling them things which vve knovv as <sic>vell</sic>
as he, let us go and content ours at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and see with what eye, and in what
manner the Princess will receive the agreeable newes of her Lovers return. When
these happy Messengers arrived the next day at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> it was very neer night so
that although one of them belonged tp the Princess, yet was he not knovvn, nor
vvould he discover himself, the better to surprize her:  It vvas only told then to
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, that a Gentleman from the Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi>, and another, vvho vvere
nevvly arrived in a Barque, desired to speak vvith her, and that they had order to
deliver their message to none but her self. She vvas at that time in her Cabinet
where she had shut up her self that day to read over all the Letters vvhich she had
received from <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; she vvas vexed then to be interrupted in an imployment,
that made up together both her joy and her grief; she commanded notvvithstan¬
ding that they should be brought in: But vvhen she came to knovv him, vvhom she
had sent to seek <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustiniano</sic></hi>, she vvas so surprized, and so amazed, out of the opinion
she had that his voyage was in vain, as the apprehension thereof keeping her from
speaking, gave the Counts Gentleman opportunity to tell her, that <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustiniano</sic></hi> had
given him in charge to present her with a Letter from him. This discourse revived her spirits for a vvhile, but fearing she had not understood him vvell, she made
that agreeable name vvhich touched her heart so sensibly, to be spoken to her once
again; vvhereupon the Gentleman told her, that the paper he had presented to her
vvould satishe her better than he could. She cast her eyes then upon the Letter,
vvhich assured her that it vvas <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustinianoes</sic></hi> hand, so that in an instant she abandoned her self over vvholy to joy, and vvith an extreme precipitation broke up the
seal of the Letter for to read that vvhich follovvs here.</p>

<p>Never was their heart more replinished with joy, than that of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, after she had read this Letter; nor never had an amorous spirit sweeter transports, than this Princess felt in thus understanding all at once the life, the return, and the fidelity of her Lover: But her satisfaction augmented yet more, when as she knew in what manner he had been received at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, no way doubting now but that her felicity was setled for the rest of her life. After she had spent two hours at least in hearing these persons relate unto her what they had known concerning <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, she gave order that they should be very well treated, and that the next morning the Counts Gentleman should repair unto her. As soon as she saw her self alone, she called a kinswoman of hers, which lived with her, and not able to contain her joy, she imparted the cause of it to her, but in such passionate terms, as it was easier to perceive, that she lived not so much in her self as in <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>: And that she might no longer deferr her answer unto him, she caused paper and ink to be brought her: but though she had a fertile wit, though she were accustomed to express her self very easily, and not to have any need to correct her first by her second thoughts, yet was it almost impossible for her to satisfie her self in this 
occasion: She could not conceive that the words of pleasure, of felicity, and joy, could
sufficiently express hers; that those of constancy and stedfastness were significant
enough; nor that those of passion, and love, were powerfull enough to paint forth
to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> that which she had in her soul: Howbeit in the end, after she had
blotted out lines, and torn whole Letters, she was constrained to be contented;
and whereas it was late, she got her to bed without eating anything, notwithstanding her womans perswasion to the contrary. She passed the night in such agreeable thoughts, as albeit sleep be a sweet and a mighty enemy, yet could it not
for all that surprise the fair eyes of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, so that as soon as the day appeared, her impatience caused her to command the fetching of the Counts Gentleman
unto her, hoping that the sooner he returned, the sooner she should see <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>;
and to oblige him to make hast, she sent him a Diamond worth five hundred
Crowns. This liberality failed not to make him diligent; hee came presently to the Princesses Chamber, both to render her thanks, and to receive
her commands: shee gave him her Letter, and desired him to present
her complements to the Count his Master, and to assure <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> that he was attended with a great deal of impatience. This Gentleman, according to <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> desire, made all the hast that possibly he could to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where being arrived
he found <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustiniano</sic></hi> ready to enter into his own house, accompanied with ten or
eleven of his friends, for the Count had been so carefull that no mark of his banishment should be remaining, as in two dayes it was thoroughly furnished. As
soon as he saw this Gentleman, he separated himself from the troup for to speak
with him, and receive <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> answer, which he took with such a panting of his
heart, as is he had doubted that it had not been favourable. In the mean time the
Count perceiving <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustinianoes</sic></hi> diforder, caused all the company to enter, by entering first himself, so that by this address he gave him means to steal aside to read in liberty the Princesses letter, which he opened with a great deal of respect, and found that it was thus.</p>

<p>They who know, by experience the effects of love, will easily imagine that
which the sight of this Letter wrought in the soul of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; he had for all that
a domestique enemy, which went alwaies traversing his pleasures, by putting
him in mind that he was yet a slave at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, though he appeared a freeman at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>. In the mean time the Count sent him word how he beleeved he
had forgotten, that he was in his own house, and that it was he which was to entertain and honour his friends there. This reproach of gallantry obliged him to
go in unto them, who all left him a little after, except <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, to give him liberty for
to think of his affairs; but whilst he was setling his house, the Count sent him all
the money which he had received of his estate in his absence, with order to his
Steward to render him an accompt of it. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was so amazed, both at his
own riches, and the generosity of his friend, as he had much ado to resolve to take
that which was his own; howbeit fearing to do an outrage to the Count, instead
of doing him a civility, he received his mony, but would not suffer the Steward
howsoever to particularise anything of his affairs; telling him only, that provided
he could assure him he gave him nothing of another bodies, it should suffice for the
making up of his accompt; that in the mean time to make some acknowledgment
for the care he had taken to enrich him, he gave him twelve thousand Crowns. This
man fearing a check from his Master, playd the <hi rend="italic">gene<unclear>r</unclear>oso</hi> as much as he could,and labored exceedingly not to accept of a thing which he earnestly desired: but at length
he must obey the pleasure of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who thinking of nothing but <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> gave
order for the making him clothes against the next day; and not to lose time, after
he had desired the Counts Officer to provide him attendants, to make up his Train
with all possible care and speed, he went forth with his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to render the
most important of his visits, to the end he might the day following satisfie his desires. They imployed all that day then in ceremonies; they were at the Palace to
do their duty to the Dukc; they were at <hi rend="italic">Andrea Doria</hi>'s to visit <hi rend="italic">Jannetin</hi>; they returned to the Count; and to be wanting in nothing <hi rend="italic">Iustiniano</hi> would goe home to
<hi rend="italic">Philippo Spinola</hi>, where he was received with so many testimonies of generosity,
both by the father and the sonne, as all his civility could not answer it. Evening bi-

ing come, he returned back with <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, where he found a man attending him from
the Generalissimo, who being come home had understood of his going to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>,
and therefore had sent to assure him, that the next morning he should have a Galley
waiting ready to carry him thither. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> accepted of this curtesie with a great
deal of respect, and prayed the man to let his Master know, that he would not part
away without thanking him for it: And whereas his amorous impatience made
him desire to be alone, that he might at the least think of the Princess, though he
could not yet see her, he was much surprised, and exceedingly vexed, to finde as
great a company in his chamber, as that which he had met with abroad; for although it was composed 
of none but his friends, yet would he fain have preferred solitude before their conversation; howbeit he must resolve to comply with them,
and hear a Serenado of Lutes and Voices which the Count gave him, upon remembring that he had heard say, how the first pashion of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had been by musick:
The Count also presented unto him a French Gentleman, whom he dearly loved,
and desired him to esteem of him for his sake, untill such time as he should make
himself worthy of it by the knowledge of his merit, which without doubt would
not be long first. This complement being finished, every one retired save <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>,
who would not abandon our Lover, untill he had restored him into the arms of
his Mistris. The night past away with a great deal of unquietness and impatience
for <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; but whatsoever resolution he had taken to be gone by the break of
day, he could not get out of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> before it was almost noon. In the end he imbarqued himself in the Galley which had been prepared for him, taking no more
with him than his dear <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and some of the Counts people for to serve him: He
had at that instant so extraordinary a joy out of the thought that the term of so
short a navigation should be the sight of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, as it reflected in his face, vvas seen
in his eyes, appeared in his discourse, shevved it self in all his actions; and one
would have thought, that he went out of slavery in going out of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, and that
<hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> was not only the place of his birth, but that he was attended there to be
declared the Conqueror of all Nations, to receive the honor of a Triumph, and to
mount into a Throne; that he was also expected by the Princess for to be crowned,
not by the hands of fortune, but by those of love. And whereas he had not so much
ambition, as desire to be beloved, the Empire of all the Earth could not have given
him a joy so sensible, as that of the heart of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. This Princess imagining rightly, that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> would not be long before he came to see her, had given order at
the Port, that as soon as a Galley should be discovered from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>-ward, she
should be advertised of it, being perswaded that they would not let <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> come
in a Feluca; so that when he appeared, notice was thereof given the Princess, and at
the same instant all the wall was set on fire with a valley of Musquet shot; all the
great Ordnance likewise was discharged, the dreadfull noise whereof could not
keep <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> from being pleasingly assured, that those flames were an effect of
them which love had kindled in the heart of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, who presently dispatched away the principall of her servants, and the most considerable of the Inhabitants of
<hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, to go to receive him, and present him with the keyes of the Town-Gates.
This obliging ceremony so mightily surprised <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, when it was done unto him, that he could hardly finde terms to express his resentment thereof, and the confusion whereinto his gallant and extraordinary a favour had put his spirit. He besought those that were sent from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to excuse him, if he did not accept of that which they offered him, since it would not be just, that he, who would hold himself too much honoured to be their Princesses subject, should do an act of their Soveraign; that for the incivility which he committed in refusing a thing that came from her, he conjured them to conduct him where she was, that he might give her thanks, and crave pardon of her both at once. They were a pretty while in their dispute of curtesie on either side; but at last <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> remained firm in his resolution. They began then to take that winding way which leads to the Town, and where all the souldiers of the Garrison vvere ranged into tvvo files for him to pass

<pb n="82" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="82     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

thorough the midst of them, and so he marched till he came to the Portall of the
Castle, where the Princess attended him.  When as first he appeared she advanced to receive him, so that to save her some stepps, and to follow his inclination,
he went as fast as possibly he could, and kissed her roab. It was at this instant
that those perfect Lovers felt that which cannot be exprest; and albeit they
had resolved on both parts to contain themselves, and had also prepared their
minds for the making of some complement to one another in this incounter,
their silence, and then their interrupted discourses, made it apparent to all
that beheld them, that excess of pleasure excited such a trouble in their soules,
as would not permit them to express all that they thought; but to conceal this
agreeable transport from the eyes of her subjects, the Princess caused <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustiniano</sic></hi> to enter, after she had saluted <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> with a <sic>gteat</sic> deal of civility: When
they were arrived at <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> chamber, all that had accompanied them were
obliged by respect to withdraw, two or three excepted, which remained to
entertain <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, whilst the Princess talked with <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>. Never were two
hearts replenished with so much joy; never had two spirits more charming
transports; and never did two amorous persons so perfectly express the motions of their soules by their onely lookes; they said both of them together,
and at one instant, that they had alwaies loved one onother; that they still
loved one another; and that they would love one another eternally: But after this dumb language had made all their apprehensions to pass from one heart
to another, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> began to render the Princess thanks for all her  goodness
towards him;  but she, not able to suffer the continuance of this discourse, conjured him to remember,  that their interests could not be separated, and that
owing him  all things it was unjust to thank her; especially having done nothing for him, than what she could not chuse but doe;  namely to weep for
his absence, to fear his changing, to apprehend his loss, and to renounce all
the pleasures of this life, since she could not have that of seeing him. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> answered thereunto, that this necessity, which she had imposed upon her
self, was so fair a mark of her affection, and so glorious for him, that unless
he should be the most ingratefull of men, he was obliged to thank her eternally; <sic>As</sic> for the rest, her teares being of so inestimable a price, she must not find
it strange, if being unable to render her any service that could merit that
honor, he resolved at least to tell her often, that he knew well he was <sic>unwor-</sic>
of it.  This conversation was interrupted by the Sergeant-major of the Garison  who according to the commandment which the Princess had given
him for it, came to demand the word of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; this Gallanterie surprised him as pleasingly, as the former which had been done him upon his
landing at the Port; and as he was no less civill, than <hi rend="italic"><sic>Jsabella</sic></hi> was obliging,
he said unto her with a low voice, and beholding her with eyes full of love,
and respect, that a man, who knew not how to rule his desires, and that would
die her Slave, was not in a state to command others: But what reason soever he could allege, he must obey <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi> pleasure; yet was it not for all
that but upon condition, that she should give the word as well as he, and
that he should not, but after her, finish this mysterie of Warre, which at
this time was absolutely guided by love. For as is these two illustrious persons had agreed together about this gallanterie, the word, which the Princess
gave to the Sergeant-major, was found to be <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; and that which
<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> gave, after he had long refused to doe it, was the fair name of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. This conformitie of spirt and thought was equally pleasing unto them;
for though they knew not what each of them had said, yet did they understand
it by a complement between them; for <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> assured the Princess, that mauger her curtesie <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> should reign still at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; and the Princess assured
him, that mauger his modesty and resistance <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustiniane</sic></hi> was Master of the Town. 
One part of the evening was spent in a sumptuous feast, which <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> made


<pb n="83" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="83     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 4." ed="1652"/>

him in the great Hall of the Castle; and for the rest of it all their conversation
was nothing but promises of loving one another eternally; and joy possest
them in such sort, as there came not so much as one thought unto them of
their misfortunes. But whereas it was late, <hi rend="italic"><sic>Iustiniano</sic></hi> lead the Princess back
to her chamber, followed by <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi> her kinswoman, and all her women;
as for him he was conducted by the Officers of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to a lodging, which
she had caused to be prepared for him,  and where the riches of the furniture
made it appear, that she had omitted nothing for the receiving of him magnificently. The image of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> so fully possessed his mind, as that of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> never came into his thought; the remembrance of what was past, nor the
fear of that to come, could not trouble his pleasures; and his present happiness so inchanted his reason, as without considering that this supreme felicity, occasioned by the sight of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, would precipitate him ere long into an extreme misfortune, he past the night without any other unquietness, than that which he received by the impatience he was in to see
day, that he might see <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> again. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was also conducted into a chamber which was little less stately than that of his
Illustrious friend, who to entertain himself more commodiously in his amorous fancies had
desired to lie alone.

<p><hi rend="italic">ISabella</hi> was no sooner awake but she thought of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, and
to entertain him with the more liberty, she sent to demand of
him by way of complement, whether he would be pleased to
go and pass away a part of the day in a fair Garden, which
the Princes of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> have on the Sea-side; and whereas
he had no other will than that of the Princess, he answered
him who came from her, that so as he might have the honor
to see her he would obey her with joy, her presence having
this particular charm, that she rendred all places alike agreeable unto him, because he never considered any thing therein but her. This
match being made, this fair Troop, as soon as dinner was done, began their walk;
<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> lent <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> his hand for to support her down to the Garden, whither
one may easily go on foot, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> did the like to <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi>, and the rest of the women
together with the Princesses chiefest Officers followed after. Their journey being short, they quickly arrived whither they were to go; whereat first their talk
was of the beauty of the place, of the situation thereof, of the ornaments which
had been added to its naturall graces, and other indifferent things; but as soon as
the Princess had handsomly drawn <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> a pretty way from the Troop, she
conjured him to acquaint her with his adventures, and no longer to defer the satisfying her curiosity, in recounting particularly unto her all the circumstances of
a life wherein she had so much interest, as to make it thenceforward the felicity of
hers. This discourse surprized <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> at first, he would have excused himself for
that day, beseeching the Princess not to deprive him so soon of the delight he had
an hearing her talk; but at length, seeing that this reason did not content her, he
yeelded unto it. They entred then into a great green Arbor, which on the one side
looked towards the Sea, and whereas <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, being set down on a seat of green
Turf, perceived that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> would out of respest have withdrawn as well as the rest
of the Troop, she stayed him, and said, that as he had been the testimony of their
first flames, it was but just that he should be so too of their last adventures: She made
him then sit down by <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, and when the rest of the company were retired a
good way from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, she summoned <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> to the performance of his word;
who, after he had besought her to pardon him, if the disorder of his fortune did
make some at any time in his discourse, began to speak in this sort.</p>

you, that which I have written to you heretofore: I will not tell you then how after I had by an hundred apparent reasons confirmed my self in the belief that you lived no longer but for the Prince of <hi rend="italic">Masseran</hi>, despair seized so strongly on my spirit, that death was the term of all my desires; but to get far away speedily from a place, where I could suspect the most constant person that ever was of infidelity, suffer me to tell you in few words, that quitting <hi rend="italic">Germany</hi>, I imbarqued my self on the Baltique Sea, to seek out an honourable death in the war of <hi rend="italic">Sweden</hi>; that on 
the way I was taken prisoner by <hi rend="italic">Chairadin</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">Algier</hi>, who sold me soon after
to the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>, which caused me instantly to be conducted to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, with

lose time in exagerating the phantasticalness of fortune, which hath been but too
well known by all Ages, and all Nations, and to give you an extraordinary proof
of it in my person, you shall understand, that after I was come to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>,
laden with irons, as well as my companions, without any difference betwixt us,
but that they tried every day to break their chains, and that I bore mine with a
tranquillity of minde, yet melancholick withall, which made them perceive that
life and liberty were not the object of my desires; this knowledge which they had
of my apprehensions during the voyage, was the cause that they concealed from
me the resolution they had taken, when we were come to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, of killing
their Guard, that so they might save themselves ere they should be presented to the
Grand Signior; and they carried their design so well, as it was not discovered above two hours before it should have been executed. And whereas amongst the
<hi rend="italic">Turks</hi> the desire of liberty is a capitall crime in a Slave, unless it be in paying a ransom for it, this enterprize being proved against them, the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>, a violent
man, and that saw how in one only night he was like to have lost three hundred
Slaves, without examining the circumstances of the matter, without distinguishing
the guilty from the innocent, condemned us all to be exposed to the cruellest punishment of that Countrey. This Sentence was received diversly, according to
the diversity of minds, but at last, though there were some generous souldiers amongst that great number of Slaves, yet heard they all this wofull news with grief:
As for me, who did not desire to live longer, because I saw my self constrained to
live without you, I belheld the end of my life as an assured port to shelter me from
all the storms wherewith I was agitated; so that though it had been easie for me
to have exempted my self from this perill, by letting the Bassa know what ransom I could have paid him, yet had I no purpose so to do. Howbeit this generall consternation indured not long, for the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> coming to consider that he could not satisfie his revenge and his avarice both together, resolved not to lose that himself which others would have taken from him; and therefore for examples sake only, he commanded that we should draw lots, and that the tenth part of our number should expiate the crime of the rest. This grace was received with joy by all the company; and albeit fear had still some place in their souls, yet was hope the povverfuller, and perswaded them all in particular, that the misfortune should not fall upon them: In the mean time the lots were drawn, and chance having decided the matter, I was of the number of the thirty that were to die. It was then that I well observed, how human weakness is the cause why every one is in some sort comforted by having companions in his misery; for when we were all condemned, I 


<pb n="86" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="86     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

saw nothing but tears of sorrow, but as soon as the lot had separated the <sic>fortutunate</sic> from the infortunate, these last changed their sorrow into rage and choler so transported them, as they could not endure the sight of them that were delivered: Yet was it not they whom destiny reserved for this supreme disgrace; for
the Bassa having moderated his fury, would have our lives once more depend absolutely upon the caprichiousness of fortune; he ordained then, that of thirty
which we were, no more than three should suffer; and the lot so favoured the desire I had to die, that I was one of those unhappy men, according to the sense of
others, though in mine own heart I was of a contrary opinion. The two that proved
my companions in this sad adventure, were without doubt the worthiest of all the
slaves, they were young, handsom, and courageous, and even such as the very Excutioners themselves, who were to take away our lives, had some regreet to
see, that chance had made a choice so unjust according to their thinking, so that
one of them moved with compassion, went and advertised the Bassa, that in losing
us he would lose the properest slaves that were in <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, and the fittest to
make a present of to his Highness. The Bassa, who repented him already of his
violence, in regard of his own interest, and yet desired that some one of us should
be punished, resolved at length for the last cast, that of we three but one should
dye, and that according to the first order, chance should still be the absolute master
of our life or of our death. The lot was not more favourable to me in this last
incounter, than in all the former, and I was the sacrifice destined for the publique
<unclear>s<gap extent="1 letter"> </gap>fety</unclear>; I was then presently bound more straitly than before; they made me my
self carry the preparations of my puniihment; and without boasting I can avow,
that I faced death with tranquillity enough: I dare not almost say, that in this
wofull estate you were the only object of my thought, yet it is true how I imagined, that this obstinacy of fortune, in chusing me still to be sacrifised, was an effect
of your desire, and that she did not judge me unworthy to live, but because you
judged me unworthy of your affection. In the end I received this sentence, as if
it had been pronounced by you, and in that thought I went to my punishment with
so much resolution, as bred wonder and compassion in them that beheld me. As
for my self, I was far from being afflicted at mine own proper miseries; I had
some delight in my fetters and chains; and the very sight of death could not keep
me from having some happy moments; for my love, doing its last and uttermost
indeavour, in following me to the grave, perswaded me, that is you had seen the
same <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, upon whom at other times you had accumulated glory, be ready
to yeeld up the ghost in adoring you, with the most cruell torments that the rage
of tyrants hath ever invented, you would at leastwise have breathed forth some
sighs, and shed some tears. The Princess, not able to endure that he should continue this discourse any longer, so much trouble did this deadly image excite in her
soul, assured him with a great deal of tenderness, and her eyes full of tears, that
this narration touched her so sensibly, as albeit she could not doubt but that he
had escaped this perill, yet could she not chuse but be in fear for him, and feel such
a grief in her mind, as she was not able to express. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was no less moved
with the tears ofthe Princess, than she had been by his relation; and when he had
rendred her thanks for so generous an apprehension, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> told him, that he could
not better acquit himself of that devoire, than to acquaint her by what inchantment he got out of this adventure. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> having testified by her action, that <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> impatience was hers, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> prosecuted his History in this manner.  Since
your Excellency will know how I was delivered, I am to let you understand, that
to go from the place where my doom had been pronounced, to that where it was
to be executed, we were of necessity to pass by one of the faces of the Seraglio, and
my good luck would have it, that when we came to that part, the Sultana <hi rend="italic">Asteria</hi>, great <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> daughter, was leaning at a window, whereof she had pulled up the
grate, and seeing a far off the multitude of people which accompanyed me, and
who seemed by their carriage to take part with my misfortune, it chanced that she
cast her eye upon my face, and that she found something in it which begot a curio-


<pb n="87" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="87     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

sity in her, whereupon she commanded them that conducted me to stay, and demanded of them what crime I had committed; I knew afterwards (for then I understood not the langauge very well) that one amongst them told her I was innocent, and recounted unto her by what mishap I was in that estate, by aggravating with a great deal of vehemency the obstinacy of fortune in chusing me still, and the constancy which I had shewed in this encounter. As long as this discourse lasted I observed that she considered me very attentively, so that perceiving by some words which I had already learned during the voyage, and by her gesture, that she spake of me, and that she pittied me, I saluted her with a profound respect. At length, Madam, the young Sultana <hi rend="italic">Asteria</hi> was so compassionate and generous, that after she had asked, and knew of what Nation I was, she expresly charged them that conducted me, not to stir from thence till they had order from the Grand Signior her father. They, who knew both the rank and credit, which the Sultana had with <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, were carefull not to fail in obeying her; in the mean time she went to the Emperor her father, who was then very luckily in the old Seraglio, where she was, and which is not inhabited but by the Mothers, Sisters, Daughters, and Aunts of the Grand Signior: There she besought him to grant her the life of a slave, that was an Italian, and innocent, whom the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> had purposed to have presented unto him, but novv vvould put him to death onely to serve for an example. After she had obtained the effect of her prayer, she rested not there, for she reported so many things of my constancy and resolution to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, as it begot a desire in him
to see me; so that sending a command to deliver me, I received order by a Trucheman to go unto the Grand Signior. To tell you, Madam, what this change
wrought in me would be to no end, since it is easie for you to judge, that he, who
so much despised life, received it not with much joy; and I dare say, that I stood
in more need of constancy to resolve to live, than another would have had to resolve to die: Howbeit I went to his Highness, and whatsoever aversion I had from
life, yet did I not forbear rendring him thanks for granting it to me. When first I
appeared before <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> he began to speak to me; for whereas he knew before that
I was of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, he beleeved that I would understand a language, which at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> they call the <hi rend="italic">Franks</hi> toung, and spoken there by every one for the commoditie of commerce, and which also I understood persestly, because it is no other
than a corrupted Italian. It was not, for that this Prince, out of an extraordinary
curiosity proper to those of his Nation, is not acquainted, not onely with all the
<hi rend="italic">Orientall</hi> tongues, but with the <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">French</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi>; howbeit in regard he doth not exercise them, he understands them only, without being able to
speak them with facilitie: nevertheless I must for the present except the last, which
in consideration of me he learned afterwards very perfectly. It was then in that
language, wherof I have spoken, that he demanded of me whence I was, what was
my birth and profession, and by what adventure I came into the power of the Bassa
<hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>. I answered him that I was a poor <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Gentleman, whose life had nothing remarkable enough wherewith to entertain so great a Prince; and that the
only chance of War had made me a slave at <hi rend="italic">Argier</hi>, where the Bassa had bought
me not long after. I confess I had somewhat ado to disguise the truth, but being
resolved that I would never be heard spoken of more, I did not tell what I was,
for fear if it had been known, and that it had been discovered hovv I could have
given a sufficient great ransom, intelligence would have been sent to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> of my
being at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> told me then, that I had something in the air of
my face, that shewed me greater than I had delivered my self to be, and that all the
rules of physiognomy were false, or I had not spoken sincerely unto him. I received this dsscourse with a great deal of respest and modesty; after which he talked
to me of the customs of my country, of war, of fortifications, and when he perceived by my answers that I was not absolutely ignorant, though in this occasion I was
not forward to shew my self very knowing, or of any great wit; there is not any
good art, or excellent science, which he did not discourse with me about, for the
space of two hours that I had the honour to be with him. At last, Madam, this great


<pb n="88" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="88     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

Prince was so satisfied of me, as he sent word to the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>, that having understood he meant to present me unto him with three hundred slaves, he remitted unto him not only his three hundred slaves, but assured him that he would give
him also as many more for a recompence of the service he had done him, in bringing me under his obedience: And when he had ordained that care should be taken of
me, he did me the grace to tell me, that I had so neerly touched his inclination, as
after he had given me my life, he would have given <sic>me me</sic> my liberty too, if he
could have resolved to deprive himself so soon of a person, which was agreeable to
him. I must confess that this generosity came near my heart, and that I was almost
ashamed to receive so extraordinary a favour with so little testimony of joy;
I retired then infinitely satisfied of this Prince, and I was conducted to the quarter of the Slaves that were destined to his Highness, although I was not treated
like them, having no other pain than that of wearing my irons. This revolution of
fortune seemed so strange unto me, when I came to consider it, as I remained all the night in the admiration of this prodigious adventure: (What said I to my self) hath destiny resolved then, that I shall pass from one extremity to another? It cannot indure mediocritie in my happiness, nor in my unhappiness; and out of 
an obstinate rage to persecute me, when it sees that I am resolved for the greatest
misfortunes, and that death passeth with me for a soveraign good, it withdrawes
me from that Port, which I held to be most secure, to expose me to the tempest again by apparent felicities: But it may be too (said I further sighing) that there is
some justice in its crueltie; the temerity which I have had to love, and to hope to
be beloved of the most admirable person that ever will be, is not yet sufficiently
punished; grief, despair, exile, imprisonment, and certainty of death, are not torments proportionable enough to my crime, which being infinite, demands also an
eternall chastisement: Let us suffer then (continued I) since the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> is not satisfied, and let us accept of the life, which is given us for a punishment, and not for a grace. It was after this manner. Madam, that I resolved to receive all that fortune prepared for me, with a design no longer to oppose my
reason against her humors, and blindly, and without resistance, to obey this invisible power, which mocks all human prudence; which puts us into the Port upon
the point of suffring shipwrack; which precipitates us from the top of happiness
into the abysme of misery; which overturnes Thrones; which destroyes Kingdomes; which causes Kings to die; and to say all in a word, which soveraignly disposes of the whole Universe. This resolution being strongly established in my mind,
I found more tranquillity in my self; and though I was alwaies infinitely sad, yet
for all that it is certain, that my melancholy was more sociable; and to speak truth,
it was in some sort necessary that I should find my self in this estate; for <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> failed not to send for me the next day to talk with him; and this second conversation
having satisfied him more than the first, there past not a day after that, wherein I
had not the honor to confer with him: History, War, Geography, the Mathematiques, Painting, and Musick were the subject of these entertainments: And whereas this Prince loves the Sciences passionately, and that the Orientall people are
not at this day adicted to them, he was ravished to see that one of his Slaves was
not ignorant in all these things; so that I may say with truth, that there was not a
man in all his Empire, whom he esteemed more than my self. In the mean time I
am to let your Excellencie understand, since you will know all my fortune, that
in <hi rend="italic">Galatia</hi>, in the same place where was heretofore <hi rend="italic">Angori</hi>, which the Antients
called <hi rend="italic">Seuleucia</hi>, and which the Turkes at this present name <hi rend="italic">Gielas-il</hi>, by corruption of speech, there is an infinite multitude of <hi rend="italic">Mahometan</hi> Religious men, called
<hi rend="italic">Deruislars</hi>, comprehending under that name all the divers kinds ofthose Solitaries,
which are found amongst them; but amongst the rest there are of them, which
are termed <hi rend="italic">Calenders</hi>, who are of a different sect from the <hi rend="italic">Dernis</hi>, and that make
a more particular profession of continencie and austeritie: Of the number of these
<hi rend="italic">Calenders</hi> was one <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, that is to say, a Noble man, descended from <hi rend="italic">Chaz-Bectas</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Chaz-Hassen</hi>, who lived in the time of <hi rend="italic">Orchan</hi>, second Emperor of the



<pb n="89" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="89     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

Turkes, and that in his religion had been the Disciple and Sectarie of one <hi rend="italic">Edebal</hi>, who was the first institutor of all those <hi rend="italic">Mahometan</hi> devotions, which prophesied the Empire to <hi rend="italic">Othoman</hi>, and his successors; and who in his time had been held for a man of a very holy life: So that this <hi rend="italic">Calender Zellebis</hi>, of whom I speak, a stirring and active man, relying on the reputation of his Predecessors, began to gain unto him all those of his sect, which were no small number; and under the name and pretext of liberty, he made almost all <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi> to revolt. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, being advertised thereof, failed not in sending a mighty Army thither; but the chance of War so favoured those revolters, as they defeated it in divers incounters, and also killed some Sangiaes, or Governors of Provinces, who would have opposed themselves to this sedition, which under the pretext of the sanctity of those that raised it, might at length have proved dangerous to the Turkish Empire. The news of the last defeat of the Grand-Signiors Troopes was brought him a little while after I had the honor to belong unto him: And whereas the bad success of this Civill War touched him more vively, than the loss of a battel in a strange War would have done, he resolved to go in person to punish these rebells. And whereas he did not believe, that these seditious were so daring, as to oppose him, he gave not himself the time to raise one of those puissant Armies, which strikes terror into all the <sic>word</sic>, but contented himself with joyning his ordinary Guard, and some other Troops, which he took out of the Garisons, whereby he passed to those that had rallied themselves together after the last defeat. When he was ready to depart, he commanded me to follow him, though none of the rest of the Slaves besides had order to go: I will not tell you, Madam, all the particulars of this War; for
whereas I recount mine own History, and not that of the Grand-Signior, I am to
speak onely of those things, wherein I have some interest: You shall understand
then, that <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, the Chief of this sedition, being fallen sick, had forsaken the
Camp, and was retired into the Capitall City of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, with the best Troops of
his Army; whereof <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having been advertised, he resolved to go and besiege
him; not doubting but if he could get him into his hands he should easily prevail
over all the rest. This design, having been approved of, was not long before it was
executed; we marched directly to this City; approches to it are made; trenches
are cast up, batteries are raised; and in a few daies the avenues to it are so well
closed up, as it is impossible for any body to goe in or out. At length, to abridge
this narration, <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, being in a short time recovered, defended himself so couragiously, that after he had sustained three assaults w ith great loss of ours, the besieged were still in case to make sallies every day, which extremely incommodated
our Army. During all these passages I had divers times besought his Highness to
permit me to venture my life for his service, which I could not obtain, because a
Slave is not suffred to bear armes: I lived then in this sort with a great deal of vexation, to see my self in a shamefull idleness at such a time, when as occasions were
so often presented, wherein I might have dyed Nobly. As I was in this melancholy, the Grand-Signior, being much incensed to see this Town hold out so long,
resolved that his Army should perish there, or carry it by force; and for that effect
he caused a generall assault to be given: And though there were a body of the enemies Army in the field, he commanded nevertheless that they should not care so
much for the guard of the Trenches, as for the attacquing of the place; and the reason of this was, because the enemy had never appeared, nor had used indeavour,
either to cast Troops into the City, or to raise the siege. In the mean time it happened, that an hour after the assault was begun, and that above twenty times there had been already lost, and regained, five or six foot of ground, which was to render <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> Master of the Town, there was heard, notwithstanding the dreadfull
noise of Cannons, of armes, and of the cries of them that fought, towards the
Grand-Signiors quarter a great volley of musket shot, which put much fear into
our souldiers hearts. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who was present at this fight for to give direction in
person, confirmed them the best that possibly he could, and after he had commanded the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> to continue the assault, he went to see what the matter was



<pb n="90" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="90     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

followed only by two thousand Janisaries, but he was quickly cleared in it, for he
had not marched fifty paces, but that he saw the rest of his souldiers come in disorder, having avoided the fury of the enemy, who was pursuing them still. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> no longer doubted then but that this was <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> his Army which attacqued
his Camp; and being a Prince of a great and generous spirit, he purposed to fight
with them: But as he was ready to march directly to the enemy, he was much surprized to behold from the Towns side, that not only his souldiers had abandoned
the assault, but that <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> in the head of those of <hi rend="italic">Chientaya</hi>, went beating them
before him in a terrible disorder. As for me, who always followed the Prince without other arms than a light chain, which I wore on one of my legs, I assuredly believed that he was lost, as indeed without almost a supernaturall assistance it is certain that he could not have escaped: He was closed up in the midst of his enemies, his Army was dispersed, fear had seized upon his Troops, and is an advantagious plot of ground had not been met withall to put part of his Forces, and his
Person in safety, this mischief had been without remedy. But, Madam, must I tell
you how it was by my means, that this day, so unlucky in the beginning, had a glorious end? Yes, Madam, I must tell it you, and since my valor was but an effect of
my despair, and that you were the cause thereof, it is just to let you understand
how it was by you that I saved both the life, and the glory of great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. Remember then, if you please, this verity in the process of this Narration, to the end
I may not be accused of vanity in delivering things which I had not executed
without you: I shall tell you then, Madam, that in this universall disorder I
conserved so much judgement to observe, that on the left hand of that quarter where we were, there was a place which Nature had so well fortified, as with
very little defence it was impossible to be forced; I advanced then boldly to the
Grand Signior, and maugre the press I let him see what I had already noted, and
caused him to perceive, that in attending the rallying ofhis troops he might be there
not only in assurance, but in an estate to keep those of the town from joyning with
them that were without. This advice having satisfied him, he commanded to go and
seiz on that plot; but as is the enemy had been acquainted with this design he advanced to dispute it with us. There it was, Madam, that I ceased to be slave for to be a
soldier, for having taken a scimitar which I found amongst the dead bodies, I got into the head of our troops, with so much resolution, &amp; so much good fortune, as I did
things there which I dare not relate: in the end, Madam, I inspired our soldiers with
such valor, as reasuming courage we repulsed the enemy, &#x0026; seized on the place, whereof I have already spoken to you. But when I saw <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> in safety, I went and cast my
self amidst some of our forces, which were fighting still with those that were come
out of the City; and perceiving that our souldiers were preparing to flie, in hope
to get to the place where <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was, I threatned to kill them if they returned
not to the fight: This so extraordinary a discourse being seconded by some effects,
which seemed marvellous unto them, they resolved to follow me: Behold me then
the head of this couragious Brigade, whom I conducted so fortunately, as I made
them carry that in two hours, which a whole Army could not do in six weeks before. At last. Madam, being resolved to perish, or do some great matter, I so hotly
pursued the enemies, that after we had killed a great number of them, made the
rest to flie, and put fear into all the remainder, I drove them even into their town,
where being entred alone with them, certainly I performed things, which made me
plainly see, that despair is more powerfuller than valor; but whatsoever I could
have done, doubtless I should have fallen there if I had not called to minde, that
the breach being abandoned, I might through that place cause our forces to enter,
thither I made then with extreme speed, and finding none on the Ramparts but disarmed people, who were there assembled to see the success of the business, I easily
got to it, and presently discovering those which had followed me to the City-gate,
I cried unto them, Victory, Victory, for to oblige them to turn head towards me: When as they knew me by my slaves habit, they were so surprized to see me still living, as no way doubting but that I was a man sent by their Prophet to succour


<pb n="91" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="91     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

them, they resolved to abandon me no more; and superstition mingled it self so happily amongst them to excite their vallor, as I can say that I never saw souldiers more couragious: They came then unto me with incredible speed, and were no sooner mounted on the breach but I pulled down an Ensign, which the enemies had set up on the wall, to put on of <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> in the place of it; and having left some for the guard of the breach, I went with the rest to seize on the gates of the town, and their Magazine of Arms. The people no sooner heard long-live victorious <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> cried in the streets, but their weapons fell out of their hands, assuredly believing that their Army was defeated, and that the Emperors was in the City: In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> used all his endeavour to put heart into his souldiers again, but seeing it altogether imposible, he resolved to flie, fearing nothing so much as to fall alive into <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> hands. As soon as the people knew that their Defendor had forsaken them, we had no further resistance, except at hte Gates, where some souldiers were still int he guard of them; this obstacle stayed us not long, for whereas we fought then with hope that the victory vvould fall on the juster side, vve redoubled our efforts vvith so much ardour, as at last vve became Masters of the place. Things being in this estate, and perceiving that I had not force enough to keep the people under, I thought fit to advertise <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> of it, vvho in the mean vvhile had rallied one part of his Army, vvhich at length proved strong enough to vvithstand the Enemy, but not to repulse him, had not the happy nevvs vvhich I sent them redoubled their courage:
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> caused the taking of the City then
to be presently published amongst the Troops, and promised them the pillage of it
if they performed their duty vvell. After this, Madam, they marched vvith a resolution, vvhich certainly vvas a presage of the victory had the enemies stood to
it, but having turned their eyes to the City, and seeing on the walls an Ensign with
the Arms of the Empire in it, their courage began to abate, and soon after to give
place unto fear; for <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> upon his flying away had sent them word, that they
should not hazzard a Battell, for that the Town was lost, so that they retired; and
although that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> pursued them a while, their Chieftain was so cunning in his
Trade, as it was impossible to ingage them in the fight, or to keep them from making an honourable retreat; for <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> beholding from an eminent place, that
they were going to take a wood, where it would have been dangerous to pursue
them, and seeing likewise that it was almost night, he returned to the Camp: And
whereas he had already sent me troops enough, that I might no longer fear the revolt of this people, I went to assure him that I had taken such order, as he might
by the breach enter into this rebellious Town. To tell you, Madam, how this
Prince received me would be an impossible thing; he caressed me with so much
goodness, he commended me so highly,and said so many times that he owed both
his life and his honour unto me, as his praise far surpassed that which I had done:
And observing that I had still a piece of the chain on, which I had brought back
with me from the fight, he commanded it instantly to be taken off. But seeing that
he could not forbear speaking of me, and always asking me some particularity of
this action, I besought him to think rather of conserving that which fortune had
given him by my hand, than any forther to commend a victory, for which he was
more ingaged to his own good hap, than to my valour. This Prince grew suddenly silent hereupon, whereof I could not imagine the cause; but I was not long
in this uncertanity, for <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> after he had mused a little, began to speak, and tell
me, how he was much troubled that his Religion would not permit him to give any
command to such a man as I was, and that it forced him to do an injustice, and
to shew himself ingratefull, by conferring that on another which I had acquired. I besought him then to believe, that if his Highness was satisfied, so was I, and that I aspired to no other glory than that of pleasing and serving him. He appointed the <hi rend="italic">Saniac</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi> then to go and command in the Town; and lest the fear of chastisement should carry the Inhabitants to any revolt, he charged him to keep the souldiers all night in Arms, and he ordained the same in his Camp, the Enemies not being so far off, but that it might be feared they might make use of the advan-

tage which the obscurity of the night gave them to come and beat up some of our
Quarters.  After this he made a sign for every one to withdraw; I would have obeyed like the rest, but he let me know that this Commandment extended not to
me, and that he desired I should stay with him. It was then, Madam, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
surmounted my insensibility, by forcing me to begin to serve him with amity, and
not with simple acknowledgement, as I had done before; and indeed to speak
truth, one must have renounced all reason not to have been moved with so much
generosity. He intreated me not as his Slave; he spake not to me as to his inferiour; he caressed me not as his equall, but as is I had been an hundred degrees
above him, both in my birth, in my merit, and in my valour: And to testifie unto
me that this discourse was not a flattery wherewith he meant to recompence me, he
sware to me that it would be long of me if I did not reign in his Empire as absolutely as he himself, and conjured me to furnish him with the means for it, because
without me he should be constrained to be ingratefull, fortune being so much his
enemy, as he could not do good to the only man he loved, if I were not willing
to it also. At last, Madam, after an hundred of the most conjuring protestations
that can be imagined, and after he had prayed me above an hundred times not to
think ill of him for the proposition he was going to make me, he undertook to
perswade me to quit my Religion for to imbrace his, because, said he, without
that he must be ingratefull, I must be a slave, and he must likewise be the most unhappy of men, there not being a more cruell adventure (continued he) for a generous Prince, than not to be able to recompence a gallant action, and to be constrained to leave a person in servitude whom he loves, and whom he esteems so
much, as to divide his Empire with him. After that this Prince had said all that
generosity and affection could make one to say in a like encounter, I besought him
not to afflict himself unjustly, since I was going to give him the means to recompence
me, not only for the services I had rendred him, but for all those which I should render him in time to come. Hereupon such a joy appeared inhis face, as fully assured
me that he had expressed the meaning ofhis heart; but it continued not long, when
as I humbly desired him to restore me my chains, and to leave me to the liberty of
my Religion; that I demanded irons of him, to testifie that I would not go out of his
service, &amp; that I besought him not to ask any more of me a thing, which I would not
doe for the possession of the Empire of the whole world, for fear I should be inforced to displease and disobey him. What! said <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> unto me, shall I give chaines
to my Deliverer? shall I retain him still to be a Slave that makes me to reign?
shall I bind the hands of him that hath crowned me? and with a strange injustice
shall I make him a captive that hath made me victorious? No, no, it shall not be
said, that I could not recompence them, that have served me, but with a shamefull
servitude: The demand, which thou hast made me, is worthy of thy generosity, but
this recompence would be unworthy of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. He had questionless proceeded further, had he not observed my countenance to change, and fearing that he had displeased me, he began to ask me pardon, when as I perceived that I was wounded
in the left arm by the blood that trickled out of the sleeve of my habit, so that
doubting that I would fall into a swoon he called in company; and notwithstanding any thing I could say he would needes see my wound searched, which was not
found dangerous, but which might have been so, had the dressing of it been any
longer retarded. It is a strange thing that I did not perceive it, and if the proposition which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> made unto me, had not moved me so violently,
as to make my wound burst out a bleeding, I believe that I had gone away
without heeding it. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> caused me to be caried into a Tent, with so great a
care, as one would have said, that on the conservation of my life depended that
of his. I began then to be no longer regarded as a Slave, but as the favourite of
the  Emperor; every one observed and caressed me, and even he that had
bought me, that had laid me in irons, and had condemned me to die, was one of the
most carefull of my health. In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> entred the next day into the
Town with all the ceremonies of a Prince, that is Vanquisher of his rebellious sub-

jects. The principall inhabitants were brought before him bound in chaines, and
prostrated with their faces on the ground; he informed himself presently of the
quality of their crime; he distinguished those, that had revolted out of malice,
from those that had been ingaged in it out of weakness, and by a goodness quite
contrary to the maximes of Tyrants, the lives of five or six of the most culpable 
satisfied for the offence of all the rest; and he shewed an example of clemencie, where
others would have shewed one of cruelty under the name of justice. But whereas he
had promised the pillage of the Town to the souldiers, he would not give them
cause to complain in a time when as the enemy was still in the field; neither would
he also let them charge themselves with booty, knowing well that the inriching of
an Army is the destroying of it; so that to content them, he caused them to be told,
that he was ready to keep his promise with them, but judging it not fit, <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> having
<unclear>escaped</unclear> from his revenge, that they should load themselves with unprofitable
<unclear>lumb<gap extend="1 letter"> </gap>r</unclear>, since they could neither carry it away, nor sell it, being constrained to follow the enemy; he 
 offered to give each of them three monthes pay, and promised
them besides not to return to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> without recompencing their courage.
The souldiers accepting of this propofition, and that they might not have leisure to
repent them, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> made them march away three dayes after, having left a
strong Garison in the Town to hinder any new rebellion. He had the goodness to
desire to know almost every hower in what estate I was, so that having been assured
my wound would not keep me from following him, he testified a great deal of joy
for it. We marched then directly to the enemy, having discovered by our scouts
where he was: But whereas <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, who had joyned himself to his Troops, would
not hazard a battell lightly, he alwaies avoyded with dexterity every place, where
he might be inforced to fight; and as he was cunning and malicious, so he invented
a trick that succeeded happily with him. He saw well, that the Grand Signiors presence was the soul of his Army, that his very sight inspired valor into his souldiers; 
and that it would be hard to vanquish them, as long as he should be a witness
of their courage; that he alone could heap wealth and honor on them: He sent then
with all speed some of his faction to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, to sow a rumor there that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was dead; that his Troops were defeated; &#x0026; that he was declared Emperor; making no question, out of the knowledge he had of the <hi rend="italic">Janizaries</hi> turbulent humor,
which alwaies remained for the guard of the Seraglio, but that they would make
some disorder, that might recall <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>; as indeed this sad and
false news was no sooner published there, but it presently begot a terrible confusion.
The Grand Visier did all that he could, to learn from whence this rumor was come,
to appease the <hi rend="italic">Janizaries</hi>, assuring them that he had no notice at all of what they
were made to believe; but that, which he thought to retain them by, did but incense them the more, and confirm them in their opinion. For (said they) if <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> were not dead, the report of his victories would reach even hither; in conclusion, the whole Seraglio, and all the people were in teares, and all the <hi rend="italic">Janizaries</hi> in arms: But when the Grand Visier, seconded by some of the people, and by some of the <hi rend="italic">Janizaries</hi>, would have opposed them, they turned all their fury, according to their custom, against the <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Christians</hi>, they plundred all their houses, they demolished their Chappells, they set some of them on fire, and in this confusion making no distinction betwixt a <hi rend="italic">Turk</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi>, little lacked but that they had pillaged all <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, yea they almost durst enterprise to force the Seraglio. But in the midst of this disorder the Grand Visier received a Letter from <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, which advertised him of the happy success of his Armes, to the end he should advertise his Subjects therewith, so that being assured of the verity of the matter, he went into the streets, crying aloud, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> lived, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was victorious, and that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> would be suddenly at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. He pronounced these words with so much joy, as they made some impression in the minds of the <hi rend="italic">Janizaries</hi>; and having shewed the Grand Signiors Letter to some of them, this truth was no longer doubted of any body. The most seditious and the most insolent were the most amazed; the name of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> restored them that respect



<pb n="94" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="94     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

which avarice and violence had banished from them; they threw down their arms, 
and craved pardon; howbeit there were some of them, who fearing to render that
which they had taken away, made strange Propositions: But the Grand Visier being wise and prudent, thought it would be better to make them hope for Grace,
than to make them stand in dread of chastisement, for fear left putting them in despair they should be carried again to some new violence. He promised them then
to speak to the Grand Signior for them, and to assure him that the news of his
death had so afflicted them, as not able to be revenged on those who they believed
had caused it, they would at least be revenged on the enemies of his Religion: This
discourse began to calm their spirits, and whereas this multitude seems always in
such like encounters to have but one soul, which makes them operate, though they
be composed of persons of different thoughts, they suffered themselves at length to
be perswaded that their crime should not only be unpunished, but also be recompenced, as a mark of their zeal and affection. In the mean time the Grand Visier
dispatched away with speed to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to advertise him of this disorder, and to beseech his Highness if his affairs would permit it, to return unto <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, for
fear some new sedition should arise there; how it was unlikely, that the Christians, Jewes, and such Turks as had been plundered, should not complain of the outrage had been done them, and that these complaints should not be pursued with a
new mischief: He informed him also, that the affairs of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi> went not very
well, and that his presence was necessary for the good of things. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> received
this unpleasing news with a great deal of grief, being sorry to leave the victory over <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> to another, howbeit he judged his return to be of too great importance
to be deferred; so that after he had given the command of the Army to the Bassa
<hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>, and instrusted him with the order that he would have him to hold, we departed for <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> with as little company as possibly we could, to the end
the Army might not be weakned, I say we departed, Madam, for since that fortunate day wherein my despair was so advantagious for me, I was inseparable from
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; I had a part in all his secrets, he told me all his thoughts, and my advices, and my counsells made up most of his resolutions. His return to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> produced many effects there, he gave joy to the innocent, fear to the guiltie, and
hope to the Jewes ard Christians; and truly all these apprehensions were not ill
grounded, for he rewarded those that had been faithfull unto him; he severely punished the seditious; he caused all that had been taken from the Jewes and Christians to be restored to them; he made their Chappells and their Houses to be reedified; and for their goods which they had been robbed of, and could not be
found, he paid them with his own money. After this, Madam, tranquillity was
more solidly established in <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, than it was before; yet did not the Emperor judge it fit to return into <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi> by reason the affairs of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi> would not
suffer him to be so far absented from it. During this intervall I had the honor to
talk every day with <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and to receive so many marks of his amity, as I could
no longer refuse him mine; but whatsoever good will he bore me (if I may be
permitted to speak so) he could not forbear perswading me to be of his Religion,
whereunto I so strongly opposed my self, in letting him see the ridiculous errors
which it teacheth, as not able to make him angry with me, I forced him many times
to laugh at them. In the mean time it hapned, that one morning he sent an extraordinary express for me, and just as I entred into his chamber, a Bassa, named <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, who hath maried a daughter of <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi>, and is a cunning and dextrous man,
entred in also with me: When I was come in, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> told me, that he had bought a
picture of a Merchant, that was come from <hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi>, which he would shew me, for to
know whether he had not been cozened, and whether it were true that he had skill
in painting: He gave me then a case covered with Diamonds, which I opened
with so great a transport, as if <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had had a quiet spirit he had perceived it;
for, Madam, if one may say, without blasphemy, that there is any thing in the
world which doth resemble you, it is certainly this pourtrait; and whereas the
picture which you gave me was taken from me, I believed at first that it was it,



<pb n="95" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="95     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

and that to present it to the Grand Signior it had been put into a richer case; and that which served to deceive me too was, that as you had drawn your self like an <hi rend="italic">Amazon</hi>, so was this also: But at length, after that this first trouble of mine imagination was appeased, I distinctly perceived that the eyes of the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had a fire which did not appear in those of this picture, and that this resemblance was very imperfect. It is certain nevertheless, that the whole Orient hath never seen so fair a person; also when <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> demanded of me, what I thought of it, I was constrained to tell him, how I did not believe that <hi rend="italic">Greece</hi> had ever produced any thing so marvellous. Thou wilt not be astonished then, said he unto me, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> is charmed with it, and that he is resolved curiously to inform himself whether the Originall be as perfect as the Picture; for if the Painter hath not flattered this maid, continued he, I am the most amorous of men, and I cannot live without possessing her.
I confess that this discourse surprized me,
for though it might have been said in a gallantry, yet I certainly knew by the manner of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s speaking that he had his heart touched. He would have me accord with him, that the Physiogminy ot this person vvas spirituall; that it had a
certain air of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> the Sultana Queen, vvhom he had so much loved, and for
vvhom he had still so much respect: I know well, said <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> unto me, how it is
incomprehensible, that he which hath the fairest women of the World in his power,
should become inamoured, it may be of the imagination of a Painter, and that a
mixture of colours, which cannot make but a dumb image, should force me to forget all the most perfect and the most charming that I have seen, yea, and <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi>
too, whom I love more than my life. I know well enough besides, continued he,
that this person may be fair, and not be very amiable; that she may have defects in
her minde and in her humour, which her picture doth not shew me; that this
sweetness vvhich is in her eyes, is not peradventure in her heart; that this majesty
vvhich appears in her face, doth cover it maybe a vvicked and base soul; and to
say all, that she is quite contrary to that I believe her to be: But in the end I am
compelled to this inclination by a superior power, vvhich vvill not permit me to
vvihstand my self: It is not because I knovv not vvell enough what is reason, but
it is because in this incounter I cannot follovv it: He prayed me that I vvould
counsell him, so as it vvere according to his desire. I knevv vvell by this discourse
that this passion vvas too violent to be opposed, so as I only said to him, that the
first thing vvhich his Highness ought to do vvas to inform himself vvhere the Merchant had met vvith this fair object of his love, to the end he might be assured
the Painter had dealt faithfully. He told me then, how that man had already acquainted him that this person was named <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>; that she was the daughter of
the Governor of <hi rend="italic">Mazanderon</hi>; that she lived with <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, eldest daughter to
<hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, Sophy of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, who it was thought was in love with her, but the report was, that <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, by reason of some secret inclination, or for spme reason
that was not known, did not receive the affection of that Prince favourably; wherefore this being so, he resolved to send <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> in disguise for to see her, to offer her
all the magnificences of the Seraglio; or is she would not receive them willingly
to bring her away by force, which would not be hard to do, because he had learnt
by another, that the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, with whom she lived, went almost every
yeer to <hi rend="italic">Mazanderon</hi>, which is situated on the bank of the <hi rend="italic">Caspian</hi> Sea. I saw very
well after this discourse, that being generous I was not to disguise my opinion in
so important an occasion; I took then the liberty to say unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> in the gentlest
terms I could choose, that to use this violence was in some sort to violate the Law
of Nations, and to be waiting to exact justice; and that if <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> was never so little sensible of it, the fire of his love might be likely to kindle that of war; and
that peradventure his Higliness might one day repent that a pisture had caused the
shedding his Subjects blood. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, who saw that by destroying the Emperors
design I would take away his imployment from him, assured the Grand Signior, that he would put <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> into his hands without the Sophy of <hi rend="italic">Persiaes</hi> ever discovering what was become of her; thathe knew almost an undoubted mean to



<pb n="96" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="96     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

execute that which he had said, provided he would give him a Vessell well furnish
ed with all things necessary; that he would cause all his souldiers to be attired
like Slaves, to the end they might be the less mistrusted; that as for him, he would
also attire himself like a Merchant, and lade his Vessell withall that was most rare
at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> of the commodities of <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>, and most proper to touch the inclination of women; that after this he besought his Highness not to command
him to say more, and to be contented with the Oath that he made him to return
him his head at his feet, is he did not bring <hi rend="italic">Felixma</hi>. This promise did so footh
the passion of the Emperor, as not able to keep himself from following it, he had
the goodness to ask my pardon if he did not submit his sense to mine, telling me
how I had at least this advantage, that he confessed I had reason, and that he would
remember how his glory was dear unto me, since I had been so generous, as not to
fear to offend him in opposing my self to the injustice of his design; that in the
mean time we should deal in such sort as <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> might have no notice of it. In
the end, Madam, <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had the equipage he required for this goodly conquest, and
I had more civilities than I deserved. Howbeit <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was constrained a little after the departure of <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> to interrupt his amorous thoughts, for to think of the
affairs of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, which since his return to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> were very much changed;
for as soon as <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> had been advertised by his Spies, that the Emperor was departed, he took as much care to joyn with his enemy, as he had used before to avoid him: And whereas <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> had order to give battell, when occasion should
serve for it, the two Armies were not long before they incountred together. If one
should alwayes judge of the event of the fight by the number of the Souldiers, it
is certain that the Bassa would have vanquished <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, who had a great many
fewer than he, but he was so unfortunate, and according to some, of so little understanding, that he let the enemies Army take all the advantages of the field, whether it were for the situation, or the wind, which drave all the dust and the smoke
in the faces of ours, whereby they were extremely incommodated. It hapned also
that when the Battell began, the Sun was covered with clouds, so that the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> not having observed on which side it was, or not having fore-seen that it
might break forth, he placed his souldiers with their eys just against it, who soon after perceived that this light which blinded them, kept them oftentimes from being
able either to strike their enemies, or to avoid their blows. At last, Madam, the Sun
cleared the defeat of the Bassa, and the triumph of <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, and the Emperors Army,was so routed, as in above eight days after a <sic>thonsand</sic> souldiers were not found
together. This news very much afflicted <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and whereas I was the only confident of his pleasure, and of his grief, I received order to come unto him ; but I
was scarcely entred into his Cabinet, when as he fell to asking of me, whether I
would have him dishonoured? Whether I had resolved to let that be lost which
I had gotten? Whether I had taken the Capitall Town of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi> to serve for a
retreat to a coward, which had blemished the glory of his Arms? For at length,
said he unto me, the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> is retired thither, after he hath lost a battell, and
after he hath let mine enemy take the Arms of the Empire: Now judge, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>,
continued he, what I am to attend from thee; thy valor hath once already established my glory, it is again by thee that I must hold it; from thy hand it is that
I will have the head of <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, and from thy arm that I look for victory: Oppose
thy self no longer then against my will; nor can I ever resolve that thou shouldst
quit me; I love thee too well, or to say better, I love my self too well to give thee
liberty to go out of my State. Resolve then for that vvhich I have so often demanded of thee, and which I dare not almost express more clearly imto thee, for fear
of grieving thee; at length <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, take a Turbant and a Scimitar, and after
that I make thee the chief of my Empire, mine enemies are subdued, and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
is contented. It is certain, that the manner wherewith this discourse was pronounced somewhat moved my minde, but it is true nevertheless that it never shaked my
soul; I besought the Emperor not to hearken so much to the affection he bore
me, but that he would also hearken unto reason; that the first blinded his judge-



<pb n="97" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="97     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

ment, in perswading him that I was capable of great things; but the second shewed him clearly, that he demanded of me a thing, not only unjust, but impossible to an heart as mine was: For, my Lord, said I unto him, our thoughts depend not upon our wills; that which we call faith amongst us, is a grace that comes from
above, and is not acquired by naturall knowledge; it is a thing then which can
not be forced; it is a present from Heaven which is to be conserved with the
perill of ones life, and which is not under the domimon of Kings: Let thy
Highness pardon me then if I refuse thee a thing which I would not doe for the possession of the whole Universe, no nor at the sight of a death, the most terrible
and most dreadfull that can be. It I should refuse thee, continued I, either my
blood or my life, which are the only things whereof I can dispose, I should think
my self guilty of the blackest ingratitude that ever was; but being far from so
base a thought, I most humbly beseech thee permit me to go and affront the Army
of the enemy, to try, the first of all, his fury and his rage, and if it be possible to
grapple with <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, and sacrifice his life to thy vengeance, or mine to thy service. Thy Highness hath but too well made known unto me, how thou remembrest that when I was loaden with chains I had the good fortune to vanquish thine
enemies; do thou judge then by what I have done, of that which I will do in this
occasion, whenas so many testimonies of affection render me indebted to thy Greatness, and that being no longer fettered with irons, I may make use of all my address, and of all my force: Let a Scymitar then, my Lord, be only given me, and
let me be placed in the formost rank of thine Army; and to oblige thy Highness
from requiring that only thing of me which I can refuse thee, do but consider seriously, and consult with thy most secret thoughts, and then demand of thy self, is
the goood hap of Christendom had been such, as that thou wert powerfully perswaded of the truth of our Religion, whether thou wouldst be capable of changing it
for the conquest of all the world: But it is too much importuning thy Highness
to ask a just thing of thee with so many reasons; and it is, as it were, to commit a
crime to make any doubt of obtaining it. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> heard me with a great deal of
unquietness, and when I had done speaking he was a pretty while without answering me: And although the thoughts of men are hard to be known, yet I well
observed, that choler, reason, and amity reigned successively in his heart; but at
length, after he had disputed with himself, he said unto me with somewhat a more
quiet countenance, That not being able to change his mind, nor being able likewise to rid himself of the affection he bare me, he had found out an expedient
which I could not refuse him, unless I were resolved to incur his hatred; and
which he would grant me, if the <hi rend="italic">Muphti</hi>, who is the head of their Religion,
thought he might do it without offending the Prophet. He propounded then unto
me, only to take the habit of the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi>, to the end that being believed to be so, he
might confer Charges upon me, and keep me about him: And to perswade the
people that I had changed my Religion, he would so order it, that the <hi rend="italic">Muphti</hi>
should assure all the world, that he had performed the ceremony of it in private in
the Mosque of the Seraglio; that he was confident this man loved his head too
well to reveal a secret of so great importance; that in the mean time I might live
a Christian under the habit of a Mussulman, and render him the happiest Prince of
the Earth. I confess, that I had more ado to answer to this last proposition, than
to the other; howbeit I requested him to remember, that dissimulation was not to
go so far as to the Altars; that love and war did many times permit such things,
but that Religion required much sincerity; and that in the same which I professed, there was an express Commandment to publish it openly. I would have proceeded, but choler so surmouuted the Sultan, as I was constrained to hold my
peace, for fear of incensing him further. I well enough perceived, that amity had
still a place in his soul, maugre his fury; I saw tears of spight and kindness in his eyes, and how violent soever his discourse was he always intermingled things
amongst it, which made me easily discern, that he had an affection for me which
could never be destroyed. He said unto me then vvith a precipitated voyce, that I


<pb n="98" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="98     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

should make no further reply unto him; that all the grace he could do me was to
permit me to go and consult with the Patriarch of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, and the Religious men of <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>, about an occasion wherein they had as much interest as I; for it
may be, said he unto me, after I have favoured them so much in consideration of
thee, I may very vvell destroy them for the same cause, and on them revenge my
self of thy insensibility, and of the anger I am in for that I cannot leave loving
thee, to the end thou mightst punish thy self: But go, continued he, and let me
hear thy last resolution within two dayes: for otherwise I shall be able to take one
which may make thee repent, that thou hast so ill acknowledged the affection that
I still bear thee, maugre thy obdurateness. When he had given over speaking, I
withdrew with a profound respest, and considering with my self what I had to do,
it seemed just unto me not to rely upon mine own proper sense in a matter of so
great importance. Those menaces of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> would not have shaken me, had
they been addrest to none save my self, but the fear of involving so great a number
of innocents in a mischief, which ought not to have regarded any but me, made
me resolve to have recourse unto the reason of others, mine not being free enough,
nor sufficiently disinterested to operate justly in this incounter. The aversion
which I had for life, being absent from you, helped to perswade me too, that my
Religion permitted not that which was desired of me. I assembled then the Patriarch of the Greek Church, and his principall Calviers, for the Latin is not yet
established in <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>; and whereas I had seen them often times after I was
there, I propounded the matter unto them, with all the circumstances which I believed was necessary to tell them, to the end they might the better understand the
importance of the affair: I let them know the extreme affection which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
bare me; the menaces he used against them in consideration of me; the promises
I had received from him if I did that which he desired; at last I exposed the matter sincerely unto them just as it had past, and without disguising my sense I gave
them to understand, that provided they might be in safety, I should be glad they
would find that I could not satisfie <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> but with the loss of my life. They began a dispute then, which lasted a good while; they would not trust to their memories, but would look over their books, and not judge tumultuously of the affair.
The opinions were divided for an hour and more, and either side seemed to have
very strong reasons to maintain their party; but in the end the Patriarch told them,
that as amongst us we daily see religious men sent forth in the habit of Merchants,
or Cavaliers, for the converting of souls, so the same disguisement might be permitted to one, provided it were for the same cause, and that the sole interest of Christendom carried me to this deceit, which certainly would bring me to happiness
in heaven, and to glory on earth, if I could resolve to execute it generously; that
the power which I had over the spirit of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, might peradventure be so great,
as to make him doubt of his Religion; that it may be his conversion might be
reserved for me; and that if this should happen, it would render the greatest service to Christendom that ever was rendred unto it; that thereon peradventure
depended the safety of an hundred thousand persons; and that in conclusion his
advice was, that I could not fail in this occasion. This opinion being become generall amongst them, they conjured me to submit my sense to theirs, in satisfying
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and that they would ingage their consciences to me, that mine should be
discharged of all fault in this incounter, so as I let not my self be blinded with
greatness, and that the protestion of Christendom were the only motive that carried me to this disguisement. I did what I could to oblige them to change their
advice; I made an hundred objections, and an hundred demands to them; I told
them, that although I should not bear arms against Christendom, as I was fully resolved not to do, yet I should not alwayes forbear hurting it, if I served in other 
occasions, because I should still be augmenting the Turkish Empire. But they told
me, so as I carried the war to the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>, it would amuse <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> unprofitably for 
himself, and profitably for the Christians; for that the conquests which the Turks
made upon the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>, could never, through a kinde of extraordinary fate, be



<pb n="99" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="99     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

conserved by them; that in this sort occupying <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> in that war, it would deprive him of the means of turning his Arms against Christendom; that of two evills the least was alwayes to be chosen; and finally, that I should in my person answer for the miseries which should arrive unto them, if I did not yeeld a blind obedience to what they ordained, whenas I sufficiently knew that reason would have it to be so. I was forced then to follow their directions, and to go unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, after I had been instructed by them concerning all that I was to do. As for that Prince, when he had propounded the matter to the <hi rend="italic">Muphti</hi> in such terms as 
testified that he desired it, he that made no other use of the Religion whereot he
was the Head, but his own profit, failed not to tell the Sultan, out of the hope of a
recompence, that the thing was not only permitted, but was also meritorious, seeing it conducted to the service of the Ensure, which the Prophet had established.
As soon as the Sultan saw me, he came to me, and beholding me with a fixed eye,
he sought to know the thoughts of my heart by the motions of my face; but not
giving him leave to speak to me, I assured him that I came to obey him, provided
that his Higness would accord me three things which I desired of him. I had no
sooner said thus, but that without knowing what I would have, this Prince assured me that they were granted unto me; I besought him then to hear me first, to
the end that precipitating nothing I might never give him occasion to complain
of m. After he had given me the liberty to say what I would to him, I humbly
requested him not to take it ill, that being his Slave I should be so bold, as to capitulate with him, and give bounds to his Authority; for, my Lord, said I unto him,
I do not consent unto this disguisement, which thy Highness desires of me, but upon 
condition that thou shalt never speak to me to put that in effect, which I am going to do in shew; that thou wilt permit me to have always about me in the habit
of a Slave, a Priest of my Religion, whom I will procure to come from one of the
Ilands of the Archi-pelago; and that which is the most important, that thou shalt
never command me to bear Arms against Christendom: If any of thy Subjects,
said I to him further, shall rebell, as <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi>, if thou wik conquer <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>; if any other of thy Neighbours that is not Christian, shall oblige thee to make war upon
him, or if thou wilt render thy self Master of all the rest of the Orient, hold
me for the basest of thy Slaves if I spare either my blood, or my life, for the glory
of thy Arms. If thy goodness doth not refuse me this which I beg of thee on my
knees, dispose of me as thou pleasest, I am resolved to follow thy directions exactly, and to obey thee in all things. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was so contented with the obtaining
of that which he desired, as he swore unto me above an hundred times, that the
three things which I had demanded, should be inviolably observed. But not to lose
time, said he unto me, I will have thy change published presently, to the end the
people may not be surprised with it; in the mean space I will go and give order
for the <hi rend="italic">Muphti</hi> to come to me, and will command him to repair to thee eight
dayes one after another, to make the world think that he instrusts thee, and prepares thee for this Ceremony, which shall oblige thee to keep thy chamber the
whilst, the better to make it be believed that it will be performed. At length, Madam, not to prolong this discourse with vain repetitions, the business was done as
it had been propounded, and this dumb shew was so well carried, as no body beleeved it but to be so. As long as I kept the house I was visited by the chiefest of
the Empire, who judged rightly, that the affection of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having no other obstacle to hinder him from imploying me, would without doubt bring me into an
estate able to serve them, as indeed it was not long before I perceived that their
conjectures were true; for the second day after this imposture, I found, that I had
an house, a magnificent train, rich clothes, and to conclude an equipage proportionable to the imployment which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> gave me, by making me Generall of
the Army in the place of the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi>: And to testifie his amity the better unto
me, he gave me wherewith to render secretly to the Patriarch of <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, and
the rest that had counselled me, the Tribute which he had drawn from them the last three years, and caused also the foundadon of a Palace to be laid, which after-

<pb n="100" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="100     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

wards I finished. In the mean time he had taken care, that I should have troops
ready to march, when I had satisfied the civilities of the Ceremony, so that at
such time as I went first to salute him in a Turkish habit, I found that that, which
I believed should have been one of my ordinary visits, was a farewell for me to go
and command the Army of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>. I will not tell you, Madam, the joy which
this Prince shewed in this occasion, it was so great, as my tonguc hath not an expression powerfull enough to paint it forth unto you; but in the end to let you
see in what estate I was with him, I have but to tell you, that after he had fully instructed me about the affairs of <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, and that he had commanded me to take
upon me the Conduct of his Army, he told me, that to do me justice, and to punish the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> both for the cruelty he had before times used towards me, and
for the cowardise he had shewed, his pleasure was, that yeelding me his place, he
should withall take that in my service which I had held in his, namely, Madam,
that he should be my slave as I had been his. I must confess here, that without playing the generoso this proposition grieved me very much, and notwithstanding all
the respect I had to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, as soon as he acquainted me with his intention I cast
my self at his feet, humbly to besecch him not to command me the doing of so extraordinary a thing, nor to require, that a man who had been my Master, should
be reduced to misery and infamy; that for my part, I could never resolve to put
him in chains that had commanded me, and who, it may be, was more infortunate than faulty: I represented then unto him that the fate of war doth oftentimes mock at humane prudence; that force and number do not alwayes suffice to
have the better; and lastly, that victory doth not always attend upon valor and
justice. After all these reasons, which peradventure had not been potent enough to
move him, I begged the liberty and fortune of this man for a recompence of all
the services which I would render him, and besought him to be contented with absenting him from the Port, by sending him to be Governor of some one of his
Provinces. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> resisted my request at first, but afterwards consented thereunto,
upon condition that the Bassa should know how much he was obliged unto me;
then he gave me a Letter for him, whereby he was commanded to remit the remainder of his Army into my hands, and straightly imbracing me, Go, said he unto
me, my dear <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, whither thy glory calls thee, where mine requires thee, and
where victory attends thee: But when thou shalt be accumulated with honour,
when thou shalt have re-established that of my Arms, and triumphed over mine enemies, come and receive the recompence that I shall prepare for thee, and quietly
enjoy the fruit of thy labors. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> having observed some change in <hi rend="italic">Isabellaes</hi>
face, thought it was fit for him to say, I perceive, Madam, that this name of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> doth surprize and astonish you, but your astonishment will cease, when I shall
have told you, that in changing of habit I did not change my name, and that this
which I bear, is the same with that of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> amongst the Turks.  It is true, answered the Princess, that I was strangely surprized by this name, but it is true also,
that my astonishment is not yet finished; for could it be possible that you should be
that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> of whom the relations of the <hi rend="italic">Levant</hi> hath told us such wonders?
whose valour hath done such miracles, who hath conquered a part of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, gained so many great battails, caused <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to bc crowned at <hi rend="italic">Bagdet</hi>, and who passeth
for so extraordinary a man, as it is not believed the Orient hath ever had the like.
Now, I pray you, hold me no longer in suspence, but after you have cleared that
unto me which I ask of you,  pursue the sequele of your History, and acquaint me
exactly with all that hath befallen you. I know very well, Madam, replyed <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, that after that which you have said, I should, if I were modest, dis avow my
self, but being true and sincere I must confess,that I am that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> whom fame hath
so much flattered, as I cannot tell how to know my self by the pourtrait which
your Excellency hath made of me by her report: Rely not then upon that which
this deceiver hath told you, and to make you the Iudge thereof do but give ear
to the process of my adventures. As soon as I was arrived at <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi> with the
Troops which the Grand Signior had given me to conduct thither, I went directly



<pb n="101" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="101     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

to <hi rend="italic">Chientaia</hi>, from whence the Bassa <hi rend="italic">Sinan</hi> had not stirred since his retiring to it, having done nothign else but incamped the remainder of his Army neer to the Town, in attending either Forces, or a new Order; I sent him that which I had brought, by a <hi rend="italic">Capigi</hi>, which he executed very punctually; he configured the Army into my hands, and gave me thanks for the obligations wherein he stood ingaged unto me; for he had understood by the Sultans Letter, that I had saved him from an extreme ill fortune. I comforted him the best I could, and promised him, that if the Emperor continued his favour to me, I would continue also to serve him. After this I imployed all my care to carry my self in such sort, that the hopes which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had of me might not be frustrated. I caused my Army to be mustered, and having put it into Battell Array, I went from rank to rank to visit all the Troups, and incouraged them to do well, (for I had learnt the language of the
Countrey perfectly) I assured them, that in leading them to the fight, I would be
the first that would be ingaged therein; that I would perform the part of the souldier, as well as of the Generall of the Army; that I would reserve my self nothing of all the booty which should be gotten from the enemy, but the sole pleasure of having inriched them.  After this discourse, they made shouts of joy,
which perswaded me that I was agreeable to them. Then came all the Commanders
to take the Oath of Obedience to me, and to assure me that they would follow me
to the death: That done, I marched directly to the enemy, who was not above fifteen or twenty miles from us; but whereas he had been advertised that the Slave
which had taken <hi rend="italic">Chientaia</hi>, was Generall of the Army that was comming to attaque him, the remembrance of what had past made him to fear that which was to
insue, and for that reason he discamped in hast, with a purpose to retire to a side of
<hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, where it had been impossible to have forced him to fight.  When I perceived his design by the way his Army took, I resolved to prevent him, by causing
my forces to march a whole night with all possible speed: The matter succceded so
happily, that my Army having had leisure to rest three or four hours, began to
see that of <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> appear, who being soon advertised  of this warlike
stratagem, entred into such despair for having been surprised in this sort, as he resolved to accept of the Battell which I presented unto him. I was glad to understand his design, and to inspire my Souldiers with the same thought, I assured
them, after I had given order for all things, that the justice of the cause we defended was a presage of the victory; that it was easier to punish Rebels, who carried
a domestique enemy in their hearts, which reproached them with their crime,
than to vanquish men whose Arms were lawfull; that they whom we were to fight
with, being resolved for it more by fear and necessity, than by valour, it would be
but too easie for our glory to remain victorious: I represented also unto them,
that the travail they had endured in going so fast, was not disadvantageous unto
them, it being most certain, that they which fly are wearied more than they which
pursue them; that the end of the War depending on this battell, I was resolved
to vanquish or to dye; and that all the favour I demanded of them was, to follow the way which I was going to shew them. I had no sooner done speaking,
but they testified unto me, both by their shouts and by their actions, their desire
to fight; so that not suffering so noble a heat to cool, I marched on foremost to the
Enemy. I will not stand, Madam, to particularize this battell, since it would be
to abuse your patience, and be wanting in good manners, to entertain you so long
with matters of war; it shall suffice then to tell you that which regards me directly, seeing you will have it so, although it be not without blushing. Wherefore I
shall only say, Madam, that at first the enemies received us couragiously, and that
they repulsed us severall times with such ardour, as despair did more in them than
valour in us; butafterthatthe victory had hung ballancing on either side, and
that the hope of carrying it had possessed each party more than once, it was my
good fortune, maugre the confusion of the fight, to know <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> by the marks
which had been given me of him. He was of a reasonable extraordinary bigness,
and his custom was to carry alwayes two Scymitars in the wars, the one in his

<pb n="102" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="102     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

hand, and the other at his saddle-bow; he was also many times armed after the
<hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> manner, so as no way doubting but that it was he, I brake through the press
to meet him, and calling him by his name, I told him, that the same Slave, who
before had vanquished him in his chains, was come to make him satisfaction for
that outrage in Arms; I spake to him in this sort, because I had understood that in
a speech to his souldiers, after he had heard that I was Generall ofthe Army, he had
told them in a jeering way, that I was still so tired with wearing of irons, as it
would be easie for him to overcome me: Howbeit fortune disposed of it otherwise, not because he was not a more valiant man than I, but because I was more fortunate than he. As soon as he understood that which I have told you, he seconded
my design; and that we might the better enter into a particular fight we freed our
selves, as well as we could, from those that invironed us, and being separated from
the rest, we began our combat. I doubt not, Madam, but you will be astonished with
that which I am going to acquaint you with, since it is certain, that one will have
much adoe not to be surprized with a thing which hath no example in all Antiquity, and which your imagination would not fore-see. It hapned then, Madam,
that some of ours having observed this action, and having told it to their companions, this rumour spread it self so suddenly amongst the two Armies, that as if
those two great bodies had had but one spirit, which had animated them, they took
both of them the same resolution, and confided so in the valor of their Chieftains,
as they determined to be spectators of the victory, which they attended from them.
They of my party said, that they would not share the glory of this day with me,
and that I would carry it away well enough without their succour; and others
muttered, that he who had known so well how to begin the war, knew also how to
finish it gioriously. At length, Madam, the most earnest to fight, separated themselves to behold us; and as is there had been some inchantment in this adventure,
every one retired to his own Ensign, and in an instant the field of our combat proved to be in the midst of two Armies in Battell Array. This event surprised me in
such sort, as it had like to have coft me my life; for whereas, maugre the heat of
the fight, I had conserved so much coldness and judgement, as to mark what was
done, and to be astonished at it, going to turn about my head towards my souldiers
to give them assurance that I fought for thera, I furnished mine enemy with such an
opportunity, as being loath to lose that advantage, he struck me so great a blow
with his Scymitar upon my Turbant, as I was almost bereft of my senses, and if by
good hap it had not turned in his hand, I had certainly been lost: Hereupon arose
cries from both parties, which amidst their confusion testified their thoughts unto
us; and whereas mine had observed, that I had received this blow by looking at
them, they would have advanced, which I perceiving by the enemies countenance,
I separated my self some dozen or fourteen paces from <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> to charge them not
to stir, and to confirm them in that design I returned to <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> with such courage,
as they were perswaded it would not be easie for him to surmount me. Howbeit
we disputed this victory a long time, and verily this man combated with such heart,
as gave me a great desire to save him; so that his horse having thrown him to the
ground upon a blow that I unwittingly gave him, I told him that if he would render himself I would promise to get his pardon of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; but being got up again
with fury, and having answered me, that he would have the victory, or die, I
would not combat him with advantage, so that being alighted from my horse we
began a new fight, which was more infortunate for him than the former: For feelling my self hurt in the left arm, the desire which I had to vanquish redoubled in
such manner, as in a little time his death put fear into his Army, and joy into mine.
Some of his seeing him fall would have advanced to revenge his loss, or to recover his body, but they were so rudly repulsed, as they were constrained to change
that design into that of breaking and flying: I then commanded my men to cry
out in pursuing them, that they should be received to grace which would render themselves; this voyce failed not to work its effect, for out of the despair wherein they were, for having lost not only the Generall of their Army, but the Au-

<pb n="103" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="103     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

thor of all this war, many of them flung down their Arms; the rest were cut in
pieces, some excepted that retired into the revolted Towns; but I can say, that
they which escaped the pursuit of our Forces contributed not the least to our glory,
for they brought so great a terror to the places which they had chosen for their
retreat, as in fifteen dayes they rendred all to the obedience of the Grand Signior.
In the mean time to make good my word, and to follow the custom of those Countreyes, I sent the head of <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who doubtless was not so glad at the
death of his enemy for the interest he had in it, as he was because he believed that
this action was glorious to me: And whereas he had an extreme desire to see me,
I had order to return unto <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> as soon as <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi> should be peaceable, and
that I had secured all the revolted places. I was not long before I was in an estate
to obey him, for whereas <hi rend="italic">Zellebis</hi> was the onely man that remained of the Race of
<hi rend="italic">Chaz-hassen</hi>, so considerable with the <hi rend="italic">Calenders</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Deruis</hi>, there vvas no one
found amongst them vvhom the rest vvould obey; the equality of their birth and
condition vvas the cause that never a one in particular vvould indure that another
should command, and this dissension put them into such disorder, as they were
more revolted amongst themselves, than against their Soveraign. I profited by the
advertisement I received hereof, for <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having sent me an absolute power to
pardon, or to punish, I commanded them to yeeld, promising to make their peace
with the Grand Signior, but threatning that if they did not accept of the pardon
which I offered them, to extirpate them utterly, and to cause all the <hi rend="italic">Deruis</hi>, and
all the <hi rend="italic">Calenders</hi> to be banished from out of the whole extent of the Turkish Empire. This was done in a conjuncture so favourable, that they all with one voyce
resolved to render themselves; there was not a Town which did not open their
Gates, receive a Governor from my hand, and a Garrison strong enough to keep
them from rebelling another time; and for more surety, I caused all the <hi rend="italic">Deruis</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Calenders</hi> to be disarmed, representing unto them, that the profession of men of
Religion did not permit them to have Arms; and that their crime could not receive a lighter punishment, than to be contented that the means of their future offending should be taken from them. At length, Madam, after I had set an order to
all things, I returned to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, where for a recompence of that little I had
done, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> made me Bassa, and Grand Visier, which is the prime Charge of
that Empire; for it had so fallen out, that he who possessed it died in my absence.
I did all that I could to refuse this honor, but in the end I was constrained to
accept of it, both by the Commandment of the Grand Signior, and by the counsell of the Religious men of <hi rend="italic">Pera</hi>, and of the Patriarch of the Greek Church,
whom I still acquainted with all that befell me, by a Priest disguised like a slave,
which alwayes attended on me, alleging this reason to me for it, that the more
power I had, the more utile I should be for Christendom. Behold me then the first
person of the Empire next to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, but with an Authority so absolute, as never
was there Subject seen so independent from his Soveraign. I was some time instructing my self in the Forms and Ceremonies that are to be observed in dispatches; after which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> reposed himself on me for the Government of his
Estates, except it were for so much as concerned the affairs of Christendom, which
I alwayes protected as much as possibly I could. In the mean season this Prince
thought many times on <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, extremely marvelling at the long voyage of <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, upon vvhose comming he had placed a great deal of hope; but fortune that often delighteth in extraordinary things, and loves to give weak beginnings to the most important affairs, had disposed of it in a fashion which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> did not foresee: And how prudent soever he was, he did not consider, that Love and Fortune, who were to give success to this adventure, were two Deities too blinde to bestow all that he desired on him, although he deserved it; and indeed he was deceived by them both, for he was amazed to see <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> return very melancholick, without Slaves, vvithout Souldiers, vvithout a Vessell, and vvithout <hi rend="italic">Felizana</hi>. At first
he believed that his design having been discovered all his equipage had been taken
from him, and that he had been ill intreated; but vvhen he had commanded him



<pb n="104" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="104     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

to give him an accompt of his voyage, he learned, that the business had past in another manner; for <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had been so dextrous, and so happy in his enterprize as
he had forcibly carried away the person whom the picture which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had given him represented: But, Madam, this person was not <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, and this adventure is so deplorable, that although it be not intermingled with my fortune but
onely in regard it is the foundation as a war, which I am obliged to relate, yet
would I let you understand it, seeing you will bc acquainted with the whole course
of my life, did I not fear to importune you with so long a Narration. The Princess interrupting <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, desired him not to speak to her any more in this sort
and to tell her, not only all that which had befallen him, but all that which he
knew concerning the life of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; it seeming unto her, that this Princess loved him too well not to have his History joyned to his; whereupon <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> began thus.

<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">The History of the Princess</hi> Axiamira.</head>
<p>AS soon as <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, after he had quitted his Vessell in <hi rend="italic">Mingrelia</hi>, and had taken
another upon the River of <hi rend="italic">Araxes</hi>, was arrived with his souldiers disguised
at <hi rend="italic">Mazanderon</hi>, which is a Town situated on the bank of the <hi rend="italic">Caspian</hi> Sea, and the
Capitaill of <hi rend="italic">Hircania</hi>, at this day called <hi rend="italic">Diargument</hi>, and had cast anchor in the
Port, he understood that the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> had been there a pretty while, although it was not as yet the season wherein she used to come thither; but for some
disorder which had hapned in the Sophies Court she had advanced her voyage.
<hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, seeing such a wonderfull good hap for the commencement of his enterprize, thought of nothing else but to seek the means how he might be introduced into the Castle, for the which he began to fall in with the Merchants of the
place, and to part with some things that he had brought thither, at a price much
below the ordinary, to the end his design might succeed the rather; as indeed
he had not been eight dayes in the Town, but he received order to let the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> see the goodliest things he had; he obeyed this commandment
with joy, being in good hope that <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> was with her: He carried her then a
great many Mirrors, little Pictures, and curious Watches, which are the rarest things
amongst the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>; but he was exceedingly surprised and astonished whenas waiting in <hi rend="italic">Axiamiraes</hi> chamber for her coming out of her Cabinet, he heard one call a
maid, that had brought him in, <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, who, though she was very fair, resembled
not a whit the pourtrait which he had: this amazement doubtless was great enough,
but it redoubled more whenas the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> entred into the chamber, and
that he certainly knew she was the Originall of that fatal Picture, which hath since
caused the shedding of so much blood, and so many tears. He was so struken with
this sight, that at first it gave the Princess occasion to think, that being a Merchant,
and not accustomed to converse with great persons, he was out of countenance;
howbeit at length he told her in the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> tongue, that within a little while he
should have rarer things yet to shew her, hoping by this artifice to have the opportunity to see the Princess once again, the better to confirm him in the belief that
what he beheld was true. <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, giving credit to his words, bought onely
a Looking-glass, and some Watches, and then ordained him not to fail in letting
her have a sight of those rarides he spoke of, as soon as they were come to his
hands. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> retired in this sort, but so full of confusion and astonishment, as he
was a long time before he could beleeve that which he had seen, and longer yet
before he could resolve upon what to do in so unexpected an event. What! sayd
he to himself, as he told me after his return, is it possible that <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> should be
turned into <hi rend="italic">Aximira</hi>? that the daughter of the Governour of <hi rend="italic">Mazanderon</hi> should
become the daughter of the Sophy of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>? or that through an extraordinary adventure a Merchant should be so daring as to assure a thing to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, whereof he
was not well assured himself? Hereupon having opened the case wherein the Pi-

cture was, which the Grand Signior had given him, and also recollecting his imagination and his memory, for the comparing of it with the originall, and for the
observing of all the lineaments in particular, his eyes so confirmed him in the belief, that it was the Picture of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, as he made no longer doubt of it. Then it was, that he saw himself combated with divers thoughts; for whereas he is ambitious, hardy, cunning, and wicked, and that to attain to a glorious imployment, would undertake any thing; the fear of displeasing <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> either in venturing to carry <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> forcibly away, or in returning without doing oughts, agitated him
so mightily, as he was ten or twelve daies sick upon it, during which time he did nothing but pass up and down in his mind all the reasons that might induce him,
either to the forcible carrying away of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, or to the restraining him from it:
On the one side he thought, that the Grand Signior having made choice of him for
the service of his amorous pashon, he should be but badly received, if at his return
he only brought back for the fruit of his voyage, that <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> resembled not the
picture which had been given him; He feared also that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s hope being frustrated, that which he had of being <hi rend="italic">Beglerbei</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Syria</hi> would be so too; Wherefore
regarding the matter after another sort, he laboured to find anothers satisfaction
in his own. But the more he considered the design of carrying away of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> by force, the more obstacles he found therein; he was not powerfull enough
to force the Town or Castle, and the retiredness wherein the women live over all
the Orient, permitted him not the means to work upon any of those that were neer
the Princess for the suborning them: But above all things, the sole apprehension
that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should not approve of his design,and should be offended to understand,
that instead of forcibly carrying away the daughter of a simple Governour, he
should have forcibly carried away that of one of the mightiest Princes of the
world, put him into an unquietness that cannot be exprest; and I verily believe
by that which I could conjecture out of his own relation, that this last fear had
absolutely mastered his soul, and carried him to return without enterprizing further, had not the misfortune of the unhappy <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> made him change his opinion, and brought her to contribute her self to her own ruin, without thinking
of it. This excellent Princess took so much pleasure in fishing, and was so delighted with this sport, as there were few fair dayes which she imployed not in this
maritime chase; and whereas all <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> was quiet, having no war either domestick
or forein, she went to this innocent warfare, more accompanied with fisher-men
than souldiers, and almost without other arms than nets and hooks. During the
time that <hi rend="italic">Rustans</hi> sickness lasted, he observed that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was two or three days
a fishing, and having dextrously informed himself from some Merchants who
dealt with him, that the Princess used oftentimes so to do, he understood what I
have declared, so that no longer judging this design, which he had believed to be
impossible, other than a little hazardous, and having a Vessell that was an excellent Sayler, well furnished with all things, and never a Mariner but which was a
Souldier, he looked on this affair after another manner, and out of an extreme
inhumanity he reasoned in this sort. I have order from <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, said he, to put
him in possession of the Originall of this Picture; it is not the name of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>
that makes him amorous, it is the beauty of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> which he hath seen in this pourtrait; it is then <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> whom I am forcibly to carry away: It is true, that
she is a Princess, but it is also true, that therein fortune favors me, in giving me
the means to acquire a treasure for <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> far more precious than he beleived it to be; the boldness of my enterprize will make the greatness of my recompence,
and will manifest to his Highness, that there is nothing which I would not do to
obey him. Behold, Madam, the unjust reasons wherewith <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> authorised his enterprize, but the true were, as I have already said, that he hath naughty inclinations; that he is born for crime and violence; and that he is so much an enemy to goodness, as it sufficeth to be vertuous for to be hated of him. He took the resolution then to carry away <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> by force, at such time as she should go a fishing; but to faciliate his design he judged it fit to get him out of the Port, and to the

<milestone n="106     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

end they should not marvail at his departure, he to obtain permission for it caused
the Princess to be told, that having received advertisement how a vessell of his
Country was within three or four daies to be at a Port that was not above ten
miles from <hi rend="italic">Mazanderon</hi>, he was resolved to go and wait for it there, to deal for some
commodities vvhich he thought he had had, but had forgot to bring along vvith
him; that at his return he vvould not fail to let her see the rarities, whereof he had
spoken, not being able to do it sooner by reason of his sickness: And to shew that
he intended to return again, he suffered himself to be unpayd by some Merchants
that were in his debt. He parted then in this manner, leaving the Princess very desirous of his return, in regard of her inclinations to such rare things; but whereas he had no design to eloign himself much, and had observed how the Princess
used ordinarily to take that way whereby he came thither, he put his vessell into
the covert of a Creek three miles from the Port, where the point of a Rock advanced so far into the sea, as they that came from the Towns side could not see them
which were there, before they were so near as they could not decline a fight. It was
here where <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> resolved to attend the Princess, being confident that she vvould
not be long before she came thither, because he knevv it was the place most proper
for her sport: In the mean time to beguile the vessels, which passing by might discover him, he set up the Flag of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> in his Main-top, and caused all his men that
appeared on the deck to change their habit; for the cunning of this man had provided for all things, and had not omitted ought that could conduce to the happy success of so mischievous a design. Now accordingly this deplorable Princess,
no way doubting of the treason that was intended against her, resolved the next
day after <hi rend="italic">Rustans</hi> departure, to recreate her self on the sea; but to make up her misfortune, she would not that day go a fishing, but onely take the air, and pass away
the time more freely with her women. In the mean season <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had made a
speech to his souldiers and Mariners, vvhom he had gained with gifts, to encourage
them to well-doing, is it hapned that he should command them to attacque a
vessel. He told them, that what he desired of them was the least exploit he could
expect from their valour, since it was a vessel without Ordnance, and more laden
with women than souldiers; that above all things they should beware of doing
any outrage to the Ladies; but for the men, that they should not spare them, it
being necessary that none should escape which might testifie ought concerning this
Action. After this he set a sentinell on the top of the Rock to discover when
<hi rend="italic">Axiamiraes</hi> vessell should come out of the Port, for to advertise him of it. The
impatience of this Ravisher lasted not long; for, as I have already declared, the
next day after his departure, the Princess resolved to go and take the air: no
sooner was she on the sea, but the sentinell advertised <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> of it, who with all
speed fitted his ship, and prepared his men to do that which he had commanded
them. Scarcely had he given order for every thing, whenas the Princesses vessell
appeared; she was sitting in the Stern upon Cushions of cloth of Gold, with all
her women about her, and attired like an <hi rend="italic">Amazon</hi>, as her picture represented her,
having a Dart in her right-hand, upon which she leaned: As soon as she perceived
<hi rend="italic">Rustans</hi> vessel, she rose up suddainly to observe it, as if she had foreseen what was
to arrive unto her; this first apprehension was quickly seconded by another more
grievous one; for just as the Princess rose up, <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> changed the design he had of
following her, that so he might draw her the further from the Town, into that
of setting upon her immediately, so that he commanded his men to make up with
full sails to the vessell, and board her, expresly forbidding any Ordnance to be shot
off, for fear of losing that which he meant to preserve, and that the Castle too might
not thereby take up an Alarum, and come to the succour of the Princess. This
was not so soon sayd as executed; <hi rend="italic">Axiamiraes</hi> vessell was boorded by that of <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, who first of all leaped into her, for to save the Princess from perill, and to encourage his men, which seconded him so happily, as the resistance of <hi rend="italic">Axiamiraes</hi>
Guard was in vain; the surprise and astonishment wherewith they were seised,
served not a little to make them be so easily vanquished; for in a quarter of an hours


<pb n="107" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="107     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

fight they were all slain, <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> not having above three of his people hurt. But when he would have had the Princess remove out of her vessel into his, she shewed more heart than her souldiers had done, and encouraging her women to defend themselves, and to endure rather to be killed, than to let themselves to be carried away, she advanced towards him with the Dart in her hand, and whatsoever he could do to restrain her, being loth to use her unworthily in her misfortune, he could not keep her from hurting him in the face: But whereas he saw that his respect might be the cause of his undoing, in retaining him too long in so dangerous a place, he commanded four of his souldiers to quit their weapons, and take her up in their Arms, and carry her into his vessell. Then it was when she redoubled her uttermost indeavour, and that with incredible courage, she would have rid her self out of their hands to have leapt into the sea; but <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> took so much care to preserve her, as he hindred her from it. As soon as her women savv that their resistance was vain, and that the Princess was in <hi rend="italic">Rustans</hi> vessell, they left defending themselves, and out of an affection which cannot be sufficiently admired, 
they strove who should first pass into their enemies vellell, so much did they fear to
abandon their Mistress, chusing much rather to be slaves with her, than to remain
free without her. After this <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> held it necessary to sink the Princesses vessell,
which was instantly done, but he thought it was not fit to cast the dead bodies into
the sea, for fear lest some of them being driven a shoar by the waves should be a
sign that the Princess had not suffered shipwrack, as he desired it should be beleeved, in regard they would be all found full of wounds. He caused all the dead bodies then to be carried into his vessel, with an intention when they should be
further off, to throw them over-boord in sacks half filled with some heavy things,
which afterwards was accordingly executed. When they had sunk the Princesses
vessell, he commanded his Pilot to steer towards <hi rend="italic">Mingrelia</hi>, and to employ all his
skill in making thither with all the possible speed he could; he gave order also to
his souldiers to keep themselves continually ready to fight, and unto two of his
men carefully to watch for the discovery of whatsoever should appear at sea, and
presently to advertise him of it. This done, he went to the Princess, whom they
had put into the Captains Cabbin, but he was much amazed to find her in a swoon;
her striving, and the grief she was in to see her self so carried away, had so weakned, and oppressed her, as she was without pulse, without motion, and almost without life. The resentment which <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> shewed for it, and the care he took to
assist her, though it was rather the effect of his interest than of his pitty, caused the
Princesses women to have some comfort amidst their misfortune: They laboured
all of them together then to make her come to her self again; and a little after she
assured them by a deep sigh, that she would soon be sensible of all her miseries; and
accordingly within a while she opened her eyes; but not being longer able to make
any resistance, and seeing <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> by her, whom she knew, though she had never beheld him but once before, and that he had changed his habit, she was constrained to
have recourse unto her tears. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> seeing her in this estate, fell on his knees before her to ask her pardon for the wrong he did her, and to beseech her to beleeve,
that so sad a beginning would have a most happy end. He told her likewise, that
he was not what she thought him to be; that he operated by a more powerfull hand than his own; and that if her grief would permit her to give ear unto that, which might confort her, she would quickly dry up her tears. This Princess striving to answer him, said unto him with a low voice, that there was no vvay to confort her, but to assure her, that she should die without the deprivation of her honour and liberty, and without falling into the hands of <hi rend="italic">Deliment</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> swore unto her then, that he knew not that <hi rend="italic">Deliment</hi> of whom she spake, and protested, that
far from doing her any violence, he would serve her with all respest, beseeching
her once again to suspend her grief untill she had learnt the cause of her misfortune. This cheater spake this with a face wherein compassion and sincerity were so
well painted forth, as sollicited again by her women, she resolved to hear him:
But he first desired that she would give them order to withdraw a little aside, to the



<pb n="108" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="108     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

end that none but she might understand what he said unto her. She made some difficulty to agree thereunto, but at length she was forced to obey. He recounted to
her then, how her unhappiness was an effect of her beauty; but he did not tell her
that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had loved her under the name of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, onely he acquainted her
that her picture had begot this love, and consequently the design which he had executed; howbeit he perceived that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> did not beleeve him, so that to perswade
her the better, he shewed her picture to her, which she presently knew, and calling
her women to her to look upon it, she put them in mind, how the Sophy having
caused her to be drawn one day with <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> by an excellent Painter, whom fortune had brought into their country, he had commanded many coppies to be made
of them, which he had given to Merchants for the publishing of her beauty all abroad, and that of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> whom he infinitely loved. Upon this discourse <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>
was no longer troubled to conceive, how <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> had been taken for <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>,
easily imagining that a Merchant, who it may be understood not the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> tongue
very well, might be deceived in taking the picture of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> for that of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, and that of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> for that of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, and much the rather, for that the Merchant had got those pictures without ever seeing the Princess, as we came to know
afterwards. But to return to this afflicted fair one, after that <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had acquainted her with the cause of her misfortune, he would have inlarged himself upon the
magnificences of the Seraglio, upon the excellent qualities of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, upon the
excess of the passion which he was in for her, and have perswaded her that her unhappiness would make her happy. But this generous Princess, not able to endure a
discourse so far distant from her sense, sayd unto him with a voice much stronger,
than the weakness wherein she was would seem to permit her; do you beleeve then,
that a person which might have succceded to the Crown of Persia, can resolve to be
the slave of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>? to spend her life in prison? and to have for her companions
infamous creatures, who are for the most part the refuse of Pyrates? No, no, <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> came not into the world but to reign, and her death shall make it soon appear,
that she knows not how to obey: Fortune hath put me into your hands, but mine
shall deliver me out of them. After this she mused a pretty while very profoundly,
<hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> not daring to answer her for fear of further incensing her ; then suddenly
speaking again, and addressmg her self to him, Can I hope, sayd shee unto him,
for any sincerity in a man that hath so cruelly betrayed<sic>?</sic> me and can I beleeve that
what he hath told me is true? for how can it be imagined that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, whose reputation is so great and so fair, should be capable of causing an innocent Princess to
be forcibly carried away for to make her his slave? and how can it yet be conceived, that this Prince, who is sayd to be so amorous of a certain <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi>, and
who hath loved her so long, could be in a passion for a picture, yea in such a passion as hath obliged him to violate the law of Nations, to forget naturall equity, to
outrage a Prince as mighty as himself, and to do an act so strange as it is without
example in all Ages? Tell me then, I conjure you, said she unto him, the true cause
of my disaster, and hide not from me that which time will clear unto me but too
well. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> seeing her mind a little quieter in all appearance, thought he might
gain her by gentleness; wherefore he assured her with all the artifice that possibly
he could use; how all that which he had told her was true, but how it was true
also, that the image of the Seraglio, which seemed so dreadfull unto her, was a meer
effect of her grief; that all the grace he would demand of her was no other, but
that she would live untill she had seen <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, which favour if he might obtain of
her, he was well assured, that the sight of so excellent a Prince would make her
change her opinion. Yes, said she, interrupting him, I will live, if my grief will
permit it; but I will live only to seek out the means how to revenge the death, that
I will give my self, as soon as my complaints and cryes have made some one to
know the outrage which I have received, to the end that the report thereof being
bruited abroad, the Sophy my Father may, by learning the cause of my loss, take
such revenge for it, as Heaven doth promiso me, and which also I beg of it: Behold then what I accord to your desires, in the mean time, if pitty may yet find any

<milestone n="109     The Illustrious BASSA.     OOK 5." ed="1652"/>

place in your soul, leave me to weep with my women, and refuse me not the grace that I may be permitted to bewail them for the miseries which I have brought them to, and to prepare them for my death; but if your inhumanity doth carry you not to grant me this that I desire, as me-thinks I observe in your countenance, remember that birth not depending on fortune, I am still the daughter of the Sophy of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, and that you are but a Slave, who doubtless have nothing more recommendable in <sic>yon</sic>, than fraud and cunning wherewith to serve the violences of your Master; get you out of this Chamber then, and enter no more unto it, till the hour of my death be come; for surely the rank which I hold doth ordain you to have so much respect unto me, who commands you unto it. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> who had no other interest in the carrying away of this Princess, but that of conducting her to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>,
fearing nothing more than to see her die before she
should arrive at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, was affraid in hearing her speak so imperiously, that
she would have fallen into some extreme resolution, if he should have contradicted
her, wherefore he went out of her chamber, and assured her, that she should see by
his respect, that he had not forgotten what he owed unto her: But first he took
heed with a great deal of care, not to leave any thing wherewith she might hurt her
self, which she perceiving said further unto him. You may take from me iron, sire,
and poison, but not the will to die, and by it I shall alwayes find means to execute
my design: <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> would return her no answer, knowing full well that she was
not in an estate to be perswaded. After this he caused her to be served very carefully without ever entring into her chamber, yet did he for the most part hear all
that she said to her women; for fearing left she should offer to get out of the Cabbin for to go and cast her self into the Sea, he lay alwayes at the Cabbin-door,
not daring to trust any body with the guard of a treasure from whence he hoped
for all his fortune. I will not recount unto you the generous and pitifull discourses
of this infortunate Princess during this voyege, since it would but augment the
regret, which you will have for her loss: For, Madam, after a Navigation prosperous enough; after they had passed over all the <hi rend="italic">Caspian</hi> Sea by gayning the Coast; on
the left hand; after they had arrived at the River of <hi rend="italic">Araxes</hi>, which disimbokes it
self into this Sea; had traversed by Land thorough the Whole Countrey of <hi rend="italic">Colchi<unclear>e</unclear>da</hi>, now called <hi rend="italic">Mingrolia</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> betook him to his former Vessell again, 
which had stayed still for him there; had travelled <hi rend="italic">Mare major</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Pontus E<unclear>a</unclear>xin<unclear>u</unclear>s</hi>
from one end to another in its length; after that, I say, they were come to the <hi rend="italic">Bospherus</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Thrace</hi>, in a place where they even touched the shoar, there arose so furious a wind, as they were constrained to take in all their sails. And whereas the Pilot had advertised <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, that he forc-saw the comming of a great storm, and that
within an hour at the furthest, he thought that in regard they were not far from a
place where the Skiff might easily land, it would not be amiss to perswade the
Princess to go ashoar, seeing they were within <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> Dominion, and where they
needed not fear to abandon their Vessell. He caused then one of the Princesses
women to be called unto him for to acquaint her with the perill wherewith they
were threatned, that she might propound unto her the avoyding of it by the means
which I have related; this Maid, who out of the fear of death approved of <hi rend="italic">Rustans</hi> proposition, did all that she could to get her Mistress to imbrace it: But this
couragious Princess said unto her with an admirable constancy, that she was resolved to attend the succor of Heaven, imagining indeed, that the storm wherewith
she was threatned, could bring no alteration to her fortune which would not be
advantagious to her. Daring this contestation the Sea was moved in such sort, as
it was out of all probability, had the Princess consented to what they desired of
her, for one to think that she could be saved in the Skiff; the tempest was so furious, the ayr so obscured, the thunder so loud, the lightning amidst the darkness so
dreadfull, the waves so high, the winds so terrible, the rain and hail so abundant,
and the roaring of the Sea so horrible, as it was impossible for one to conceive any hope of escaping from so evident a danger. They were two days beaten in this manner with the tempest, and tossed up and down with the wind and the waves,




<pb n="110" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="110     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

without ceasing in the mean time to use their uttermost indeavour to with-stand it;
but at last they were fain to give way to this violence, and refer their lives to the
conduct of fortune. Already had the Pilot abandoned the Helm, his Compass stood
him in no stead, the Mast was all to shattered, the Sayl-yards torn off, the Tackle
rent in pieces, the Vessell took in water on every side, the souldiers cried out in
despair, the Mariners abandoned themselves to grief, the Princesses women were
all dissolved into tears, <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> himself had almost lost his understanding, whenas
in the midst of so generall a consternation he heard the Princess cry unto him with
a quiet spirit, and with a setled and consident voyce; at length <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> shall not
be a Slave, she shall dye with glory, Heaven is armed for her succour, and (if I deceive not my self) her death shall be the cause of her revenge.  Scarcely had she
finished these words, whenas an hideous wave hitting the Vessell with an unexpressable impetuosity, dashed it with such violence against the point of a Rock, as
they suffered shipwrack in that very place.  I will not tell you. Madam, that which
<hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> himself could not tell us, for this misfortune was so sudden, as in an instant
he found, that of all his Vessell he had  nothing left him but a plank which
floated to his hand, as he was labouring in the water, and wherewith he saved his
life by sustaining himself upon it; for this man was so fortunate, as without other
industry than strongly fastning himself to this plank, the Sea (which according to
its custom retains nothing of all the rapines that it makes) cast him on the shoar,
where he remained almost in a swoon till the tempest was over, which was not long
first; so as it might have been said, that this Princess had served for an oblation
to pacifie the fury of the incensed waters; for two hours after she had suffred shipwrack, the Sun beginning to appear, dissipated the darkness of the night, and the
tempest, and restored calmness and tranquillity to the Sea. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, being wholly
come to himself again, got up to the side of a Rock to see if he could discover any mark of so sad a wrack, but he could discover no other thing than some of the
Tackle and Planks of his Vessell, which the waves had brought to Land, so that despairing of any comfort he went to the ihabitation that was nearest to the place
where he was, and stayed these certain days to make search, if at least the body of
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> might have been found, as also to meet with some means for him to return to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>: As for the Pcincess, all his care in vain, he found indeed some
dead Souldiers and Mariners along the shoar, but of her he never could have any tidings; so that the unhappy <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> is doubtless without life, and without sepulture. In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> thinking of his return, although he were neer to a
place where Prince <hi rend="italic">Gianger</hi>, the youngest of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s sonnes was residing, yet would
he not demand any assistance from him, for fear he should be obliged to tell him a
thing which was to be concealed; wherefore he had recourse to the Governor of
<unclear>a s</unclear>mall Town that was not above four miles from thence where he had suffred shipwrack, who furnishing him with all things requisite for his journey, he returned
by Land to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> with so melancholick a countenance, as at first sight one
might easily perceive that his enterprize had not been prosperous: I was at that
time with his Highness, and I have not lost the remembrance of so dolefull a conversation. As soonas <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had made an end of relating to the Grand Signior
that which you have heard, he would have excused hmiself for having forcibly
carried away <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> without his order, but <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> said unto him with a face
wherein grief and choller equally appeared, Speak no further unto me thou base
and infamous ravisher, and know, that if thou hadst not maried my daughter <hi rend="italic">Chimeria</hi>,
thy death should have satisfied for that of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>. Ah poor Princess,
said he, how deplorable is thy face! and how unhappy is mine! Then turning
himself to towards me, who was present at this mournfull relation, do not reproach
me, my dear <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, said he unto me, for not giving credit to thy counsell, which
I remember but too well for my content; and the estate wherein I am, punisheth me sufficiently for my imprudence: Can any innocent be found more infortunate than I? But what say I, innocent (continued he) I cannot be so of the death of this Princess; it is I that have delivered her into the hands of <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>; it is I that have ex-

posed her to the tempest; and it is I that have been the cause of her loss. Could I be ignorant that she was not an ordinary person? No, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, I could not; I loved her under the name of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, but I was to adore her in my heart as a great
Princess; I saw something so high and so majesticall in the air of her face, as I
cannot be excusable for not knowing her; for howsoever, if the possession of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was necessary for my felicity, she was to be intreated after another manner
and if my love would have constrained me to have recourse unto violence, I should
have gone in person in the head of an hundred thousand men to make so noble a
conquest with honor; she should have been brought in a triumphant Chariot, and
not in the Vessell of a Traytor and impious man; I should not have thought of
possessing her till I had set a Crown upon her head; and if I could not have obtained her, I should have changed my love into respest, and with admiration have
looked upon a bliss that was forbidden me: But <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> did not believe that I was
capable of such noble apprehensions, he hath judged of my minde by his own; he
thought because he is violent, that I should be wicked; he hoped for a recompence
of his crime, and out of an inhumanity which is without example, he hath betrayed an innocent Princess, he hath put a stain upon my life which I shall not be able
to deface, and hath reduced my soul to an estate never to be comforted. Then addressing his speech to the Princess, as if she could have heard him, and calling to
mind her last words, which he had caused to be repeated to him more than once, he
cried out with an exceeding transport. Yes, <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, thy death shall be the cause
of the revenge which thou desirest, and the grief which I shall have for it all my
life, shall be instead of an eternall punishment unto me: There needs no Arms to
invade my State; there needs no proclamed Enemy to fight with me, I carry one in
my bosom which shall alwayes surmount me; repentance and sorrow shall be inseparably with my spirit, and the image of so unhappy, and of so beautifull a
person shall accompany me even to the grave. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having been constrained
by the excess of his displeasure to give over speaking, I did what I could to restore
tranquillity to his soul, but his grief was so vive and so strong, as I needed a great
deal of time to vanquish, or to say better, to moderate it. Behold, Madam , the
History of the unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, all the particulars whereof which I have told
you, I learned from <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, and more too from one of his souldiers, who returned
a little after him, and was saved almost in the same manner. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> could not
then forbear interrupting of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, to lament the misfortune of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, but
after she had satisfied her compassion, she desired to make an end of contenting her
curiosity, and intreated <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> to continue his discourse, which he did in this
sort.

<p>I Will not stand. Madam, to relate unto you, how I imployed my self after my return from <hi rend="italic">Natolia</hi>, in regard I know that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> purposed to let you understand, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahims</hi> Palace was built by my direction, and how it was in that intervall of peace, and <hi rend="italic">assoon</hi> as I was Grand Viser, that I caused the ornaments thereof to be made, having seen that work finished but a little before <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> arrivall at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>. It is true, said <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, that I have a desire to describe that inchanted Palace to her Excellency, and to acquaint her with all the magnificences, and all the grandeurs which you have quitted for her sake; and to make her comprehend a part of what I say, I am but to present her with that which the Grand Signior hath sent her; saying so, he drew out of his pocket a box of gold which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had delivered unto him, and having opened it, he let her see one of the goodliest things in the world. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was so surprised with the richness of this present, as she would not have received it, but at length <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> having told her laughing, that he was not determined either to keep it, or to carry it back to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, she was constrained to accept of it. <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> jesting made <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> fetch a great sigh, beginning

already to apprehend the end of his narration, and for that cause had spun out
that of the Adventures of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> as much as possibly he could, in exactly recounting her History; and all because he was not yet well resolved whether he should
deliver the truth of things to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; in the mean time, whereas she was in much
impatience, and that night began to come on, she desired him not to lose such precious minutes, but to prosecute his discourse. I would willingly have had you dispence with me, answered <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, for leading you once more to the wars, but
since you will be acquainted with all my fortunes, I am to let you understand, that
being absolutely determined not to wear a Turbant unprofitably for Christendom,
I had no other thought but to divert the Arms of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> from Hungary, where I
knew he had a design to imploy his greatest forces; the loss of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> furnished
me soon after with means to put so just a resolution in effect: For whether it were
that some of the Princesses women were saved by a prodigious good hap, and had
acquainted <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> with the cause of the death of his daughter; or that the aboad, or sudden departure of <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi>, who had alwayes past at <hi rend="italic">Mazanderon</hi> for a
Merchant of <hi rend="italic">Coustantinople</hi>, had begotten some suspition of the truth, advertisement
came that <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> was levying a mighty Army: The Truce which had been so
long between these two Princes, could be no obstacle to this war, for it had never
been observed exactly; and some particulars had often committed acts of hostility
on either part, so that according to the Maxims of State, a plausible pretext could
not be wanting for an Army to march into the Orient, as often as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had a
mind to it: In the mean time it happened that the <hi rend="italic">Georgians</hi> having past over <hi rend="italic">Euphrates</hi>, did much spoil in <hi rend="italic">Comagena</hi>, robbing all that went to, or came from <hi rend="italic">Mesopotamia</hi>, so that the <hi rend="italic">Sangiacs</hi> of the Province having complained of it, and seeing
that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> took no order therein, they passed to <hi rend="italic">Diarbech</hi>, where in all the Countrey about <hi rend="italic">Birtha</hi> they did great havock, and rendred that with usury which the
<hi rend="italic">Georgians</hi> had lent them. This conjuncture seeming too favourable unto me to be
neglected, I repaired unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who notwithstanding the advertisement he had
received that <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> had put himself into Arms, could not be drawn for all that
to think of this war; the image of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> reigned still in his heart; he could
not resolve to fight with the Father, whose daughter he had caused to perish; and
if some resentment of glory had not been still remaining in him, I think he would
rather have let <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> invade his Empire, than oppose himself against him. But
to shew unto you how hardly this Prince was drawn to make a war, which he
believed to be unjust, I have no more to say, than that after I had used all my address to remonstrate unto him, that the war of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> was a thing no longer in
his choice, since knowing what his Governors had done in <hi rend="italic">Diarbech</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>
having an Army on foot, he was not to doubt, yea though he <sic>wre</sic> ignorant that he
was the innocent cause of <hi rend="italic">Axiamiraes</hi> death, but that he would fall upon him; that
after I had told him how it was alwayes advantagious for great Princes to begin
the War; that it was a mark of love to his Subjects, not to suffer the fire to be
brought into their houses; and that I had made him also to consider, that at last
it would be better to be in an estate to shew grace to his Enemy, than to receive it
from him; that in this occasion it did not concern his particular glory alone, but
that of the Empire; that being innocent of the misfortune of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, he was
not to fear that heaven would be contrary to him; and that if this death was to be
lamented, it would suffice to imploy his tears and sighs therein, without beholding
the blood of his Subjects shed.  After all these things, I say, he made no other
answer, but <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> is dead for me, I must sacrifice a part of my State for her; and
that my Subjects may not murmure at the Conquests which I shall suffer <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> to
gain upon me, I will labor to obtain others of the Christians, without obliging
thee, as I have promised, to serve me therein. I vow unto you, Madam, that this
discourse surprized me extremely, not knowing which way to oppose my self against a will so fully determined: And that which put me into further despair of
being able to execute my design was, that the Mother and Wise of the Emperour
hated me with a serret hatred, because I had always favoured <hi rend="italic">Mustapha</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gianger</hi>,



<pb n="113" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="113     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>

excellent Princes, and the children of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; for though this last be the sonne of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi>, yet leaves she not to hate him, because he loveth <hi rend="italic">Mustapha</hi>: This hatred was the cause then that these two women opposed the voyage of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, onely to contradict me, with so much adress and violence, as I stood in need of some extraordinary mean to destroy all their artifices. The first represented unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, that the wars of the Orient had always been infortunate to the <hi rend="italic">Othomans</hi>; that his Armies would be exterminated with hunger and thirst, if he carried them to a place from whence his father <hi rend="italic">Selim</hi>, although victorious, brought back no other advantage, than the loss of his best souldiers. As for <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi>, she imployed nothing but her tears, wherewith alone she was more powerfull than reason it self; so that all these things being joyned to the loss of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, wrought in such sort, as I saw almost an impossibility in diverting the storm which was ready to fall on Christendom: But in the end, after I had tried all wayes in vain, I bethought my self, how <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> being mightily perswaded that Judiciary Astrology is a Science
which men may prastise with certainty, I might peradventure bring him to what
I desired, if I could get an <hi rend="italic">Arabian</hi> come from <hi rend="italic">Damascus</hi>, that was an excellent
Astrologer and Mathematician, called <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Aral</hi>,  whom the people accused of
Magick, by reason of the wonders which every day he did; hoping, after I had
won him with gifts, to make him say unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> whatsoever I would have him.
I sent then secretly unto <hi rend="italic">Damascius</hi>, not knowing how to meet with any other expedient that could satisfie me otherwise; and whereas my orders were as well executed as the Grand Signiors, it was not long before he was brought to me. In the
mean space I was resolved to speak no more of this war to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, untill such time
as that which I projected should utterly fail me. As soon as <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Aral</hi> was arrived
at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, I talked with him in private, and after I had ingaged him absolutely to do what I would have him, I discovered my design unto him, which nevertheless I covered with the good and glory of the Empire, to the end too he might
serve me the more faithfully. But this man told me, how he held it fit that the Stars
should be observed, and his books consulted with a little about this war, because it
might so happen, that without any imposture or lying he should be obliged to perswade <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to this voyage; and howsoever, though the stars did not concur with
our intentions, yet would he be sure to keep his word with me. I parted with him
in this manner, having first intreated him to make a shew of the best effects of his Science at the Port, that so the Emperor might give the more credit to that which
he was to say unto him. <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Aral</hi> failed not in obeying me, for he had not been a
week at <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> every one spoke of the prodigies he did; and whereas he
was a great Physiognimist, he got a world of reputation in a short time. He foretold
to some that they should die the next day, which failed not to fall out accordingly;
to others he revealed the most secret adventures of their lives; and he was so happy 
that of all the things which he assured, none mist, or at leastwise might receive a favorable interpretation; so that the report hereof being come to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, he sent for <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Aral</hi>, who in his presence told the Bassa of the Sea such things, as extremely surprized him; for he confessed, that every particular of that which he had told him, had befallen him accordingly. The grand Signior commanded him to follow him into his
Cabinet, where, as I knew afterwards, he declared unto him the most special passages of his life, &#x0026; principally his love to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> upon the sight of her picture, although I had not spoken to him of it; so as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> being mightily perswaded of the Science of this man, asked him whether he thought that the war against the Persians
would be
prosperous. But <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9;</hi>, who desired to finish his figures and observations, &#x0026; to give the
more weight to that which he should say, answered <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>,that things past were seen
with more certainty in the physiognomy, than things to come; &amp; that for an affair of
so great importance, he demanded of him only six days to satisfie him fully: and for
the better carrying of the matter, he besought him to let him know the precise point
of his nativity, albeit he had been acquainted with it before by me. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> accorded
him his desire, and having given him leave to depart, rested so satisfied of him
as he was already disposed to govern his designs by <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Aral</hi>'s answer; who



<pb n="114" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="114     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

after he had made his observations, came one evening to me with a contented look,
and assured me, that his Science was false, or I should Crown <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>. It is certain, Madam, that I did not believe the discourse of this man, but onely
seemed to give credit to his words, to the end I might not disoblige him, although
the success of things afterwards made it good. The next day he went to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
and with a confident countenance told him, that the war of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi> would prove
unlucky to him if he undertook it, but that of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> glorious; and assured him further, that if he entred first into the Enemies Countrey, one of his Slaves, whom
he very much loved, should Crown him King of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9;</hi> accompanied this
discourse with so many circumstances, which would be too long to repeat, as at
length <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who was very scrupulous in all things, which he believed came from
above, prepared himself for this war with as much precipitation, as he had had
repugnancy to it before. As soon as <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9;</hi> was gone, he sent for me, to command
me to alter all the direstions which he had given, and to cause all the Troops to be
inrolled for <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>: And whereas this Prince carried an unmeasurable affection
to me, he had charged <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9;</hi> not to discover any thing of that to me which he had
said to him, desiring to make me believe how it was in consideration of me that he
with-drew his Arms from Christendom, thereby to ingage me the more to his service. Whilst things were in this estate, an accident fell out which began to give
great hope of this voyage of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, and to confirm <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> in the good opinion
which he had of <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Aral</hi>; for it hapned that one <hi rend="italic">Ulama</hi>, Satrape of <hi rend="italic">Caramania</hi>,
a man of great account with the Sophy, who had maried one of his sisters to him,
and though she dyed a little after this Mariage, yet did this alliance render him
more considerable than before. This man, I say, having received some out-rage
from that Prince, after he had served him in divers incounters with the expence of
his blood, requested of me that I would obtain some place of safety for him within <hi rend="italic">Solimans</hi> Dominions. I will not tell you, Madam, what this excellent man did
in this war, since it is certain, that his generous actions doe well deserve a relation in particular; neither will I stand to recount this voyage exactly unto you;
wherefore, that I may not abuse your patience, and make the best use of the rest of
the day, I will only tell you. Madam, that having had a Commandment to conduct
the Vant-Guard with <hi rend="italic">Ulama</hi>, I was so fortunate as I surprized <hi rend="italic">Tauris</hi> without any
resistance, which at the first astonished the Enemies, who nevertheless left not to desend themselves couragiously in all other incounters. <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> performed wonders
in his own person, and so did also one <hi rend="italic">Deliment</hi>; but at length fortune in two ranged battels declared her self for us; so that as soon as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was arrived in person, he had almost no other imployment than to receive the Deputies of Townes
which submitted to his obedience. A part of <hi rend="italic">Assyria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mesopotamia</hi> were subjected unto him, but in such sort, and so absolutely, that from the Mart of <hi rend="italic">Balzera</hi>,
which stands at the mouth of <hi rend="italic">Euphrates</hi>, entring into the Gulf of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi>, even to the
last Town, they rendred all unto him.  The most notable of this great number
were <hi rend="italic">Caramida, Medinum, Orfa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ancefa</hi>; but that which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> rejoyced most
at, was the reduction of <hi rend="italic">Bagdet</hi>, where he was Crowned King of <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> by the hands
of the Caliph, who to do me honor, and to testifie that I had contributed somewhat to the happy success ofthis war, would needs have me serve in the Ceremony,
and help him to set the Crown on the head of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; so that by this circumstance
nothing was more to be added to <hi rend="italic">Mul&#x00E9; Arals</hi> Predictions, who at our return was
recompenced sufficiently.  Afterthis, his Highness bestowed some time in giving
directions for all things before his return to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi>, where he was resolved
to be received in triumph, but a little sickness that he fell into by the way deferred this publique rejoycing, which nevertheless was performed within a while after; and I may say that this Triumph was as happy for me, as it was glorious for
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>^ seeing it was there that I came to know <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> in the habit of a Slave, who
can recount unto you. Madam, that fortunate dayes passage more agreeably than I
could. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, having said this, became so confused, as if one of the Princesses
Gentlemen had not advertised her, that the Count of <hi rend="italic">Lavagna</hi>, accompanied with


<pb n="115" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="115     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book 5." ed="1652"/>
the Marquis of <hi rend="italic">Tonraine</hi>, was come to visit her in the behalf of the Senate, she had
perceived the disorder of his spirit. After she had heard the message that was
brought her, she rose up, and giving her hand to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, she said unto him with
a very well satisfied countenance, Doe not think to lay upon your friend the trouble to acquaint me with the rest of your Adventures, he hath had enough already in going to <hi rend="italic">Constantinople</hi> to justifie me unto you, besides what he is to be at in
relating to me that which hath arrived to himself in particular; but to let you
see, continued she that I am not tyrannicall, I will give you time to content my
curiosity, in the mean space I think it fit we should go and receive the Civilities
of the Senate: <sic>Thir</sic> said, she suffred her self to be lead in one hand by <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>,
and in the other by <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, whom she had retained as he was about to with-draw,
and the rest of the troop followed after. All the way <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> continually admired the marvellous effects of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>'s fortune, but in what manner soever she
considered them, she still returned to speak of the obligation wherein he stood ingaged to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>: I must consess, said she to <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, that if this Prince be such
as you have delivered him, he may be stiled the wonder of our Age, and is my
Religion did not forbid it me, I would quit my Countrey with joy to live under
his Dominion. This discourse made <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> to tremble, but <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> laying
hold on her speech, confirmed her yet more in the advantagious opinion which
she had of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> being come to himself again, assured her that all
which he had said of him was very far short of the truth. This fair Troop entertained themselves in this sort, untill that being arrived neer to the Castle, the
Count and the Marquis came to meet the Princess, who entertained them with a
great deal of respest. The Count, to acquit himself of the Commission which
the Senate had given him, said unto her, that he was not come only to congratulate with her for the happy return of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, but also to give her thanks for it,
as the most important service that ever she could have rendred to the Republiqiie;
that this favour from Heaven was doubtless due to her vertue, and to the vowes
she had made for him, rather than to the desires of the Senate, who had rendred
themselves unworthy of it; how to testifie unto her, that the present had utterly
defaced the remembrance of the past, he intreated her that she would honor <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>
with her presence, whenas she had resolved upon the triumph of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, to
the end that by the pomp and magnificence which they would bring unto it, they
might at leastwise testifie their joy, although they could not testifie their acknowledgement. This discourse made <hi rend="italic">Justinianoes</hi> heart to pant, and the Princess to
change colour; for she understood well enough, that the triumph he spake of, was
to be her mariage. She answered with very much modesty, that generall causes being without doubt more favoured of Heaven, than particular interests, it was to
be certainly believed, that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had been restored to his Countrey for the only glory of the Republick; and that having nevertheless encountred her particular felicity in this generall happiness, she had more reason to give thanks unto
the Senate, than to receive any from them; but, continued she, interrupting <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who would have answered that which she had said of him, it will be more
convenient for us to enter into the Castle for to tell you there what I thinke of it,
than to stay any longer in a place which the night that is now at hand would
render incommodious. The Count then presented the Marquis of <hi rend="italic">Touraine</hi> unto
her, whom they called at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> the French Marquis, and assured her that he was
a man whoso condition and merit were not unworthy of her knowledge and
esteem. There needs no more, said the Princess, to commend and render him
agreeable to me, than that he is your friend, and that you esteem of him; whereupon she entertained him with a great deal of curtesie, and the Marquis saluting her with very much respect, besought her to judge of him by the Counts opinion, rather than by his own, whenas he should have the honour to be known of her. After this complement, the Princess presented her hand to the Count, and looking on <hi rend="italic">Justiniano, Doria</hi>, and the French Marquis, as though she had been


<pb n="116" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="116     IBRAHIM, or     Part I." ed="1652"/>

sorry that she could not share her Civilities amongst them, universall beauties
were the object of their entertainment, during the little way that remained for
them to goe.  The situation of this place is so delicate, the prospect of it so
pleasant, and the setting of the Sun was that evening so glorious, with the diversity of vive and rich colours, which the gold of his Rayes imprinted on the
Clouds, and reflected on the Sea, as it is not to be thought strange, that a
discourse so common should make up the conversation of such extraordinary
persons. As for <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, he went along talking to the French Marquis, who led
<hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi> by the arm, that seemed not unpleasing to him: And in this manner they entred into the Castle, where the Princess treated them as
magnificently, as is she had been prepared of a long
time to receive them.

<p>PResently after supper the Princess, perceiving that the Marquis
was gon from the company, demanded of the Count whether
it were true that he had brought the French liberty into <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>,
as he had formerly told her during the time of her solitariness.
It is so true (answered the Count ) that if you knew in what
fashion we live, you would be surprised with it; Howbeit your
amazement would cease as soon as you should know the wit, humour, and address of the French Marquis. And seeing his precepts are not opposite to pleasure, but yet conserving Vertue with a great deal of
respect, he was not much troubled to find out followers, both amongst the men and
the Ladies. But is it possible (said <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>) that he could vanquish that jelousie
which it so naturall to those of our Nation? He hath for that (replied the Count)
made use of an artifice, which he alone was able to invent: He observed within a
little time, after I had made him known to all the persons of quality, every love in
<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, and wrought so well by his address, that in a short while he was the universall confident thereof. When as he saw himself master of all mens secrets, he began
to perswade us all in particular to the French liberty; to call us Tyrants over our
wives; and to make us comprehend that there was extreme injustice in prohibiting
conversation unto Ladies, who alone could render it agreeable; That as for him, he
was resolved to make them happy whether they would or no: and for that effect
(said he unto us) all they that have sisters must permit me to see and talk with them,
to the end that having made them know, how Vertue ought not to be untractable,
and how they think more harm when they are by themselves, than they would do
if they knew us more particularly, I may make that succeed which I have projected
for your advantage. Besides (said he unto us) this essay cannot be dangerous; for
whereas I never have an affection that lasts above a week, you need not fear that
I shall make any great progress therein. Each one in particular durst not refuse
him that which he demanded, as being his confident; so that in a short time hee was
introduced into all the Houses of quality, mauger the severity of fathers, and the reservedness of mothers. For he hath so complying a spirit, that he knowes how to
take upon him all formes; and for gallantry, no man can be so proper for it as he:
he sings very sweetely; he playes upon the Lute and the Gittern; he daunces with
a good grace; he limnes and paints well; he writes excellent letters; he makes verses in our tongue, as ifhe were an Italian; and his conversation is so intertaining
that it is as impossible to be without friendship for him, as for him to be without affection. Whereupon it is easie to imagine that he had quickly perswaded that which
he desired. But to begin the introdustion of the thing publiquely, one day when there was a bal, and the company assembled together, he approached boldly to the


<pb n="118" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="2     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>

principall mayds ofthe Citie; for he feared not so much the brothers as the husbands;
and told them openly, he was ashamed for them, that they should be separated from
the rest of the company, as if they were unworthy to be of it: and then hee made a Satyre against that custome, which he must one day rehearse unto you. When as everyone took delight herein, and that he knew he should be supported by all the
young folks, and that the Ladies in their hearts wished him no hurt, he desired all
the company, that they would for this evening onely carry themselves as is they
were in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, and follow his directions, to the end he might at leasure make the
Ladies see, who do not travell, the difference that was between the one and the other.
Hereupon all those of his faction cryed it up with a great applause, and his advice
was followed, although there were some that did not allow of it: The women also made some difficulty thereof; but at last the Marquis prevailed. He changed then
the whole Order of the company, saying it was the custome of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, that conversation should be the greatest pleasure of a bal; so that he played the master of the Ceremonies in such manner, as in placing every one, without shewing himself affected therein, hee placed each one according to his inclination. After that it
was a good while before he would suffer the Violins to play, that the more commodity might be given to talk; and in this sort, every one for his particular interest, found himself so satisfied, as there was not any but avowed, that they had taken more delight in this assembly, than in all the rest that ever had been. Since that,
he hath wrought so well with nine or ten interessed persons, as we meet two or
three times a week five or six families together, where verily he delivers such pleasing things, as cannot be repeated unto you, without losing much of their grace. It
must be acknowledged (said the Princess) that this is a rare man, and deserves that
I should inform my self by what happy adventure hee hath preferred <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> before
<hi rend="italic">France</hi>, for I have heard that he is a man of quality. You have reason, Madam (said
the Count) to call it happy for us, but it hath not been happy for him, though the
end was to him glorious. I beleeve (said <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> interrupting him) that her excellency would be well contented to understand his fortune. And I (replied the
Count) to obey her, if I did not fear that the Marquis will not give me leasure for
it, but will come and interrupt my recitall thereof. I am much deceived (said <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>)
if he doe not give you all the oportunity you can desire; for I have well observed
that the faire <hi rend="italic">Emilia</hi> hath not displeased him; and that being gone from hence, because she was not well, he followed her carefully with his eyes, and if I mistake not,
he is gone to seek out some occasion to see her, or to premeditate some letter, or
verses to express his passion. The Count being of <hi rend="italic">Doriaes</hi> opinion, yeelded to the
request which the Princess had made him, and began to speak in these termes.

<head type="sub" rend="italic">The History of the French Marquis</head>
<p>I shall tell you then, Madam, that the Marquis is of an illustrious House, and of a
Province in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, the name whereof is not in my remembrance; and without
particularising any thing more of his life, than the last action which gave him unto
us, you are to know that his vertue begot him envie, and consequently enemies in
his country. And whereas he had alwaies lived at court, and in the warres, the late
King <hi rend="italic">Francis</hi> shewed him a great deal of respect and good will, although hee was
as then but very young. He had not been wanting then at the battell of <hi rend="italic">Pavy</hi>, where
he had performed wonders in person, and so happily for his g!ory, as the King himself had been a witness of his valor; yet were there afterwards for all that three
Gentlemen in his Country, whereof the one was called <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, the second <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi>,
and the other <hi rend="italic">Dincourt</hi>, amongst whom fell out a quarrell, occasioned by the doubt
of his valor. <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> had hated the Marquis of a long time, so as it is credible, that
being unable to finde out any other meanes to deface his glory, hee published
openly, albeit neither he, nor the other two, had ever parted from their houses during the warre, that the Marquis had fled from the battell of <hi rend="italic">Pavy</hi>. This discourse


<pb n="119" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="3     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
comming to the Kings ear, at such time as the Marquis was not at the Court, nor had head any thing that was spoken against him, this Prince, who loved him dearly, thought he should oblige him, if he sought further into the matter. Hee sends for <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> then to know of him from whom he had received that which he had reported: <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> answers that a Gentleman, named <hi rend="italic">Dincourt</hi>, had assured it unto him, and <hi rend="italic">Dincourt</hi> appearing said, that contrarily <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> had told him, how he had heard it from one called <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Dincourt</hi> seeing that <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> did not contradict him, besought the King that he might not bee involved in this affayr; the King grants his request, returns him home, and commands <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> to present himself, as he does: the King demands of him whether he had told <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, that the Marquis had fled from the Battell of <hi rend="italic">Pavy: Beniers</hi> stoutly maintaines that he had never said any such thing, and gives the other the lye. The King, who was willing to force two men, who had not been in the warres, to fight, told them, that to discover which of them had been the author of this falsehood, he would have them fight a single combat, and that he would honour it with his presence. They accept of it, and the next
day, the lists being prepared, and the King being placed on a scaffold with all his
Court, and invironed with a great multitude of peoole, he <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> appear, conducted by a gentleman of his friends; and <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> at the other end of the field brought
in by one of his kinimen. <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> would needs fight with two swords, and but half
armed; so that either of them had a Corslet on with long tasses, sleeves of mail,
gantlets, a cask on his head, a sword in his right hand, &amp; another in his left, with each
of them a dagger by his side. This new spectacle drew the eyes of everyone upon them,
but at length, after the sound of trumpets, the oaths, &amp; other ceremonies requisite in
such like actions, they began their combat, wherein they both shewed a great deal of
adress and valour. At the first <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> seemed to have some advantage of the other, he
appeared more active, more ardent, and more vigorous; but towards the midst of the
combat it was easie to judge, that <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> had made spare of his forces to give the other leasure to spend his. <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> grew faint, &amp; the other so couragious, as no man had
ever seen one fight more valiantly. They were a long time before they could hurt one
another; for it hapned that those two swords, which each of them had, and that carried terror by the eyes to the heart of those who beheld two men armed in that manner, were notwithstanding against their intention a meanes to make the combat endure; in regard that the left hand sword served to ward the blowes which they gave
one another, aswell as if each of them had had a buckler. When they perceived that
their own armes kept them from destroying themselves, they cast away their swords
both at once, and falling a grapling together with a great deal of precipitation they
had recourse to their daggers: But <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> being the stronger, and the more delyver,
hath <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> down under him, and his hand wherewith beheld his dagger being ingaged under the others, <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> seekes for nothing else but a place not desended by
his cuirace where he might kill him, &amp; already had he his arm lifted up for to stabb
hem, whenas the King, who would not lose a man which had shewed so much courage, threw down his warder in the midst of the field to make them leave off, which
caused the people to give a great shout for joy, whereat <hi rend="italic">Benires</hi> turning his head about gave <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> oportunity to disingage himself, and in this manner the Kings authority finished their combat. But admire. Madam, the caprichiousness of chance, by
this which I am coming to tell you: The Marquis, about whom the quarrell was, arrives in post at the very same Towne, where the combat was sought; he askes where
the King is? and whereas the people are never well informed of things, he is only told,
that he is beholding a combat, which he hath permitted unto two Gentlemen, who
had required it of him. This novelty touches him with curiosity; he goes without
further inquirie, or any thought that he had any interest in this affair: he comes thither, hee beholds the combat a while amongst the multitude, makes vowes for <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>,
whose demeanor and personage pleased him, wishes against his own proper interest
that he may carry away the victory, and without knowing it takes his enemies part.
But one of his friends having perceived him, approaches to him, and in few words
recounts him the whole matter, and withall possesses the mind of the Marquis with



<pb n="120" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="4     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
shame, despight, and fury. There is one then (said he unto him that had acquainted
him with this bad newes) which dares accuse me of cowardise; and even the King,
who knowes full well whether I fled from the battell or no, in stead of punishing this
Impostor, does him the grace to permit him the combat; renders himself judge of
it, is ready to heap glory on him, and to declare him victor if he surmounts his enemy. No, no,I cannot suffer it, and I must cast my self disarmed as I am,into the midst
of the lists; I must fight with them both together, or asunder, it matters not which, so
as I may be revenged, or die gloriously. As he was in this resolution the King threw
down his warder to make the combat cease; and though the Marquis his minde was
much troubled, yet had he observed that <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi> was in a condition to be victorious
over his enemy, at such time as the King had given that signall of peace; which put
him into such strange choler, as hee resolved to break through the press, to goe present himself, and in person demand satisfaction for the outrage had been done
him by so black a calumnie. What (said he to himself, in seeking still to approach
neerer) the King takes care for the life of a man that spoyles me in my honour! hee
hath not permitted the combat then, but out of hope that my enemy would vanquish,
since <sic>assoon</sic> as it appeared that he had the worst, he retayned the hand of him that
would have stabbed him, and saved the other from the punishment which he was going to receive: But it is just that he should perish by my hand; and that I should
be revenged by my <sic>relf</sic>. In the mean time the press was so great, and the people
so thronged together for to hear what the King said to<hi rend="italic"> Mars&#x00E9;</hi> and his adversary, as
the Marquis could not come neer him, till he had told them, that their courage had
obliged him from having either of them acknowledged for the calumniator: and
that in persuance of this grace he commanded them to publish every where, how they
knew from his mouth, that the Marquis had been one of the formost in the front of the
battell; that he had been one of the last which he had seen fighting about him; and
that if all the rest had done their devoir aswell as he, he had not lost his liberty. Then
turning himself to the principall persons of his Court, I am (said he) a witness of
that which I say; and is any one dare make any doubt of my speech, I will make him
feel what the displeasure of an incensed Prince is. The Marquis seeing the King
leave off speaking, cast himself at his feet, and surprised in such sort, both the
Court, his enemies, and the King himself, as it was a good while before hee could
be heard, so great was the murmure. But at length,after the people had been commanded to silence, the Marquis spake to him much after this manner. I know very
well, Sir, since your Majestie is satisfied of my courage, that I should be so too; but
it is not sufficient for your glory, that they whom you favour should be valiant, they
ought also for the justifying of your judgement to be thought such by all the world;
And therefore (if I may be permitted to speake so) I cannot indure that they, who
have traduced me two hundred leagues from the battell, should not by experience
undestand, that I know not how to recoil, either in a generall, or particular combat:
Grant me then out of justice that, which you have granted out of grace to mine enemie; your equity and your glory is concerned herein, and you cannot refuse me
the combat which I demand, without covering me with shame and confusion. The
King having attentively heard him, said, that his resentment was noble, but he
could not for his own glory accord him that which he desired: That the publique
testimony which he had given of his valour, was more glorious than the death of
his enemy, who by his commandment would be constrained to publish all his lifetime the contrary of that which he had reported; That if he should permit him
the combat, he should seem to posterity, that he himself had made doubt of his valour; that it would be to equall him with his enemy, which by no means he would
do, neither was it just he should. The Marquis, hearing the King speak after
this sort, was so seised with spight and grief, as he could not answer him. In the
mean time the King, advising with the chiefest of his Court about what satisfaction
he might give the Marquis, never heeded his going away; for suddenly thrusting
himself amongst the press, he did so, as before he could be followed he took post, and went and hid himself in one of his friends house, forty Leagues off, with an


<pb n="121" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="5     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
intent not to stir from thence but to be revenged. The King was much offended with this action of his, and although he loved the Marquis exceedingly, yet his authority seeming to be contemned thereby, he testified a great deal of displeasure for it. He charged <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> not fight with him, and yet commanded him to acknowledge every where, how that which he had said was false. This while the Marquis caused his enemy to be observed, and received news of whatsoever passed at Court; and whereas he hath a great and generous spirit, the alteration of the Kings favour towards him touched him so sensibly, as he desired his friends not to think of restoring him thereunto: He took 
order secretly for his affairs, setled his estate,
raised a mass of mony, great enough to undertake a long voyage; and that done,
resolves to fight, not only with <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, but also with <hi rend="italic">Beniers</hi>, not knowmg, said he,
whether he had not spoken that which he disavowed; and after all, to quit the Kingdom for ever. But the latter gave him not leave to execute his design; for he died
of sickness. As for <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, as soon as he knew that he was returned into his countrey, he sent him a challenge; whereunto he answers, that in regard of the Kings
charge to the contrary, he could not accept of it. The Marquis netled with this
refusall, resolved to force him to fight; and watching for him a good while after
in a Wood, that was not far from <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;s</hi> house, and whither he went oftentimes
to walk, he perceived one morning a Provost-Marshall, accompanied with two of
his fellows, who came along thorough the Forrest; he hid himself for fear of discovery, and heard that oneof them named him, and said that the King would have
him apprehended if he could be found. This discourse obliged him to follow them
afar off; but he was much astonished when hc saw them enter into <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;s</hi> house:
whereupon he no longer doubted, but that it would be impossible for him of a long
time to find an opportunity to fight with him. He informs himself more particularly of the business; remains certain daies about this house, and at length learns,
that the Provost-Marshall was sent to <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> to apprehend him; for the King had
been advertised both of his retreat, and of the time when he departed to return into has Country; So that oppressed with many misfortunes, he resolved to go and pass
away certain moneths in some other place, hoping that in the mean time they
might peradventure be wearied with continuall guarding of <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>. He went then
into <hi rend="italic">Provence</hi> for his more security, where one of his particular friends lived, that
was retired from the Court. Being there, he understands that the Kings displeasure
is pacified, and that his enemie is dead; so that the impossibility which he saw to be
revenged, makes him take the resolution never to appear again at a Court, whose
Prince had not intreated him very well. He passeth into <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, as being Master of
his Actions and Estate; and after he had seen all that is remarkable on this side the
mountains, he staied in the end at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where such pleasant things have arrived
unto him, as one vvould hardly beleeve they vvere true, they vvere so extraordinary. You have much obliged me, said the Princess, by acquainting me vvith all
these passages; but I vvould fain know, vvhat cause <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> had so to hate him? I
rather think Madam (replyed the Count) that there was some love in the quarrel;
if I be not deceived, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> had four sisters, and the Marquis but one; and they were
both neighbours together in the country, so that visiting one another very often,
according to the custom of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> fell in love with the Marquis his Sister
and the Marquis, who alwaies returns Love with usury, became enamoured of all
his four at once. He loved the eyes of the one, the stature of the other, the voyce of
the third, and the wit of thelast. And in these four mayds, he said that he had the
most accomplished Mistris in the worid. This folly lasted long <sic>enongh</sic> to give <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> leasure to become desperately in love with the Marquis his sister, who at her brothers intreaty had entertayned him very civily during certain moneths that he was away in the Province, albeit she could by no meanes indure him. In the mean while the time of his return being come, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> begins to think seriously of his affaires, beleeves they will succeed well; and finding that the Marquis took great delight in resorting to his house, thinks to give him the choice of his four sisters, and by that exchange hopes to estabilish his felicity, and possess his Mistris. He


<pb n="122" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="6     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
imployes one therein, who was a friend both to him and the Marquis; gives him order to discover which of his Sisters he hath a mind to, that he may prepare her to intertain him the better. This friend acquits himself dexterously of his Commission, he repairs to the Marquis, speakes to him of <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;s</hi> Sisters, and demands of him
which of them pleaseth him most. He answers, that they please him all alike;
that the eldest is plump, fair-hayr'd, white-skin'd; that she hath a great deal of
sweetness in her eyes, and in her humour, but that it is great pity she is no taller.
This man, who was called <hi rend="italic">Alsac</hi>, beleeved that this was she which touched the
Marquis his heart, since he found but this little defect in her. But the other proceeding on in his discourse, he thought it was the second; for (said the Marquis)
the advantagious stature of the next; that stately look; that dark hair; that ovall
visage; and that noble pride, which appears in her port and all her actions,
would render her incomparable, were her complexion somewhat clearer, and that
she spake a little more than she does. I was deceived (said <hi rend="italic">Alsac</hi> then) and it is
this same that hath vanquished him. But (continued the Marquis) the mouth of
the third; her white teeth; that quaintness which she hath in the ayr of her face;
that merry and joviall humour; and that which goeth beyond all the rest, that
charming and passionate voice, which she governs with so much art, gives
her such a grace, as would make her surmount all hearts, were it not for a little
inequality of humour that appears in her. Nay now I know not which of them
it is, said <hi rend="italic">Alsac</hi> to himself; but for the last (continued the Marquis) it must be
acknowledged, that that fresh and vermilion hew, proceeding from her youth,
which may be named the soul of beauty; those sparkling eyes; that black hair;
that comely neck; that mean and well proportioned stature; those white hands;
and that which is most marvellous in the age of fifteen yeares, that nimble wit,
which renders her the entertainment of a company; which makes her talk very
agreeably of all matters; and which puts a particular charm into every part of
her; deserves almost the whole heart of a worthy man, if she did not live in the
Country, and had but for six moneths onely breathed the air of the great world:
but that originall sin which takes off much of her value, and the sole thought
that she is a country Gentlewoman, is a soveraign preservative for a man of the
Court. <hi rend="italic">Alsac</hi> was then very much perplexed; howbeit he conceived that the obstacle which the Marquis brought to this last, was the least considerable; and that
thereby he would conceal his passion. But this conjecture was not for all that so
strong, as he durst settle his judgement on it, as on an indubitable thing.
He presses the Marquis yet in another manner, and precisely demands of him,
whether he be in love or no; the Marquis, who thought he was not to speak seririously, answers, that he is, more than all the men of the wodd; the other intreats him to tell him with whom; and the Marquis, who believes that this man
hath no hidden design, is contented to tell him, for to keep him still in doubt,
that it sufficeth he assures him, how in that which he loves, all the beauties of the
body, and all the graces of the mind, are incountred; and that a master-peece of
Nature might be made of it, if one could see together, what he loves asunder.
<hi rend="italic">Alsac</hi> comprehended nothing  by this discourse, although it were true in
the Marquis his sence, who indeed was in love with these four maids; in each
of which he found things that touched his heart, and others that did not please
him.</p>
<p>This man then being in dispair of being able to acquit himself of his Commission, enquires howsoever, whether it be at Court, or in the Country, that he loves?
The Marquis answers, how it is in the <sic>Coutry</sic> that he loves, and after this they
part. <hi rend="italic">Alsac</hi> goes to <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, and tels him that all the fruit of his voyage is, how
he certainly knows that the Marquess is in love in their Country, and that of necessity it must be in his house, since there were no other Gentlewomen thereabout;
but to undcrstand precisely which of his Sisters held the chiefest place in his heart,
was impossible for him to discover, so well had he spoken to him of all four, howbeit it seemed to him that the last touched him a little more than the rest; but


<pb n="123" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="7     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
this too was so uncertain, as he counselled him not to rely on it. <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> finds himself hereupon sufficiently troubled, howsoever he resolvs to clear himself therein, and beleeves that entertaining all his Sisters, one by one in particular, he may discover the truth; it being impossible, said he, but that I shall observe by their countenances, to which of them he hath spoken seriously of love. He sends for the eldest to him into his Cabinet, speaks to her with a great deal of testimony of good will, and to oblige her the more easily to discover her heart unto him, he assures her that he thinks of nothing with more care, than to establish her Fortune; that he should hardly resolve to marry before her; and at length, having made a turn or two, he demands of her whether the Marquis had ever given her any particular proofs of his affection, and whether that match would be agreeable unto her. This proposition having made her blush, she answers, casting down her eyes, that in this occasion she had no other will but his, and that she was ready to obey him. How it was true, that the Marquis had testified that he greatly esteemed her, and that in a hundred encounters he still seemed to prefer her before the rest, and that she also had known how to acknowledge his merit to the prejudice of them that came neer him; but that for three 
or four dayes since he had
applyed himself more in talking to the third than he was accustomed to do. This
Maid giving no further marks in this discourse of the love the Marquis bore her,
than that which she bore to him by the jealousie which she shewed, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> was at a
nonplus; he perceives by his Sisters speech, that the Marqtus had spoken to her
of love; that she did not hate him; and that she suspects notwithstanding that he
hath a mind to her which sings, although according to <hi rend="italic">Alsacs</hi> opinion it should
be to the youngest. Howbeit he conceals his unquietness from his Sister, and resolves to sound them all, charging this not to speak a word to the rest of what
had past between them. She withdraws, and the second arrives with a look and
a modesty that made him beleeve he should be much troubled to draw anything
out of her concerning that which he desired to know. But he was much amazed, when as at the first proposition which he made to her of it, she freely told
him, but with some little preparation before hand, that she beleeved the Marquis
loved her eldest as a Sister; that he delighted to hear the third sing; that the wit
of the last did not displease him; but as for her, she thought that he had given
her such tokens of his esteem of her, as he had given to none of the rest; and
that he had at sundry times spoken to her in that manner, as she could no longer
doubt of it. Howbeit, that for three or four dayes last past, she thought that to
spight her, or to make her more favourable unto him, he had caused one of her
Sisters to sing more, and had eyed the youngest more than he used to do. That
as for her, she could alwayes rule her will by his, but if he would permit her
to speak the truth, she must confess unto him, that she could be contented to marry with a Courtier, being so strongly dis-inclined from the Country, as she could
hardly resolve to talk with them that came to visit her. Her Brother promises to
doe what he can to content her, and having charged her to be secret, he dismisses
her, and sends for the third. What shall I make of all this (said <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> to himself) I cannot learn yet whether the Marquis be truly in love or no, however I
am sure that I have two Sisters which are already desperately in love with him,
but it may be, continued he, that the other two will clear this <hi rend="italic">enigma</hi> unto me.
In the mean time she whom he had sent for appears with her jocund humour; she
demands of him at the first dash, whether it were to propound a Lover unto her
that he had sent for her so in secret; he answers her,that she was not deceived, for indeed it was to ask of her whether the affection of the Marquis did satisfie her?
She replyes laughing, that the obligation which she had unto him for having
taught her so many excellent ayrs, for having taken such pains to make her sing
well, and to tune her Lute to her voice, deserved that her answer should be favourable unto him. But, said <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> to her, speak seriously, for though you be the third, yet if the Marquis loves you, you shall be the first married. Can you doubt of it, said she? and see you not that the conformity which is between us


<pb n="124" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="8     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
must needs produce a fair affection? He is merry, I am not melancholick; he understands musick, and I can sing; he plays on the Lute, and so doe I; he dances admirably, and I doe not dance with an ill grace; in conclusion, there is a kind of I know not what invisible thing, called, as I think, Sympathy, which makes us that we cannot hate one another. I but, replied <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, this is not enough, and you must tell me more seriously whether he loves you. Expect not any thing more serious from me, said she, for I should cease to be that I am, and preadventure should not please the Marquis, if I were wiser; wherefore be pleased to let me tell you only, that if he speaks to you with as good a grace when he demands me of you, as he did in discovering his passion unto me, I shall not answer him cruelly.
After this she went away singing a Song which the Marquis
had made for her, and left <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> so confounded, as he could scarcely beleeve
what he had heard. But at length the last arrives, and whereas he knows that she
had more wit than the rest, he also imployes more art in speaking to her: He
cajols and carresses her; calls her his Favourite, and his dearest Sister; and after an hundred protestations of good will, conjures her to deal ingenuously with
him; and to oblige her the more, confesses unto her, that he is in an extreme passion for the Marquis his Sister; and beleeving that he is so too for her, he desires
her to tell him the truth of it, and if it be so, to use him kindly, for fear he should
oblige his Sister to oppose his affection. She answers thereunto with a great
deal of wit, that she would think her self infinitely happy to be sacrifised for the
felicity of her Brother; but as for that which concerned the Marquis, she was to
tell him, that her life had not yet been long enough to bc able to discern a feigned affection from a true; that it was so little a while since one had given over
intreating her like a Girl, that she durst not as yet rely on her judgment; that indeed it was true, the Marquis had taken some such particular care of her, as made
her think he did not wish her ill; and whereas he was the first worthy man that
had spoken civilly unto her, she confessed freely unto him, she could not chuse
but be obliged to him for it; but that therein she promised to follow his directions exactly. The address of this maid was not such, but that her Brother perceived by the change of her countenance that the Marquis pleased her more than she
made shew of: But whereas he desired to have the liberty to think of so strange an
adventure, he sends her away, injoyns her to be secret, and assures her that he will
alwayes testifie that she is dearer to him than his other Sisters. When she was gone,
he fell a walking up and down (for the Marquis knew all these things afterward
by the third of these Gentlewomen, who out of the conformity that was betwixt
them continued still his friend, maugre all their disorders) and having been a while
without speaking; What, said he, the Marquis shall make my four Sisters be in love
with him, whilst himself peradventure is not taken by any of them, and I shall be
so unhappy as not be able to touch the inclination of his one? He will laugh in
his mind at his conquests, and my misfortune; and whilst to the prejudice of my
house he shall be laden with the favours of four maids, I shall get but cold civilities from her, whom I love passionately, and that alone can make up my felicitie.
But, continued he, what counsell can I take? If I have <sic>recouse</sic> to violence; if I quarrell with him; if I fight with him, and will make him explain himself by force,
for the interest of my Sisters, then I ruine my self with her; I lose the hope of ever
possessing her; and it would be an ill way for one to prove his love unto a generous
person, to kill her Brother. It is better for me then to dissemble a while; to observe all his actions; to endeavour yet to discover whom the Marquis is in love
withall; and if at last I can learn nothing certain, then to propound unto him
the choice of my Sisters, in demanding of his. Behold in what sort <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> reasoned with himself about so intricate an affair (at leastwise he hath recounted it
since in this manner.)  But as Marse was thus troubled at home, so was the Marquis in some sort with his Sister, who having another design with herself than
the marrying of <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, would have him dispense with her for entertaining him
any longer, and permit her to take all hope from him. Howbeit the Marquis,

<pb n="125" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="9     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
who could not endure that his Sisters rigour should deprive him of the favours of all <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;s</hi>, unto whom he durst not have gone any more, if once she should have put him into despair, could not consent unto her desires. Why, Sister, said he unto her, you see me to be a hundred leagues from the Court, in a solitary Country, where one can hardly behold any thing that so much as resembles a woman, and you will be so cruell as to deprive me of a company, wherein I meet with
four very amiable ones; so as if it be true that the loss of one Mistress brings an
unquietness that cannot be ended but by Iron or Poyson, what doe you think will
become of me, when you shall have taken from me four at a time, which I love passionately; and in a place where I can find no others? If I were at <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>, I should comply with you herein, not onely for fower, but for thirty, being well assured that I
should repair this loss in a little time: But in the midst of a desert to deprive me of
four sole maides whom I can love, is so great an inhumanitie, in the humor wherein
I am, as if you consider it seriously you must needs repent you of it. But, answered
his Sister laughing, you doe not love them, for how can you share your self amongst so many? Not love them (replyed the Marquis) naughty Sister, come, you
doe not know me, if you believe as you say; for it is most certain that I love them
with all my soul; and that in all my life I never found my self so constant, nor so
amorous. And whereas this maid could not very easily comprehend, how a man
could love four at once, and tearm himself constant: for to make her understand it,
he told her, that by a very extraordinary adventure he had no great affection for
any of them in particular, but meeting in these four persons separately, with that,
which he would have in one alone, he was so desperately in love therewith, as he
was never in such a passion before. He told her further, that ordinarily when he
found any thing that was amiable in a woman, he excused the defects which were
in her, and became in love with all her person; but that in this incounter, through
a caprichiousness of love, he was wounded in another sort. For, said he seriously,
it would be impossible for me, in the estate wherein my mind now is, to love any of
those maides single; and I am never more joyfull than when I see them all four together. I behold the whitness ofthe first; the look ofthe second; I hear the voice of
the third; and admire the gentleness of the last. In conclusion, I am so satisfied with
this manner of loving, that when I could, by an unheard-of miracle, take from those
four maides all that doth please me in them, to make thereof a Master-piece and a
mervail, such as I may imagine, yet should I rather chuse to love them as I doe. For
if I should love but one of them, I should be without consolation when she were in
choler; whereas contrariwise I am never altogether unhappy: if I have angred the
fair one, the brown one regards me favourably; and if I am out with the serious
one, the merry one comforts me with her jocund humor; and when it falls out,
that I am upon good tearmes with all the four, I have such delight as cannot be exprest. One prepares a bracelet for me, another ties a band about my hat, a third
gives me powder and essences, whilst the fourth causes her picture to be drawn for
the love of me. In pursuance hereof, I sing a song that is agreable to all four, which
each of them applies to their own particular for a mark of my affection, and which
they all commend with address and joy: and that which is yet more worth than all
these things, is, that this passion is so fair and so extraordinary, as the end of it can
never be unhappy. For when as I my self would contribute to mine own ruine, it
is impossible that ever I should arrive to that infortunate terme, which for the most
part finishes all loves, I mean marriage. If I should love one of these maides, it may
be that utterly losing all reason against my custom, I should also mary her; but loving these four sisters as I doe, unless the Law should permit me to mary them all
four, as the Turkes does, I am in no danger of being their husband. In this manner
I shall be alwaies free, and alwaies amorous; and the impossibilitie that there is for
them ever to be my wives, gives them a charm, which will make me love them untill I return again to the Court. Judge now after this, cruell sister, whether vou are
to rob me of all my pleasures. You know, continued he, that I doe not cross yours,
that I have never prest you to hearken to the sighes of <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, more than vvas need



<pb n="126" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="10     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
full for my diversion, and not to constrain you to marry him. I am so much a
friend of liberty, that I cannot endure the least violence, either in my self, or in another; and if you resist me never so little more, I feel that I shall doe what you
would have me; but at the very same instant I shall take Post to goe seek out some
new object for my passion, without vvhich I am not able to live. They vvere a
long time yet pleasantly disputing on either part concerning this matter; but at
last the Marquis his Sister, vvho vvould not lose so favourable an occasion to discover unto her Brother the design vvhich she had, gives him to understand, that during his absence, a Gentleman of their Neighbours, extreme rich, of great courage,
and of much spirit, had fallen in love vvith her; and that he being to return from
the Army in a short space, she was afraid lest some mischief might fall out between
him and <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>. It is not that I have any affection for him, said this Maid  but I
must confess to you, that I vvill never mary <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, though I think I could resolve
to be the others Wife. Come, my dear Sister, answered the Marquis, doe not disguise your thoughts; say that you are in love; that your passion is violent, and
vvith these charming vvords you shall obtain of me all that you can desire; I vvill
return to the Court eight dayes sooner than I vvould have done, to leave you the
liberty to use <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> as you please; but vvhen I goe I will leave our Mother an absolute power to mary you according to your ovvn mind; for I am so glad to see
that you are not insensible, that I love you for it far more than I did. As they
vvere thus talking, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> arrives, the Marquis hides himself against his Sisters vvill,
gets out at a back-gate, mounts on hors-back, and rides to <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;s</hi> house, vvhich
vvas not far off, vvhere he finds those four fair Sisters, or to say better, his four Mistresses, all of them more joviall than ordinary, for they had every one in particular some hope to be the Marquis his Wife, by reason of the proposition their
Brother had made to them of it. They had also attired themselves extraordinarily,
to give him new wounds; for they knew well no day past without his visiting them.
The eldest had a garment on of green cloth-of-Silver, whereof the sleeves were
tyed up with carnation-silver'd ribbon, and her hair with the same, which did
not misbecome a person fair-complexioned. The second had on a night attire of
pure white silver tinsell, which gave a kind of lustre to her serious and modest
aspect; the third alwayes glittering, was in a wastcoat of gridilyon sattin, set all over with silver oes ; as for the youngest, though her garment was plainer than
the rest, yet was it the gallantest; her habit was nothing else but silverd tiffany,
imbroidered with flowers, lined with carnation taffata, and her head was covered over with carnation and white feathers, which must needs doe well with a young
person, whose hair was black, complexion clear and lively, and eyes wonderfully
sparkling. All these Sisters were much amazed in themselves, at the care which
each of them had taken on one and the same day, in setting forth themselves as
much as possibly they could; and the Marquis was so surprised to see them all at
once with such magnificence and jollity, that he could not imagine what should be
the cause of it; for commonly they observed this order amongst themselves, that
there was one alwayes carelesly drest, to the end that each of them in their turn
might shew, both affected handsomness, and handsome carelesness. But at length
the Marquis accoasts them, divides his comp<unclear>l</unclear>ements and looks, commends them all
four together, and without knowing what was in their thoughts, does things which
confirms them in their opinion. He talks to them of love openly, swears that he
is in such a passion for them, as he was never in the like before; and whereas their
minds were prepossessed, they beleeve that it is an address of Court to speak overtly
of these matters, and to leave it to her, whom one loves, to apply it to her self. She
whom he beheld beleeved, that it was as much as to say, it is for you; and those
whom he did not behold, beleeved, that out of respect he durst not encounter their
eyes, in speaking of a thing which might make them blush; in fine, they were all
very well contented and very well satisfied. The Marquis, who did not love to
make unprofitable visits, demands new favours of them; he will have a bracelet
made of the hair of all four; they laugh at it at first; they refuse him, or to say





<pb n="127" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="11     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
better, they make him the more earnest to intreat them for it; and at last they grant it him, still in the thought, that it is a trick whereby he will get the hair of her <sic>eh</sic> loves, without making shew that it should be a particular favour, or that she should have cause to be offended at it. This promise was soon executed; the youngest of these maids being the most dextrous, was she that plaited this hair together, and made a bracelet of it, where the different colour of their hair appeared all asunder. In labouring at this work, she laughed in her sleeve, so think how her Sisters were beguiled, if they beleeved that it was for them the Marquis had desired that which she was making; and the rest, who thought they were more cunning, mocked at the simplicity of their younger Sister, for taking such paines about a thing wherein she had so small a share. And those severall concealed opinions which they all had, gave them so strong a disposition to laugh, as upon the least pretext for it, they fell into it; finding too amidst their laughter occasion to redouble it, each of them beleeving in their mind, that the rest would not alwayes laugh with so good a will when once the Marquis should declare himself. As for him, who never lost time, after he had spoken to them all in generall, according to the French liberty, he spake to them in particular; he singles out one into a corner of the room, and there sayes gallantries to her; a little after he talkes with another at a window, which looks upon the garden, and seeming to admire the beauty of the flowers, he praises that of her eyes; he accompanies the youngest when she goes forth, and makes use of this occasion to  cajoll her. And when they
walk in the garden, he sometimes draws one of them also from the rest, that he may
be able to speak two or three words to her in private, or to ksss her hand. In the
meantime, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, who had not received such caresses at the Marquis his house,
returns to his own, where he finds him still to be; he does what he can to make
him stay all night, but the Marquis, who began to fear lest <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> should press him
to explain himself, withstands it, parts from this fair company, carries away the
bracelet, and comes back to his Sister, who was very melancholick. For it had
happened, that her Lover being returned, had surprised her talking with <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>;
and whether he had understood of his design, or that she had before acquainted him
with it they had saluted one another very coldly, and had talked as men that took
pleasure to contradict each other. So that, said she to the Marquis, after she had
recounted unto him that which had befallen, I see the matter in a case to break
forth, and suddenly to produce some mischief; it we doe not look to it in time.
No such thing, answered the Marquis, for whereas I have promised nothing to
<hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, and that he too hath not spoken to me of his love to you, or of any purpose he had to marry you; I may tell him if he moves me about it, that I am engaged to another, and to make that true, cause your Lover to come to me,
aud I will promise him my consent. I know that thereby I shall banish my self
from a place, where I have a great deal of pleasure; but since I am of necessity to
be gone away within eight dayes to the Court, I could not make a better end of
this adventure. For <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> forbidding me his house, I shall have a fair occasion
to write them a letter of adieu and despair: withall, continued he, I perceive that
I begin to accustome my self to the favours which I receive from these Gentlewomen, so that now the happiness which love gives me, being turned into an habit,
it is no longer hapiness to me. The Marquis his Sister was so astonished to hear
him talk thus, as she could not forbear laughing at it: They past the evening in
this sort, and not to lose time, the Marquis his Sister advertised her Lover, that
the next morning he should repair to her Brother to acquaint him clearly with
the intentions he had for her. The note which she sent failed not to work the
effect she expected from it; her Lover comes just as the Marquis is rising, speaks
to him of his passion for his Sister, shews that he covets his alliance, and in the
end expresses his desires so clearly, that the Marquis without further delay leads
him to his Mothers chamber, who favoured her Daughters wishes, propounds the
matter unto her, gets her to agree unto it; and whereas this Lover was absolute
Master of his Estate, and of his own will, they resolved to accomplish this Mariage




<pb n="128" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="12     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
within four dayes, to the end that the Marquis, who was to return to the Court,
might be at his sisters wedding. Things being in these termes, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> arrives, who
was come on purpose to his Mistresses Mother, to discover his design unto her. As
soon as the Marquis saw him enter, he descends, he goes and imbraces him, invites
him to his sisters wedding, before he acquaints him to whom she is to be maryed;
seemes to believe that he is not interessed therein; talks to him of dancing and
joy; hoping thereby, that <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, seeing the matter resolved, would not explain
himself further, and peradventure would alter his mind. As indeed, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> hearing
this discourse, and knowing that his rivall was returned, makes no doubt but the
Marquis spake the truth, onely he doubted, in regard ofthe manner of the Marquis
his speech to him, whether he had observed that he affected his sister. He was mad
that he had not declared himself sooner, and that he was arrived so late; and in this
unquietness, he knew not whether he should goe in or no, to be the spectator of his
Rivals tryumph; whether he should quarrell with the Marquis, though he knew
not as yet that he was faulty; whether he should depart away without saying any
thing unto him; or whether he should trouble this wedding with some strange violence; in fine he was so confounded, as not knowing what to doe in so unpleasing
a conjunsture, he suffered himself to be conducted along by the Marquis, whose
adress in this occasion was such, as without seeming to perceive any change in his
countenance, he still continued talking to him of diversion and joy; and that too
with imbracing and putting him gently on towards his Mothers chamber; whereunto as soon as ever they were entred, the Marquis presented his brother-in-law to
<hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, who saluted him very coldly; in the mean time he had leasure to tell his
Mother and his sister in two words, that to keep <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> from shewing his hatred
and resentment, he was not to be left alone with anybody. After that civilities were rendred on either part, the Marquis thought it was fittting that he
should entertain the company; he began then to quarrell with his sister, for
that she was the cause of his rejoycing at a thing which was repugnant to
his mind; but withall he was well assured, that this thing should never
give him joy again, either for her, or any other, and that this compliance was no doubt the greatest mark he could render her of his love. <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>
hearing this discourse, demanded ofhim, whether he meant mariage by that
which he spake? and the Marquis without further delay, answered him laughing,
that it was of that destroyer of love; of that Tyrant of libertie; of that enemy of pleasure;  which most commonly disjoynes all that Love hath united; which discovers all the defects ofthe mind and humor, to persons that believed they were altogether perfect; and that which was worse than ail the rest for him, which banishes love, inconstancie, and gallantry from amongst men, to introduce into the
stead of it, jealousie of honor, a false constancie, and domestick cares. So that, as you
speak (replyed <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> interrupting him) you believe it may be that you should
much oblige one of your friends, if you should mary his Mistress to another. If he
should tell me, answered the Marquis, that he would mary her, I should not contradict his intent, for I am so much an enemie to constraint, as I never oppose any
thing; but otherwise if a worthy man of my friends should appear to me extremely
amorous, I doe not think I should doe him any great wrong, if I should deprive
him of the meanes of marying his Mistress, in case his passion should disorder him
so far, as to give him a desire to doe so: And in the humor that I am, the greatest
proof of affection that I can render unto a maid, when I become inamoured of her,
is not to marry her: yea, and I have met with some, unto whom, the more favourably to receive my affection, and to testifie unto them the respest which I bare
them, I have declared at the first sight, that in becoming their Servant, I had no design to become their Master; and in assuring them that I was their slave, I assured
them that I would never be their Tyrant. It may be, replyed <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, you have not
alwaies spoken so openly; that I have not, answered the Marquis, when I believed,
that those whom I loved had wit enough not to suspect that I had any such bad intent; but howsoever I have never done or said any thing which could make them



<pb n="129" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="13     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
believe, that I had any other aym, than to love them, to be kindly received of them, to be heard with pleasure, and to obtain of them all those petty favours, which are no part of the Husbands demean, and which ought alwaies to remain in the disposition of Ladies, therewith to gratifie their Lovers. For since there are not men found, which amuse themselves in wearing bracelets of their wives hair; which demand favours of them; which are ravished with kissing onely the tip of their gloves; with saying gallantries to them, praising their beauties, giving them serenades; making verses to their glory; and telling them that they burn and dye for love of them. Is it not strange they should be deprived of all these pleasures? and is ti not unjust, that men which doe not love them shoudl possess them absolutely? and that they which adore them should not at leastwise have all those pretty things, which are not directly opposite to vertue? Your maximes are so bad, said the Marquis his Sister, speaking to her Brother, that if you had not alwayes been at Court, and that we had alwayes been brought up together, I
should have some cause to fear, that one might imagine you had perswaded me
to your opinion. I dare not say, replyed her Lover, that these maximes, which
you condemn, have nothing in them that clashes with reason; nor also maintain
that they have nothing in them but that which is bad; for I have too much love
for the Sister, and too much respect for the Brother; but howsoever I am confident that you will not follow them. It is true, said <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, tartly enough, that
inconstancie is not that wherewith he is to be reproched; and I know not whether on the contrary, Vertue opposed will not prove to be the onely crime that may
be imputed to him. The Marquis perceiving that the other was preparing himself to answer, and peradventure with bitterness, continued to speak of the injustice
of men in the discerning of things. For, said he, if the diversity of good books
renders a man knowing; if diversity of voyages serves him for an agreeable study, which illuminates his mind, and informs his judgment; if the diversity of
fair arts is a knowledge that pleases; if the diversity of tongues passes for a laudable curiosity, why should one think that the diversity of loves can produce nothing that is good? And why will one have the grace of novelty, which is
the charm of nature, to be a defect in love? For my part, said <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>,
I will no longer oppose this doctrine, since an universall change cannot be but
advantagious for me, glorious for some, and equitable for others. The hidden
sence of this speech was easily understood by all the company; but the Marquis,
who in this occasion did not desire to dive into things, alter'd the discourse, and
said unto <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi>, that his Sisters must needs honour this Wedding with their presence, and that he must rejoyce with them, for that they are not so neer to slavery.
The honour that you will doe them, answered <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;;</hi>, will surprise them, not
because your civilities hath not given them occasion to attend more from you,
but whereas this newes is unexpected, it is fit that I should goe and advertise
them of it, to the end they may prepare themselves to receive the grace that you
will doe them. The Marquis pressed him extremely to pass away the rest of the
day with them, but he would by no means stay; He invites him also to his Sisters
Wedding, talks to him of Bals, Lutes, Musick, and of all the entertainments usuall in such like Feasts: whereunto the other answered still with speeches of a
double sence. The two Rivals quipt one another civilly, which doubtless might
have produced some unlucky adventure, had not the merry humour of the Marquis sweetned the conversation. <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> took his leave of the company, with a
forced countenance, which made them conceive that he had strange unquietness
in his mind. He went home then with so much grief, as he could not longer conceal it, and to <sic>minish</sic> in some sort he desired to make his Sisters partakers of it.
He sends for them, acquaints them with the mariage of his Mistress, tels them that
the Marquis is unfaithfull, inconstant, a cheater, a courtier; that cares for nothing
but to please himself; that hath made a mockery of them; and then recounts all
their conversation unto them. These four Sisters were not more amazed at this
Wedding whereunto they were invited, and the lightness of the Marquis his hu¬



<pb n="130" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="14     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
mour, than to know by their Brothers discourse that they were Rivals, and equally beguiled of the hopes which they had conceived. At first they beheld one another, as if they would silently reproch each other for concealing themselves in their
designes: But the third of these maids, whose mind was not so sensible of grief, and
that could not be long without giving seme marks of her humour, after she had paused a little, began to speak, and said with a tone of the voice of admiration, I mnst
confess the Marquis is wonderfull dextrous, that could deceive four interessed
maides; and though I did infinitely esteem him, continued she, I did not think he
had had so much wit, nor that he was so unworthy of my friendship. The mindes
of the three others were not so moderate; and though the eldest was of a very sweet
disposition, yet could she not chuse but shew her resentment. The second, alwaies
haughty, manifested hers, by seeming to share very much in that of her brother;
but as for the youngest, she was vext to the heart, for having so ill assured her first
conquest; and albeit she had a great deal of wit, yet she could not forbear shewing
her choler. Howsoever the third continued still saying, that this adventure was a
new charm, which she discovered in the Marquis, and that ingaged her to esteem of
him the more. In the mean time the wedding day arrives; <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> feignes himself
sick because he would not be at it; the sisters excuse themselves upon their brothers sickness: Howbeit the third makes a secret match with one of her kinswomen, that dwells not far of, to goe and see this feast in disguise; they mask themselves then very bravely, and appear in that assembly accompanied with certain
men disguised too as they were. As soon as they were entred into the rooom, the
Marquis knew her that touched his heart still; he approaches to her, makes her
an hundred complements, and continues telling her, that he loves her passionately.
But she without reproaching him, answers, that she does not doubt of it, and that
the conformity which is between them ought to work so fair an effect. That nevertheless it was fit they should a little better examine their thoughts, it seeming just
unto her, that two persons, which made profession of beguiling all the world in
gallantery, should not be beguiled between themselves. This said, this gentlewoman made the Marquis sit down by her,  whilst the rest of the company were dancing, and with a most pleasing relation acquainted him with all that had past, betwixt her brother, her sisters, and her self. Hereupon they promised much good
will one to another, esteeming too much of themselves for ever speaking together again of love. She counselled the Marqnis not to come at their house, but since he
was to be gone to the Court the day following to send a complament to her brother
and her sisters, as indeeed he did. The Marquis took post the next morning, leaving
his sister very well contented, <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> in despair, three of his siisers in choler enough<sic>.</sic>
&amp; the other satisfied. Ever since that, Madam, there hath alwaies been a secret hate between these two houses, until such time as <hi rend="italic">Mars&#x00E9;</hi> made the report that caused the
<sic>cmobat</sic>, which I have recounted unto you, &#x0026; that consequently hath so happily for us
brought the Marquis into <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. I confess, said the Princess, that the history hath
much delighted me; and that I am much obliged unto you for acquainting me with
so gallant and extraordinary a man. As she was saying so, the Marquis came into
the chamber again; whereupon she began to charge him for keeping so long away
from a company, which found his infinitely agreable to them<unclear>:</unclear> But he with a respective boldness, answered, that knowing very well how the Count would impart some part of his humor unto her, he feared not to acknowledge, that being
in doubt he should not alwaies well remember what she was, and also what he was,
he went away to expose himself to the lookes of the fair <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi>, to the end that
having his heart replenished vvith love, he might have nothing but veneration for
her. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> could not forbear laughing though she blush'd in looking on <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>: vvho told the Princess, that this foresight and respect of his, merited a great deal
of acknovvledgment. And I too am resolved not to be ingratefull; but I fear vvhen
as you knovv me, said she to the Marquis, that you vvill have a passion for me quite
contrary to that <sic>vvich</sic> you seem to fear. For in fine, whether it be constancy or obstinacy, I never change my determination; vvhen once I have taken a resolution,


<pb n="131" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="15     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
nothing can destroy it; so as I have great cause to doubt, that this difference of humours which is seen betwixt us, will set me at ods with you: but that which gives me a little hope yet, is, that I know you have friends that are not inconstant. I confess, Madam, replyed the Marquis, that I am inconstant, and that following the order of Nature, I should hate that which is directly opposite to me; but for all that it is certain, that I am not incommodiously inconstant; I never contradict any in their opinions, nor in their pleasures; I give unto others the liberty which I desire they should grant me; I doe not blame constancie, though I like well of change; and my soul is so full of passion, as I canont condemn all that which is called Love; wheresoever I find this passion, it pleaseth me, and all the effects of it are agreeable unto me. I love jealousie in this same, despair in him, dissimulation in some, infidelity in others; and although it seldome produces any thing but joy in me, yet does not the melancholy of a Lover, who is not of my humour offend me. I am so powerfully perswaded of the excellency of Love, as I hold for infallible, that the most unfortunate Lover in the World hath more happy dayes, than the freest of all men can have. For in fine, the remembrance of what is past, or the hope of what is to come, still gives him felicities, which are not met withall in the possession of other good things. Verily, said
the Princess, there was never anyone so sociably inconstant; for commonly we are so unjust as to desire that our sense should rule that of others, to
approve of nothing but what pleaseth us, and to condemn all that contradicts
our opinions. And they which are of this humour, find in themselves wherewith
to maintain their severity. They say, that whereas there is but one reason in all
things, there is but one way to be followed; that all they which esloign themselves from that, doe goe astray, and that so they maybe justly blamed. I acknowledge, Madam, replyed the Marquis, that there is but one reason, but I maintain also, that it is so difficult to be known, as he who thinks he hath found it,
is oftentimes further from it than others, which without judging soveraignly of
any thing simply, follow the sense wherewith Nature hath inspired them. And
indeed to speak truth, if it be necessary for the equitable judging of a matter, that
one should be loose from all, and so indifferent as to lean equally to each side, or
to say better, not to lean to either; how is it possible that any man should be so hardy
as to make any judgment of the actions of others, principally of that which regards
Love? But since I have been taken at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> for an Astrologer, permit me to
play the cunning man in this encounter; I say then, Madam, that our reason is
not so absolutely loosed from sense, but that our temperament hath a great share
in our opinions; and that that just mixture of the four humours, which renders
the spirit so clear and solid, and our health so sound, is seldom found in any body. There is alwayes one of them that predominates over the rest, and by it we
act according to the pleasure thereof; we are grave, merry, chokrick, or patient;
insensible, or passionate. And certainly it is not so much the rigour of a melancholick mans Mistress, that makes him cry out, sigh every minute, shed tears, pass
away nights without sleep, rave from the purpose, talk alwayes of despair, and
appear with a langor, that seems to be an effect of an extreme affliction; as the
power of this predominant humour, which forces him to receive all things after
this sort. And to prove that which I say, we are but to consider, that if the same
rigour were addrest to a man of my humour, he would receive it in another fashion; the jollity and joy which proceeds from the temperament, is not easily
troubled by things without; and certainly, that which makes the melancholick
man complain in Love, would give me occasion to laugh; that which makes him
to sigh, would induce me to make verses of gallantery; that which makes him
weep, would quite cure me ofmy passion; and if I should pass nights without
sleep, it would be, doubtless, to give Serenades; I should not rave in conversing,
to weary others, and make them hate me; I should not entertain my Mistress with
my despair; nor should I fill her imagination with sad thoughts, which putting
her into a bad humour, might make her to use me ill afterwards. But contrari-



<pb n="132" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="16     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
ly, I would talk to her still of all the delights of them that love one another; and
whereas Love is alwayes represented in the midst of sports, laughters, and pleasures, I would indeavour to inspire her heart with joy, that so I might the more
easily introduce love into it, to whom the painters do alwaies give a bed of flowers, without ever laying him on thornes. In fine, Madam, far from perswading
my passion unto her by the langor of my face, I would shew her so much satisfaction in my eyes, as she might very well perceive that her dominion would be pleasing to me; and that I would not be like those people newly conquered, who by their
melancholy makes one beleeve that they are alwaies meditating some revolt. There
are also two kindes of Lovers, who by the humours which predominate in them
are made to doe strange things, the anxious, and the cholerick. And though the
former are not so far eloigned from the melancholick, but that they have
some conformitie together; nor the cholerick from that sparkling humor,
and that fire which animates me; yet are they for all that differing in many things.
The anxious is satisfied with nothing; the possession of felicities, which he hath desired, molest him; he wishes for quite contrary things; he loves and hates all at a
time; he hath a secret enemy within himself, that mingles bitterness with all his
pleasures; he beleeves when his Mistress shewes him favours, that she is too prodigall of them, or that she deceives him; in conclusion he is easily displeased; nothing
can content him; and when the person whom he loves gives him the least cause of
jealousie, it is enough for him to meditate on a murther. A man like me, in such
a like occasion, would mock at his Mistress, and his Rivall; a melancholick man in
<hi rend="italic">France</hi> would fight very couragiously, but as for an anxious man, Steel, Iron, and
poyson, would be the least armes that he would make use of. As for the cholerick,
he would receive the rigors of his Mistress with transports of fury, so far forth as to
offer affronts to her, to threaten her with all things; but as the cloudes, which form
the tempests, are dissolved when thunder breakes forth, so this man of choler hath
no sooner exhaled his fire by his cries, but he goes out of himself, and one onely
look of the person beloved finding yet some impression of heat in his heart, doth
therein easily kindle that again of love; Finally he is easily angred, and is as soon
appeased. There are yet of another temperament, who are so patient, as they are
almost insensible; and cold predominates so much in them, as if it arrives that love
warmes them a little, they are capable of enduring any thing: For they are so powerfully surmounted by laziness, that for fear of stiring they dare not change their
Mistress, but suffer all things without complayning. You see then, Madam, that
the diversity of the humours of the body contributes much to our apprehensions;
and that one and the same thing is seen after a quite different manner.  And if we
will give credit to the Astrologers in this behalf, they will tell you also, that <hi rend="italic">Saturn</hi> by his influence makes all the melancholicks act, as I have declared; that they,
over whom <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi> predominates, are of my humor; that <hi rend="italic">Mars</hi> inflames the soules
of those, whom he governes, with the fire of choler; and that the Moon inspires
those, whom  she  commands, with a coldness, which makes them almost insensible. You will tell me it may be, Madam, that these Starres are so far distant
from us, as it is hard to comprehend how they exercise an absolute power upon
men; but if you consider that which they doe in the universall world, you will the
more easily beleeve that which they doe particularly in man: for in fine the diversitie of seasons is derived from them; and this successive change of heat and cold,
of flowers and fruites, which are seen every year, is found also in our selves. We
have our seasons as well as the year, and even as age changes our temperament,
in changing our humours, we likewise change opinions. The second age of life,
which is the first for love, seldom fayles in producing of violent passions, which
are often followed by imprudence and indiscretion. As for the third, the passions
therein are not so lively, but withall they are better governed: One conceales the
pictures which he hath of his Mistress; One no longer shewes the bracelets of hair
which she gives; One hath as much care of her conservation as of his pleasure; and
it is in this age alone, where gallantry, a little reason, and a great deal of love,


<pb n="133" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="17     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
may sometimes be encountred all together. But for that which followes, and is called the age of Wisedom, Love doth in it appear so strange, so dreadfull, and so ridiculous, as I cannot find any thing more horrible than an amorous old man. For of all the apprehensions which this passion inspires him with, he hath none left him but jealousie: Liberality, Address, Gracefulness, Vivacity of Spirit, that fire which sparkles in the eyes of a Lover, Respect, Care, Cajolleries, Verses, Musick, Dancing, and an hundred other things, which are so dependent on Love, that if it be dispoiled of these ornaments, it almost ceases to be Love; all these things (I say) are no longer found save in his memory, and that too in a manner, which time and use hath rendred ridiculous. But instead of all that, he is covetous, uncomely of a languishing spirit, dis-respectfull, careless, uncapable of delivering a civility with any good grace, or of making Verses that have any life in them; for the Muses doe not use to favour old Lovers: And for the langauge of the Eyes, how should they make use of them to express their passion, when as ordinarily they are become so weak, or sunk so far into their heads with age, as they are hardly to be seen, neither can they distinctly see others. Finally, that Love which is painted so plump to use, so fair, so jolly, so amiable, 
so merry, so young, so vigorous, a torch in one hand, a bow and quiver on his shoulder, and a scarf over his eyes, should for them be painted, withered, lean, hideous, hoary, sad, and languishing, having neither bow, nor
quiver, nor making other use of an extinguisht torch but to lean on it, nor of
his scars but to wipe his eyes. So that, Madam, this diversity, which is seen to
arrive to one and the same person, according to the change of his humours, of
his temperament, and of his ages, doth demonstrate, that albeit there is but one
reason to be followed, yet we doe oftentimes form many according to our fancie. Wherefore I doe not think I am upon a bad ground, in not amusing my
self about to vain a search, as that of the true reason of all things, seeing it is
so difficult to find; nor in following, as I doe, that which pleaseth me, and all
that which seems amiable to me; neither in leaving that liberty to others, which
I give unto my self.

</div></body></text></q></p>
<p>After the Marquis had given over speaking, and left the company very much
satisfied with his wit, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who would not abandon reasons party, and who
desired the Princess should think it was not out of caprichiousness and fancy that
he had veneration for her, answered the Marquis in this sort. You combat reason with so much force and address, as it cannot be easily beleeved that you doe
not know her; and the same wit which you have made use of to overthrow her
dominion, manifests sufficiently unto us that you are one of her subjects; and if
at any time you quit her, it is only in this passion, from whence some, who are not
acquainted with the nobleness of Love, would banish her. But for all that it is
certain, that she finds a place every where; that she can be the Mistress of all men;
that she can subdue all the passions, and all the griefs of the mind; make those of
the body to be supported without impatience; withstand our temperament, and
the influences of the Stars; and by her infinite force makes us vanquish our
selves, by obliging us oftentimes to destroy our own pleasures.
</p>
<p>To know this truth, we are but to consider,that the humours which predominate
in us, the constellation of the Stars, and that change which time works in our
temperament, do not change anything but our inclinations, which certainly are
caused by all these things: Howbeit that is not powerfull enough to delude reason,
who no way depending either on the melancholy humour, or on the Stars, can also judge soveraignly of all the apprehensions wherewith she inspires us. She hath
a seat more transcendent than our inclinations, which many times are found to be
very low, and corrected by reason. All Antiquity would furnish us with examples of it, and the wisest have left us marks of owing all their vertue to their reason, which having made them prefer the study of Philosophy before their inclinations, hath kept them from being the most infamous amongst men. And truly it
were to deprive us of all the advantages which we have over beasts, if our onely in-



<pb n="134" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="18     IBRAHIM, or     Part 2." ed="1652"/>
clinations should have the conduct of our lives: And to make it appear that
we have a destiny more noble than that same, we are but to observe that the
Creatures, which move not but by instinct, have one like unto it, and generall to all their kind. All Harts seek <hi rend="italic">dictamum</hi> when they are hurt; all Birds
of season seek for the Spring-time, and fly from the Winter without fayling;
which the Lyons doe not, nor so many Birds that doe not shift Country. This
instinct then is seen in all the creatures without ever failing, even as the race of the
Sun, the course of the Rivers, and all other things which doe not depend of themselves, doe alwayes follow the first order that hath been given them, and that is so <sic>ne-necessary</sic> to them, as they cannot fail. But as for man, it is not so with him; he is
absolute Master of his thoughts, and of his actions; nothing forces him, nothing
violents him, and he is so independent from all things, as he can even attempt upon
his own life, as was often seen at such time as it was lawsull to prefer death before
servitude. It cannot be said that this action, which destroyes Nature, is an effect
of a naturall inclination; there must be then a more powerfull reason than our inclinations, seeing it is certain, that of all the interiour apprehensions which Nature
gives us, there is none so strong, so predominant, nor so universall, as the desire of
life. In the mean time, since there have been men found able to vanquish it by reason, it may be consequently beleeved, that there are a great number of others, who
can force their inclinations, and judge soundly of all; and who, without considering that which pleaseth them, consider only that which ought to please them. For in
conclusion, our inclinations doe not move in us so powerfully as one may imagine
they doe; they having nothing common, as I have already said, with this instinct
of unreasonable creatures, which forceth a whole kind to doe one and the same
thing, and which is instead of reason to them; since we see, that not onely all Nations, all Provinces, but all men in particular, are so different one from another, that
many times there is more difference between an Italian and an Italian, than between
the whole Nation, and that of the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tartarians</hi>. Our inclinations, if we will
know them well, are no other than a secret motion, that carries us without violence
to please our selves more with one thing than another; some love the Woods better
than the Rivers; and others the Waters better than the Forrests, and that may be peradventure by temperament; they leave not both of them for all that to know, maugre their inclinations, the beauty of those things, and to delight in them, which
doe not touch their minds the most sensibly. But to shew that it is somewhat too
weak a thing to deceive reason, we are but to consider, that use alone forces our
inclinations. Liberty, which is so naturall to all the World, is a good that is not
desired by all the women of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>; custome onely makes them find their houses large
enough for their walks; and the place of their devotions far enough for their voyages. Judge then after this, whether reason can suffer her self to bc vanquished
by enemies which time doth surmount. As for the passions, I confess, that they
are a little more difficult to be destroyed; but yet I maintain, that if reason will
oppose them, she will appease them, and restore tranquility to the mind that is most
troubled. If reason then will act, it is certain, that, maugre the force of temperament, the influences of the Stars, and the ages of men, we shall see the melancholick sociable; the cholerick patient; the slothfull more active; a young Lover without inconstancie, and without indiscretion. I acknowledge nevertheless, that there
is a kind of passion, or to express my self more clearly, a kind of Love, which reason cannot destroy. This impotence proceeds not, for all that, from her weakness,
but it is because she never destroyes that which she hath established; and because
this Love, whereof I speak, is rather an effect of our reason, than of our passion;
and truly, when a Lover hath, in the person whom he loves, met with the beauty
of the body, of the mind, and of the soul; when as Vertue is mingled with all these
charms; when as his vowes are not rejected; when as he feares but the inconstancie of Fortune, and not that of his Mistress, it is impossible to say otherwise than
that reason is the Mother of a passion, that doubtless cannot disorder the mind;
that hath nothing base, nothing abject; that produces none but fair thoughts; that



<pb n="135" ed="digital"/>
<milestone n="19     The Illustrious BASSA.     Book I." ed="1652"/>
propounds no recompence unto it self; and that hath no other aym but to love eternally. If I were of a humour to contradict the opinions of others (answered the Marquis, laughing, and looking on <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, and then on <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>) I could shew you in few words, that at the very same instant when as you maintain, that one cannot be pre-occupated by his inclinations, you do not consult so much with your reason, as with your sense: But let it suffice for the finishing of our dispute, that I will make you see by my experience, that my inclinations shall be alwayes stronger than my reason; and not to stay longer in giving you an example of it, know, that though I am by the most perfect Princess in the World, and in the conversation of the worthiest persons of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, yet can I not chuse but be in some unquietness for that I doe not see the beautifull <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi>. The whole company could not forbear laughing at the freedome of the Marquis; and the Princess demanded of him, whether he had yet taught her Kinswomanthe French liberty, by
having persuaded her to receive his visits without her permission. Madam, said
he unto her, if any one be faulty in this occasion, it can be none but I; who going
out of your chamber for the reason which I have declared unto you, I took the
boldness to make use of your name, to be received into that of <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi>, from whence
I had not departed as yet if she had not driven me away. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> seeing it grow
late, wished the Count to bid the Princess good-night, for fear of incommodating
her, by making her stay up too long; and though she made them a complement to
assure them that they could never be troublesome unto her, yet they retired, and
were conducted by the principall Officers of her House to their Lodgings. The
Marquis would not abandon the Count, nor <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, his dear <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who nevertheless could have been well contented to have been alone for the better entertaining of his thoughts, but civility and friendship kept him from it. When as they
were abed, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who could conceal nothing from his friend, acquainted him, that
<hi rend="italic">Horatio</hi>, of the illustrious House of <hi rend="italic">Cibo</hi>, and the Count's Brother-in-Law, was in
love with his Sister; and that he almost was so too with the Count's Sister-in-Law,
although he had seen her but twice since his return: Howbeit that he had used his
best indeavour to oppose this passion, in regard he knew very well that this Maid
had an imperious humour, which would not be easily vanquished. <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> answered thereunto in such a manner, as perswaded <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> that he had a mind to sleep,
but indeed it was because his mind was so taken up with his own, as he was not
capable of hearkening to other mens affairs; so that <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> fearing to incommodate
him, gave over talking, and slept more quietly than <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> did.

<p>THe morn-ng bringing joy and delight again to this fair
Troop, the Princess would needes have the Count and the
Marquis bestow that whole day too upon her, and to pass it
away the more agreeably she led them to <hi rend="italic">Monton</hi>, a little
Town, some mile from <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, where the Princes of her
House had built a magnificent Paviglion, which she desired
to shew unto the Marquis. <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi> finding her self better
that night, made one also of the company, so that the Marquis was in the best humour of the World. And whereas the
Princess observed that his respects were not displeasing to her kinswoman, she said
to the Marquis, for to oblige him to talk, that whereas love ought to be without
supercherie as well as war, he having not as yet declared himself to be <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia's</hi>,
she might by his observance and services be induced to beleeve that he was capable
of a solid affection, and so ingage her further than was fitting. <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi> blushed
at this discourse, and the Marquis without giving her leave to speak, assured the
Princess, that he should not long conceal himself, and that the Count could confirm this truth unto her. Indeed, said the Count, he hath not used to keep himself
from being knowen, and if he would take the paines to recount unto you the first
adventure that befell him at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, his address would appear to the beautifull <hi rend="italic">&#x00C6;milia</hi>, and the relation no doubt would give your Exccllencie much content. Withall it will be better walking towards the evening, than in the midst of the day, and
you cannot pass it away better. The Princess, who was perswaded, that the Marquis his adventures could not chuse but be very pleasant, intreated him thereunto
with a great deal of civilitie; he excuses himself a while, but in the end she conjures him to it in the name of his last Mistress; It is she indeed, answered he, that is
most powerfull in my heart, and that makes me to obey. The Princess conducted
them then into a Cabinet, that was open on four sides, and whereof all the walks
were of cristall glass from the top to the bottom, that so the prospect might be the
more free. After they were set down there on seates of ebony, covered with carnation and silver tinsell, the Marquis began his History in this sort.

that you have done forthe publique libertic; theCount hath already acs]uainted

oiLucretia ) but that afterall I was noc to pretend to her affection.  I consessIh
for this time her reiistance provoked me more than her be^utv. Behold me then ic
solvcdto know from whence the impodibility of my enterprise procectkd; I call
la Roche to my succor, and command him to leoair to Lucretia, and to imploy all
his cunning to discover Livtaes true thoughts. He presses her, he intreates hei he
thre.iten; to abandon her,  and yet for all that she acquaints him with no part ct"
that he dclires to understand. At first she tells him , that she knowes nofsiing; after
wards that she is obliged to be faithsiill toher Mistress; then,'that it is a thin? past
remedy; and last of all, without any thought oftellinii him that which he reqnired
ihe saies that Livta is ingaged in an affection to another ,  whom she will not name!
This newes put me into choler,  and made me resolve once more to temptthelide-
litie of Lucretia; to which effect I gave la Roche a diamond, therewith to oblige this
wench to meet him one evening, and discover untohim the v.hole truth of I;sMs;
history. My liberalitie sailed not to perswade her better than his eloquence, she
nicetes him in a place sir enough out oi the v.ay to be overheard of any but my selt,
^vho umkrslood what she said without her perceiving it; and there, after she had
suffered her self to be a little intreated, she spake in this sort unto him. I know veiy
well that I commit a str,-,nge insidelitie against my Mistress,  but since it is to con-
serveyoii, and that you promise me you will not sprak ot it, I hope I shall notie-
pent me. I will tell you then, continued ssic, that about three dayes agoe,  wheiias
my Mistress was making an end of dressing her,  and that she was doing ibmethiiie;
about her head, where she had no need of me , she observed that I looked out at the
window with a great deal of attention, and that I had also pulled up the grate. And
whereas siie asked of me ivhat it was I looked at so earnelsly, I answered her boldly,
that it was at the worthiest man of all her lovers; meaning your Master, who then
passed along thorough the street.  I fear me&gt; replyed she sighing, that you and I are
not ofthe same opinion; howbeit, Lucretia., who is he that you do treat so advanta¬
giously to the prejudice of others ?Ic is laid I bein.::; become more hardy, theSrench
Marqui?, who verily hath an ayr,  and a countenance, which none ofthe rest have.
And for my part, I consess unto you, that I should bc more sensible fora raan of his
Nation, than of ours. I cannot tell, Lucretia, answered she ,  whether I Ihould have
been as sensibly touched as thee, is he of whom thou speakest had found my heart
without ingagenientjbut this I can tell, my dear girl, that it is not in an essate to
receive anv new irapression, for the truth is, lam in love. Arc you in lovc, saidi
mightily surprized &gt; I, siid she, I am in love, and that so exceedingly, as I am re¬
solved to tell him so much this day, who is the cause of my passion; and who after
my ill intrcating of him for two yeares together, is resolved to return unto Naplch
ofwhenceheis,andnever toconie to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> ai,a\n.  But I doc not purpoletobeto
vertuous, as to be thereby infortunate all the rest of my life ,  wherefore, my dear
Lucretia, thou raust this night, when as he is to come and take his leave ofme,
©ring him into the garden atsuch time as my father is alkep, where I will be rea¬
dy to receive him s for I cannot endure he should goe from me. He is of a conditi¬
on equall to mine, so that the greatest harm can arrive to me by it,  is to raary
him whether my father will or no, who peradventure will raake some dishculty of
it, bccuisc hc is not sb rich asI;howsbevei, Lucreti.%, doc as I have bid thee, and be
assured that I will raake thee happy, is thou prove faithfull to me. As I was prepa¬
ring to answer, her shthcr came into the chambsr.  In the mean time ni^ht amved,
and whereas I could doe no other but obey her,  I b^ou^htin Hortensto the hexso-

tert sell not out so, for still I conserved a littk affection, and a great deal of de¬
sire to be revenged.  But before I would resolvc on anv thing, I was willing to bc
vet better informed ofthe raatter, andto understand certainly whether//orz-s^-
L lay concealed at Leanders.  It was my good hap, that ^aleno, whom que¬
stionless you know , and that hath a wit very proper to irabroyl an intricate
affair , proved  to be a dear consident of his. And whereas we had con¬
trasted agrcat friendlhip together at my being at i?owi?, I went and sought him
out  and^having found him , I soon obtained of him what I desireds.^ He
told' liie , that not above an hour before he parted from Leander; how it wa$
true that Hortenso lay concealed in his House ,  by reason of an amorous ad¬
venture v/herewith he was very much troubled ,  because he was  inaraoured
ofa ndvce oi Cinthtoes, named AureLa, withwhom Hortenslo had had a parti¬
cular commercefor a good while together : How he was in good hope , Hortenslo
going away, and having no further pretension there, that he might have decla¬
red his love to Aurelia , but how far from that, Hortenslo, not onely remained hid
in his house, but had also obliged him to carry a letter to this Gentlewoman, to
crave her pardon for his parting away without bidding her farewell, excusing
himself upon this, that his grief for leaving her had kept him from doing so. He
told me likewise, that Aurelia had received Hortensio's letter tvith much testimo¬
ny of affection ; that Leander had been greatly tempted to discover unto her how
she was betrayed, andto make his profit of his friends deceit; but that in con¬
clusion friendship had prevailed with him above love.  That being returned to
Hortenslo, he had very much prest him to let him know why he was unfaithfull
to Aureliat how hehad sreely answered thereunto., that his inclination was to
Ltvia; how for the other, he served her out of acknowledgement, it being moit
certain that he was very much obliged unto her.  How after all this he had de¬
manded of him, whether a friend of his should disoblige him in thinking of her,
since he loved her but for consideration^ Uow Hortenslo wasnetled with this dis¬
course , aM had testisicd unto him that he would not endure it.  Behold, Madam,
theestate of things ; Livialowed Hortenslo, and was beloved ofhim; I loved X#-
via, and was ill intreated of her ;  Aurelia loved Hortenslo , and was betrayed
by him ; Leander loved Aurelia , not daring to discover it unto her , and
was an instrument of his friends treason; salerio was Leanders consident, and be¬
trayed him for my sake ; Lucretia for being faithstdl to/^ ^css^s, was unfaithfull
to her Mistress; in sine, we all of us almost did that which we ought not to have
done.  The business standing in these tcrmes, I resolved to speak once more with
Z-.«//.i; and whereas it is most certain, that when one comes to know that the Der«
ton beloved accords to another favours which she resuseth to him, he changeth re¬

contemning negligence, I said unto her in somewhat a bitter niaiiLr sw
be,tairess Uvta, that being unabk to merit any thing of you as a Lover  v.7 ^
the quality of a Gentkraan-Usher I raay be perraitted to help to lead ion  s
i&lt;now not, answered she, with aforious countenance, what renders you sobold.
to interrupt me in my way ; but I know very well, that is you have not a m
pole todiipkaso me, and did know my humour, you would not be so incoiili
derate as to dare to speak to me with so much liberty; for I make profeshon ofa
modesty, which cannot suffer such things, and which you raight very well under
stand by the coldness wherewith I have alwayes treated you.  I consess that the'
discourse neded me ; Icould not endure this sevcre vertue in aperson diat had
none but for me ; andthat reprochingme with her rigour, seemed as though she
Would make nie serve for the triumph of her Lover.  I retained her then by the
arm, as she was ofsering to goe away, and in a quipping and jeering manner, be¬
holding her with a malicious smile, I said unto her; icis true, Livia, that! have
been rassi and inconsiderate in daring ro list up my eyes towards a person of so ex¬
traordinary a vertue, as cannot suifor one to adore her; as cannot endure one
should speak to her of Lovc; as loves even darkness, and hates the light, bccaiis: k
niight discover that which she would conceal from most men.  Indeed, answered
she, I hate the Sun, because by it I see you.  It may bc, said I unto her with thesame
countcnance,and looking justly on her, that you do not hate the Koon so much to¬
wards raid-night.  Whereupon she strove mightily to get away, but in regard!
held one corner of her vail, she durst resist no turdier, perceiving plainly that I no
longer respested her.  Nay, said I unto her, as she would have gone from me, yoii
must hear me whether you will or no, for since i t is a sutc of Love, it is but just
that you should hear me, as well as you have heard niy Rivall ; and that to bc well
informed ofthe justice of our cause, you give him audience in the night, andnie
in the day; for] doe not desire that in consideration ofme an handkcrcher should
be hung in the Window; that LwrrssM should descend into the garden; that a door
which seem? to be ssiut, should be left open; nor that I should bc a gallant, who
seems to be absent, and yet sades not to be at the adignation which is given him.
Verily Livia's astonissiment raadc nie almoli- repent for what I had spoken, but in¬
deed I could not contain my resentment.  The first diing that Livia said afterthis
discourse, was; h.hLucretia,youhawe betrayed me s But this Wench,who inthis
occasion appeared to me to be the most dextrous and daring that ever was,answered
her with an extreme precipitation; I Madam ! would to Heaven you were not more
betrayed, in acknowledging that which I never revealed.  In the mean time , l»
Roche, who had heard allthat I said, wasr iich vexed at my enga^m^ Lucretia by
my discourse; so thatapproching to me, s e said softly to me in Srench, 0 Sir^
what have you done? I doc not know, said I ssepping a little back, but, is thou
canst, re-accommodate this diforder.  During this, Lucretia swore salse oaths to
heiMistrcisfor the clearing of her innoccncy; and the ^oor Livia was so surpri-
ledj as sile could resolve of nothing ; in sine, wc v.creall four exceedingly perplex¬
ed ; I was vexed for having spoken so lavissily ; Lucretia was much troubled in
justisyin;&gt; her self; my Agent knew not what to doe, either for Lucretia, or forme;
and Z-zr/.s could think ofnoth ing that would satishe her : She vvould fain-have
railed on me, but she saw that I was too much acquainted vvith her affairs to be
incensed more; She could have been contented never to have seen me again, but she
feared left partin.a; away without saying any thing unto me, I should publissi that
which I knew. At last, shc vvould willingly have recalled me,for I vvasstept a lit¬
tle from her,and stood niusing with my self, biu her heart vvould not consent that she
should use any civility tome after that vvhich I had said unto her.  Behold,]\la-

<p>ic,arprocheduntoL,^/.,andsaidunto her forthe justisicatson ofi;.rr../-*, with a
kenSg irnccritic: I knoi very well, Lady, that I do put my self in singer of being
turned away by my Master,  in dikovcring a thing unto you, which he grs^tly la¬
bours to conceal, but the condition wherein you are, and the innoccncy of Lucr^^'s'
forces me to open it unto you. Know then, continued he,  that whatsoever he hath
said unto youis not theeffect of niybodies treason, butofAstrology, which he un¬
derstands pcrkstly. It is a kicnce wherein he is become so expert,  that is I should
recount unto you the mervailcs, which I have heard him tell, you would be migh¬
tily forprlkd with it. And whereas he is passionatdy in love with you, seeing you
very rigorous to him, he hath spcrtt every night for these eight dayes in con¬
templating the Starres, and turning over his books,  to dikover the cause
thereof, and without doubt it was by this meanes that he is come to know that
whichhe hath said unto you: he hath shewed me, condnued hc,the garden, where
you were, in a great s}ass, though I would  not undcrstand what you said.
Trudy the invention ofthis lad amazed me ; it was in vain forme to make signes
unto him to hold his peace; the raore unquietness that I shewed, the more he conti¬
nued speaking; and I may say that I was never in greater pain, for I heard all that he
said. But whereas! saw that he went confounding things, andthat from an Astro¬
logcr he would quickly make me pass fora Magician , in talking of an inchanted
glass,  I resolved to help forward this trick, that so I might make him hold his
tongue, Vv herefore I called him somewhat rudely, and having commanded him to
withdraw, I came to X/sM with civilitie enough,  just as Lucretia was saying to
her boldly, how she had already heard it assured indeed, that I dealt with telling of
fortunes. And having fainted her for the better colouring ofthe business,  I seemed
to bc very angry with la Roches imprudence, in discovcring to her a thing ,  whicsi
I would not have known, inregardof the brutissiness of the people, who imagine
that one cannot observe the Starres, without having commerce with the Dcvill; and
know not how to put a disserence between Astrologic and inchantments.  But
hnce the fault was done, I desired her to oblige me to her discretion, by not publissi¬
ing that which had been told her. I said unto her also, that parting from the Court
of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, I had past through Provence , where hapning to be lodged near to a great
Noftradamus, so admirable in this sciencc, as it was not known whether he should
be tcarmed a Prophet, or an Astrologer , I had been so happy, as to touch his incli¬
nation, andto gain his friendship even to the point to teach me apart of the ex¬
cellent things he knew, either for Astrologic, Phisiognom'y, or Chiromancie.  In
hne, I spake to her with so much art, as she beleeved me; and beleeved too that L«-
cretia^a, innocent, who on her side played her part so well,  as she made me assia¬
med. She clapt her hands together, she accused her Mistress for having jaccused her;

men had imployed all their lives in this study,and had taken upon shem'she naaie s
Astrologers, but that few had come to the point of descrving ir.Then turning him t
me with a more open countenance, he said unto me, that iTi were such a one as hi^
daughter told him, he would serve me with all his heart; that he was very mu h
assested to men of merit, and to the lovers of sciences, whereofthe vulgar wer
ignorant; and that in conclusion, is, he should tell me truth, he must consess that i^n
times past he had given himselfto judiciary Astrology; but that the trouble of do¬
mestick affaires had kept him from excelling therein ; howbeit that he still kncwe-
nough to be able to discourse a little with me of it, is* I would come and viUit hini
at his house, whereof he shewed me the door. I leave you to judge, Madam in what
a case a man raightbe , that knew not so much as the names of the Signesand Pla-
nets; I made use of considence then in the incounter, and told him that I vvould
not sail to come and take outalessonwith him, and assured him that he should
have a scholler of me, vvhich vvould receive his instrustions vvith a great deal of
joy. Leonardo Q so is this man called _) took this true speech for a modest
civility ; and said unto me again, that he should be glad to hear me tel! him
something of his fortune; and to perswade me that he was knowing he said to nie
also, that he had a great clesire I should goe and dispute vvith him a little in his Ca¬
binet, that he might know whether the Planets s except Mars and Saturn^ whose
insluences be the happiest, are not they whose pararclls are the greatest. Now forme
that should have been healed of a quartan ague vvith a word less terrible than this
I saw it was time to retire , vvhich I did after I had told him again that I vvould
very ssiortly come home to him and shew him my ignorance. He vvould have obli¬
gee! me to enter presently vvith him , btit I excused my self dextrously from it, and
so departe4, after I had salutcd Livia civilly enough, and beheld Aucretta vvith a
iign, that testisicd unto her how I was forry I had given her so much unquietness
inso little a time. I was not four stepps from them but regarding this adventure
with a more quiet eye, I found it so pleasant, that I had no other pashon but to
make it last as long as I could : And this manner of revenging my self appeared so
sweet unto me , as I thanked la Roche above an hundred times for finding out this
invention, seeing it had succcedcd so well. Now entring into my lodging I met
with Valeria, unto whom I gave an accouilt of all that hapned unto me , wherewith
sie was so surprised and ravished, as he could not believe that which I told him, so
much did hc fear that it was not true. He would not rely upon my word, but would
have the testimony ofmy Agent too; and though I was ofsended at it, yet was he
above an hoWCr doubting whether it were a jeis, or a truth, which I told him. But
in the end, perceiving I spoke seriously he believed me, and this trick so pleased hij
humor, and touchedhis inclination so mightily, that hc loved me a great deal the
more for it.lt was advised thanisince the father had had a part in the dcccite,and that
the business raightbe divulged, that it was better to have me pass for an Astrologer
than for ah impoftor, and to sow the bruite of it about the Town, before Leonardo
Ihould have leisure to discover that hc had been gUlIcd: But I opposed this advisca
</p>
<p>sood while, for, said I, no sooner shall Ibc considered as a Contemplator ofthe
tarrcs, but they will come and ask me an hundred questions, whereunto I should
not know what to anslvcr , so that I cannot tell how to turn my self in this affair.
What yoii shall answer, said my Agent &gt; You ssiill inswer, continued he, just as o-
thers doe; sometimes I, sonietimes no, bc it favourably or satally, and for the rest,
much good may it do them ; for in conclusion, 'an Astrologer never warrants any
thing. Valeria sell a laughing at this discourse, and told me likcWise for the uphol¬
ding of this opinion, that this sciencebeing so dilsicuk as it was, it might be that
chance would make me prophecy sooner, than all Astrologicall rules and speculati-
ons; That I was but to speak alyvaies obscurely; never to assirm any thing with cer¬
tainty; to consider a little the quality and age of persons; to speak scldom of the
past, or thepresent, vtsithout good information threreof; andof tlic suture to din
course alwaies by Emblemes, and Ehigtnaes, and commonly to farctell more good

that as soon as hc had perceived him, he had made as though he had not Ceen
him, and that passing by him with his eyes on the ground, hc said somewhat loud,
I did never think that a man could have wrought such Prodigies; That there¬
upon L^Wirr had stayed him , and asked him what those marvails were whichhe
had seen V That hc secming to be much surprised with his over'-hearing him, had
answered, I can scarce tell, so much am I still transported with astonishment and
admiration at that which I have seen; That afterwards Ls&lt;««^sr had prest him ve¬
ry much to tell him what it was; and whereas he would have been forry not to
have satished his curiofity, he had consented thereunto, but that first he had used
allthe ceremonies ofa man that would deliver a great secret; that he had look¬
ed all about to sQe whether they raight be over-heard; that he had made hint
swear that he should not speak of it again to any body , onless it were to his most
speciall friends; That in sine hc had omitted nothing of whatsoever might make
him hearken with attention, and render him credulous.  And that after all these

<p>I was there. And this too is one of the least things he can doc ; for is I shall tell
you the truth, I have seen and heard a picture speak, and that is it whkh causes
the consusion wherein you see me. Leander was so surprised, as Valerio told nic that
he changed colour at it, and earncstly intreated him to bring him acquainted with
me, which he promised to doe, upon condition that he should not publish what I
had told him, for fear I might bc suspested to be a Magician; and that at lcn&lt;^th
after many other discourses on this subject, they parted very well satished one of
another. And for a conclusion, Valeria s2.id unto me , this is the first sod I
met withall; then he recounted to me how hc went unto the Academy, where he
had imparted to a great many the Wonders that I did ; that to publish them the
better, he had told them unto them in their ear, and had prayed them not to
ipeak of it, or at least wise not to name me; that going from thence he went and
made a turn about the Market-place , where he had met with a man , who re¬
counted unto him part of the things that he had told in secret to the Academy, as
one that was verily perswaded of it; which had so astonished him, as to keep
his countenance hc was fain to enter into a Tennis-court, where hehad found a-
ncther man, whom he knew not, that was talking very earnestly to sive or six per¬
sons, which hearkened to him very attentively, and assuring thera that Iwas the
greatest Astrologer ofthis Age; ancl that hehad seen me doc an hundred things,
whi^h he recited unto them. That whereas he could not forbear laughing, he had
set himself merrily to contradist him, but that this raan without going about to
seek for reasons to convince him, had told him roundly, that he spake in that raan-
ner, because he did not know me, but that he spake upon certainty, for that I was
one of his best friends, it being not an hour since he parted from me; so that after
he had recounted all theso things unto me, said r'".j/^no, despairing of making a
better encounter than that ofthis man,I came away to find you out,so satissicd with
my lye, as is it should alwayes succecd so luckily, I would raake a vow never to
speak truth again. After we had laughed well at this adventure, and rightly ad¬
mired the santasticalness of the World, which loves to bcleeve, or at least to pub¬
lissi bad newes, and prodigies, we saw my Agent return, whose voyage had had a
quite other success. He had met but with few to publissi that whichhe desired
should be known,so that being mad for having done so little for a man ofhis humor
and address, be had resolved not to come back till some good adventure bcsdl him.
He had sought then in vain for some one to deceive, when as a Maid, named Camib
la,-who seryed Aurelia, said to him in passing close by him at such time as on:
could scarce see, follow me. It is sussicient to say, that this Lad was brought up
in my service, to make one be assured that he followed her foot by foot, for fear of
lofing the fight of her. This Wench led him into a by-lane, where few solks
came, for it was almost nothing .but garden walls; When they were arrived
there^ Camilla told him, that a person very considerable, both for her merit &gt;
and her beauty, attended a speciall service from me; that the reputation which
I had of being the civilleft of men , made her hope that I would not resuse her; and
that is I would do her this grace , I should not sail then to be at a little garden
door, which sbe shewed him in the same lancj and to oblige him to trustin

hmk that L./.... serret will bc none to my Master , for ishe plcasof he knowes
tha which now we doe. Alas! said the wench again, how assraid ara I of h.sac-
ctfaintance, and how do I wissi that he raay never think of me  There is nothing to
be feared, said la Roche unto her , when as he knowes your adventures, for he is as
dis-reet as he is knowing. But at last after a reasonable long cominunication, where
Camilla still assured, that she would by no meanes serve such a Maskr, she told me ,
that I was not to sail,  is it wcrcpofsibk, in being at that garden door the same
nieht when as the Moon was down;  or is I could not bc there accordingly , that
then I would be there the next night at the same time ; that she would be .ready at
that place to give me entrance, and her Mistress in the garden, where I ssiou d speak
with her. I conkss, when la Roche related this unto us that I could not chuse but take
sreat pleasure in it, ^and much desire to read the note that was written to me.  Is I
had as happy a memory as a ^#w^»^« Heros , I would recite it unto you without
changing a illlable, but since I hive it not, it shall sussi'ce that I do tell you in gene¬
rall, how Aurelia intreated me with a great deal of ci vilkie and affection ,  that I
would imploy that niervclous kicnce, which I exercised so nobly, in setting her
wind at rest; that from me alone she expested succor for her unquietness, and that in
sine,is I v/ere a Srenchmanswhich according to her sence was to say civill) I would
not resnk her. Valerio was so ravished with this encounter ;  my Agent was so glad
of it; and at first dassi I found it so pleasant, as we past away an hower very merrily.
But whenl perceived that Valerio would have me try this adventure, my pleasure
diminished by the half: The more I opposed his will, the more he persisted in Van¬
quissiing mine; it was in vain for me to represent my ignorance unto him, thedis-
ordcr that might arrive unto me by it, the perplexity Wherein a man would find
himselfto be, when he raust speak of that he does not know; for to all these objesti¬
ons he had wherewith to answer me.  Hc in the first place laid it down to me for a
ground, that to the end I raight not be taken for an impoftor by Leonardo, and to au-
thoril'e the cheat which hc had used to an hundred persons, in assuring them that
I was a great Astrolo ger, it was necessary,  that I should use two or three one after
another; that otherwise I should lose the reputation which he had gained me ; that
isl resuscd to meet Aurelia, it was irapofsible bttt she should speak ofit to some bo¬
dy, and so I should be cryed down , and out of abilitie to be revenged of Livia by
this artifice ; that I cduld notracetwitha fairer occasion toraake shew ofmy art
with sacilitie, in regard it required but the beguiling of a maide,' who doubtless
was well perswaded already ofmy sciencc, since shehad been so hardy as to intreat
me to come and speak with her; that in sine, seeing ^«rts//&lt;« had been so weak as
to belecve things just as one vvoulcl desire she ssionld bcleeve them , it vvould questi¬
onless be very easie for me to sadssic her; And for a conclusion,said he unto me, she is
young, she is fair, she wiU meet you in a garden ,  and irt the night, judge now as¬
ter all this, whether you are not to go thither. It is certain that this last reason mo¬
ved me very much; and ] selt then such a repugnancie inresusiiig a fair maid, as I
nude no longer question what I should doc; wherefore I prepared my self for it,
and for the more secur i ty,  Valeria and my Agent armed themselves to attend me at
this garden door. As for my self I carried nothing but my sword vvith me ,  for I
could not fear that the universall adorer of women,  should be betrayed by a wo¬
man. But before I tell you what arnved to me in this garden, I must recount unto
you. Madam, that vvhich was the cause of this adventure; for we vvere made ac¬
quainted with it afterwards; You remember,no doubt,hovv I told you, that Lean¬

<p>der was the first whom Valerio had perswaded that I was an Aiirologer'-, and sonie-
what niore;and that Leander vyas the same in whose house 7/or/-s«/;o lay concealed*
I remember all this, said the Princess, interrupting him , and to testifie it unto you'
I remember that Leander loved Aurelia, and durst not tell her so much, because Hor.
tenslohad ionie coranierce vvith her, although it was //methat pofsessed his heart
and that Lss;*«^i?r play'dbut an outward part in being constrained to scrvetheim-
pofture of his friend, and to carry Hortenslees letters to, Aurelia as ishe had bccnab-
ient, though indeed he lay concealed in his house for to goe every night unto Ljvi/
in a garden.Since it isso,said the Marquis, I am then but to tell you, Madam,that
^ster Leander had been povverstilly perswaded of the wonders which r^/mo had told
him I could doc, he changed the resolution he had taken to stay till//orssw/a had
broken oir with Aurelia,\nto that of disabusing her by a pretty subtiil way, it she h-d
had a true ground for it, an.l that I had been siich a one as he beleeved me to be. And
behold how hereasoncd with himself; I am going, said he, to Aurelui for a letter
which she is to give meto day for Hortenslo, whora she beleeves to beat Naples, or
on the way thither, she hath already shewed a great deal of grief for his ablence;
now isl can bring her to speak of that again, I will tell her ^hatValeno hath told
me of the Srench Marquis; so that isshe shall happen to bc curious to see her abseni
Loverbythescience of this man, she shall likewiie see that hc is not aiNaples-^ that
he is still at &lt;7sw«^; that hc loves another, and by these meanes I shall destroy her
affection to him, and it raay be raake my profit of this diforder. This resolution ta¬
ken, he goes to Aurelia, who after she had given him her letter , sayled not to speak
ofthe absence of her Friend, to ask of him whether he thought it would notbe
long ere he would return ? Whither he had not taken this separation heavily ? and
whither he had not already a longing to see him again, though it were but lately
since he went away I Yea so great a one, answered Leander, who would by no
meanes lose so fair an occasion, as I ara almost resolved to try the sciencc ofa gr^ac
and excellent man , that is not far ofs. Aurelia straitway would needes know of
him what he meant by that which he said, whereupon he recounted unto her all
that Valerio had told him, and a great deal more; that I raade the dead to speak, and
those that were absent toreturn again , but in such a raanner, that one saw the per¬
sons , whom one desired to see, as is they had been effectuaJly in the place where
diey seenied to be; and that this was done without inchantment, and by naturall
Causes, but hidden from most part ofthe w^orld; that one must be very skilfull inthe
knowledge of ideas and simpathies for the comprehending of aliy part ofthese
niervclous effects; but in sine, how he was certain, that what hc said was true. v^«-
relia hearkned to this discourse with much attension; at first, she seemed to doubtof
that which Leander told her, but it was doubtless to make her self the more alTn-
red ofit. For after he had consirmed the matter unto her, as ssi.e desired it; andthat
hehad told her my name, siie demanded dexterously of him where I lay, andby
what way one durst propound such things unto me, seeing I was a raan of quality)
and that raade no publick profession thereof. He answered her, how it was tobe
done by request, and that isshe desired any thing ofme, he had a friend that wast¬
ry intimate with me. She thanked him, andsocivilly gave him to understandthat
she would be well contented vvith his cleparture. He was no sooner gone, butshc
calledC&lt;«w///rs, vvho was the consident of her secrets sfor she recounted asl this to
me afterwards) and reported faithfully unto her all that Leander had told her.And
for a conclusion, she shewed her that she was absolutely resolved to speak vvith me,
and to intreat me to let her see her dear Hortenslo , of vvhom she had not taken her
leave. They rcasbned a while upon this subject, but at last lovc prevailed vvith her
above &lt;^ood raanners. Camilla told her Mistress, that she knew a raan by fight vvhich
served me; sothat without further delay she chofe rather to write to me, aslhave
declared u'nto you, and to raake use of this vvench,than to accept ofthe ofser which
Leander had made her. In the mean time, the bovver of assignation being come&gt; i
went to the garden door; T/i/mo and my Agent stayed three or fourpaccsof , tiUi

t nded lie in a Cabinet, which was at one corner of the Garden, whether she pre¬
en lykd me.  It is very true, that when first I law Aurelia she seemed so fair tin--
t M L houHh she were half covered with her vajl, asl.ttk lacked but that I had
-00 ei to hi rathcr.of the beauty cs her eyes, than of the insluences of the Srai ^
iv t^^ye menokafore to deliberate on my complement; for she spake si iss,and
desired me to pardon herthe boldness shehad rakcn in putting me to the trouble to
cone to see hen  she prayed me to consider, that since she had sailed in the re-
p?st which sheowedlo lierself, she raight well sail in the civility which was due
to me I answered to this dikourk with a great deal of subraission ; afterw.ods
helpikctomeof the reputation which I had for Astrology, of the things that she
had been told ofme, and how much shc had desired to see me.  I received theso
oraises with a carelesnes-, respestsoH enough for all that, which doubtless made her
belecve that I thought I well dekrved it.  And still to gain time I lengthened this
discourse as much as pofsibly I could; but ssic, that came not thither to makeconi-
pkmentssaid with a low voycc, as though shehad been afraid to be over-heard,
though there was no body there but Camilla, that kept Sentincll at t.ie Cabinet-
dore  the Wonders which have been recounted tO nic of your Science, perswades
me that it would be easie for you, isyou will, to spare me the labour to  tell
you that Which I desire of you, since without qnestion you know it already.
It is certain that this discourk surprised me after a strange sort; audi beleeved,
in the consusion wherein I was, that I should find nothing to answer her with; but
at length, after a great contest with my self, it is for the same reason, said I, that
your raodesty ought not to keep you from spciking; for seeing it is a secret which
I am not ignorant of, what you shall say of it ought not to add any thing to your
consusion.  It is true, said she, but I should be glaclder to hear it from you, than
tohave it delivered by me; be not therefore so lieorous, andis itbep6ssible, doe
that which I desire without my telling it you.  This pbstinky made me almost
mad, and I vow to you, that the modesty of the severest Missress that ever I had,
troubkd menotforauch, as that ofthis Muid;  And seeing this consusion still
dugmenring, Isaid unto her with the tone of a more serious voice ; Fair Aure-
ita, I should be willing enough not to oblige you to the doing bs a thing that
seeras unprofitable to you, is Iliad not a secret reason which consTraincs me there¬
unto; and since I raust let you understand it, know, that by the force ofmy art,
I can tell not onely that which you desire ofme, but whatsoever hath arrived unto
you,that which you think at this prescnt,and that which ssial besall you hereastcr;buc
is by a plain and faithfull relation, jou doe not shew the consent you bring to
that which you would have me doe for you, it will bc irapofsible for me to serve
you; and beware, said I unto her, listing up niy voice, left that which you call mo¬
desty, bc not an effect of the doubt you have of my Science, in desiring by this
essay to assure your self of it.  There raust be considence in this mystery, continu¬
ed I, for I doe not work onely by thcordinary Wayes of Astrology, but I think I
have gotten some extraordinary knowledges which go beyond thern:And to testisy
it unto you, I will presently tell you, is you desire it, all the most secret thoughts
of your heart, but after that look for nothing more from me.  Shcsbycd me thien
with a great deal of precipitation , and said to me almost trembling, seeing it is a
tnbtite which I mustrCnder unto you, I am resolved for it; then she redounted
unto me that which I knew already without inchantment, Im can, that she loved
Hortenslo; but she told me afterwards that which I knew not, namely, that ssic
would have me shew her that Lover, whom she beleeved to be at t^aples, but was
sldlX at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>.  This propofition put me into a strange diforder ; I Void her at
first, that the matter was not easie; that it behoved her to have a great deal of cou¬
rage to undertake it; thatthe appantion of Spirits, which Were not at that time
many other but a santasticall body, did alwayes bring fear along with it; and
that she should think well of that which she desired, before she undertook it.  Shd
answered me then, that nothing which resembled Hortsnslo could scare her.  When¬

the neccssity wherein I was, rendred me ingenious, and I iraaained a trkk  whi
hath shewed by the event, that it was well conceived.  I told her then with a rnlr
open countenance that her considence pleasod me; and that I was ravished to s
a person of her Sex have a Spirit hardy enough for an enterprik which made til
boldest to tremble.  But to make it succecd, she was to write a note, according
the tearnis which I would distate unto her, and let me carry it away to make m^
sigures upon it, assuring her that I would tear it as soon as the mystery was sinilli^
ed ; and that this amongst the Learned was called, the making of a covenant with
the Ideas.  She made a little dissiculty at it, but having told her how I could doe
nothing without that, she consonted thercuntO;and by good hap there was a pen and
ink in the Cabinet, and a Table-book, wherein we found a white leas.  She besan
then to write what I distated unto her,  which isl be not deceived was much as.
ter this manner.

<p>A Lt hough you goe in the night like an Angel of darkness, yet pass you with me

not donbt that soagreeable a vislou jhall sright me, for I ajsure you that it [hall sive
me more pleasure than fear.

<p>Aurelia.
</p>
<p>Whereas her mind was already pre-occupatcd with the opinion of my skill,
these equivocating words, of an Angel of Light, of Darkness, of Conjuration, of
blcssed Spirit, of Heaven, of Apparition, of Vision, and of Fear, sailed not tocon.
sirm her in this belies.  And then too I pronounced all those great words widi so
imperious a tone, as I perceived her to be terrisied therewith.  After this, ! would
needs see her hand also, and would have her six her looks upon me; I demanded
of her the hour and day of her birth, and made many other observations, which
would be too long to recite.  But at last, all these devices being over , I quitted
Aurelia, after Ihadprondsed her that within three nights she should see her dear
Hortenslo, and so Camilla came to conduct me forth.  In traversing the Garden I
observed that Camilla hid her face with a great deal of care, for fear left I should
read the secret of her heart in her eyes; and whenaa I perceived it, I said tohsr,
laughing for the raaking up of the Comedy , in vain, Camilla sfor so had I heard
Aurelia call her^ doe you seek to hide your eyes from me, when as I plainly see your
heart.  Now I besecch you Sir, said this Wench unto me, raightily surprised, and
that was naturally merry and joviall, is yoti know my secret, doe not tell it unto
my Mistress, for then will the poor Nastagiobe turned out of doors.  I had such a
mind to laugh at this simplicity of Camilla, as I got me out in hast, for fear I should
burst out into laughter, or be stisled in the place ; howbeit I told her in going fordi
that I would be discreet.  I found Valeria in so great an impatience to know what
I had done, as I could not make him resolve to stay till we came to our Lodging
to recount it unto him, for we had not made three steps but we stood still, so tkat
little lacked but we had past all the night in the strcets; bur at length we came dii'
ther, where I recited all this unto him.  Bur the pleasure ofit was, that I had been
so accustomed so speak to Aurelia in a grave tone, as I delivered every thing un¬
to him just as I had said it.  And to make up the matter, there were some instan-
ces, where I was not very certain whether I were not indeed the same which I gave
cut my self to be.  When as I shewed him Aurelia s Letter, he demanded ot me
what design I had in raaking her to write it ? What design, said I , even to have
it to sall into the hands oi Hortenslo, who bclecving that Aurelia knows he lies con¬
cealed at LsW&lt;rr^ house ,  in regard she writes unto him, will not sail to be at the
place which she hath assigned hini'by her letter, tofee is he can justisie himself; »n'i

soaold For Hortelso retyring very late from Lr^.^ve had had the leasure to attend
for him alrac st an hour bcforl he came forth.Is the passion wherein I had been m for
thisraaid, had been as strong still as it was the day before, Ihad past that timewith
a great deal of unquietness; and I should without doubt have rather given some
marks of my resentment t.i my Rivall, than have caused a letter to be delivered
•into him; but I never needed four and twenty howersto cure me of such a ciis-
cak. I kit then nothing raore for Uvta, but an extreme desire to trciible her plea-
lure- so that to arrive thereunto, I had as much patience, as was requisite for me to
havcinthis incounter. We set our selves, T^/.m and I, some dofcn pacesfrom the
door,out of which Hortenslo was to come,under the jetting-out portall of an house ,
that was buik after the and que manner. As for/rsi?or/7^ he approched nearer, yet
not sofar from us, butthat we raight hear all that he should say unto him. And
whereas it wascxtrcrac dark, and that his way tycd him to pass by th'" place where
we were, ive conceived that we should hear, without being perceived, how he
wt.iuld receive this message. As indeed, he was no sooner come forth but I heard my
Agent say unco him, that Aurelia havhig understood he was in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, had sent
him with a kttcrunto him, which he delivered him ; and that she earnessly desired
hini ncato sail the assi&gt;iiation shc had therein given him, for that ihe would receive
no answer but from his own mouth; in regard whereof, continued la Roche, I may
not stay to hear any thing you would say to me, for so ara I enjoyncd by Aurelia.
J/orrs«/?"o would have laid hold on him, but my Agent was not accustomed to let
himiels be taken, when he had no mind to it; Hortenslo then was coiistrayned to be
contented with that which had been said to him. We heard him stamp with his foot
on the ground, chap his hands together, and say with a kind of voycc, which shewed
both astonilhment and grief; what dcvill hath discovered to Aurelia that Iwas
here? It raust without doubt be an effect of the secret passion of Lww&lt;^sr, who hath
hoped by ruining me with her to establissi himself in my stead. Some three steps from
thence he stood si ill, and whereas we saw that this adventure made him talk like a
man bciidcs himself, wc resolved to follow hini. This design wasno sooner taken,
but he began to go on and talk all at an instaut. What said he , hath my friend be¬
trayed me ? however i raust see Aurelta, to the end I raay keep Leander from rea¬
ping the sruit ofhis cunning, and that this incensed maid may not revenge her
self upon Lria. She loves me ,'rand I do not doubt but I shall pacisic her easily
enough. But it may be, said he again, that it is not Aureliacs letter; let us stay , till
wc can bt ckai cd of it, before we resolvc on any thing. Verily, this manner of dis-
courlingby himself seemed pleasant enough, howbeit that which I found to be yet
better was, that we perceived s for we followed him very close ) how though the
night u as exceeding dark, and that wc were in a very narrow street, where it was
so obsdire, as nothing could be discerned , yet had he broken up the seal of this kt-

vvhich the paper made caused us to conjesture so.But the ill luck was, that in ha H

slung it a good way from him , without purpofing so to do, for he sought for" ^
pretty while after. We underssood this accident, both by the discourse which h*
held, and because he stood still. We got us up, Valerio and I, against the wall • but t
ronsess to you , that this adventure was not pleasing to me: I was so assra'idth \
Hortenslo vvould not seek as hc should do for the letter, and so my design IhonM

from it to find it; that he had forgot the place where he had let it sall; that perad¬
venture it was near to me, though I did not perceive it; in sine, I was even vvij.
.ing to seck for it vvith him; and my imaginadon so troubled me, as I believed]
sivv it in twenty places, where certainly it was not. And when my mind was
deceived in this manner, I was in a pain that cannot be exprest; For whenas I
ti\oUiiht that I sa'?v it in a place, I understood by Hortensloes going diathcvveiit
troni it, vvhich so madded aie, as I had like to have lost al! patience. But at length

have not lols my labour: Whereupon he went presently away, and I retaining V,\lt-
lerio, who would have continued follow ing him, told him, that is the like should
besall me again, J should go wild; that this adventure was both too pleasing, arid
too ofsensive, for me to be once more expokd unto it; and that withall wehadno*
thing else to do with him. Wc got us away then to our lodging, where we found my
Agent, howbeit we went not to bed before we had laughed sussiciently at the a:d-
dent ofthe letter, and at all thatwhich Hortenslo had said in seeking for it.  Inthe
mean time he was come to Leanders house, where after he had read the letter, whicli
he knew to be written with her own hand, he was consirmed, as we understood il-
ter, in the design of seeing her. Hc beleeved, that all those words, of blcssed Spirit,
Angcll of light, and darkness, which Aurelia had taken for markes of inchantiueDt,
•w^ere termes of galantry, that could not part from a spirit that was ranch incensed,
He sirmly resolved then to see her the night ensuing; and thereby to conserve her
to himself^ preserve the reputation of Livta, and destroy the designes ofhis friend,
ivhonvlie waspcrswaded had betrayed him; for he could not conceive hov? Ame¬
lia could come to knovj any thin^ of h\m other vtaies.  But at length day came,
which I past away with an impatience that holds me still; forthough I had thesanic
very day two very pleasant coiiversations with tvvo men, whereofthe one niocktat
Astrology, to oblige me thereby to speak of it, and the other said that it was the
cxcellenteli: of all Sciences, to carry me to the same things yet will I not speak there¬
of; for even as I am now talking, I am in hast to tell you, that assoonas the time of
Hortensloes alsignation approched, I went and put my self in ambuscado,  with arc*
solution to see the end ofmy inchantment. Now it hapned, thatthe weatherbeinj
extreme hot, Aurelia lay in a low room,  whose grated windowes were upon the
street, and where Hortenslo had often talked with her. But, Madam , to give youth:
full pleasure ofthis adventure , I am to tell you, not onely that which I saw, ana
that which I heard, but thatwhich past between AureliaandCamilla,\shovccsm-
ted it afterwards unto us.Assoon a$ Aurelia hadsupped, she made as though skc were
not well, that sb she might be alone with CamiUa,  and when she was come to her
Chamber, this wench asked of her, whether she did indeed believe she should see
tlortcni'o that night '*. For, said she, how canaman that is sofar distant from hence
come hitherto you in so short a time ?  The Mistress, who thought her self a great
deal more able, laughed to hear her say so; and took a great care to make her com¬
prehend, that this Science was above her understanding; and told her moreover,
how it would not be esscstively Hortenslo vthich she should see, but something that
stould resemlsse him so persestly, there would be no disserence. Howbeit, said s'*"
niilla unto her, what do you hope by seeing him so ? .what entertainment ? vvh«

Camilla,Win you not be assraid &gt; Never a whit, answered ^/^rs//.t. J ust as she was
saym-iv, Hortenslo, who I had seen pass by the place v?here I was hid, .md whom
I had followed pretty clofc,knocked lostly,accoi ding to his custom, at the windovy,
Whkh Aurclia'hcarwi^ began to change colour. Itmay be you believe, saici Camil¬
la unto her, that it is Hortenslo w hich makes this noite, or to say better his phaii-
tasnie ? I do notbelc:ve it, anivvered Aurelia, howsoever open the window, and
pull up the iii-ate. This wench had no sooner obeyed, but perceiving Hortenslo, they
both of them gave a sreat ssirick ; Camilla finding her selt as very a coward , as ssic
bdieved she v\as; and Aurelia being nothing sb consident, as she had thought she had
been. Hortenslo expounded this astonishment after another manner, and believed
that the choler she was in against him , put her into that case vyherein he saw her,
nameiy vvith a countenance extremely changed,and her spirit so confounded, as
stic could neither sit still, run away, nor behold him. And whereas he was corac
thither onely to appease her, he said unto her that at laii: this Angell ofdar|^ness
Was come by her conjurations to see an Angell of light. O me, siid Aurelia, it is
the voice of Hortenslo ! but I am not able to ansvver him ; nor is it to speak to him
that I have vvilhedto see him. In saying so, her exceeding fearso reaniraated her
forces, as she was able to get away into a Cabinet, whereof the door was open.
Asfor r^/w///^, she vvould fain have soflowed after her Mistress, but her astonissi¬
ment kept her from is. Not being able then to do more, or to say better, not know¬
ing what she did, she hid herself under the table. Hortenslo was so amazed at that
vvhich hc saw, as Aurelia could hardly be more. In the mean time , that he might
get her to come back again , and knowing, that she could hear him well enough
trom the Cabinet where she was, belaid unto her with a languilhing voice to
move her the more; Am I come sb far then, Aurelia, onely to see you, and will not
you voiichsase to look on me V Alas! CryedC/iw)//^ toher Mistress, that which wc
think is but too fare, for he saies hc is come onely to see you. Aurelia, that was
ready to dy \nheArin2,Hortcnslo rpieak,whom she believed tobe a phantasme, cryed
tohim out of the Cabinet to be gone; and that she made a vow how she would never
see Hortenslo more; unless it were Hortcr,slo indeed. He who believed that she meant
he V, as no longer Hortenslo, by realbn tA his change, called to Camilla , with an in¬
tent to desire b.er ihat she would get Aurelta to come forth to hini again; but scarce¬
ly had he named her, when as this wench, who had marked on which side the door
of theC.ibinet was, moved herself with such vioknce to get from under the table,
for to eic.;pe away, as she overthrew it, together with the^light that stood upon it,
which in turning down was cxtinguished; The noise which the table made, the
cries of C..vw/7/.i, the voice of Hortensio, and the darkness , so srighted Amelia s for
ssic believed that al! this diforder was caused by the phantasme') as she sell into a
Iwoon: So tsiat akhough Hortensio continued laying many things, yet heard she no¬
thing cs It, no more than Camilla, who was fallen to her prayers. Hortenslo seein^ no
bodyanhvcr him, and having heard some noiso which I made wkh going tolscp
back a little, that I might have the liberty to laugh, he retired away in soch a choler,
and sury, as -avc so great a blow with the pummel! of his sword against the grate

<p>as it were better I should want good manners, then deprive you ofthe pleasure of
hearing it. I wil! tell you then, Madam,since your silence seemes to permits me so
doe, that Valerio hid a setvant, called Vespa, whose inclinations were proportiona
ble to his condition, being of somewhat a dull spirit; he never came a nights into
the chamber where we vvere, but to help to make his Master unready, and then
went presently to lye with la Roche in a room which was soparated from ours one
ly with thin bords and tapestry hangings, so that speaking never so little lowd one"
niight hear from the one place what was said in the other.  When la Roche and Ses.
pa were a bed, this last demanded ofthe other, whether it were true that I knew all
that was done in the world, as he had been lately told&gt;L^ Rache,who meant to make
himselfmerry with him,  assured him that it was sofar true,  as that I persestly
knew what any body did, is I did butjinowthe name of the person. Alas, said Sel
pa then,  I would not be bound to scrve with such a Master! For how should one
spend his life with a man,  to whom one durst never tell a lye ? It is somewhat an
hard case, said my Agent, speaking a little lowd, to theend wc might hear him;
howsoever it must be so. I liad as Iccse dy, said the other, as have my Master know
all the lies that I tell him, when as I  return from some place, where I have stayed
longer than I should: for, as you know, we want not excuses for the stcaling of an
hower to bestow in our pleasures;  Mounsicur was not at hobic; I waited for hima
long time; he stayed me with a purpose to have written to you ; I soughtforhini
in divers places; your clothes were not done; I was to see as I went along whither
your Gittern were strung or no ; and so ,  according to the diversity of occasions,
diversity of pretexts are alwaies found : But as for you, I do not see hovv you can
live j you durst not, I assure my self,  entertain tvvo three of your companions
whilst he is at the Comedy, and pass away an afternoon in making good cheat. I
durst not indeed, answered my Agent, unless it were at such a time, as I know hc
had great affairs in hand, and so had no leisure to think of me.  Neither could you
have the pleasure, said ?^sr/p&lt;?, to recount his secrcts; to say he is in lovc vvith such
a one ; he goes often to such a place ; he writes to such a person; and that which ij
the worst, ishe hath ill intreated you; whether it bc in revyling you ; or in threat¬
ning you with the bastinado; or is occasion serves,  in giving you a whirret on the
car; you durst not complain to your friends of it: Whereas to me, it would bcthe
depriving me of a great consolation, isl could not say to one;  he is raore santasti'
call than aMulc; more extravagant than a Hobgoblin; and togivehim toalldie
devills in hell when he is untoward. For when I have said all this, I return home,
as isl vvere well revenged, and had said so much to him himself. As for me, said
la Roche,  mine is none of the worst, and I am seldom in the case you speak of I
wissi it may bcso, replyed the other , hovv ever you muss needs consess, thathe
vvould very much incommodate me  in one thing; for hovv could one serve hitn
well, or be well clothed, is a man should not make some profit to himself of the
money that passes through his hands; I should bevery forry to steal ought si'om
any body, but in that case I must be excused. It is not to hord it up, that I take any
thing, but to do him credit vvith it ; and then the recompences vvhich Masters
make us is not so great, but that we raay vvith some justice recompence our selves.
For that, said la Roche, you have reason; and there I lose a fair oportunity, vvhich
you enjoy.  You are so unhappy too, continued Vespa, that as I perceive you dare
not think of quitting him, ancl of looking out for a Maslcr secretly, as we common¬
ly do, when wc find not our selves well vvith him vvhom we serve : and to con¬
clude, I should chuse rather to be in the gallyes,  than in the service of this man: I
should not have spoken thus sreely to you, added hc smiling, for fear he should have
known it, isyou had not told me, that hc is to know the hame of them vvhofese-
crets he desire to know; for as for that vvhich I am called by, he will be couscned
in it, because I took it upon me but when I came to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, by reason ofa small ad¬
venture which besell me a ;^«o«»^, of whence I am.  You would have reasonfor
that you say, replyed my Agent, vvho was willing to put him in fear, is he did
not know mine; but is to morrow he should have a desire to know what I have

<p>done,

<p>dcjiie he would also know what you have sayd unto me; for otherwise his soi-
ence'would be very consused. Then am I undone, sayd Vespa, but howsoever, ishe
must kn. -vv all that I have 'sayd unto you, let him know also that I never took much
from my Master^t a time, to the end that he may be contented with making me to
he turned away. We burst out then, Valeria and l^ato such a laughter, as he could
no loneer doubt but that we had heard him widiout inchantment. And where -
iis there wasa back-door that opened out of their room upon the staires , he
rofe in hast, and got him away , so that wc never heard of him after. The
rest cs the night was spent in sleeping, but the next day I had employment
eiioi+gh ; for I was scarcely out of bed , when as I received a Note from
Aurelta, whereby she prayed me that she might speak but one Word with me at the
Garden door, where I hadformerly been, out of which she would come forth, and
seem as though she had met nic by chance. I raade some dissiculty of going to her »
but at length Valeria constrained me thereunto. As soon as I came at her, being stili
pale,and amazed with her last nights adventurc,she said unto me,that having been ad¬
vertised since morning, how Hortenslo was esscstively at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, and had never been
absent from thence, she found that she had great cause to complain of me, for that
</p>
<p>her ; but r
buthaving
any thing &gt;
was an unc
</p>
<p>untohcijt-----J;-------------         ^^   -------------,^; „.„^
</p>
<p>this reason is so forcible, as I cannot destroy it; but since it is true, that nothing
can resist you, do me the favour that Hortenslo, who as I have been told, lyes secretly
at Leanders house, that he raay go a nights to see a mayd whom he loves, may no
longer love her; or is it be pofsible, thathe may dcspile and hatcher. Thispropofi¬
tion began to put me into such choller against Astrology, that little lacked but that
I had left Aurelia without an answer ; howbeit my wit served me yet this once again
dextrously enough : For I assured her she was il! informed of the matter, and that
Hortensio dad not lye concealed for any new love, but that being grown kalous of
her, he had seigned a voyage to Naples, the more cxastly to observe her actions; and
that without doubt sile was beloved of//'i9rs&lt;r«/sS', asmuch as ever she had been. This
poor Gentlewoman was so satished with thatwhich I told her, as she verily belee¬
ved it; and so I left herewith a great deal of joy. As I was returning home I was
mightily surprised, to see how the people began to note me, and point at me; some
saying, that I was a learned man ; others, that I was half a Prophet; theseVame
that I was an Inchanter; those, that I wasa Forcerer. There were some too than
not far from the truth, took me for an impoftor, and scofsed at me ; at leastwise I
interpreted their looks and their actions so. I went then in a rage to'find out Vale¬
rie, whom I met withall some three or four steps from my lodging. I did not re¬
count unto him what had hapned to me, but I quarrelled with him for that he was
the cause ofall the consulson Iwas in. He, that was ready to burst with lauehter.
asked me whether I had not given him order to publissi my kicnce &gt; Yes sayd I un¬
to him, but not to make nic pass for a Magician. You know, sayd he unSo me, still
laughing, tkit Same atignients every thing ; and then what is it you complain of &gt;
all the world is satissicd with your skill, andthat which should more content you.
you are revenged both o your Rivall and of your Mistress, by giving them so much
unquietness as you do He had no sooner sayd so, but Leander appeared, and seemed
to come to us; I would have declined his encounter by entring into my lodging,
but r.r/.r/. told me thathe had promised him mya cquaintancc,and that he was too
near then for me to avoyd it. sodeed he was so near as I could not answer Valerio so
that I was constrained to receive the civilities of Leartder, who after a great and Ions
complement, recounted unto me all his love to Aurelta, who loved HarteTo thas
loved noc her, because hewa. ingaged elswherc ; and therefore he conjSme as
well for his interels, as for that of Aurelta, so to do, that she might no longe^lssest

<p>Hortenslo, but accept of his service. I was so confounded with all these adventure^:
aslscarceknew which way to turnme; howbeit sccmingtoconsiderof all thathe'
had told me, at length I assured him, that is he continued loving and serving he
he should be beloved of her, provided he acquainted her with his passion.  He went
away very well satissicd, and Valeria demanded of me, how I hoped to keep niv
word?I answered him,that at lasi Aurelia would be weary of Hortensloes despising her-
that Leander by continuing to scrve her would touch her heart, and so would think
thatheobtainedthatby the power of my art, which was due to his own industry.
But, sayd I untohim, no\y that we have a little rest. Ictus so into our lodt^in/*
howbeit we were scarcely in the middle ofthe Hall, when turning my headab'out I
perceived Leonardo the father of Ltvia, comming to me with an open countenance
vvhich made me conceive that he had something to demand ofme.  I received him
with a forced civility,which might have made him know,is hehad heeded it,th at the
light of him had put me to a non-p'us. And to give him yet more liberty to perse¬
cute me, Sii/sm, who took great pleasure in all these things, made shew of taking
his leave of me, and went and stayed for me in my chamber.  Then began Leomrdo
to tell nie in a serious manner, which vexed me exceedingly, how he was ash.inied
that his sirss visit was to request a favour from nie, rather than to let nieknow that
he was in love with the reputation which I had gotten in so ssiort a time; but in sine,
that he niight oblige me by his sreedom to use the same to him, he besought me that
I would cast a Sigure to discover who it was that had got an Emerauld Ring which
was lost QUtof his house.  I raust consess, that I found my self then inso strange
a case, as is by wissiing I could have become a Magician indeed, to get out of this
crofs adventure, I verily think that I should have wished it.  What shall I do, sayd I
to my self ? What counsell am I totake? And what can I ansvver tofo predinga
discourse ? It concerns not now the beguiling of an amorous mayd, or an ignorant
Lover; it is an old man that sayes hc knows Astrology, that will discover my igno¬
rance as soon as I shall speak ;  For to tell him a lye about this Ring, it vvsllde-
stroy it self : It vvere better for me to deal sreely vvith him ; he will be obliged to
me for undeceiving him ; and then all things well considered, I had rather spoil all
my desigii.s than put a trick upon a raan of this age. After I had determined to doe
so,  I took  a more serious look upon me for to tell him, how it was true, that
heretofore I had understood some principles of Astrology sfor I could not resolve to
consess my self to be direstly an impoftor ) how upon that ground my friends had
given me the reputation of knowing somewhat ; but that none ofthcra had ever
any experience of it; how it was true also, that I had many times delivered my sels
to be more knowing than I was, in some occasions jwherc seigning was rather a gal¬
lantry than a crime; but as for him, I desired it should appear, that the reputation
which Ihad gained was not sodear unto me, as his friendlhip , seeing I con¬
sessed ingeniously unto him, that I did not know enough either in Astrology, of in
the other sciences depending thereupon, for to be able to tell him that whichhe
desired of me.  This discourse sb clear and true had nor the effect I expested from
it; for very far from being believed, Iheard Leonardo say unto me souling, HadI
not known by the report of others, that you are a learned man, your humility
would sussicc'to perswadenie that you knowniuch. Iswcar unto you,sayd Ilaugh-
ing s for I could not poflibly forbear ) that I know nothing. Even this which you
say, ansvvcred he, is that which consirms me in my belies of you ; and thus niodest
and djkrc t&gt;continucd he, ought they-to be who know much ; for their science
makes ihem to be known well enough, without any intermixture oftheir vanity-
Is I were what you think me to be,sayd I interrupting him, I would acknowledge
it to you; but it is certain that I do not merit the honour youdonie. Ihavealrea-
dy told you, anivvered he, that this humility is the greatest sciencc of asl; it b^"
ing most lure, ihatcvery man vvhich sayes hc knows a tiling well, is ignorant of is)
smec he is arrived at the point to think that he knows it persestly, But at lengdi let
us return to our purpose, and permit nie totell you, that this Emerauld isgraveOj

as though he had lost a letter, ;^hich a brother of his had written him from Nap/esi

ofher what she ayled, she had told him, that the ring , whicl] she had given to Hor¬
tensio was lost to the end he should not marvell ishe sa\v it no longer.This dicourse
niade'rac wonderfull glad; I took the paper from la Roche the better to dissemble the
raatter, .tnd uling a great deal of civility to i eanardo,  I delired him to cxcuse the
libei tv which I had taken. He answered me, that with him J was justisied ,  provi¬
ded I would not resuse him. I conkss that the occasion of gulling him Was so fair^ as
I should have had much adoe too forbear; and Leonardo too had such a mind to be so,
ashewouldhave beendisobliged more in not being gulled , than in being gtslled;
besides, it was in vain for me to tell him the tristh again, which he would not un¬
derstand, do wh.it I could. He began again to press me; I resilled yet a while; but at
last, when I saw that hc would needes have me devine,! spake to him with more cer-
taincy than an Astrologer, and more clearly thin aOr-acle, is he would have under-
iloc d me rightly. After I had made a turn in the room vvithout speaking a wordj
I ni.ide a stop just before him, and said unto him; hitherto I have done what I could
todilkniblc the little knowledge I have,  that I might not do any thing which
■would clispleasc you; but since you will needes know it, I will consess sreely unto
you ,  that i have already cass a sigure for it upon the intrcaty ofa kinswoman of
Liviaes;  so that disguising th^ truth no longer, I ara obliged to tell you, thata
man, whom ytiu saw this morning in a riding suit,  is he which hath the ring you
speak of Who w^uld ever have believed it, said Leonardo, that a raan of his sassiion
and qualitic, had been capable of so strange an action^  But young people that
have covetous fathers, are many times carried to ill habits by neceshty;-howsoever
I miisl knd ou^this ring, and isit be pofsible demand it of him thathath taken it a-
Way Without charging him that he stole it. After this discourse he gave me thanks,
and raade me promise to come to supper tohim. An hower after he was gone,
came an old sellow, who had served Leonardo about thirty yeares,  presented to me
by la Roche, that told mewith a simplicity which made meto laugh, how being re¬¬
solved to return into his Colmtry, and carry With him the little money which hc
had gotten, he besought me that I would cause him and his treasure to be transpor¬
ted thither in ^ moment, for fear of robbing by the way.'I know enough for that 4
said my Agent then, Without my Masters medling in it; and when I hadconsirmed
him in this opiidon, away they went together.  But whilst r^/mo laughed atmv

<p>resembled that ofa thies, as he was somewhat assraid to speak to him. Hortensio an¬
swered thereunto, that hc would think himself happy, isit were to command hini
any thing. How curtcous he is? s thoussit Leonardo yyith himselfas he delivered to
me afterward } and what a pitty it is, that so handsom a man should haveso bad
an inclination? Then taking courage, belaid untohim , that having understood
there was a ring in his hands, vvhich had been lost out of his house, hc desired he
might see it. And wh ereas Hortenslo was surprised vvith this discourse, he seenied
to be sb confounded, as Leonardo no longer doubted but that he was guilty. 0 nie!
cryed Hortenslo, what is this I hear ? I do not say, replyed Leonardo,  that you are
faulty, but the party from whom you had it. How unhappy am I,  said Hortensi
interrupting him ? Asshst not your self, replyed Leonardo, forthe hand which &lt;iavc
ityoUjliath alone committed this fault, andso you are justisied with me,  Whilst
I cofi.ir do did what he could to conceal from siini the bad opinion hehad ofhim
he was perswaded, that this man knew the truth ofthe matter; andto justitie Li-
z-i.i as much as pofsibly he could, he assured him that he alone was culpable; that
healoiK had deceived him ; that he denyed notbut that this ring was in hishandj-
and therefore he acknowledged he had just cause to complain ofhim,  Thisis
ssrangc, said Leonardo to himiels-, that the more I would cxcuse him , the more he
accuses himself ! I say it to you again , continued the other, that I alone am wor¬
thy of puniihment. No Hartenslo,sayd Leonardo, you shall not perswade me to it; sur
I am well informed ofthe truth ofthe business. VVhy then it is b:st forme, answered
Hortenslo, not to make any further denial!, but in restoring you the ring to con¬
sess ingenuously that I was constrained by an inevitable neccssity,  to do you this
wrong. I know well enough, rc'plyed\Leo;iard.-'. what youth is capable of, and what
neccssity will make one doc. Hortensio,  seeing Leonardo speak sb gently unto him,
and believing,so ill did they undcrstand one another , that he knew all which had
past between L«i'/^ and him, believed alio that he was to make his profit ofthis oc¬
casion, and to speak plainly unto him. Since you know, said he to him,how to ex-
cuse my errors,  will you bc pleased to render them legitimate , in giving
me  leave to marry Livia'i  you know my birth, and you raay know my estate
when you please. Marry my daughter J cryed Leonardo, this propofition isso plea¬
sant, as ou.^ conversation shall end there , for I do not think that yon have reason to
continue it any longer, after I have assured you nevertheless that I ssiasl be discreet.
Saying so, the old man went a\my,and left Hortenslo more amazed, than ever he was
in hishfe,forheno way apprehended that Leonardowould accusehim of thcst;andto
perplex him yet further, J?«rs//.j appeared , vvho believing, according as I had told
her, that/forss^j/o had not concealed himself but because he was  jealous, vvould
#« pajsant have laid sbme raanner of gallanterie untohim. But he, vvho was not in a
case to dissemblc,  and that saw well enough hovv his lovc to L/w^ was upon
breaking  forth ,  said  unto her somewhat  rudely ; you drove me zway
at such time as by your direstion I came to wait upon you, think it not strangc
then is after that I never do see you more; and to recompence the lovc vvhich
you have borne me with sbmesrccness, know, that I am ingaged in an affection,
whichca^notendbutwithmy life. This said, he left: her,  for to goinallhastand
try is he could see/.»t/&gt;W , to the end they might advisc together .about what they
were to do in so crofs an adventure. In the mean time, Aurelia so rcolycd upon my
words, as she had much adoe to believe but that Hortensloes despisali was a mark ot
lovc. As shc was returning home inthisirresoludon, she incountred XrW^r, vvli^
had i'een Hortcnso enter into Liviaes house, and Leonardo presently following in al¬
ter him; sb that inforced by his passion, and my counkll, hc discovered unto ha
the truth of the History : He informed her how it was by his meanes she was ad¬
vertised in the morning, that Hortenjio never parted from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> ;  and that to
let her see how Livia wholly pofsessed his heart,he knew for a certain that he was at
that instant widi her; having said to him just as he was going in,and he passing by, i
will no longer oppose your love. This discourse so netlcd Aurelta, a/^"'''*^!'?'/'°

llortciso was gone in to Ltvia, Leomrdo came home ; lb as he had no more leasure
but tu let her Know that her father had demanded the Ring ofhim, vvhich she had
ijivcn him, and that he had used all his endeavour to draw thccrime wholly upon
himsels;for as soon as Lucretia perceived Leo&gt;iardo,she advertised them of it; where¬
upon Hortenslo was constrained to hide himself in a corner of the Garden where
they were, it being impollible for him to i:et forth without being seen. When sup¬
per time approached, I went thither; fori was not lorry to seck foraii occasiou
of seeing in what case Ltvia was in as cr so many odd adventures; as I was going
along I met vvith la Roche, vvho told me that he came from working his inchant¬
ment for the nun who was afraid of robbing by the way ; that after a thousand
devices, he had madehim get a ss ride upon a pale, as it were upon an horse ; and
there having bound up his eyes, and tyed both his hands and his feet, he left him
talking themaddels things inthe world,outofa conceit hehad that he was slying in
the air,and that to keep him from being robbed by the way,hc bad taken his money
from him without his perceiving it.  I rebuked him for his soolery, and having
commanded him to follow me, I entered intoLeonardoes house, just as hc was go¬
ing to accoft his daughter, who seeing me, would have pulled down her Vail over
her face, but he not permitting her so to do,told her, that a man, to whom she was
ingaged for therecovery of a Ring which was sodear unto her, well dcserved to
have the pleasure of beholding her. We were both of us then very much abashed,
for I knew nothing of that which had p.ist betwixt him and Hortenpo ; and she feared
that her father would give her some cruel check or other.  Howbeit I was not sa
taken up, but that I heard, in regard I was advertised of it before, hovv the poor
simpkson vvhom la Roche had tyed up in this garden, sayd, that he had dispatched a
great deal of way already ; and I find, continued he, hearing us talk a far

Jn the mean time we were mightily kirprised to see/s«rs//^, led by Leander come

her by the hand, Wliar, said he unto her, a man hid about my house ! wemustseej;

that I may revenge you, or bt revenged on you, is thatwhich youttllmebe not

Leonardo commanded all the doors to be ssiut, and leading Aurelta, and causing L/:«
vvith all the rest of the company to follow, he began first to fearch in the Gardea
We had not gone four steps, but they perceived this man tycd on the pale, who raade
a great coil as it were to go the safter.  Thelight of him arresting all the troup,
Leonardo asked whether this was his daughters Lover ; ^welialookcd onZ/Wwiss;
L/I7.J began to take a little  heart, hoping they would fearch no further, and su
Hortenslo would not be found.  But going formost, I untyedthepoorsot, andsaid
to Lsso«4ri;io, that this was without doubt the knavery of my scrvaiit,who was will-
ing to raake s"port vvith the simplicity of this man.  Hc was no sooner untyed^ but
following his imagination, Behold, sayd he, how at length I am come into my
Country ; it is sit I should kils the earth where hrst I drew my breath. And when a;
Leonardo dcm:indcd ot him, what it was that he did. AI ass ! Master, sayd he, are you
also come into my Country, withall this goodly company ? La Roc hi approaching
sayd to him softly, you have not done all that I enjoyncd yon, for do not you per¬
ceive that you are stillat <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>  The poor wretch grew then soastonHhed aste
could not ansvver a word.  In the mean time -^«rs///j having told Leonardo, t\[t
this was not he she sbught for, we continued going on. And when Leonardo\\i^
demanded whether there were nothing behind ajasmin hedge vvhich was rightbe-
fore us;Horten/io, vvho saw thathe stiould be discovered, because thcArborwhere
he was hidden was hard by it, resolved to shew himself^ rather than tobe takra
vvith the manner.  He went forth then boldly, and speaking to Leonardo ; Seek no
surthcr,sayd heunto hiin,l am he alone who is hidden here,and that wisl notoppost
the revenge which you will take of me for it.This is not amiss, sayd Leonardo tome,
I seek for my daughters Lover, and I find a Thies.  You think peradventure,sayil
he unto him, to steal another Ring from me, but I will keep you well enough from
it; and in the consideration of your Father, who is a man of honour, I will onely
see ure my self of your person.  Aurelta thought Leonardo was wild, in taking tia-
tenslo for a thies; Leander and Livia beleeved the same thing; Hortensio himselfkncS
not what hc meant by it; and I alone was he that could clear this Enigma.  And»!
Iwas preparing to s"peak, Hortenslofaid to Leonardo, that he had loved his daUEh-
ter two years ; that he had had the Ring from her; that he was no thies; and that
he might know of her whether hc told the truth or no.  Aurelia-would hayci^o-
ken, but choler would not suffer her ; Livia indeed had love enough to have ton-
sirmed thatwhich Hortensio sayd, but she was retained by ssiame, howbeit she iinj
fain to surmount it, when her Father asked ofher, whither that which he hcird
was true? for she answered, how hoping that this mariage would notdilpU'ils
him, it was true that she had given him that Ring for the first obligation thereof.
Leonardo had no sooner received his daughters answer, but taking nie asidene
consulted with me about what he ought to do in this encounter; for he did "^'^''

<p>his love, as he prekntly sumraoned Aurelta to the perforraance of her word, w
consirmed it unto him with generofity enough.  But the best in this generall icjoy-
cinswac that Ltvi.tjxn a gallantcry,came,and srailing sayd unto me,l counsel you a-
nother time to rely more on your racrit than on your kicnce,since though you have
wholly employed it forthe interrupting of my raariagc, yet you see that your Arc
is deceitfull.  And continued ^«rs/;4, in somewhat a sharpcr raanner, you alUired
me that! was beloved of Hortensio, whereas I no sooner encountred him, but I see
him maryed to another, whkh shews that your Astrology is salse. As for me, said
Leander, you perswaded methat Aurelia did not love Hortenslo, in the mean time
the proof she hath rendred of the contrary, testisyes the untruth of your books. And
for my part, sayd the Traveller, hc promised to send me into my country wirli ut
any danger of robbing, and lo I ara still at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>.  All this was spoken to me so
precipitously as I was Vurprikd with it ; nevertheless being fully resolved to con¬
tinue no longer an Astrologer, I made use ofthis occasson; for causing Lucretia to
approach, that she might witness thatwhich I meant to say, I besought Leonardo to
pardon me for that I was going to consess unto him, seeing my gullcrie had had sb
happy an end for him; and that hc would call to raind how it was not long of me,
that he did not believe me to bc no Astrologer.  I recounted unto them my love to
Ltvia; in what manner I knew her secret, and consequently all that I have told you.
And after I had obtained Lncretiaes pardon as well as mine own, I made it appear
that I had satished thera without Astrology : For, sayd I to Leonardo, you asked me
for your Ring, and I have made you to find it ; to Livia, Ihave told you the raoft
concealed particnlais of your adventure ; to Ls&lt;«»^«', I raade you hope for the pof¬
session of Aurelia, vvhich shc proraises to you her self; to Aurelia, I have undeceived
you from Hortenslo,and made you acknowledge the fidelity of Leander; to the travel¬
ler, I promised you that you should not bc robbed by the way, and I have kept my
word with you ; for I am sure you are not in case so to be,  la Roche havsog pro¬
vided for that by taking away your raony, which I coraraand him to restore unco
you presently; sothat you see I have not sailed in my promise to every one: for
touching my self, siiyd I laughing, you perceive I am he alone for whora I have
done nothing; sb that to recorapcnce nic in some sort for so many unprofitable pains,
savant me Valertoes pardon, vvhich especially I demand of Leander, as of the most
ofsended, but withall the raoft obliged to his friends gullery, since without him hc
durst never have thought of the happiness which he pofsesscth.  In conclusion, said
I to them Isill laughing, whereas you know that I am a dangerous enemy, I counsell
you, as persons whom I esteem, to receive me for your friend. They burst out then
into so great a laughter, as they thought they should never have been quiet again
to hear the compkiiient, which Leonardo made me,who assured me that the pleafore
I had given him by my relation, wasso great, as hc should alwaks remember it,
as an iraportant service which Ihad rendred him, and thathe would not for any
thing but that this gullery had been, it was so diverting : Ltviatold me next, that
she was ofher fathers mind, and though she had denyed me her love,yet did she pro-
mikmeherfriendihip; Hortensio added thereunto, that he was so much oblLed
unto me tor drawing him out of prison, as hc could not chuk but swear an invio¬
lable affection to me; and Leander, vvho was engaged to mes or the pofsession of
his Mjstrcs s, gave himkls wholly unto me;  for Aurelta, as she was least satished so

<p>never forget the visit I had given her, but nevertheless vvhensoevershehad any ba¬
it should not be for me; whereupon she would ha.ve goncaway, but! advised Z.''
siardo to send for Cinthto her Uncle, and also for Valeno, to theend they should i/'
part asunder till all things were peaceably concsoded. This was almost as soon exe¬
cuted as i had mentioned it; in the mean time Livia and Aurelta, having talked a
pretty while together alone, called Hortenslo and Leander to them, and suchthins"!
passed between them, as they found themselves all four extremely contented. CimI}'
and s^j/sr/o being come, anda fair conclusion made on all sides, thewhole compa¬
ny supped with Leonardo, though none but I was invited. Howbeit thac I may not
Madam, further extend a relation, which is already but too long, I shasl tell you'
that within a while after I was bidden to their wedding, whither I came with more
lovc than all thesefour together had ; fori had enough for every woman of the as¬
sembly.  But at length,night being come, I left them maryed and contented; I sjy
contented, because I ara not an Historian but forthe first day of theirNuptialj
which orciinarily is full of joy and gladness. Nevertheless that which troubled iiie
afterwards was, how not able to keep thj nutter from being  divulged, the
same people who had pointed at me before as at a Magician, looked upon me then
as on an impoftor, and jeered me in soch sort as I durst not peep out of doors. Eiic
it is also true, that the same adventure was the cause of a greater good unto me;
forby the Count of Lauagnes curiofity I got the honour of his acquaintance and
friendship, which hath likewise produced yours too, Madara, and hath also given
me the nobleft passion that ever I had in my life. I must consess, sayd thePrincels,
that you are incomparable, and chat in regard of what I have heard, there is non:
but will say how you are a dangerous enemy, and a pleasing friend.  Ah, Madam,
sayd the Marquis, do not ruin me with zAmilia ! no, no, sayd this mayd, for I pro¬
mise you not to judge of you but by your self^ who, as I bekeve, will perswadenie
that, which her Excellency speaks of, better than she can , as eloquent as she is. I
would fain know, sayd <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, speaking to theMarquis, whether they from whom
you take your love, may pretend still to your friendstiip.  Yes, answered hc, pro¬
vided they have been favourable tome; for as for the rest, they areso indisserent
unto me, as it would bemorc advantageousfor them, that I should hate them. This
is a pretty discourse indeed, sayd Jushniano,since that by this reason,thc fair ty£milii
ought not to be cruell unto you, to the end she may by receiving your lovc favour¬
ably pretend one day to your friendship, I consess, said the Count, that the Marquis
his opinion teaches me a new tenet, which I did not belecve could be pofsible; I have
always heard it sayd, that friendship is many times a way to love, but that lov;
stould bc the way to friendship, is a thing whichhath but few examples, and no
reason at all. This dispute would be a little too long, sayd the Princess, b;tn forthe
time and the place, and I think it were sitter forus to return unto i^/'^-zco before
the ending ofthe day, which will not permit us to walk; but this agreeable dis¬
course hath given us sb much satissaction, as we have no reason to regret it.  TIk
whole company then arofe;thc Count led <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>;the Marquis&lt;i/£milia;Jushniano and
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> went together; and the Princesses women, together with other of her servants,
followed after without order.  All this fair troop went aboord ofthe Galley whicli
brought them thither, whereofthe Princess never made use, but when she went to this
place.  The rest ofthe evening was wholly imployed in talking of theMarquis his
adventures, each one repeating in particular that which had seemed most pkasant
to them thciein.  Ijabella likewise caused her kinswoman, who had an excellent
voyce, to sing; the Marquis plaid on the Lute, and sung also with the beautisul i/s-
milia; so that concluding this day with Musick, they bid the Princess good nighr,
and retired to their lodgings.

' Count to return unto <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, not daring to stay longer ma
place whither hc had been sent. Hc took his leave then of the
Princess , who desired him toassure the Senate ofher acknow¬
ledgement, and that ere long she would be at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> her self to
rei/der thera thanks in particular for the honor they had done
her; The Marquis also kissed her robe ; she caressed him very

to write unto her. I shall be glad of that, said the Princess, and will enjoyn c/£-

did not return unto Geuoua; yyhich being observed by Jushniano, he conjured him
to abide no longer at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and to go along vvith the Count. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> withstood it

he had never before but onely for two or three cs all that great multitude ofvvo-
men vvhich hehad loved inhis time ; it is likely he vvould have said more unto
her, had net the Count gone away. They departed out ofthe Princesses chamber-j,
accompanied by y«/?«ww; who conducted them to the Port, where they imbra¬

Sgl  be tt I ore supportablc to me  she walked oftner than she was wont to doe;
Ec il dl ssinto her Cabinet, for the entertaining ofher thoughts; and hc.
conpl anccforme,  together with the secret hope she had of seeing you again ,
wrof so povversolly upon her raind , asthey dilsipated a part ofher grief,  and
put her Ibul into a more peaccabk estate.  She took pleasure m recounting to ii^e
vour first adventures;  she shewed me your letter.^, and the verses which you had
made for her; and by the praiks which I gave thera,  I quickly got more eskem,
and love, from her than I had before. She sofsered me also sometimes to sing an ayr
unto her; and whereas she called to mind the passion which you had ever had for
musick, I dare say, how it was raore forthe love of you, than for the love of me,
that she retained one of your Rivalis in her service, ^/£mtlia, perceiving that this
dikourse had made Justtniano change colour, could not forbear laughing at it; and
desiring to draw him out ofthe pain whereinto she had put him;Be patient, said she
unto him, and judjrenot precipitously of a matter, for which you will afterwards
without doubt repent you. I know, answcrcd Jushniano,  that I should be unjust in
dcsirim; to be a judge oilsabella ; but I know withall that fear is inseparable from
love, and that inthis occasi'.in I ought to give you some marks of it.  I will soon
make it ceak, continued cjLmilia, but prepare your self to undcrstand the most san-
talsick adventure, and the strangcst incounter,  that ever you heard ofs: You are to
know then, said she going on, howthat great reputation of beauty which the Prin¬¬
cess had all over/t&lt;«/y,bep;ot a curiofity at one and the same time m the mindes of the
younz^Vxinceoi Salernsy,andDonT emando de lAendoz^a,  who for a long time had
been in the War of Milan under the Marquis of Guasl; and albeit they knew not
one another ; thoup'i the one was of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, and the other of Spain; though the first
was at Naples, aiir', the other at Milan; yet took they both of them the same resolu¬
tion. The Princ&lt;! of Salerno was handsom , of a good mine,  and full of spirit; and
whereas in studying the Mathematicks, he had learned to design, hc had afterwards
applyed hi^iiscls to painting, and was become so excellent in that art, as few Master*
in <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> had done braver things than hc.  This young Prince being resolved to see
whether same did not slatter the Princess , and knowing by the example of others,
th« it would be no boot for him to present himself at jiso^^iro with an equipage
proportionable to his condition, he concluded to go thither disguised ; and that
he might the casilier find out the meanes to approch unto the Princess,he purposed t&lt;#
say that he was a Painter. Don Sernando de Mendei&amp;d, as I have already declared, ha¬
ving a like desire, and a like curiofity, used also the same meanes to content it:
For as the Prince of Salerno Would pass for a Pairtt'cr, so Would Don SersiofiAo, wh^
understood musick persestly,  pass for a Musician. They disguised thtmsolve^ then
after the manncrtheyhad resolved On, andwithotit knowing ought of oweano^
thcr, they came to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> at the time which I have noted; and when as the. hope of
seeing you again, and the Princesses compliance for me, had rendred her mekncho"-
ly more sociable. The first that arrived at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> was Don S^YMndo,  wkb retained
this name onely, leaving that of Mendoz^a, as too illustrious for hirtiA^oiii hc pre¬
tended to bc. And whereas the Princess had ordained a long timt before, that no
strangcr should enter into the Town, without first advertising her ofit, they came
prekntly and told her, that a man, which gave himself out to be a Musidanj desired
to enter. At first she thought not to have seen him, but as forme, Who had ho other
dchgn but to delight her, I besought hi?r to command he might be adhmted to e

<p>ter, tothe end wc might see whether he were skillfull enough to keenn  s
forgetting that which I had alre.vdy learned in Musick; and to oblige her n TrT
nyme, I caused her to remember the passion which she had told me you^d^
had for this excellent art; and it was without doubt that in this sort the sole ^^^'^
lidcration of you introduced Don Sernando into the Castle ,  although the PrinT
had the goodness to tell me, that she should be very glad there could any thine b
met withall, which could keep me from being weary of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>. But in theed
Don Sernando appeared, and albeit both the Princess and my self found somethin'
that was great in his countenance, yet suspested we nothing of the truth, attnbn^
ting that softv ayr to the Nation, whereof he said he was; for he did not conceal
himself from being a Spaniard, in regard, though he spake Italian well enough
he would yet have been known by his pronunciation.  The Princess demanded of
him, of whence he was, whether he was going, what he could doe ; and to all thole
particulars he answered exactly. As for^his science, he desired the Princess that st-
would be the judge of it,  and hear him sing. She would fain have reserred herself
to me, but giving her no leisure to command me unct) it, I sent foraVioflanda
Lute, to theend hemight shew us what he could doc. I well observed, how he he-
held the Princess with a great deal of attention ,  and also how hc blushed two or
three times. But whereas the greatest beauties strike everyone with admiration I
took his blussiing for a mark ofhis respest, and his attention for an ordinary elsest
of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>es beauty. When that was brought which I had sent for, he took a Lute
and truly touched it reasonably well; but when he had plaid on it, and that toim
he had taken a Violl in his hand, he perswaded us yet better by his play, that he was
A Spaniard,than he had done by his pronunciation,lt being raoft certain that it is im¬
pollible to play better:  Hc sung alsb with a very good grace, and with much art;
As for me, I consess unto you that I was ravished vvith rr.  And whereas the Prin¬
cess perceived the satissaction that I received by it,  and was resolved to please me
as much as she could, she demanded of Don Sernando, whether he would abide with
her for some time to be my Master ? He very well contetJted vvith this propofition,
told her, that she did him too ranch honor, and though his purpose was not toraake
any stay at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, yet should he esteem himself insinitely happy,  is hc could bea-
ble to render her any service. Thus see you Don Sernando lodged in the Castle, and
in the rank of the Princesses domesticall servants, but more yet, of that of her le¬
vers. For as we know afterwards, hc became so despcratcly in love with her, ashc
resolved to do all that he might for to gain her to himself, by any way whatsoever.
Certain dayes after, the Prince of Salerno, vvho gave himself the name ofLucilio, ar¬
rived also at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and according to order it was told the Princess, hovv there
was a young Painter, vvho said, be came from Rome, that desired to shew hcrsome
small pieces ofhis own drawing.  She who, as I have already declared, sought to
delight me, commanded him to be brought to her ;  Don Sernando was at that time
in the Princesses chamber, vvhom I had caused to corac thitherto hear a Spanisc
ayr, vvhich had extremely plcdsed me. The Prince of Salerno being come tothe
Castle, entred into the room, where we were , with a profound respest , wd
shewed the Princess two small pieces  of his drawing, admirably wesl done
In the first was seen a Sea represented, whose waves seemed to be very much moved,
and a far of on the ssiore a man, who, mauger the counsell of divers persons, which
secmed by their actions to hinder him from it, leapt into a skiss , and abandoned
himself to the sury ofthe Se;^, shewing them with one hand the point of a Rock,
which stood up in the midst ofthis Sea, as is hc had a desire to go and suffer ship-
wrack there.  The second picture was an/sr&gt;rr«*, ofan extraordinary design; and
though the first piece expounded unto us that of the Prince of Salerito, yetdidsss
not undcrstand any part of that emblem; and the Princess, without comprehending
ought that was mysterious therein, exceedingly commended his work. ^°''&gt;^'l'';

and  Painting ;  and so did sIx^  locl.c  the two  Rivals together,  that  is to
say, twofncniies,  without her knowing of it, and  without  their know-
in- of it c'llo.  For is Son Sernando w.\s become amorous at the hrst light ot
the Princess, the Prince of SJcrnt&gt; was charmed ai ith it.  I very well pciccivecl, as
wcW a?.Von Sernando, how He beheld her with an cxtiaoidinary attention; but I
niarvailed yet less at that than at the c soer, ima-inin- that as he was a shunter, su
bcinc well ken in beauties, he vvould conseree lome Idea of that of the Priiicds_,
to make nic thereof in his Pictures. Von Ser?ia;,do and he complemented very kind¬
ly one with anofsier, and were as great friends u first", as they were soes afterwards.
They thought inthemean while, e^ach of them in particular, ofthe dehgn theyhad
in hand, a^nd dextrously informing themselves of thePriiicelses mind, they learnt
how shelcvcd you still, and that although the greatest part of the Worid bdieved
you to be dead, yet was ihe absblutely resolved never to engage that faith unto ano¬
ther, wiiich she had given you : Whereupon they conceived it would be to no pur¬
pofe su-them to discover themselves as yet to the Princess ; but contrarily, that it
would bcthe means of ruining all their designs, and depriving them of her|fight
for ever.  Wherefore they i-elblvcd to continue with her as long as they could;
carefully to observe her dispofition ; to please her as much as polsibly they could ;
and to work according to occasion. ■  For afterwards we underssood both all their
de/igns, and all their realbnings, which in this encounter were aim oft the very same.
Behold them then in the determination to render themselves agreeable tothcPrin-
es'',and to me also,because thty perceived that I was gracious with her.Von Sernanda
aught me Musick with a great deal ot care, and concealed none of the secrets of
this Art from me ; yet sometimes he was vext for that I learned so sast ; for, said he
to himself, as wc imderstocd afterwards, as loon as she knows as much as I know ,
I shall bc discharged ; and is I doe not teach her as Isijould, they will turn me away.
Howsi ever he made choice of the first, and indeed was one ofthe best Masters in the
World. The Painter on the other side drew out shedcsignsof his Pictures, where
I think hepiitall the disguisements of Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury, and of all theo-
ther Gods ofthe Sistion.  But the best was,that what he did to continue the longer
at ^c«^cs7, had like to have driven him from thence; for fearing left he should be
dilcarded when the painting of this Cabinet came once to bc sinished, he wrought
lo siowly, as cne might say it was Penelopes Web,and how he undid that in the night
whichhe had doneintheday.Nevertheless,wherasthe littk vvhich he did wa* yery

<hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, for the design which he premeditated: And Don Sernando, ^siho\ne^T^i
enough that the S paniards do not disapprove ofthose who augment their do
by any way whatsoever, sent a Gendeman, whom he had drawn disguised i"*"?
town, to s tch him mony, and some troops of the Mtlanese, by the perniiSi s
the Marquis of Guasl, to whom he wrote about it, for the executing of that whit
he thought on.  During thcsc preparations, the Painter and the Musician contimt
ed their endeavours still about the Princess ; the one always madcmystedou
Pictures, and the other always sung Songs, wherein he spake of sovc without be'
ing understood, so that they came to bc somev/hat suspitious one of another- and'
that which began to make them so, was, for that P^w s^r^^W^ not seeing the'Prin-
cess cnoligh to content the extreme passion wherein he was for her, had intreated the
Painter in private to draw her picture for him , and kt no body know of it.  The
manner of Don Sernandoes raaking this  propofition begot some sofpition in the
Prince of Salerno; and the manner also of his excusing himself from embracingit
made Doal'ernando observe him with the more care;so that passing over again in tiieir
memory how they had lived together before, they found wherewith to augment
their s iispitions, but not wherewith to doubt of that vvhich they thought. Afterthis
they never lived wel together;thcy traduced one anothers profession;the Painter said
that he had heard better singing at Rome ; and the other assirmed that all the designs
ofthe Prince of Salernoes Pictures were slolnfrom antient Painters.One dayasthey
were inthe Princesses chamber, they entred into a dispute before her, andby diat
liberty forgot the personage which they represented ; yet was not she ofsended atit,
but contrarily took pleasure inhearing them.  ThePainter would have his Artcar-
ry it from Musick; he sayd thatit was the imitator of Nature; he vaunted thathe
could beguile the eyes, and deceive reason by theillusionsof perspestive; hesayi
moreover, that it was Painting which made men live after their death; that it was
she which erested Trophcis for the victorious; that by her we see battels which w
had not seen; that by her we know Alexander and all the Heroes of Antiquity ;thit
by her we make voyages without stirring out of our Cabinets; that by her V7ese:
our friends though they be absent; that she was a visiblc Hisfory,  a mute Poesie;
and to say all, that ssi^was so excellent, as a good Painter miglit almost boast him¬
self to be the creator ofthe things which hc represents.  The Musician, who would
not give place to the Painter, maintained, that there was thesame disserence be¬
tween Painting and Musick, as betw een the body and the soul ; that this first was
wholly materiall andgrofs incomparilbn of the other, which wasakogetherspi-
rituall; that  is Painting erested Trophcis tothe victorious, Musick sung dieir
victoryes; that the one touched nought but the eys, whereas the other, asl celclli-
all and divine, wrought upon the very soul vvith somuch power, as sheexdted
or appeased the passions as she pleased ; and by this sweet tyranny rendred her scls
absolute mistris of all reasonable persons. Hcsayd farther, that to judge rightly of
the advantage which shehad over Painting, we were but to consider, tliat the best
illusions she can make, do alwaies work a greater effect upon the rude vulgarthan
on Worthy people; that indeed she raight ssrike these vvith admiration, but ncvct
utterly deceive them, so that she operates raore powerfully upon the ignorant than
on the able.  He added, that it was notso vvith Musick, which did not predomi¬
nate ablblutely but over reasonable person : that to have wit is not enough forusto
become her subicsts, and bc charmed by her; but we raust also have, not only sou"!
knowledge of this Art, but likewise a great and noble soul; sothat quite contra¬
ry to Painting, the more able  we are, the more we suffer our selves to be vanquilh'
ed by her charms: That the other was but a deceiver, vvhich pays us vvith nothing
but apparcnces, and sb impotent, that she can do nothing of her self, or to say bet¬
ter, that she is nothing without the help of cloth, pencils, and colours; Thatthe
beauties of Mulick were effective beauties, and to shew her independency we arept
toconsider, that she is no^ other than apureessec's of the imagination, guided by

<p>judgement; sothat having no need of forraign things, it ^^nothard to judge, what
advantage she hath over Painting.  It is certain, diat the dispute of these two
men secmed too trankendent to me for persons oftheir profeision, and I began to
look on the Princess in a raanner, whkh testisyed unto her how ranch I was amazed
thereat, when as DonSernando, perceiving it, took prekntly upon him the humor,
vvhich is ordinarily attributed toMusicians; and witha caprichiousoess,whercin no
seigning appcarcd,he gave an hundred geeringquipps tothe Princeot;^/^r«^, who
played his part as well as the other; sothat returning out ofthe amazement which I
had been in, I reslefted no further upon it, but heard the rest oftheir dispute with
great delight; for they raade sb pleasant a Satyre against each others profession, as
the Princess herkls, spight of her melancoholy, could not forbear laughing.
Howbeit she would have them become friends before they departed; and having de¬
manded of them why they bore such a splecn one to an other ,  for she had been ad-
vertiicd of it, they were much troubled how to answer her.  DonSernando, being
ever the bolder, spake first in this incounter, and told her, that on his pare she was
the true cause ofit. ThePainter, exceedingly surprised with this discourse, knew
not what to think thereof; when as Don Sernando profecuting it ,  gave them to un¬
derstand, how that which made him so avcrse unto him ,  was the thought he had,
that when he should be ^oni from Manaco, the Princess could not chuse but remem¬
ber him, because she should alwaies see his Pictures,  whereas is it were his ill for¬
tune to depart from thence, she would presently forget him, nothing remaining of
him that might make him be remerabred of her.  Is this jcalousie did not ssicw as
much malice as affection, replyed the Painter, I should fear the Princess might take
it well at your hands, but as I believe her to be very equitable, so I think she will
find the coldness which is betwixt us better grounded, when as I shall tell her, thac
our dislension proceeds from our not knowing one anodier. Or it may be, said Don
Sernando interrupting him, from our knowing one another too weil. Never a whit
replyed the Painter, for you are as unskilfull in painting, as I am in musick, and so
wc are but bad judges of each other; and it is the Princess alone, which will one day
put a disserence between us, when as she shall know me b.ttei: and that the designes
which I am about shall bc wholly sinished.  The Princess, who thought he spake of
thcddignes ofhis Pictures, told him, that sheknew him enough already to admire
all that he did. And whereas Don Sernando would have replyed,  she forbad him,
and commanded them both to live better together afterwards, than they had done.
They answered, that they would obey her as much as they could, and so retyrccl
with a great deal of unquietness. The Prince of Salerno found Don Sernando too har¬
dy for a MuUcian, and found also, that ail his songs were too passionate,  too amo¬
rous, and suiting too much with the Princess, for to bc sung without design. In sine
bethought, that ashc was capable of disguising himself like a Painter , sb might a-
nodierbe of disguising himself like a Muikian. Nevertheless this likely sofpidon
continued not long with him; and considering how much men ofthis profession arc
caressed by great persons, he no longer racrvaiied at his boldness;  hefound like¬
wiie that his observations upon his songs vvere ridiculous ; for, said he, as we un¬
derstood since, upon what subject would Ihave them raade,  that they should nor

a man of quality could understand this Art so persestly. These divers thoughts
never for all that so well setled in their minds, but that they past often from th^
one to the other, and so were alwaies ready to* quarrell one with another. Som -
times the interest of their Nations was the sKcasion of their disputcs; andisth*
Princess authority, joyned to the fear which theyhad of venturing themselves un^
seasonably, and dcstroying their designes, had not kept them from it, they hacl
without doubt sought more than once.  In the mean time the Princess and I Hved
without suspesting any thing ofthe truth; Howbeit I remember, that onedayi:
came into my thought, that there was something extraordinary in Don SerMiwdo-k\:
teaching me an ayr which I found to be cxtreme.'ly passionate, and of his own m-
king, I demanded of him laughing,  whether it were [pofsible for him to speak
sb oflove, without being ;in love. He answcrcd me thereunto, that  he could
not , for thatit was impofsible for him to sp^ak against his heart.  But, said
I unto him, may not I bc your consident, and may not I know the person
for  whom you make such excellent things ?  You would no sooner be niy con¬
sident, ansvvcred he, but you would be mine enemy , vshcrcfore I will not tell you
anything, nor shall you know it but when I can no longer conceal it. I consessmj
simplicity unto you, sbr my first apprehension being over, I believed that I had some
ssiare in this discourse;  and fearing I should bc obliged to intreat  the Prin¬
cess to turn Don Sernando away , is became to lose the  respest which he owed
me, I pressed.him no further, contenting my self with being his scholer , and
not his consident.And I was so assraid to part with him , as I never spakeof
this matter to the Princess, who past a good part css her time in seeing the Prince
of Salerno paint.
In the mean spacC these two disguised Lovers finding no reason for them to disco¬
ver themselves, were even in dispair with it. They saw the Princess every day more
sirm in the resolution she had taken; for whereas they were dextrous and interessedy
they had so gained some ofthe Princesses Ofsker.'j,  as by them they knew allthat
did pass, and all that had past. I have told you already, that the Princess imployed
a good part ofthe day in seeing him paint, this entertainment agreeing better with
her melancholy, than Musick; It was then impolsible, but that, being good as ske is,
the Prince of Salerno should often have occasion to talk with her;  and in those in¬
counters , she had found so ranch spirit and civility in hini, as one day she preikd
him to let her know where he had led his life.  And whereas hc had taken a resolii'
tion, which you shall undcrstand by and by, he answered her, that he had neverhid
any other Master but the Prince of Salerno, who was one of the most considerable,
both for his birth and riches, that was in allthe Kingdom of iV4^/&lt;ri; that it had
been in his late fathers house where he had learn'd to know the sassiions ofthe world
better, than ordinarily Painters do ; and that not long before, through a miscbastcr,
which he could not avoid, he was come away from the Prince of Salernoes service;
But, Madam, continued hc, though I bc from him, I cannot chuse but say, thathiJ
inclinations are great; that hc loveS glory and vertue, for touching his wit, id'
not for me to judge ofit.  I mervail ,  said  the Princess unto him, is hc be such as
you say, that you would leave him ; for being great in birth, mighty in riches, and
so vertuous as you paint him forth to be, he must also without doubt be liberall, s^^
that I do not see any reason for your abandoning  him. That is it,  Madjm)
inswered he, wherein I can not satishe you; howsoever I can assure you ,  that uc^t
to you, there is no body in the world whom I would serve vvith raore affection. k
Was in this sort that the Prince of Salerno began to give good iraprcshons of himseli
to the Princess,that he might prepare her the better to his desire; and divers tim«'
the Princess and he had such like conversation*. At length that Master ofhis horse,
whom he had sent to Naples, returned unto the Town disguised as he used tobe,
and acquainted him, that hc had left at Villa-sranco, which as you knowisiicir

"is his design , and knowing him as I do hc will rather increase the number of
vour krvants,than rob you any. Ashcsaid thus, his peopk arrived, who, with¬
out raaking ssiow of knowing him, salutcd the Princess v^ith agreat deal of re¬
spest and the Prince of Salertioes old Governor delivered her a letter written to hor
from'hisMastenshe read it with blussiing, and though I perceived a great deal ot
unquietnels in the Painters face , yet was I perswaded that only the intcidt which
he secmed to have in the Prince of .S^/^rw, or the fear he was in left he should be
forced to quit the Princesses krvice, was the cause of it. After the reading of this
letter I knew by her discourse that it was a propofirion of mariage, and a declara¬
tion of love. She said to the Princes Messenger, that his Master did her an honor
which she was unworthy of And whereas this Governor would have inlarged him¬
self upon the prayscs ofhis Masser, I know his vertue and his merit, replyed she,
and here you see one by me, said the Princess, shewing him the Prince of Salerno,
who hath drawn me his picture, and I doubt not but it is very like him^sincel
can assure you that he is one of the best Painters ofthe world. This gallanterie gave
great hope to the Prince of Salerno, and silled the mind of Dan Seruimdtt\nth diC-
pair. In the mean time the Princess told the Princes Messenger, thathe should have
her answer the next day, and then commanded her Officers to have a care of him ,
and CO conduct him to the lodgings where stranger&amp; were entertained. They were
no sooner gone, but the Prince of ;;«/ssr»o making use of the liberty which the
Princesses goodness gave to all her krvants when she was in private. I rightly fore¬
saw, Madara,  said hc unto her, that the Prince of Salerno would not make me
change my Mistress.  For my part, said Don Sernando interrupting him, and ad-
dreshng his speech to the Princess, with an intention to use a trick for the dcstroy¬
ing of the Prince of Salernoes designes swhom he did not imagine was so near
him ) I think I should betray my duty, and be Wisnting to the fidelity which I owe
you, is seeing your happiness, or unhappiness concerned, I ssioold not tell you, that
■ this Prince of ;4/s?r»sj is nothing less than what you are toW'he is. Do you knov*
him, demanded the Painter ofhim with a great cieal of coldness ? I have seen him
an hundred times, replyed he, during three months space that I was at Naples^hc
\ would have had me live with him, after I had taught him some Spanissi Aires, but
, having been acquainted with the samasticallness ofhis humor,  I would not serve
' him. Besides, Madam, this Prince is neither rich, nor powerfull in his Country ,
in such raanner as one would raake you believe ; and I wonder how he should be
so hardy, as to extend his ambkion so for as to you. Permit me. Madam, said the
Painter interrupting him, to ckar my self of the doubt wherein I am, and to ask
ofthis enemy to the Prince of Salerno, whether he be young ■, or old , and in what
place they grew acquainted together &gt; for as he talkes, I dare say he knows him
him not. He is young, answcrcd Don Sernando, and that you may not think but thac

vvhich I have will not end so soon, replyed the Painter, for is I had undert k "^"
I could let her excellency see , that he is not so unhandsom as you would  s*
him tobe. The Princess, vvho had no interest in this  dispute,  nor appreh  H^
that vvhich the Painter said, as he meant it, interrupted him, for to demand  h

Never doubt ofit. Madam, said he unto her. Isyou draw that of the Prince of'?'
ler no, said Dan Sernando, lam sure it will not reserable you, for indeed he is

to draw me out ofthe doubt wherein I am, tell me, vvho hath informed vouch"'
the Prince of;4/sr«o isso santasticall ? All his servants, replyed the other  wh'
complained exceedingly of it. I wonder at that, said the Painter; but who hath
told you too, chat he was not rich ? All the people cs Naples, answered the other
vvho are well acquainted vvith the diforders ofhis House;  and then again I per-'
ceivcd it well enough my scls, forbe gave me nothing for the paines I took ii
teaching him to sing. It is not his custora to be so sparing, answered the Painter •
But tell me yet, who served him at that time ? This old Governor which you saw
but novv, was bc with him ? What were his recreations ? what was his delight? what
was his imploynient? IthinkI didnotfeethat man about him, answered Ds)«/sr.
w.i«^s?, and for his Master, I found himso little worthy of esteem, that I did not ob¬
serve him; howsoever I am very sure thathe is not considerable at all, either in the
Court of Spam, or vvith the ^»srs-.Scy. I see nolikelyhoood, replyed the Painter'
for one to believe that the Emperor and the Vice-Roy haye entertained you with
these matters, whilst you were playing on the Violl.  There is yet less, skid the Mu¬
sician, that they should tell you the contrary of that which I assirm, whilst you were
besmearing of walls. Ah ! Madara, said the Painter interrupting him, permit me
to punissi the lying and malice ofthis impoftor, who dares traduce a man so inso-
Icntly, whom certainly he does not know, and a Prince too , who cannot be abso¬
lutely without merit , since he is capable of the design to scrve you; He hath been
my Master, and is now your servant, pardon me then is for your sake I lose the r^
spest which is due unto you. Do not you fear , said the  Princess unto him that
Ds7«s/r«4Wss&lt;sr speeches shall ever hurt the Prince of Salerno; neither doubt you,
that this noble ardor which you ssiow in maintaining his party shall displease
Hie, but contrarily I shall esteem of you the more for it; and I forbid Don Sermh
from ever speaking of that Prince but with respest; but withall I charge you not to
renicrabcr what he hath said, and coraraand both of you once raore to livelovinely
together. ThePainterwholly silled with hope, rendred thanks to the Princess; and
the Musician not able to doc  otherwise, got him away assoon as the Princess
was entred into her Cabinet, vvith a purpose to ansvver the letter vvhich she had
received from the Prince of ;4/sr»s? ; Who being withdrawn in private, and rc-
slcsting on Don Sernandoes boldnes&lt;; in maintaining ofa lie, and on all that had past
betwixt them, hc no longer doubted but that he was a man of quality, whom, the
fame reason which had made him a Painter, had made a Musician.  Coming then
to look on Don Sernando, as on his Rivall, hc had an hundred times a mind todis-
cover himself unto him, that hc might oblige him to fight vvith him ; but this first
sense of revenge andjealousie being over, he knew it vvould mine his deiign; For
Hcconsidcred, that is the Princess ansvver to him was favourable, he should have
time enough to be revenged; and isit vvere not,that then hc should discover himself

restin-in her power, but the esteem of him and hissoiendlhip , ssi. alliircd hini
both of the one and the other, and of an acknowk^dgemeiit that should last as song
as her life. Thisobliging resofall asswaged not the Prince of Salernoes grief.  Who
himself heard his own sentencc pronounced; nevertheless he had reason enough
lek to uk his uttcrmost indeavour to conceal it, for kar he ssioiild be suspested ot
the Princess. As for Don Sernando, the joy which he testified for this adventure was
so great, as the Painter was the raore consirmed in the opinion which he jid. After
th? Prince of Salernoes Messenger was gone,&amp; thatuhe Princess had given him a di¬
amond of great value, and that she had commanded him to bc conducted io the
Barque,vvhich wasto carry him back to his Vessell, thePainter craved leave of
her that he might accompany him widi the rest, for he durst not speak to him, said
he, unless it pleased her to permit him. You are discreet, said the Princess, and this
respest merits more dian this which you demand ofme. The Painter having ob¬
tained thispermidion, went and overtook his Governor, to salute bra ; this raan ,
who was inlsrusted as he ought, used him like a Painter, and dexterously giving
him the commodity to talk with him,this Prince willed him to return unto Villa-
Sranco, under pretext of racnding something about his vessell, and t©send the
Master ofhis Horse the next raarning disguised unto him , with as much money as
as he could bring. Now you arc to ^ understand ,  that the day before he hapned
to meet and know an old Souldier, which foractime had born armes under his Sa¬
ther, and whose life he had saved, being at that time Sergeant of one ofthe Com¬
panies of the Garrison. The Prince of Salerno comeing to know him , found the
meanes to speak with him in private, and after he had given him three hundred
pistolets,hc made himself known unto him This man ravished to see the Son ofhis
old Master, but raore yet with his liberality , testified after his manner,both his
acknowledgement, and his joy. In the mean time thePrince of Salern0,whohid
not raade himself known unto him only to inrich him,told him how hc was to serve
him in a busincs that concern'd all his happines. This man told him,that he was his
subject, and his obligee, so that consequently he raight expest any thing from him.
Then the Prince asked him, whether he lived alone in his house, and having learnt
that he did, he asked of him further, whether he could not suboi n a Sisher-man
with mony; thisSouldier having answcrcd him, that the poverty of those kind
of peopk did not permit him to doubt but that he should find out an hundred in
stead of one, hc gave him wherewithall to gain him, without discovcring any pare
of his design untohim, assuring him only that this Sisher-man should be expofed
to no perill, nor have ought els to do, than to carry his nets: Thatwhich made
the Prmeeot Salerno do dius, was, for that he had observed how just at ten of the
clock m the forenoon the ordinary Guard still used to rise, and thereby had con¬
ceived, that they whichsawaSisher-raan go forth laden with his nets about nine,
would not be there at sive in the evening, andso consequently hc might come in
again accompanied with two men attired like Sishermen, and laden with nets as
he was, without any nodce taken of thera. After he had reasoned thus with him-
icst, he resolved to execute that which he had premeditated song before, judgina
ngudy by the,answer which die Princess had given his Messenger,^hat nothing

<p>but violence could put him in pofsession ofher.  This design being absolut I
concluded, he sought for the means to execute it. This Sergeant brought him
b isher-man into a place apart, whom he instrusted with that which he would ha *
hini to do ; and thenextday this man went out ofthe Town about eight of t^
clock in the morning lacslcn with nets, and sas I have already said) before the Gua d
wasriitn; but when it was towards evening, hegave over sissiing, and went t
meet with two Souldiers disguised like Sishermen, who came by Land from th
Prince ot Salerno's Vessell, which was at VtUa-Sranco, and waited for hini at a cer¬
tain Reiidezvouz which had been appointed him : Having ssiarcd his nets amonesi
them, he re-cntred into the Town, and incountring none of those souldiers at
the Gate which had seen him in the morning, nonotice was taken of them, andso
they went along with him home ; where they stayed till it was night, and then
these two men having left their nets there, were conducted by him to the Sergeants
house, in which they abode concealed untill the Prince of Salerno had need of
iheiii. By this device there entred everyday two souldiers into the Town, who
carryed two Pistolls and two ssiort swords hidden in the nets, wherewith they were
laden.  But whereas there wasto be thirty days before the threescore souldiers
which he had destined forhis entcrpri2e,could enter, he was in an extreme impa¬
tience; howbeit he concealed it so well, as we could never perceive it. Inthe
mean time he had gotten him a ladder of cords, wherewith he purposed to bring
a dozen souldiers into the Castle thorough the windows ofhis chamber, vvhich o.
pened upon a place where no body usually passed, and where no body could trou-
ble his design ; for upon thediforder which had been between him and the Muli-
cian, theyhad been lodged assundcr. For the rest ofhis Souldiers, hehad resol¬
ved to send thera under the conduct of the Master of his house, and that Sergeant,
to the gate of the Town, for to render themselves Masters of it, whilst he sliould
carry the Princess away by force, for which effect his X'essell was to be at the
Port.  But whilst he attended for the entrance of all his souldiers, and that dm
Sernando also attended the return of him from whora he hoped for succour in hi?
enterprize, they lived better together than ever they had done, and in ssicw they
loved one another cxtreracly, though indeed they hated and observed one an¬
other as two encraies. Asfor Don Sernando,he had sduring the design which lie
kept close} fallen into a strist league of friendship witdi one ofthe principall Inha¬
bitants of Asonaca, whora the Princess had made Captain of the Gate.  His M
admittance into this mans house, was to teach his only daughter^o sing, after*
wards his conversation grew so pleasing unto him, as he srequented thither very
often, and so they came to love one another exceedingly. Don Sernando, in&amp;i
thought which hewasin, turned his eyes upon this Captain,  and having heard
him say divers times, that the people began to murmur against the Princeis, for
that it seemed she had resolved all her life-time to make a desert of is/o»«&lt;r»j and
Utterly to ruine the trade thereof, by the dissiculty which there was of entringinto
it, he resolved to conside in him, as he hid,  after he had blinded him first with i
great suni cs money, vvhich hegave him. Andthat which made him not doubt but
that the Gentleman, whom he had sent, would bring him Troopes, was, because
he knew the Armies of Spain were very powerfull in Italj,  and that is he couU
tiicc render himself Masser of this place, she should not only be justisied, but quia-
ly succoured; the Counccll of .&lt;i;&gt;4/«never wanting pretexts to invade the territo¬
ries oftheir Neighbors, when as they find occasion for it. During this expestation,
the Princess had'had her unqu etness, as well as her Lovers; for thatLicutenantot
her Guard, whom she had sent to seck you , scemed too long to her in returning:
and whereas she had made it a secret, I was she alone to whom she complayned oii^&gt;
Nevertheless one ofher women chancing upon a day to overhear somewhat conru-
sedly wh.'t she said unto me, believed that you were suddenly to return,  and ne^

continued even unto the end. For when hc had learned thek Aires, after they had
been repeated unto hini above twenty times, yet did he not sing thera very vvell .
NcverthelelsthePrincess would hear no other thing,  howsoever I intreated hei
to the contrary; so that Don I ernando was thereby rec uced to that point, as he could
not see the Princess unless he would sing his Rivalls songs: Which he did vyithso
much constraint, as he raade me to laugh at him ; For still I was perswaded that he
did k out of caprichiousness and pride, though indeed it was out of jcalouhc.
As for the Prince of ;^/mw, another adventure besell him.  When as there lacked
but two dayes of the time wherdn all his Souldiers were toconie in, the Princess
remembrcd how she had heard him say, that he could draw the picture of one that
was abknt, that should be like him,and thereupon believed that by the instrustions
which she could give him he raight peradventure draw a picture that would re-
kmbk you, though hehad neverleen you. She propoundes the matter unto him,
assures him that hc shall insinitely oblige her is he can do it;  and though she told
him not precisely who she person wassoat she desired the picture of, yet he knev7
that undoubtedly it was yours which she would have. At first hc said ,  that hc be¬
leeved hc could not do it;but after he had thought on it a little, I will endeavour.
Madam, said he unto her laughing ,  to content you, provided you will have the
goodness not to intreat me as an ordinary Painter, and that you will acknowledge
unto me, after you have seen it, that it is the pist are ofthe man, who of all the
world honors you with most respest, and loves you with mott passion. You know
too much fora Painter, said the Princess unto him blussiing, howsoever I will
pardon you this boldness, and will acknowledge that unto you vvhich you say,
provided you presently go in hand vvith your work. The Painter having for an¬
swer made a love obeisance, went to setch a cloth and colours for him to work
in her chamber.  When he was arrived there the Princess vvould have had a great
glass taken away, which hung right opposite to the place where he had seated
himself,for fear the Sun vvhich gave full upon it, should mar it; But he prayed her
that it might not be removed, because as he l^aid,  it served to ease his fight.  The
Princess then began to describe you as you are, and particidarising unto him all
the seatures of your face as vvell as pofsibly she could, she thought she had instrust¬
ed him sussiciently. Whereupon hc began to design this picture, and pausing at eve¬
ry draught that hc made, as it vvere to recolkst his memory, at length he traced
out all the rest. And after the Princess had caukd him to alter something,  she pro -
sest that it was very near to the fame which she desired ;  but for fear hc had for¬
gotten what she had already told him,  she reprekntcd unto him again the colour
of your hair, of your eyes, and of your complexion. Then he took his palet, and
his pencills, and tricked the picture, vvhich certainly resembled you a little,  but
less tl an when it was only traced out with the cole. The Princess mervcllcd here-
at; and knew not whereunto she raight attribute the cauk ofit;  for considering
every seature in particular, she saw that little lacked but they vvere just as shehad
ttguivd them, and yet for all that the whok put together soarce resembled you at
all. Bui the Painter nothing abaihed at it, told her that it was but a trickine  and

that pass, as it vvould be impolsible for her not to know in this picture them l
faithfull of her Lovers. The day following the Painter came again, into thcPrl
cesscs chamber by her order, and seated himself in the same place where he sate be'
fore.The Princess instrusted him again, and he raaking ssiow of hearkning very at¬
tentively unto her,beheld himself in that glass which hung before him;but the more

ons. And when she testisyed to the Painter the imouietness she was in for it, he told
licr, that tojudge vvell of a picture ,  one was net to look uponit whilss itwasa
doing, andto discern the faults the better of that which he was about, she w.isto
let him work an hower upon it without look'ng on him. The Princess believed
him, and taking me away with her to the other end of the chamber, we left him
alone; but we were much amazed, when he liad advertised us that his work was
done,  and that hehad brought it into the light for us to judge the better ofit,
tofee that it was his own pistnre v.hich he had drawen, and not yours.  Tk-
Princess then perceived plainly, that this was not a matter of chance, and in an in¬
stant calling to mind somany things, as she had seen withoutthmking of theni,
she made no doubt but that there was somewiiat, vvhich was mysterious enough in
this adventure; Yet had she sussicient conssancy of mind not to shew all hei araa2e-
ment, and to take from the Painter the meanes of discoveringhimselffurther; I
well foresaw, said she unto him with a s.-eming simplicity,  that this glass woHJd
make you spoyl your work; And I am very forry, continued she,  going towards
her Cabinet, that you have lost your time, and I too. Is this pisturc,saidthc Prince
of Salerno, in following hertvvo or three step',does not reserable the most passionate
of your Loversjl with all my heart renounce the profession which IraakcTakeheed,
answerd the Princess,that my anger becomes not as strong, as your presumption is
great. Madam, said he unto her, retayning her by the Gown,l am not so faulty asl
seem to be,and to justisie my self in some sort to you, I muii tell you, that I have no
other design in drawing this picture, than to let you sec that the Prince of Salerm'n
not sb ugly as Don Sernanda hath described hini unto you; For by a strange chance,!
reserable him so near,as I might well be taken for him: And that I may not conceal
all the truth from you, continued he, I will consess ro you, that it is by hisconsent
that I ara here at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>,that it is to speak to you ofhis asscstion,that thus I call my
sclsat yoursect,most humbly intrcating you to believe,that no man ever adored you
with more respecT-.Answer then,Mad.im,I beseech you,but not with sury,to theend
that that faithfullLover may shew himself to you.  Under what form soever die
Prince of Salerno raay present himself,he ssial alwaies receive the same entertainment
from me;my rcsolutions do not easily change,and should he lay all the Crownes of
the world at my sect,yet should I resuse him as now I do;But as for you,said she unto
him, I shall know how to use you as you ought tobe, and lam very much deceived
is you talk to me long of loves.  After this the Priiicels retyred without attending
his ansvver. For my part, I profcss unto you that I was so astonished at this adven¬
ture, asl could not speak. Howsoever I followed the Princess into her Cabinet,
.'ip.d ix:spcst obliged the Prince of SaUr-o togo out of her charaber, conceiving
rightly by the manner wherewith he was anivvered,  that his perswalions would
obtain nothing. Thatwhich raadc him carry himself thus,  ancl to uk this dangC'
rous gallantery, was, that being upon the point of executing his design, he wouW
have been glad to have found an occalion to see ,  whether he could not by san'
meanes have prevailed with the Princess, without having recoursc unto violence;

diefirst than the other: And after we had exarained thematter ,  it wasiesolved
that this  Painter should the next day bc turned out of ^ci«^c.,without letting him
know that he was sofpested to be a Prince , and also without any other ill usage ,
than banissiinghim. With this intention the Princess went to bed, and would have
me lye with her that night, it being irapclTible for her, as st^^^^^^^J'^o have any hope
oftleepinc, as long as you should have a Rivall in ;i/o«&lt;tc^. Whilst the Princess and
I were ag'itating in thissort, the Prince of Salerno, who had found that all his hope
conliised wholly inforce, resolved to deser his design no longer, and to execute it
the night ensuing;he went then to seek out that Sergeant with whom he held in¬
telligence, and to speak with the Master ofhis horse,  to the end his vessell might
not sail to be at the Port just at the bower which hehad appointed, andthathe
should deal in such sort, as all raightbe ready against need should be. He gave them
the time and the signall ofthe enterprise,  and thinking that hc had well dispofed
of every thing, he retyred into the Castle as he used to do, taking but two pistolls
and a sword along with him, which he caryed secretly into his chamber, in case
any violence should be ofsered him before his design could be executed.  Is the
Prince of Salerno was busied, no less was Den Sernando; For hc had understood some
dayes before, by the return of him whom he had sent into the Mtlanese, that accor¬
ding to his? and the Marquis of Guasls direstions , he had brought him store of
mony and Jewells, together with sive hundred men, which were come thither not
in a body, but two and two in a co.upany, and so were lodged in all the Villages
about ^s?K/ss«», with express order to render thcnilelves all upon a certain night&gt;
whereof they should bc advertised , within a mile of thcTowu; Sothat PslslS^r-
wWoftaydfor nothingbut the return of the Captain of the Gate,  who was gone
to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, and whose faith he had corrupted. This m.an , for our ill fortune, or to
say better for our good fortune, came back as hc desired, so that the next morning,
which was the very same day wherein this Painter sinished the picture that re¬
sembled you so ill, he went and found him out,  and having given him to the va-
Icw often thousand crownes in jcwells, hc consirmed him by this liberality in the
design he had undertaken. But not to prolong my dikourse, it sufficeth that I tell
you, how after he had discovered himself to this man to be that-hc was a good
whik before; after he had perswaded him,that the retiredness wherein the Princess
lived, would in the end undo <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; because, said he, it was impofsiblc, havine
no Prniceto deknd it,  but that some one or other would seize upon it; after he
had told him, that this place was too important, for to be left undesended under
the Government of a mayd ; and that soeing it was to pass into the hands of
.trangers, he was todchre that it raight sall into the power ofa man, who would

</p>
<p>be obliged to him for it, and that was able to make his fortune.  After  Ilk
things, I say, this man charmed with the present benesit, with the hope of T^
was to come, and believing too that it would be somewhat advantaaious for ?
Princess, he promised Don Sernando, who communicated his whole design'^
him, to deliver him the Gate whensoever he pleased.Hereupon hcknt that Ge"T°
man, which belonged unto him, to carry his direstions to all the severall pi
where his souldiers were, to the end they should precisely meet together withi^*^^^
mile of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> an hour after midnight, and that they should repair to the sate s
the Town as scon as they could see a slaming Torch on a Tower. The stranccnes
of this incounter was, that the very same night wherein thePrince of Salernoyjn
to execute his design, Don Sernando resolved, without knowing ought ofhis Rivalls
affairs, no longer to deser his interprizc, purpofing to die, or to render himself
Master of the Town, and pofsesfor of the Princess :"so that whilst wc were all the
afternoon seeing the Prince of Salerno paint, he had been taking order for all things
as well as the Captain of thcGate. Their designs being in these teinis. Youmasc
nie tremble with astonissiment, said Jushniano, imerruptins, sAEmilia. Youwillhave
yet more, continued ssic, when Issiasl tell you, that just about two hours after mid-
night, which by an extraordinary chance proved to be the very point, bofsi ofthe
Prince of Salernoh and Don Sernando''s enterprize ; that first having caused twelve
souldiers to enter thorough the window of hischamber with thehelpof ahder
of cords, and commanded the Sergeant to go and seize upon the Gate ofthe town
that hc might forcibly carry away the Princess in hi$Vessell,which wastobeatthe
Port at the same hour,wc heard the outward chamber-door broke open;whereupon
the Princess gave a great skrike, and without standing to know what the matter
should be, the first thing that came into her thought was to put on her clothes, to
the end she mightnot be found in bed, wherein I helped her vvith all the speed
that pofsibly I could.  In the mean time her women ciycd out at the windowes,
but the Princesses Officers lay in a quarter sofar of, because she never feared any
thing from the Towns side, and the Prince of ^^/srw's execution was so sudden,
as scarcely had the Princess gotten on a Night-gown vvith much hast,but he entred
into her chamber followed by ten souldiers, having left two at the Castle-gatc, wb
had stabbcd the Porter upon his awaking.  I leave you to think what the Princess
became in this occasion, when as maugre her resistance and mine,maugrc her tears,
and maugre her cryes, she saw her self carryed away forcibly, by these souldiers,
and led outof the Castle.  I can indure no more, said Jushniano, wissi as much
grief, and almost as much choler as is hchadseen his Mistress carryed away bj
force. Have patience, said ^yEmilia, for yet you do not see all our Enemies. VVhen
as the Prince of Salerno had forcibly carryed away the Princess, I followed her all
in tears, and catching sast hold of one of the corners of her gown, we went in this
sort even to the Gate of the Town, neither thcPrincess nor I having the powerio
cry out, so much were we seized with fear, and our judgements troubled
The Prince of Salerno found not the matter so easie as he had believed it; for the
Sergeant, who had gotten the Ward, and that was toraake use of it for the sur*
prizing of the Court of Guard, and cutting them in pieces , arrived just at the
gate, as the Captain that served Don Sernando, was delivering it up to his men, wkss
were come thither under the conduct of the Gentleman which belonged unto
him, after they had seen the Signall on the Tower.  And whereas he had oiderto
dye, or to render himself Master of it, what resistance soever he met withall, ht
had already begun a ssiarp and bloody fight, when as the Prince of Salerno, ana
thofg that kept the Princess, arrived at that place. And being a Prince of a grCJt
courage, after he had commanded his ten souldiers to look well to the Princesi, W
went with his sword in his hand to see what the matter was. Never was there any
thing more drcadfull than that same night; Don Sernandt, who lay not in the Ca¬
stle that night, who was ready at the gate to receive in his men, and who was in
the head of them, when as the Sergeant arrived there, thought hc was discovcred,

<p>where his Souldiers guarded us, to see in what eihte the Prince Is v/as.
when hc perceived by the abundance of people , vvhich came running from all
parts, that it would bc impoflible for him to siniih his enterprize , he came once
morcuntoher.  I will dye, Madara,  saidhe unto her, seeing I cannot pofsess

that after I have sought to carry youav/ay, I goe now to fight for to keep you
from being carryed away by Don Sernando, and the Prince of ;^/sr«o being un¬
able to live for you , will dye at leastwise in desending you.  This discouiso
luiprising the Princess; What siid she, have we raore Enemies than one? Thi:;
while the Prince of Salerno, vvho notwithstanding the darkness of the night,
having observed that Don Sernando was  in the Head  of the Troopes which he
sought withall, called himso often by his name, that at length they met to¬
gether, and entred so suriously into a particular combat, as lofing the care ut
their men, itwas the easier for thera of the Garrison , and the peopk, wlio were
all up in amies, to defeat thera.  The treacherous Captain laboured in vain to
put Don Sernandoes people into order ; and the Prince of Salerndes Master of
his Horse,  and the Sergeant, whora he made use of, opposed themselves also
in vain to the dilbrder of theirs.  The consusioVi increased with the number; The
Princesses Troopes augmented still ;  those of the Enemies diminished every
moment; And whereas her voyce was heard at last by fomeof her servants not¬
withstanding the fearfull noise that was raade,  they  which guarded us ha¬
ving marked it, and seeing above an hundred men come from divers parts up¬
on them,  they abandoned us after some small resistance ,  and that they had
shewed agreat deal of care of not expofing thePrincess to any danger, as the
Prince had expresly charged thera.  They had no sooner left us the liberty which
they had taken from us,  but the Princess, seeing herself in the hands ofher own
People, got into the nearest house , and appointing Souldiers for the guard of
It,  she coramanded they should send her word how things stood,  and thac
Is It were pofsible they should not kill the two Heads ofthe Enemies forces In
the mean time the Prince of Salernoes Souldiers, which had abandoned the Prin¬
cess, vvcnt amidst the press to seek out their Master for to  advertise him of
It, and having by chance found him ssill in si^htnith Don Sernando,  they told
hiniconsusedlythatthe Princess was carryed away. This discourso equally for-
prised them both. The Prince of Salerno beleeved that Don Sernandoes men had done

<p>shght by Sea, nor any security on Land for him, with so little company. It is credit
ble, considering what I have said, that seeing himself in that estate, and pcrceivin?
that the Prince of Salerno, followed by some of his men, niade towards the port
he with his Souldiers mingled amongst them, and entred into his Vessell with hini'
the darkness of the night favouring the design,  which doubtless hc had to kill
the Prince of S alerne, and tomakehimselfmafter of his Vessell.  For when theday
began to break there was a great noise heard on the Port side,  which made every
one to get up on the walls for to see what thematter was. The Princess andlwent
upto the top of the lodgings where we were, which looked upon the Sea, and
whereas it was grown very light, we saw a Vessell, that was making from the Port
and on the hatches a great number of men fighting together, whereof some tumbled
alive into the Sea, and others sell down dead at their enemies feet. In the midst of
this diforder-we knew the Prince of Salerno and Don Sernando by thek apparell,who
combated with such violence, as moved thePrincess to compassicJh, but at length,
the Vcssell stiil getting further of,we saw that after a long combat these two Rivalls
remained fighting almost alone, and presently after both of them tumble downup-
on the hatches; and so on an instant the Vessel vanilhing, wc could no longer dis¬
cern those two couragious LoverSjWho more happy inthis sad adv£nture,than they
were aware of, made the Princess shed teares of pitty; but she shed them abundant-
ly,whcn as in her return unto the Castle she beheld so great a number of dead bodies
as the strcets were even  covered with thcni. The Prince of ;/2/ssr«of/Master of his
horse was found living still, as well as hc whom Don Sernando had stntirXQtVt
Mtlanese; and it was by their meanes that we came to learn the particularities ofthis
History, which without them I could not have told you; for the Princess understan-
ding who they were, caused them to be very carefully looked unto, thas she might
iearn that which I have related. The Captain ofthe Gate , and the traiterous Ser¬
geant were found amongst the number ofthe dead, and as is the Prince of Sdcr-
noes yiasker of hi%horse, and Don Sernandoes h^ent, had prolonged theitllvesbut
only to tell the Princess what she desired to know, they dyed within a few dayesof
their hurts. As for their Masters we heard afterward,  that being fallen dovyn ask
were dead,in the manner as I have toli you,ch£ remainder of the Prince of Sakrmii
men having made an end of killing those which had followed Don Sermmiolt
Mendoz^a; andbe\ieyin2, their Master to be dead, three or four of them took up
the body of Don Sernando for to cast it into the Sea, when as the Prince of Sde/sn
coming out ofhis svvoon,  and seeing what they were going to do, recovercdso
much strength as to forbid them from it; generofity being greater in him than hi-
tred, or revenge. This  commandement of the Prince was executed , andthit
too ofsering whether hc had any life remaining in him; and when it was reported
untohim that he still breathed, he charged them to have as much care of him is
of himself; as, indeed he was looked unto and treated in the same raanner. I vvilnot
declare the conversations ofthese tvvo Rivall unto you,but in bries it sufficethtoW
you know, that the Prince of Salernoes generofity so nearly touched the heart ofJ|**
Sernando, as he ceased to hate him,and would needs land with him at Naplefto'^
throughly cured thcre.And as is on the healing oftheir wounds that of their minds
had depended,they surmounted the love which they bare to the Princess,the tirst out
of reasbn,and the other out ofhis pride.And each ofthcra following bis own sim
they sent to the Princcss,&amp; wrote unto her, the last with rhodomontadcs, according
to the humor of his Nation, and the other with a great deal of civility; beseeching
her to remember that she had promised her friendship tothe?rince of Saltr^i
and praying her also to attribute allthat had past to the passion of thePainter i*'
cilio, and not to him ,  who vowed alwaies to seek occasions to serve her, andto
publissi every where,  that she was the admirablcst creature on the whole earth.

<p>^H E N as Jushniano was retired to his lodging , and that hehad
coramanded his servants to leave him alone, after they had
gothimtobed, his iraagination represenred untohimmore
lively, than ever it had done before, the inconsiderationofhis
voyage; the promise hehad made to Soltman tot awn mo
him;the neccssity, cither of breakinghis word with a prince
who hadso much obliged him, or to quit his Mistress: Alas/
saidshe, how unhappy ara I, andhow iraprudent havelbsen^
what shall I do in so deplorable an estate ? What shall I say to the Princess ? Where¬
fore came I to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> s Had I the design to betray her , in coming to marry her,
and then to steal away from her the very next day ? Or have I past my word for to
salsisie it? No, no, that was not my design ; I desired to see <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, mylovear-
ried me unto it, and doubtless it ought to carry me unto it; and were I to dispofe
of my sols again, I should still do the fame thing. And could I, said he alowd,re-
suseto see <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> &gt;Thcn turning himself about with precipitation, he recommen¬
ced his complaints. What, continued he,  did Iconic to thePrincess, only to ac¬
quaint her that I was Grand Visier; that I was the chief of all the Orient; that I
was the Favorite of a great Prince; and afterwards to abandon her to grief and
dispair, and so return again to enjoy all those greatnesscs ? Ah no, Justimamhwi
base;  he will not quit a Princess, who is not unhappy but for the love oi
him;  he will not sacrisise her so cruelly to the pleasure of a Prince, who
raay find men enough in his Empite ,  that will take the place whichhekW
there;  For in  sine,  is <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> loy es us,  this princess loves us too ; n"'
is I have  friendship  for this Prince, I have love for <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>.  Let us not

to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. It wasinthismanntv that Jashniano agitated in his mind so dishcult
a thine to resolve on ; and honor and love tyrannized him so crUelly, as his rea¬
son was almost lost therewith. But at length, after he had past the greatest part of
the night without sleeping, hc generously resolved to speak plainly to dicPnnces?,
and in this design prest with weariness and thought, sleep surprized him whether
he would or no, or to say better, a dull and melancholy vapor brought a scnsolcs-
nes; upon him, which yet could not keep his iraagination from representing still
unto him the deplorable condition wherein he was. Day being come, he sounci
himkls so altered, as one would hardly havcbclccvcd,that the miseries ofthe mind
coidd inso little a time have brought such a notable change to the face. As soon
as the Princess was in an estate to be seen, she sent him a complement to advertise
him ofit, whereupon he came straightway to her Cabinet, but with acountenancc
so pale, and eyes wherein grief was so vilible, as <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was suj-prised with it; But
whereas she did notbelieve thathe had any cause to be asshsted, she thought he was
skk, told him thathe should nothavecomeout of his lodging in the case hc was
in, asked him what hc ailed ? whether hc had a seaver ? whether it were still on him?
and sinally propounded very many questions unto him, whereto Jnsltmano answe¬
red not a word. For upon the point of executing that which hc had resolved hc
selt so cxtraordmaric a trouble in his raind, as he suddenly past from palcncssto
redncss; hc was taken at first with an universall ssiivcring which made him to trem¬
ble , and then with so great a burning, that hc seemed all on sire. The Princess see¬
ing him in this case, conjured him again with more earnestness to acquaint her
with the cause of all these alterations in him, thatthey might labor to give some
renicdy unto it. Alas! Madam, ssaidhe unto her with somewhat a low voice, that
he might not be heard by one of the Princesses Women, who was at the other end
of the Cabinet) the knowledge Which I shall give you of my disease will not make
you find a remedy for it; for it is of a nature not to be cured, but by death.  Yet
is I should suffer it my kls alone, I would not complain of it; but I am afraid that
k would be contagious for you; that the knowledge which you should have of ic
would incrcak my grief by causing yours ; that I should be more infortunate in
your person, than in mine own ; and that in conclusion you would be yet more to
bckmented than I, who descrves the miseries which oppress me, since I am the
cauie of all yours.  The Princess judging rightly by thisdiscourse, that there
was some great matter to be known, commanded her woman that was still in the
Cabina, to go and stand at the door for to keep any from coming to interrupt her

and that to conserve it, any thing is to be done : you see, said she unto him, tbatl
am prepared for the greatest misfortunes, and for such as seem to bc the ssirthestofs
sronime ; hold me no longer then in pain, isit be true that I have any powerovcr
you. J»j?/'»/&lt;»w seeing he could not avoid it, went on with his History from the
point where he had left it, he recounted unto her his pains, his un-quictncss,and
his joys, when as he knew that she was not inconstant; that not knowing whatds
to do, he had been constrained to acquaint <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> with his whole life; and conse¬
quently, that the permission which hehad obtained toconie and see her was but for
six months only, having ingaged his word to that Prince to return unto him pre-
cisely within that time. Judge safter this,Madam, saidhe with sighs thatWellneer
sussocated him, and that scarcely suffered him to speak} whether my complaints
be not just&gt; whether I am worthy of your favour, and whether death alone benot
the remedy which I can find for my miseries. For consider sI besecch you) the pi¬
tifull estate whereunto I am reduced; vsssiich way socvcr I turn me I see you ilill
infortunate, but unhappy and infortunate only forthe love of me. Ah Madam!
is you knew how touching this objest is, how sensible and grievous it is, you
would easily apprehend the evill that I suffer; it is so great, as there is no expres-
sion strong enough to represent it well : You have believed me to bc dead, and I
have thought that you were inconstant; your vertue hath been tryed by a long ab¬
sence, and my crime hath been pimissicd with slavciy; but when as fortune seenied
to be weary of persecuting us, vvhen as your constancy was sussiciently known, and
when as my crime was punished enough, she made some truce vvith us: I knew? tba:
you lived for nic, and you were not ignorant that I always lived for you. I am
returned Mac^am, but must I repeat it once again ? I am returned a Slave, fortune
hath but Icngrlicned my chain, and not broken ofs my irons. You seem. Madam,
continued he, by your silence to tell me that I had done better for your rest, not lo
have returned, and to have left you in die belies of my death, than to conic forw
assure you that I do live, but that I do not live for you. I think,Madam, that realon
is on your side, but it is a reason which I cannot follow. My voyage i.s not an eP
of my reason, nor of my will; I never stuck at the taking of this resolution, W'
lowed my sense and my lovc, and my passion so raightily blinded my reason,asmy
soul abandoned it sols wholly to joy. I no longer thought that I was to return i'
gain to Conslantinople, but only that I was going to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, that I should have t e
pleafore to soe you there, and that afterwards I could not be unhappy. In sine,Ma
dam  have not done that which I ought,but I have done that which I could no^:
choofo but do. In the racan time I have no sooner seen you, but I have bchdd y
as a good which I was to lose, and as a person which I have n^^^c unhappy, r

<p>you, and crucll to my sols; and to say all, I am so unhappy as death alone can suc¬
cor me: But for all that Madam, it is you that must pronounce my sentencc,  and
dispofe ofmy I ik. Juslmiano then kit himkls so prest with grief,  as he could say
no niorc.The Priiicel^s, vvho had heard him with a great deal of attention,  also-
nishment, and sorrow, was also a good while without answering him ;  agitating
in her self so dissicult a thing to be resolved. She was then leaning with one arm
on a littk table of ebony, looking on <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> , who durst not list up bis eyes for
fear of incountring those ofthe Princels, which were full of teares;  But at length
this generous person, who had a great and noble soul, brak ofs her silence, and said
unto him with a constancy, which hath scarce any exaraple; I consess, my dearest
Jushniano, that our raiscries are so great, as I could not foresee them; and one had
nectl ofa mi III I, that is sirm indeed , not to He abandoned wholly  to  grief,  in
an occasion where it is so hard to satishe together, both honor and love: I consess,
continued she, that thcsc two padions reign both at once in my heart; but I consess
also, that the last cannot bc satished without the other; and that in conclusion , to
express my thought unto you, had I not found a meanes to satishe them both, I
should die, and let you goe. For know, that I am too generous to suffer you to
testifie your lovc unto me in an unworthy way ; and lam ravished to see you love
glory, as much as me.No,<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>,you rauis not break your word with a Prince,
who h.ith so much obliged you; forso should you be both ingratefull and persidi¬
ous; neither must you too abandon a Princess, who loves you so dearly;  forso
should you be both crucll and unfaithfull; and isyou love her persestly, you can ne¬
ver doe it. I know full well, answered justtniano vvith a deep ligh, that death alone
can acquit me of that which I ought to doe. That is not my meaning, replyed the
Princess, and to clear it unto you ,  you raust return again to that generous Prince
who hath loved you so ranch; I am no less obliged to him than you, since I ow
your life unto him; and for this reason , together with that of honor, I will not
hinder you from it:but withall you raust perrait nic to follow you.Oh.'Madara,said
jHstmiano , do you think well of that you say ? yes, answered she, I have thought
well upon it,  and  am resolved for it. But whereas lovc can never vanquissi ho¬
nor in mysoul, Iwill not follow you as a vagabond, and scrsak en one, you shall
mary me here ,  and that  done , I will follow your fortune over all  the
earth. You have told me already, that SeUman permits you the exercise of your Re-
li2ioii,l mayenjoy the same gracc,either as passing for your slave,or for your vviso.
And then again, I have not forgotcen that you have told me , how this Prince hadi
made you hope, that is he could support ,your abknce during the time ofthe six
riionthes vvhich he hath given you, hc would grant you your full liberty: Let us co
then, my dear Justtniano, and demand k of silm with teares; Do not stain your slo-
rv, in breaking your vvord withso excellent a Prince; and ofsend not your love
m resodng a reqiiest which I makcto you with so much earnestness. The generous
dilcourk oi the Princess had wrought strangely on <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, during the time that
ihelpake to hini, though he left not harkensog unto her;  and this pi?,pofi^i^ngave

a hing which he would de .berate of; he had in an instant p.dred ovci in his mind
allthe reasons, which m.g^it either carry him to it, or keep him from it The

greatness of courage ? No, it would not be just. Leave me the onely thsog whe ^^'"
to I can pretend, and pofsesse all the other vcrtucs., wherein I can have no n'^""'
must in this occasion, Madam, shew you, that Justtniano knowes how to lovc  J
by the hardcst tryall that can bc desired of a Lover, I will niake you see that
love considers nothing but you alone; that it is wholly disintcressed ; that I rcea^I
not my scls; that in sine I am as persest a Lover, as you arc generous. But this q^
all,ah how cruell it is! And how hard a matter it is to rcsisse that which oned"
sires! Yet it must be, and nothing can distra&lt;^ me from it.  To testifie my love unt'
you then,Madam, at that height which speak I of,I must not accept ofthe ofseryo!
make me; I must resuse to raary you; I must abandon you; I must deprive my sju
all my felicity; I must fight with all my desires; I must destroy my self; and I must
become the most wretched ofall men: Behold, Madam, all thac I can, and allthat
I ought to do for you; for to expofe you to tempests, to the sury of Pyrats, andto
consent that yoi; should mary a slave, is a sacrilegiousnhought, which would render
me the most criminall person in the world, and which shallinever arrive unto me.
It would be enough indeed for fortune to make me seel my own miseries, during
so satall a voyage,  without inforcing meto resent those which should happcnto
you. Let me depart then. Madam, or to to say better, let me dye. I will doe ncidier
the one, nor the other, said the Princess, and in this occasiou you shall not dispofe
ofyour self. Nevertheless it is needsul! that you should giveme a publiquc asl of
your will, before I can execute mine. Resist me not, Jushniano, unkss you desire to
ofsend me; sofser me to follow yon with honor, and put me not in the conduion
of increasing the number ofthose indiscrcet ones, who many times have solkwctl
their Lovers, without being their wives. Think of my glory, I conjure you; and
think too, that isyou abandon me, I may peradventure be capable of forgetting k.
Do not expofo me, I beseech you, to chat perill, since it is greater for me, according
to my apprehensions, than the drcadsuUest tempest that you can describe unto me.
And fear not I pray you, continued she, either shipwrack, or Pirats; is weperilB
together, wc shall dye almost vrithout grief; is we oe made slaves, you willhelp
me to bear my chaines; or is wc be soparated , the fory of those barbarians shall do
no more, than what you would now do.  Cease, Madam, from adding to myfor-
row, said J*;/?&lt;»*&lt;»» interrupting her,  complain of my misfortune, but complain
not ofme in this crnell adventiire.  When I parted from Constant iuople to come hi¬
ther,  I blindly followed my passion; but at this present. Madam, Ivvillblmdly
follow reason: She will not have you follow  a wretch, and an infortunate nun;
Do you not conl;der, how is it should happen that I should dye, in what ancslatc
you would remain ? Ah! my dear Princess sis Imay be permitted to call yoa
so ) give over so wofull a design: Live in tranquility , whilst I go and combatray
evill fortune at Constantinople; with a promise, isl cannot overcome it, not tofr
vive her victory very long. But itmay be we shall not be somiserablc; SoUmtinb.^
a great and vertuous soul;  that which I am going to doe may please him l&lt;
may bc moved with my teares and pray ers;  he may break that invisible chain
which tyes me unto him ; and being no longer a slave, you mighc then widiont
shame accord me the honor, which now I resisse. This hope is too weak, saidthc
Princess, to make me change the resolution I have taken: No, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, to sp«^
to me thus, is not to lovc as you should; this is to blind me withanartilicejto
doubt ofmy affection and courage, and to say all, this is to ofsend me sensibly.?^!
teares shall not hinder yours from having their effect, but contrarily I am of»
stx accustomed to vanquissi even cruelty it self with such like amies:  Suffer ™^
then to ssiare this victory with you, isyou are to carry it;  or that I may be van¬
quissicd with you, is you are to be so. You do not consider. Madam, saidjustim0'^
that is <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should see you at Constaittinople,  it would be the meanes of neve&gt;
obtaining my liberty, because I should then have all there th.it could rendering

have you promise me, that within the time you are to stay here, you will obtain
the resolution from your self to raary me, and to permit me to follow you ; for in
conclusion I cannot consent, that we should be separated from one anodicr but by
death alone. This last word was no sooner pronounced, but the Princess found hee
self vciry ill; she became pale and languissiing; her eyes,diat were so clear, so pier¬

selves up , she sell backward on her chair, her head leaning on the left side, and
weakly reaching out her right hand to Justtniano, who was so surprised to see her
so changed in an instant, as'hc could not forbear crying out pretty lowd. But for¬

<p>sicians where already come, for being incountred by good hap inth: Castleth-
had been advertised ofthis accident by one ofthe Princesses women. They beheld
her, seel her pulse, ask her questions, to come to the  knowledge of her disease
and not able to find out the cause of it, they testifie by their actions, and by their'
unquietness, that n^t knowing it persestly, they are troubled how to reiblve oa the
choice ofthe remedies that they would apply thereunto;  At length they ordain
her to be laid in her bed , that still they might gain time to think of that which
they had to doc. J«/?/w/?w out of respest retired all in dispair, and vvithoutbeins
able so much as to reason about his misfortune, his sorrow became so strong, as hj
selt it but consusedly. The Princess was not long in her weakness , and Nature do¬
ing her uttermost, gave her spiritsthe liberty again which grief had arested; But
thereupon, thci e was so great and Itiddain a revolution ci all her humors, as she
sell into a violent seaver, so that the Physicians knowing then the Princess disease,
albeitthey were ignorant ofthe cause ofit, they began to treat her according to
the precepts of tlicir Art.  <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was also desired by order from the Princess
to repair unto her; hc obeyed, and came into her chamber, vvith a face wherein the
grief ofthe raind so nearly resembled that of the body ,  as he seemed to bs sicker
than the Princess. He approches, every one withdrawcs, and when the Physicians
told her, that after such an accident as this which had befallen her,  ic was sit she
should not speak much, she assured them that their conversation should notbe long;
as indeed all that she said to Jnsltniano was,  comfort your iels for the love ofme,
is you will have me live for the love of you ,  and be raindsuU not to speak ofour
misfortunes, no not to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> himself isi he comes hither. And whereas she saw that
J«/?i»;4«s? could not answer her  without discovcring'his  grief, shewrunghim
gently by the hand, and calling e./£w;7/^ , she commanded her to haveacareof
Juslmiano, untill her sickness was abated.  This infortunate Lover, not daring to
speak, for fear of augmenting the Princesses disteraper, and making too much show
of his dispair, which she would not have him to do, retired away without saying
any raore, than, AhlMadara, isyou will have me comfort my self^ you nrast then re¬
cover ofthis sickness, which I have been the cause of.  After that, thePrincess
grew extremely worse and worso ; the seaver held her ten daies with so much vio¬
lence, and weakness together, as the Physicians durst not warrant her life: Butk
was nothing in comparison ofthe eleventh day , for then Jushniano, who scarctlj
had abandoned her all that time, absolutely beleeved that she was adeadbody.
The seaver was very ranch increased , her strength diminilhed, the remedies unpro¬
sitable; Nature scemed to want power, and to be so oppressed, as it was impolsible
to hope that she Ihould cscape.  But in the midst of all those raiscries, and inso
great an extreraity, the conssancy of the Princess was admirable; who,  notwith¬
standing &lt;!y£miliaes teares, the cryes of her women,  and Jushnianoes dispair, who
was no longer in the tcrmes to suffer himself tobe constrained by reason, cxpreiTed
such a tranquillity of mind, as it might well be judged, that life was not very dear
unto her: Yet could she not for all that indurc Justmianoes lookes, nor see his teares
trickle down his checkes without resentracnt, and besides that deplorable objest)
she was inscnsible to all things.  But whilst they were in these tcrmes at yls«»'««')
there was nothing but rejoycing at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where it was not known that the Prin¬
cess was so sick as she was;  for from her first time of being ill, she hadgivcnin
charge that it should not be publhhed, to the endshc niight recover vvithoutmo-
leftation, or at leastwise dye quietly.  It was onely then knowen at Genona thatlK
was not well, but that kept them not, from meeting almost every day ; according
to the order which the Marquis had established, either at the Couius, or atDorii&gt;[h
who after his return had taken an onely sister, that he had , to govern his houlc;
and who was alsociated with this fair Troop ,  vvhich had no other thoughtbuto
delighting themselves. The raoft considerable of this assembly, were theCountot

wit^and beauty, sothat the Marquis being joyned to so many excelknt persons,
k niight have been said, that this Asserably had been persest indeed, had Justtnia-
nt and the Princess of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> been there. The next day after that the Couns,D&lt;jrM,
and the Marquis were returned to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, this illustrious company sailed not to
meet at the Counts Palace; and whereas it was forbidden to speak in these occa¬
sions either of war, or of generall affairs; and that Verses, Painting, Musick, Love,
Vertue, and all other things that depend ot an excellent wit, were those onely,
Wherew'ith one niight entertain himself inthis encounter; the constancy of Isa¬
belU die merit and love of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, raade an overture to the conversation. The
beauty of the place also added something to the beauty of the Assembly ; for the
more magnificence, and making of the better and raore glorious ssioW of their
Jewells, those dayes wherein the women decked awd set forth themselves all the
wiiuk/vvs were ssiut up,and torches served to light the room, which this day Leonora
caused to be sumptuonsly surnished,becausc the company was to be more than ordi¬
nary. The hangings were of Carnation Velvet, imbroidered all over with tears and
spangks of gold and silver ; the bed, chairs, and stools were of the same ; and in-
{sead\ sa <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> Carpet, the sloor was covered with agreat piece of Gold, Silver,
and Carnation Silk tinselh This charaber was lighted with thirty Candlefticks,
whereof the one half wereof gilt Vei million set with Stones, and the others of
ChrilT:all ingraven, and garnished with gold.  Round about this Chamber huBg
at an equall distance, great Plates of Gold-sraiths work all set with precious stoncs,
and upon a Cabinet of Nacre and Corall, a great vase of Agate, and two baskets
of Gold ingraven full of artisiciall Flowers. There were also between these Plates
greatniyrrors, with the Pictures of all the Ladies of thecorapany; and the same
placed in kich sort, as opposite t&lt;p every myrror hung the Picture ofa Lady, drawn
in the habit of a Nymph, or a Goddess.  The beauty and magnificence of^so many
agreeableobjests, did without doubt excite some more than ordinary joy in all
the Assembly ; and in so charming a place it had been very dissicult for one not to
have been wounded with love, which presents not it self but in the raiddest of plea¬
sures and delights: And indeed Pm^ was more powerfully touched therewith
than before ; Heratlofch new slames for HispoUta; Alphonso be^an to look on Lm-
nidit without indisserencie; and the Marquis seeing never a woman in the compa"
ny u itli whom he had not been already as much in love as was pofsible for him to

for all tuatlb strong in him, as to keep him from complaining of this adventure-

ing at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> in the middest of twenty of the fairest persons of all /t&lt;i/is,Hhould
be constrained to send my raind to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, there to encountei my Milsress.  It is
not, continued he, because it is an effect of ty£mtlia's chatms, or ofthe change of
my humor; but it is because I seeing never a woman here, for whom I-bave not
already been in passion, I am inforced to conserve that for her still. And certainly
is I had thought I should have tarried so long at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, I should have taken a bet¬
ter order for my affairs.  I would have loved Hjpolitaafull moneth, SothrontA
as long, and so all the rest ; by which rule I should have needed but twelve IVlistres'
ses every year : But in the manner that I have carried my self I ara utterly ruined.
For my part, said Leonida with her joviall huraour, I will forget is you will, that
ever you were in love with me, to the end, you may not give any occasion of sad¬
ness to our Assembly: and I assure you that is you could resolve to make a new
declaration of love unto me, I ara deceived is you would not love me more the
second time than the first. I have known since, continued ssic, that I was to indul¬
gent to you ; Iconiracndcd the first Verses that you raade for me; I took too
much care in learning a song which you gavcrac ; I danced better with you thin
withall others, and I know not any testimony of estecra and good will which I
did not render you ; in the racan time you quitted me cruelly, to lovc she severc
Sophronia, whose coldness could not keep you from serving her six days longer than
nic; and Iconsess that I should not be forry to know for what reason her rigors
have chaniied you raore, than my complyanccs and favors; to the end, that is e-
ver we have such another adventure, I raay govern my self therein with address.
But I pray you, added she, do not content your self with telling me, that the same
thing arrives almost to all the world, that dissiculties and obstacles augment Love,
since custom passes not fora good reason with me, and that all which I can do, is
to follow it only in apparell. It is certain, beautifull Is&lt;?w^s*, answered the Mar¬
quis, that this matter is a little too delicate to be disputed vrith. you ; but lincc
you have denounced war against me, it shall not be to ofsend you that I do answer
you; bear then, is not a satissaction to your coraplaints, at leastwise a resolution
to your doubts. I think, is I understand well that which you marvell at, and that
whichyoucannotcomprchend, itisbut toknow by what reason rigors and neg-
left do augment love, rather than caresses and favours : but is I deceive not my
self, it will not be hard for me to demonstrate it unto you. No man is ignorant
but that beauty ingenders love, and so love is no other thing but a desire to podels
beauty, in such sort, that is love bc a desire, it will be so much the greater, by how
much the thing desired shall be dissicult in acquiring ; since being once pofleftjthc
cause ofthe desire utterly ceases : wherefore it isnot an improper action for Love,
but soiced and necessary, to be more vive and earness in rigors than favors, seeing
they excite and entertain it.  But to explain my self raore cleaily, I say, that de¬
sire cannot be at rest, because at the fame inssantthat it arrives at its end, itcealei
to be desire : So that is love bc a desire, as I have already said, what strong^
proof can one have to ssiow that it ceases to be love, than to see it arrived at its
end? But is sfair Leomda) you should not agree that love is a desire,I think atleal''
wise that you will not deny but that it is a sire, since so many have told you, tM'
they burned for you, as you cannot be ignorant of this truth.  But it you conlp^
the effects of it, you will see that I ara not altogether out of reason; fire is» ^
nature so astivc, as it consumes allthat opposes it ; is any thing resists it, is^'
stop its paslage, far from the end which we had propounded, that which scem^
should have served for opposition, serves it for nourissiment; for in conclusionjhs
is quick and ardent as long as it finds resistance ; but as soon as it hath vanquilh' &gt;
andthat it hath nothing left to consonie, it consumes it self^ndccasesablolutty
to besire, when it hath nothing more to vanquissi.  Is it be then true that love is
sire, it is true that it kindles by dissiculties; that rigors scrve to soment it) 2"
when it happens that it hath nothing left to surraouiit, it loses its being ^r V
sire, and ceaits absolutely to be love.  Let us not marvell then any longer, is it" '

which I had stir the cruell one ; and changing of objest, I arrive still at my end,
which is to lovc eternally. Butis this reason which is particular to me, doth not

mant, and so many other wonders which are in Nature, working by reasons that
are hidden from the knowledge of men, so am I inconstant m that manner, by a
particular vertue, whereof I cannot reach the cause, and which at this presenc
doth also inforce me to have no raore but good will for the fair Leomda. It were

I will not resist it, and I will indeed acquaint you with one. But whereas the
anger he was in, for that he could not bc amorous in this place, had taken up his
thoughts,hcacquited himself of it after an extraordinary way; yet was it not
without musing attentively on that which he had to say, never regarding Whether
allthecompany were in casetohearhimorno; and after he had performed all
the ceremonies of a man that prepares himselffor a long Narration, he began to

as I was the most favourably intreated by her, without having any occasion to

Behold the end of my History. The whole company then broke out into such a

<p>full nicmories of their Heroes, who make narrations,  which cause them to pass
whele daies without eating, and nights without sleeping. For my part, said the
Marquis, I found my self so ill with such another adventure at Asow^co, where I
recounted my sollies of<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> to the Princess, as I am fully resolved never to sall
into the like again ; and I should rather chuse to talk to the beautifull sAmdm
whom I did lovc, and still doe love whether I will or no, than play the Astrologer
a second time. In the mean while <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who was insinitely desirous to speak to ;«.
phrottia of his growing passion, thought there was po better way to make shegenj-
rail cpnversation cease, and bring on a more particular one, than to propound the
Musick, for the charming of the Marquis his bad humor.  To which effect then he
told the Count, that is harmony had at othertimes had the power to appde
the sury of some J  it might easily allay the melancholv ofa man that was not
accustomed to have any, TheMarquis, who could notbe deceived with such like
things, presently perceived Pisr/^s/design; and to vex him a little hc told hini,tliJt
the remedy which hc propounded unto him could not work but upon the melanclic-
lick, andso by consequence , it would be unprofitable for him. But afterhehad
waggissily caused the conversation to endure a little longer,he was the first thatprtst
Leonora to impofe silence on the company by a consort of lutes, which she hadmade
them hope for. The Count then arofe, and pussiing open the door ofa Cabinet, k
ordained the Musicians to begin. In the mean time the Marquis, who was willing
to oblige Deria, said, that the Ladies were first to be placed, where they mightbdi
hear; thereupon he made a dcmy-circlc of chaires some four or sive paces sroniilis
Cabinet door, wherein he placed all the women, and behind every Lady, he seated
a man, playing the Master of the ceremonies so dextrously, as without any shew of
assestation in his choice, hc placed Herat I0 behind Hjpolita, and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> clofmSt-
phronia, who sailed not to muke use of so favourable an occasion : For after they
had barkened a long time to an excellent consort of Lutes, with a silence wortbj
of so charming an harmony, and that he saw how in the assembly each one in pat*
ticular began softly to commend that which seemed to be the most agreeable indie
Musick, he took thcliberty to say unto Sophronia with a low voice; I may not ven¬
ture to deliver my opinion of those exquisite lessons I have heard; because the sinill
attention that I have lent unto them , would not permit me to be an equall judgt
thereof. Doubtless the thought which hath diverted you from it,  replyed Soijh

cholick.lt was both together, answered Deria, and isl raight presumetoinait
you the consident ofa matter that imports as much as my life, you should seewidi'
out quelstion that I am not far from the truth. It is for you to consider, said sheunto
him, whether this secret, is it may bc told me, would be advantagious to you for
me to know it; and on the contrary, I being of a sex that is accused of being mu*
ble to conceal any thing, whether you are to fear the expofing ofyour self totlw

<p>these last words, and turning her self to Leomda ,  who Luc next heron the righi
hand, for to demand ofher how she liked the Musick , it sell out that in going to
avoid one dikourse of love, she interrupted another; For Alphonso , who began al¬
ready to be in a strong passion for Leonida, had laboured to shevv it her with the
raoft addi el - that poflibly he could. But whereas she was ofa wily huraor,and would
contrary to that of Sophronia, cunningly conceal things which were near her heart,
by seigning to discover thera ; in ssead of answering to Sophromaes question ,  she
, said unto her smiling, and pointing to <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>; this Cavalier hath talked so much
to me oflove, as I had no leisure to raind the Musick. Alphonso was somewhat a-
mazed at this discourse, but seeing that she did not bt hold him , either with cho¬
ler, or contempt, he said unto her with address ;  there appeared so much ofit in
your eyes, a.s it would be as dissicult for one not to be taken with it, as it would be
impofsiblc for you to bemoan the evills which you are the cause of  Whilst these a-
miable persons entertained themselves in this sbit, Horatio v/as not sb happy,  for
whatsoever care he took about it, he could not obtain one favourable look from
Hypolita , whuse jealous humor had made her bekeve that hehad beheld Z/sd&gt;«/si.^
with too much attention, whether it were that he had observed Atphonso,who spake
softly unto her, or had without design cast his eyes that way; but in conclusion all
that she answered to tvhatsoever he could say unto her ,  was to pray him witha
quipping geer not to be <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>es Rivall,vvho was her brothers sricnd,'for fear left
the share which she was to have in all his interests, raight oblige her to break vvith
him. At the fame instant die consort ceased , and the Count desired the company
to renew their attention forthe hearing of a Dialogue, sung by two most excel¬
lent voyces; after which the Marquis, who had set himself down by Leonora, conti¬
nued the conversation still for some time v/irh his ordinary address;  and then all
this sair Troop departed away,  but with disserent dioughts. PorA« selt himself so
cased, for having raadc his first declaration of lovc to his^Mistress,  that he was as
much satished therewith, as ishe had received a great favour from her. But though
■Sophrorna esteemed very ranch of <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, though he was ofan illustrious race, though
he was beloved of her brother-law,  and that according to apparent reason she
could not make a sitter choise, yet was there a particular one, and that was hidden
to all the worid, but not unknown to her ,  which raade her fear the sequclof this
padioii. For she was not ignorant that the Count,  albeit he esteemed of <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> in
particular, yet bore an  irreconcilable  hatred to the whok family in generall
though in his actions and words he testified the clean contrary. It was in this for?
that this beautifull and prudent maid reasoned with her scls, not doubting but that
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>es dikourse was unseigned, because she was sofsiciently perswaded that he
would not easily venture to say soch like things unto her, having alwaies made

are for the most part all alike amongst worthy persons. and whe rcas time prclse!
me, I will onely give you an accompt of all that hath arrived to me since, but I4
shall be in few words. I served her then vvith assiduitie enough, as you might well
observe; and even to that point as she was no longer able to doubt ofit. I perceived
by her lookes, that my person did not displcase her; that my witandmyhumji.
contented hers, and then when i expested some testimony of assestiofiforarccom.
pence of my paines, guess, my dear sister, what it was that she gave me, and the
onely one that I received ? Horatio stayed a while, in expestation of Sophroniaet an¬
swer, who presently said untohim laughing, I think, brother, that I cannot with-
out trespashng against good manners shewmy self very spirituall, in gucshng at the
favors which may be done to a Lover ; wherefore it were sitter that you shouldlet
.meknow what this favour was, thanto trouble me to tell it you. Harkcntome
more seriously, I conjure you, replyed Horatio,  and know that this testimony cs
affection, which I have so often received from Hypolita , was not the gi vine me oc¬
casions to see her, or to speak to her in particular; it was not an obliging letter;
it was not a bracelet of her hair; it was not a picture; it was not assuring me with
her own mouth that she did not hate me; but it was telling me, that I did not love
her, and that I loved another. In sine , the first proof which I had ofher affection,
was a mark of her choler; and to express my selt more clearly, jealousie alone hath
shewed her love tome. You cannot receive a more undoubted proof thereof, said
;ts^&lt;ww interrupting him: Nor a more grievous one too, replyed .Wor^r/o. For
you must know scontinued he) that after I haddoneanhunclredincivilitiesto
satishe her, whereof you have many times demanded the cause of me, though I ne¬
ver told it you; yet could I not cure her mind ofthis sancy; And ofall the women
of quality of<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, I do not know one, that hath fair hair, which she hath notbe-
lievcd that I have been in love withall, Leonida onely rcmaines, who at this present
ssicks in herstomack, and for whom she hath ill intreated me to day. Isit be so,
iaad Sophronia, you are to take comfort, and bc caresoll to justisie your self unio
her; for when her jealousie shall want an objest, she will questionless be constrayned
to give yoa another mark ofher affection. Ah, sister, replyed Horatio, you anh.
little acquainted with this passion ! it formes phancasmes, it deceives the sense, it
illudesrcason, and without any ground, or subject, it leaves not to work in those
whom it pofsesscth; it makes them to see that which is not; makes them believe to*
pofsible things; and utterly perverts the understanding. At leastwise, sofar as Ihavt
observed it in others, for I have never tryed it otherwaies, which certainly tiii

times she had permitted him to interpret her resentments and choler to his advanj
tase H7P;/;M heard him witha great deal ofattention, but for allthat he could
not perswade her, for with a piecipkous voycc she sad unto him; Suppofo that your
indcavours and services have been powerfull  enough to obtain my affection,  yet
have they not been powerfull enough to conserve it; and thereof I could bring you
a thousand testimonks; but whereas they are matters wherein your excuses might
give me satissaction, and not desiring to receive any from you , I will pot surnissi
you with meanes to doe it; but to convince you, I will onely say one thing, which
admits no reply, and which all your cunning cannot destroy.  Have you not seen
me, continued ssic, receive the civilities of the youngcst ofthe Sregofes, ofthe el¬
dest of the Adornes, and of some others, without regarding yours ? Have you not
been in some assemblys where that last hath alwaies taken me out to dance, whilst
I have scarce so much as turned my look towards you ?  Have I omitted any occa¬
sion of testisying unto him, when you past with himbefore my window,  or in all
©ther places where I might have you for a witness,  that his love did not displcase
me ? No, Horatio, I have omitted none, and the affection which I bore you, made
me have recoursc to this artifice, hoping I should know, by giving you some cause
of jealousie, the force ofyour palsion; but I have not seen, though you have seen all
thcsc things, that you had any sense ofthcra ; and albeit I knew that by this unto¬
ward experience I should be in danger of lofing you, is you were sensible, yet chofe
I lather to resolvc upon it, and to assure my self of your love, thanto conserve you
with a luke-warm and indisserent affection. I have ever heard, that jealousie is the
daughter of lovc, yet do I not say that lovc cannot be without jealousie. Question¬
less you will tell me, that by my own reasons I am unjust in complaining of you,
since it is pofsible, that you may have love without having jealousie. But alas I this
discourse hath not so much as an apparent reason, neither can I suffer my self to
be perswaded to that which! desire so passionately. And to ssicw you that I can¬
not force my raind to deceive my self, hear a thing, which hath made me to
think upon this matter. I have been perswaded then, that love alone cannot pro¬
duce jealoulie; and how it is necessary that jealousie should have a mother which
may contribute to her birth; this mother, is I be not deceived, is occasion ; and as
love without her cannot produce jealousie, so she without love canot beget
jcalouiie.  This reasoning seemes so powerfull to me, as you cannot make any
objestion which it destroyes not; for in sine, you may well have lovewithouc
jcalouhe, when as you have no occasion for it; but I having given it you and
you not having taken it, is to say absolutely, that you have had no love 'Ah I

<p>more have you established my felicity.  You say then, amiable Hjpolita scontinued
Horatio^ that  there can  be no  love  without jealousie, and because Ihave
not been jealous, I have had no love ; you shall pardon me is you plcak, is with-
out lofing the respest which I ow }ou, I dare take the libertic to contradict: you"
in maintaining with reason, that the perscstest and sincerest reason is that which
admits of no jealousie.  It is athing known of all reasonable and dis-intcressed
personsj that he who loves truly, loves only to love, and not to be beloved, or ro
expest any recompence ; for that thought is too base and abjest forso noble a pas.
sion. Now is the loveof beauty, which is that whereof we speak , springs from
an objest that is pleasing to the fight, it followes, that sb long as this ob¬
jest seems  amiable  unto  us , so long will our love continue ;  and whe-
t'ler the person beloved answers our affection ,  or answers it not, this love
shall be still the same love.  Butthat I may make use of a comparison as well
as you, a man sees a fair Lady, and love arises in his heart, is it necessary
for him to examine whether this Lady be ingaged to another in affection? it is
certain that it is not; and it is everyday seen that love doth subject us to them
whose love is ingaged othcrwherc:so that one may wel judg from thenr:,thataman
ought to persevere in his love, though some cause be given him of jealousie, since
when he was not beloved, andthathe was induced to love by the only fight of
beauty, he left not to be insinitely amorous.  And is I may be permitted to maie
use of History inthis encounter, what syrapathy, or what affection could that
young Athenian expest,who became so desperately in lovc with a beautifull Statue,
and whose passion was so extreme, as the like was never heard of? It is very cer¬
tain, that he loved only to love, seeing the objest of his passion was absolutely in¬
capable of any correspondence. Now then is it bc true, that a Lover is satished in
knowing that he loves, hc is raoft assured that jealousie is not of power enough to
destroy his lovc, and that this jealousie is rather an effect of a desestive, than ofa
persest love.  And to speak sreely unto you, tell me, I pray you , who can be so
hardy, after a worthy person hath had the goodness to receive our servicesfavoura*
bly, andto testifie some affection unto us, as to suspest she should have the same
thoughts for another? kh,fair Hjipolita, thegallantry and civility vvhich you
have used to the eldest of the Adornes, could not oblige me to draw so bad a conse¬
quence against you. And tocomprehendall the rest of my reasons in one alone,!
am but to say, that he who by his discourse gives some marks ofhis jealoulie to
his Mistress, names her inconstant, sacile, and almost infamous: Judge now,fair
Hypolita, whether thesebe words agreeing with a Lady.  In the mean time kis
most undoubted, that in what tcarms soever jealousie is exprvssed, it cannot be ex¬
pressed but in this manner: whereas quite contrary,thisconnaence which wehavc
in the person beloved, which makes us to approve of all her actions, is the true
mark of persest lovc, and indeed merits the most acknowledgement, is I maybe
permittecl tofay so. I havenot suspested you then, beautifull Hypolita, of incon¬
stancy, because I have esteemed you very much; and is I had had as good a place
in your heart, as you have had in mine, you would questionless have done me jo-
sticc, in not accusing me of infidelity. Hypolita was not forry to find Horatio"') rea¬
sons stronger than hers, but whereas she was high-inindcd,ssic would not let himssc
that she began to repent hcr;but contrarily making ssicw as isshe thought u strang'
her brother should leave her so long entertaining Horatio, she called him, sortii'
shessi.oiild be constrained to say something that would bc too obliging unto hii''
And whereas Pslr/'i could not satishe himself, he came out of his Sisters Cabinet,
and went down to wait on Horatio, whom she could not let part, without behol-
dinuhim in such a sort, as he raight easily perceive, that he was in better terms
with her than when he came thither ; for it is the custom of those that are em]
angry, to be as easily pacisied; to accuse, that one may justisie himself; and to com¬
plain, that they ULiy be satissicd. Jrttlk mean time <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had no sooner lek B^^r*-

fame • and how pressing socvcr it be for you to send it away to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, I am resol¬
ved not to kt you have it again, till all our srknds have seen it.  The Marquis re¬
sisted it a while, but at length consented thereunto; and in regard the Assera.bly
met not very soon, the Marquis sent not away his Letter till just the day before
they thought the Princess would have died : So that when La Ra'che was arrived at
<hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and entred into the Castle, he was much amazed to see them all in tears.
And whereas in this occasion the Officers had no care of any thing, he went even
tothe Princesses chamber without any impediment; where hc saw <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, hc
notsecing him, for grief so absolutely pofsessed him, as he was incapable ofall
knowledge, but of that of his own raisfortune.  He could not incUire the fight of
the Princess, neither could hc also keep from her, sothat hc was in a continuall a-
gitation.  In the mean time the Physicians desiring to do their uttermost endea¬
vour, still carefully observe the estate she i$ in, they consult with their books, and
inso desperate a disease they resolvc to have recourl'e unto extreme remedies; sa
that abandoning ordinary Physick, one amongst them, who was an excellent Empi-
rick, raade her take so wonderfull an essence, that after it had caused her to sleep
eight hours, it restisied the blood,' diminished her Sever, restored her strength, and
put her quite out of danger.  The indisserency she had shewed at the approaches
of death, scemed the same,whcn as the Physicians assured her that she should not die
of thislkkncsa; and she gave them greater thanks for their affection to her, than
for their saving her life. Howbeit they were not without thank? for this resurre-
tT:ion; for J«y?/«&lt;&lt;«»o received so great a satissaction from it, as he could not give
thera thanks enough of his acknowledgement. His joy nevertheless was mingled
vvith a great deal of bitterness, and his soul was not in an estate of rasting a quiet
plcaliiic.  This while L-&lt;i?s7c*s, whom the Marquis had sent, hearing that the
PiMiceis wasoutof danqer, went to J«/««m«»'s lodging, for to rcndcT him the ci¬

<p>JEmilias Letter to the Marquis.
</p>
<p>IT vould be too much vanity in me to pretend unto the obtaining of that from m
which so great a ttumber of fair persons could not oblige you to render unto them, dl
not believe then that I regardyou as a conquest, which I may never lose, bnt ctntrxtd)
I am resolved to do in this occasion, as great Captains use to do, who, after they !uve tA-
ken a place which they thinks they cannot hold, set tt on sire, and deslroy it themselves, ts
get some advantage siill by this loss. And whereas there was never place so hard to k
kept, as your heart, I purpose, in order to that you have written me, to bring new pmts
unto it, rather than to resolve to lose you altogether: There will he short ly at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> 4
fair ktnswoman of mine, whom I conjure you to love, when at you jhall no longer judse mi
■worthy of that honor, to theend that in lostngy-sur love, I may at leastwise comfort mj
self with your fight, with your conversation, and with your srteidjhip.
</p>
<p>.Emilia.
</p>
<p>This Letter being sealed, she gave to la Roche, who presently departed for to re¬
turn unto Gss«o»/s, without speaking to thePrincess; for ever since she was out
of danger, the Physicians had absolutely forbidden any one from talking to her,
no not so much as <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, who /aw himself very soon kept from it by a stronger
reason. For whether he had been too long without eating or sleeping, or diat
grief alone had been the cause of his indispofition, hc found himself within a
short time, in a sickness as desperate as that of the Princess, who not seeing him a-
bout her, was very inquisitivc to know where he was. The Physicians and c/swi-
lia, who feared she would asshst her self too much is she knew the truth , told her,
that J«/?/«/Ww having seen her quite out of danger, and being prest by an impor¬
tant affair which had befallen him at Getoua, was gone thither with an intent to
have returned back again before she should have taken notice of his departure,
But when they saw <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>'s sickness grow dangerous, and that the Princess
was as much troubled with hearing no news of him, as she could have been is
ssic had known the condition wherein hc was, they conceived it was sit, fearing
the sad event of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>'s malady, to acijuaint her with that which they had con¬
cealed from her,  sy£milia was she that charged her self with this heavy Commis*
sion, she carried the matter so dextrously, as she ingaged the Princess to speak of
Justtniano, and to marvell at his unexpested absence, and so unthought-of a silence.
It would not bc hard for me, answcrcd Emilia, with a sad countenance, totake
you out of this unquietness,  is I disi not fear to give you another greater than
that.  Whereupon the Princess, leaning with her right arm on the pislow, anj
with her left hand also drawing the curtain, sixed her look on «Amilia,m
after she had been a pretty while without speaking , as it were to divine
of that which she  should be acquainted  with, she said unto her in such»
sassiion, as shewed that she would bee obeyed ;  disguise not the truth unto
me, let me know my  niiserie as  great as it is ,  and tell me whether
Juslmiano be dead or unfaithfull;  for provided he be neither the one nor the
other, I stiall receive all other misfortunes with a great deal of indisscrencisc
The last cannot be, answcrcd ^y£milia, and heaven will not permit that the other
should arrive unto you.  But not to disguise the truth unto you , Justmano neve

<p>ting you with his, hath kept us from telling it to you; but finding it to continu^
longer than we thought it would,! held it my dutv to advertise you ofit. You ar^
a cruell creature, replyed the Princess, to conceal a diing from me,  which con¬
cernes my life. And what will <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> lay ofthe little care I had ofhim ? h is by
his order, answered i/smilia, that we have caried the business in this sort.  Isyou
will have me pardon you this fault, said the Princess, so order the matter, that
<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> may not be surprised when he shall see me.  t/^milta did what she could
then to keep her from getting out ofher bed, but neither her intreatics,  nor the
counseU ofthe Physicians, could alter her resolution. She calls her women, gets on
a night-gown, ancl causing her self to be held up by the armes, she goes to Justini-
«of; lodging, whom she found so changed, as he could hardly be known.  Assoon as
he saw her enter he indeavoured to salute her, but being unable to list up his head,
he was constrained tobe contented onely with turning his eys towards her,aHd say¬
ing to her with a seeble andjlanguisting voice,vvhich could not be heard by any but
her lels, for her women were a pretty way distant from thcni; At length , Madara,
fortune shall not separate us, and death is going to doe that, which I expested from
the cruelty ofthe former: Nevertheless I shall die contentedly, since I have still the
pleasure to see you, provided you will proraise to live for the love of me, and that
my meraory shall be dear unto you; For I find this advantage in death, that it keeps
me from being unfaithfull to you;It sinishes the combat oflove &amp; honorwhich could
not be vanquished in my soul; it raakcs nie satishe thera both; and to say all, it sepa-
rates us, but I do not forsake you;and I doe nothing in this occasion,but what I can¬
not chusc b'lt doiThe Princess having her chcekes all bedewed with tears, answered
him sighing,! am not yctso str from the grave,butthat Imay enter into it with yoUsl
is death should carry you thither ;  but isyou doe love me, you will strive to live.
Think not ofconserving your self,since you have no will to it,but ofconserving me,
and believe not that you can die without me.  I shave kt you see what grief
can do upon me; and I she uld have no need, either of poison,orpoignard,to
quit me of this life, for the loss of you alone woidd suffice for it.  Think not for
all thiii that I speak to you thus out ofthe fear to dk, it is an apprchension which
IS not my soul, and I doe not find death drcadfull but in the person beloved ; let me
not make tryall then ofso ssiarp a grief;  live, is k be pofsible, and contribute at

with again. As he would havesrocceded, onecameand advertised thePrincess
that Pjn^ having understood s)s his Friends sikness, was arived at the Castle, and
desired to see him The Physicians then approched to Justtnianoes bed side, and told
the Princess, that Is soe loved his life, she was to let him rest so quiet, and suffer
few to see him. Justtniano mtreated thera to kt him imbrace <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>\ who presently

<p>melancholy too; and their conversations, which weie wont to be full of nothi
but love and gallantery, were wholly now of the inconstancie of things; ofthen ^
cessity of dying, and of the little lastingness of the most assured pleasures.  Thev
could not mervail enough, that after so long an absence; after the escaping fromso
many misfortunes; after the drying up ofso many teares; and when it seemed that
nothing could oppose J«/'«/&lt;?ws?sj and Is.tbellaes content, they should find them-
selves more unhappy than before: they knew not for all that how far their unhappj.
ness extended, for their secret misfortunes were without doubt the greatestand
most sensible. And when as Jushnianoes sickness wac no longer dangerous, andthat
he had recovered hisjstrcngth, then it was that he was the most asshsted. For com-
ing to consider the little time he had remaining to make good hij word whichhe
had given <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; and that he was to quit <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, his grief became so great, as
had not his soul been already long accustometi to melancholy, he could not with'
out dyirighavc supported so grievous an apprchension. But a little while after he
had begun to goe out ofhis chamber,for to repair to that ofthe Princess, beingstill
very seeble and languissiing, hc said unto her withagrcat dcalofpain;Now, Ma.
dara, is the time wherein you are to dispofe of me,and to let meknow, whedier
I am to be wanting, cither to my love, or to my honor; live with insamy, ordic
with glory; satishe Soltman, or oblige him by the breaking ofmy word to ruine
ROt onely allthe Christians that are inhis Erapire, not onely all Europe, butyott
too, who is raore dear to niethan all the world bcside. I think. Madam, Ihaveal-
ready told your exccllencic, what \ ought to doc in such a grievous case, ad-
vise thenwhatyou will have me to doe; But I beseech you, make me no more
such  propofitions, as an excess of gencrofitic would render unjust; hearken to
nothing but reason inthis incounter; do not follow that which your alSestion
inspires you with; and remerabcr how I ought not to do any thing that is unwor¬
thy of the honor which I have to be beloved ofyou. Ihave told you already,re-
plyed the Princess, what power I have over my self in this occasion; and my pro¬
pofition seemes so just unto me, as I can find nothing that can destroy it; Forio
sine, you will satishe <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and you will satishe me also; I will doc nothinga-
gainst my honor, and I will satishe that which I ow to our affection: Resolvc tb
to raary nie and to part away,  and  never hope that I will change my deiign.
When you were at Censtantinople, did you believe that I had so little affection, las
I could easily resolve to receive a visit from you, for to be deprived astcrwardiof
your fight, it raay be for as long as live ? Ah / Madam, said justiniano interrupting
her, I had no other intent in parting from Consrantinople, than that of seeing you,
and of coming hither time enough to keep you from ssiuttingyourselfupina
Cloister. For understanding the resolution you had taken for it, upon the belies
you were in of my death, nothing could have been able to retain nic. What, saiJ
I, the incomparable IsabeUa shall make her self an eternall prisoner for thee, andit
fortune ever restores thee thy liberty, thou ssialt find her without hers! Ah! nOjnO)
rather doe any thing to hinder it. It was in thissort. Madam, that I reasoned
with my scls; and that,togcther with the hope of seeing you, raade me, withouirt"
amining the raatter, take my resolution. And I believe! have acconiplilhedtbit
which I propoundetl to my self; I have seen you,  Madam , and having let^*i

your word keepes you from it;  And for me, I proraise you is I cannot break my
chaines at Censtantinople, the newes ofmy death shall soon set you at liberty: so^

<p>store hn- to her health; That whereas he was resolved to perform this pilgrimage
unknown,and that this voyage could not be but long, he conjured him to take care
ofthe Princess and her affairs in his absence;  That in the mean time he should not
speak ofthis design, till he was gone;  and that then he should deliver his com-
t.k'ments to all hisFriends.  He told him moreover that he was obliged to steal a-
way from the Princess,  who would not have him make this voyage without her;
but beine loth she should be expofed to the incomraoditles ofso painfull a pilgri¬
mage, he had concluded to part without saying any thing to her, but onely leaving
her a letter. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> was strangely surprised with this discou rse; but seeing that Justi-
matio spoke seriously, he ofseieds how araorous soever hewas of Sophronia ) to ac¬
company him in this voyage ;  and the contestation which they had upon this sub-
iec^ had not ended sofoon, had not <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> told him thatthe neccssity ofhis as-
sai I cs required it to bcso; and that to render him a proof of his affection it would
sofsice he should suinilh him with meanes to get from <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> secretly. That will
not be hard for you to do, answered <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, for yesterday,when I arrived at the Port,
Iheard by chance ofa Srench barque, that is hound for Venice, which parts away
to morrow morning by the break of day, and no doubt will receive you, assoon as
you shall present your sels; so that you shall have no raore to doe,  but to get abord
her, and i will stay here to deliver your letter to the Princess. You will be but un¬
welcome to her for it, replyed <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> ,  who was not willing thac <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> should
be present at <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>es receiving of a newes , which would so much asshst her, for
fear left the constraint she would be in, should raore augment her grief. He prayed
him then not to see her, till hehad her permilsion for it. And whereas he deman¬
ded ofhim, who should wait on him in this voyage ? <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> answered him, that
one ofthe conditions ofhis vow was, to goe alone and unknown.  <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> opposed
this as much as pollibly he could , but vain was it for him to give any counsell to
his Friend; andj Hiliniano,taWm^ a part of the money which he had at <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, de¬
sired/o/-r.no kt him goe and write, and to get him to bed.  After that Vmahad
obeyed him, and that a\lJ:*stinianoes people were gone out ofhis chamber, except
it were oir, whom heh.id commanded to tarry in a withdrawing room till hc
called him, he leaned on a table, and looking on the paper whichhe found there ,
but without marking that which he looked on, hc palsed up and down in his mind
all his past misfortunes, all those which then he resented ,  and all those which he
forcLiw tor the suture; but ofall these deadly thoughts, the crueUest , and thchar-

him whether he would not go to bed, <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> made a sign to him to be gone,
seigning as though hc had somewhat els to write ; but it was indeed because his
grief was so great, as not being able to sleep, he thought that the agitation ofhis
body would ease that of his mind.  He past the rest of the night in walking up
and down, with so great an unquietness, as one is not able to describe that which
he resented.  Hc oftentimes opened the window to see whether it were day; and
though his greatest raisfortune was to part from <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, yet one would havesaid,
that he was impatient to be gone from thence; so much was his soul troubled,aiii
so much was his reason confounded.  In the mean ti:ne <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who had not slept
all the night, hearing <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> walk, sfor his chamber joyned to his) caused him¬
self to be made ready, and entred into his friends, just as the day began to break.
He would yet have disswaded him from this voyage, and once more desired him
to let him accompany hini,but Justtniano would by no means accept of so obliging
an ofser; so that Dorm seeing his friends resolution, was constrained to followhis
pleasure.  And whereas thessiadows of the night were almost quite dispersed by
the approach ofthe Sun, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> went and treated with the Master of the Srtuh
Barque for <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>'^ passage,who followed him to the Port, his face covered wiib
his cloak.  The Guards of the Town and Castle, who saw him go forssisoearlj,
marvelled not at it, for during the little time wherein he had been well at Mmio,
he had used to walk out at such hours to entertain his thoughts at the Sea-side. The
separation of these two friends had been with more tcnderness, is Justtniano bad
been less asshsted; but love so strongly pofsessed bis heart, as there was no more
room left there for friendship: so that when he came to imbrace <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, all that be
could say tohim, was to conjure him to have a care of the Princess.  He would
fain have disclosed the truth unto him, but/y^^s//4 having forbidden hiniluw
do, he durst not disobey her.  He got aboard then being scarce able to speak, and
suffering himselfto bcclispofed of by them that receiveil him, he abandoned him¬
self not so much to the Sea, as to his grief  The Pilot having order given him to
part, stcered his coursc for r^wc-s, and <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> standing up beheld Monaca,'^\^
his arms acrofe, and his eys full of tears, never marking <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who still niadeligns
of farev;ell to him from the Port, whereunto he leturned no shew of answer at all.

stedsastness of his resolution &gt; hehad resisted my intreatics, he was not moved Widi
my tears, he would not hearken to my sighs: With what stronger arms could I
hope to vanquilh him? but now is no time to reason of things done ; Justmiarof
is-sjne,andhow strong soever my love is, I may not forget mine honor; I can¬
not resolve to follow him as a forsaken one ; he separated himself from me that hc
might be generous; and that I may not swerve from vertue, I will not follow him.
But what say I, unfortunate as I am? is I know not where he is, how can I sollovr
him? Then suddenly holding her peace, and turning her self on the other side,
she sighed with so much violence, as it was impofliLle for her to speak.  A little
after for all that she sell to speaking again in this sort.  Ah, Justintana, ssaid she)
what a sensible outrage to my affection was this excess of love, that hath torn thcs
from me ! the tempess whereunto thou expofest thy self, is to be less feared, no
doubt, than thatwhich is raised in my soul.  Is it pofsible scontinued she) thac
thou couldst resolvc to resuse the having of me fora companion of thy miseries ?
Certainly thou didst not believe that my soul was strong enough ; and thou
thcughtcst peradventure that I did not intreat thee, but tobe denyed.  But I ara$
crucll Csaidshe)tomakcso ilaconstrustion ofthe meaning of the most generous
of men ; who deprives not himself of me, but for the love of me; who consider
none but my intei esls, and who loves not even his own honor, but for my proper

give tortune that advantage, to have more cruelty, than we have constancy: Let
us force her by our rescjlution to be weary of hurting us, since indeed there is no¬

<p>sess. Madam, when I knew that his voyage was absolutely necessary, seeing hc had
promised it, and that he did not steal away from you but to keep you from follow¬
ing him , I found that hc had reason for it, and I served him in his design; Yet was
it not till I had first ofsered to accorapany him, with allthe tcstimonies of affection
I could render him; and I hid added force to intrcaty, had hc not assured methat
he should not acconiplissi his vow, is hc went not alone and unknown.  But is it
pofsible that he is gone, said the Princess ? disguise not the truth unto nic, is he not
concealed in some place, totake order for his affairs? No, Madam, answered D,;.
rta, for he hath given me the charge ofthcra. Is that beso,  said thePrincess, who
wotdd fain have been at I iberty to shed teares, I hold it sit that you should goe and
publilhatCsTw^.i the true cause ofhis absense, for fear left so unexpested a depar¬
ture ihould cause bruites to run about, either to his disadvantage, orminc. But be¬
fore you go, tell me I pray you, whether <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> were asshsted indeed to quit me?
whether he said any thing to you to tell me ? and what were his last words ? They
were all for you, replyed <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>; for after he had imbraced me, all that he could ob¬
tain ofhis grief was no other than force enough to injoyn me to take care of you;
so that Madam, you may dispofe of me as you please , and believe that never any
cloignment begot so great anasshstion,as that which I saw in <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>: And knew
I not that he loves you more ardently,than ever person did love, I should hardly be¬
lieve that absence alone could cause so great a displcasure in his soul. The Princess
selt her self then so pressed with grief, as it was impofsible for her to retain her
teare.s, and seeing that she could not hide them from <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>,ihe said untohim wiping
her eyes; You may not think it strangc, that I am not more constant than y»/?/w,«,
since I am as unhappy as he; and that I yeeld not to him in affection.This weakness
justisics his, said <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and I profess he were unworthy of the honor which you do
him, ishe did not resent, ashc doth,  an absence that separates him from the onely
person which can make him happy .The princess and <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had some more such like
discourses, but at last she prayed him once again to return with all speed to Cww;
and for that effect she coramanded a Vessell should be made ready to part away pre¬
sently after dinner. The thing was executed accordingly, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> departed from her,
and by her direstion carried back with him a part of Justtniano''s train, the Princess
retaining the other in her service till the return of their Master. The next day V'-
ria arrived at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where he delivered the departure of Justintana to all his ac¬
quaintance. Every one received this luwes with mervail,but amongst others &gt; ibs
Count, jllphonso, the Marquis, and all the rest ofhis Friends,  were not ct)ntciwd
with merveling, they were extremely asshsted at it.  And being all met togctherat
Leonora's:, they talked a long time of this adventure; nowthopgh they doubtednot
bi t that it was in the manneras <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> recounted it, yet was not their reason forall
that satished. They found somthing that was strangc inthis voyage ; and condcm*
ned Por/rs tor suffering him to ^o. Leonora and Sophronia were not of that opinioH)
and maintained that he had done well, in not hindring him from accomplil"!"?
that which he had promised. For my part, said the Marquis, I do not condemnP«-
ria, for it may be isl had been in his place, I should have done the same thing; but'J
I had been in Jnstinianoes, whenas the Princess was sick, I am very sure that! shonW
not have sought for remedies sofar of;  and I would have chofen a pilgr'"'^S''
where she niight have easily followed me, to the end I might not have bceus^P^^^'

<p>Hat wc may not aggravate the grief of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, since it is not the last
that hc is to endure, let us land him at Venice, without describing his
unquietncs!,his sorrows, and his transports. As soon as hc was arrived
thcrc,he had no other design but of thinking of his departure from
thence: And whereas there was a great commerce from Venice to all the
Hands of the Archi-pelago, &amp; to Censtantinople it self, it was not long before he met
with a ship that was ready to set sayl for the Isle of Chio, so that it was not hard for
him to get passage in her upon pretext of some iraportant affairs, which hc said
he had with certain Jew/JI? Merchants of Pera. He irabarqued himself then with¬
out beinc' known, and too profperous in his Navigation, by reason of his cloign¬
ment from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, he arrived at this Hand; where he was not long before he
foundaVesiellthat was bound for jP^r^, and shipping himself in her, he left the
He of Mtttlene on the right hand, and on the left that of Lemnof, now called Stali-
ntena.  From thence he entred into the Strcight of Cj^/Z/^o//, where stand the two
Castlcs of Sestof and Abydus, which the Turki name the Dardamlli, and so came to
the Profantis , calkd Marmora, where he entred into the Bofphorus of Thrace, and
arrived at Pera, where he would not go on land till it was night, because of the
habit which he wore. As soon then as he came thither, he went to the Christian
Religious men that lived there,who were insinitely glad to see him again, for he
wasa mighty support unto thera. After their first coniplements, they told him
that his absence had occasioned some raischiefi in the Ottoman Family; but though
he pressed thcni much to express therasclvcs more clearly, they would not do it,
knowing hill well the extreme affection which Jushniano had always born to Mus¬
tapha, and tht e^cntv ous danger. And then a^ain <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had his mind so silled
with his own misfortunes, asheinsisted not much upon those of others.  From
thence he lent secretly to an Italian Slave, whora he had left at horac , to bring
him a Turkish Uahh: Which was done accordingly, and the next day in the even¬
ing hc entred into Constant mople, but so altered from that which he was wont to be,
ashc was hardly to be known.  As soon ashc was at his Palace, and that he had
received the complements ofall his Officers, of whora hc was exceedingly beloved,
hcwcnt tothe .9^r^^//o, although it was not the custom to enter there at soch
like hours: but Justtniano, whom henceforward we call <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> , remembrcd his
old privileges still.  ThzCapigis, which kept the gate, repulsed him somewhat
rudely,but as soon as they heard his voice, they craved pardon of him, and a Capi-
gihajstwtnt and advmised the grand Signior of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>s arrivall  He was at-

<p>him, could not have made him answer him that spake to him ; But the name of I
Bassa was not so soon come to his ear ,  as approching to this blcssed Messcnp^'
which brought him so pleasing a newes, he demanded of him, is it were u-
that hc was returned,  why he did not come in as he was wont to doc  with'
out  advertising  him  ofit? This demand  was a commandment to the C ^
pigibajst, who presently caused/^r^/j/'w to enter.  Assoon as he appeared Soltmi
charged everyone to withdraw, so that seeing himself at liberty, he inibraccdhim
with so much tenderness, that though his mind was wholly taken up with love and
his miseries, yet found he himself sensible ofso great an amity. Is it poUiblc  sajj
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> untohim, that I should receive this consolation in my misfortune? but
am I not to blame, continued he, to doubt that thou couldst not be generous e-
nough to come back again ? This doubt would questionless bc an injurie, replyed
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, had it not proceeded from the impatience of my return, rather than from
a distrurt ofthe promise I had raade to thy Highness. It is not without reason, siid
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> interrupting hini', that thou thinkest I have desired it, for assoon as thou
hadst abandoned me, victory, fortune, and vertu^abandoned me to.  I became at
once, both the most infortunate,  andthe raoft faulty of all men; and by the malice
of another I lost all that thy friendship had acquired me. I am no raore the Solimn,
whora thou thoughtest worthy of thy esteem, and to let thee know the deplorable
estate wherein thou findest me, I have no more to say to thcc,but that thou shalt never
understand from my mouth the milhaps that have befallen rat, or to say better, tbe
crimes which I have comraitted. However! will impart unto thcc,  that all dijt
which my armes had conquered in Persia, by thy valor andconduct, is revolted)
that Assyria and Mesopotamia are no longer under my power ;  that Ulama having
been wounded, his Troops have been defeated; that my whole army hath beenrou-
ted; that Tauris is lost; and that there is no more left me of all thy conquests, than
thebarercmerabranccofthv victories. But, ah, how happy should Ibc, is Ihad
also lost the nioity of mine Empire, and hadnot made my self unworthy of reign¬

would have answered him, he would not suffer it, but conjured him nottofpeak
at all to him, save onely to proraise that he would never hate him ,  whatsocvcrse
understood ofhis violences. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was so surprised to hear Soltman speak in diis
sort, as he scarce knew what to answer him. For whereas he had not reslefted niudi
on that which the Religious men of Pera had told him, imagining it bi
been some dissension-,  which the artifices of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had sown in die Of-
toman family ,  and none of his Officers having dared to acquaint himwitli
that which had past,  hc could not conceive how <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should bcso huhs.
He ans wercd him then, that he would give his own eyes the lye, even when they
should report unto him that he had committed a crime; that he was too well alTu'
red ofhis just ce and vertue to doubt of it; that great Princes raight sometira«
appear culpable to the eyes of their subjects,  and yet be innocent in their own
soules; and that  in sine, hc gave him the same word,which he had so exactly obser¬
ved, that he would alwaies have the fame thoughts for him, as hc had formerly bad.
He besought him withall not to conceal his  misfortunes from him; but ^&lt;'/'»*'
halfcorasortcd with the promise he madehim,  desired him not to press him W
it, and further obliged him by oath, not to speak of his crimes whenhedioP
come to know thein; and should onely believe that <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> was the causeoti"
his disafters. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, seeing how sensibly <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was touched, and perceiving
V. cli by his teares that this should be some lamentable adventure, durst not speal^}^
him more ofit; and though he had resolved to cast himself at his feet, wbenu™
he came before him, to demand his libcrtie of him, hoping he had thenw^"
in some sort accustomed to his absense ; yet held he not thata seasonablcunis)
a.id that he wasto  wait for another occasion. This thought redoubled his gs'"^^
yet .noie,so as that joyned to the melancholy  which his displea-sures and nil"*

I have told yol heretofore, I know this History very well. For besides the prin¬
cipall things, whichnoraanis ignorant of, I am privy to some particularities,
that are not known to allthe World, and that by the informationof a Slave,
who wa^ Sa.x-elanaes favouriteduring that time, but was afterwards turned out ot
the Seraglio by her herself, in a phantasticall humour, which makes her that ttjc
never loves any one thing long , and hath ever since lived with me. You shall
hear then that which you desire to know,aiid vvhich I have learned from this Slave,
and some others who were well acquainted therewith : But in regard you have
time enough to spare, I will intermix the History of her Father, which will not
beunusefull forthe intelligence of hers. <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> consenting to it caused Se¬
lixana to sit down by her, and Halima began to speak in these terms.
</p>
<p>Ihe History of Bajazet dnd Roxelana.
</p>
<p>THey which know the biith, breeding, and first inclinations of Roxelana, cin^^
not marvail at the last things which she hath done ; but contrarily they
would have reason to find it strange, is she had not undertaken any thing to sa¬
tishe her ambition, which is the onely passion that reigns in her soul, and for
which she sctsall therest on work; never making use of lovc,hatred, envy,and
jcalousie, but to satishe that.  Now to shew you that she hath drawn this inclina¬
tion from her Father, who brought, her up, and consirmed her in the opinion,
that greatness was the soveraign good of this life; and that to attain unto it,
vertue and honor were to be despised.  You arc to know, that In times past Roxe-
i/»&gt;»4« Father was in reasonable good favour with the Emperor Selini, Father to
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; and that after the death of Selim, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> also had agreat care of his
fortune: And certainly he had rendred him oneof the inoft considerable ofthis
Empire, had he had as much fidelity for his Master, as he had address for to please
him, cunning to conserve himself^ and dissimulation tocoilccal his vices from a
Prince vvho never had any, and who was never carried to any violence, but by
that of lovc.  But withall it raust be acknowledged, that this passion hath often
pcrvcrtedall his inclinations;  or at leastwise hath forced him to do things quite
contrary to the sense of hissoill, when as it is peaceable.  But to come again
to Bajazet sso was the Father of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> called) after he had by an hundred ar¬
tisices, which would bc too long to recite, arrived at that height about <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>,
which I have told you; and that there was not any charge whereunto he might
not have raised his hopes: It hapned for his ill fortune, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> senthini
to cany his direstions to Scutary, y\here the Beglierbei of NatoUa, who was
there at that time, coramkted to his conduct the fairest Slare th*t ever was sccn,
for to present her in his name to the SuUan, to theend that is he adjudged her

<p>worthy to be of the number of those that are destined to be his wortich  he should

without any other design at that time, than to do athing v?hi?h he'thought would
notbe disagrceable to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who was then in the prime slovsrct* of his age  and
one of the goodliest Princes of the World.  But vyneri the day of his departure
was come, and that the Beglierbei- of Natolia^ had put the Slave into his hinds
who, asccording tb the custom of those which are to be presented to the grand Sie-'
nior, was most gorgeously set forth, he was so miglitily taken with the sparkling
ofher eys, as is the Beglierbei, who was named Amurath, had nottdliiscarriaet he
might wel have known that he vvas too sensible ofthe attrasts of beauty,to be made
the conductor of a slave,that was able to subject the whole world; for a's I have heard
say,she wras as fair as Roxelana,vihoml have fomerimes seen on the terrace ofthe ;s-
raglto,which looks on theSea,where ordinarily she is, when publike rcjoycine's are
celebrated.But certes it niust be acknowledged, that Soltman is excusabk forlovin?
hcr,maugre her artifices,for indeed she is the greatest beauty that imagination it self
is able to conceive.  This Slave, of whom I speak, being then as fair asl describe
her to yoii, and being remitted unto the conduct of Baja-tet for so long a journey
he became so desperately in love with her, as notwithstanding the respest whidi
he owed to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and without fear of the chastisements ofan ofsended Prince,
he resolved to pofsess her, and not to render her unto him; howbeit he resisted so
dangerous a temptation for some time; but hi s wit^ that was but too sertile in in¬
ventions, having fornished himself with one, which he believed was good enough
to make his design seicceed without danger, hc thought of nothing els but of ex¬
ecuting it; and behold the way which hc took to bring himself to it.  This Slave
destined to the grand Signior, had been sold to Amurath, the Beglierbeiof Nidtk,
a little before ;4i&lt;?x.ss's arrivall, by ccitain Pirats, who not so much as knew of
whence she was, though by her pronunciation- it was gathered that she was! of
Persia: but whereas her language was not understood of any one, and that it ap¬
peared also how she understood nothing that was said to her, he judged that slie
Knew not they were carrying her to the grand Signior. So that using her with a
great deal of kindness during all the voyage, andtestysying much affection unto
her, she seemed to be comforted in her misery, at leastwise she shewed a more aiiid
countenance. He took exceeding care then, that she raight not understand by signsj
that vvhich she could not undcri^and otherways;and whereas he had been sent u^it
a secret exped'ition,he was but little accompanied, which served very much coolscs
the furthering of his design.  When as they approached to ConstantiuopUjhe took
his nieafores so right, that arriving too late, he sectned to be constrained to lie at
.in house that he had some four or sive miles from the City, where out of jealoulie
he ha:dcaused a young woman to be kept, whom he had exceedingly loved; i«t
indeed his intent was, not to enter into Coftstantinople, for a secret reason wMetH
.ini g&lt;!)ing to acqi&gt;aint you with.  He arrived then at this Countrcy-house, where¬
in nohe lived but that woman, an old Eunuch that looked to her, and two sh'"
that waited on her, alibis retinue being at his house in CanstantiMple, whereaceor'
ding to the permission of our Religion he had also two wives, with whom the iis
ptvioui Alicolasso was she named that abode thQsin the Country}couId never agi&lt;s'
She was beautifull, and ofa great spirit, but had such a disdainfull look, andso
ambitious an inclination, that there Was need of Ba]a^ets humour for one ta b*^'
had any lovc for her.  This conformity -^hich was between them did notsof a|l
that produce a reciprocall affection ; for howsoever he had endeavoured to mw^
himself be beloved of her for the space of a year and more that she had been irt W«
hands, yet could he never do it: vvhethcr it were that she had a naturall ajreriioj
for him, or diat having found two Other wives already in his house, which had*'
the authority over it, she could not indure to bc the last; so it Was, that she Co&lt;"

Ba]a:i^t, who Would not displease her, protested once again^that is hehad belaeved

their fidelity to me in other countries;  and for those which are come with nic
from Mat olia, they cannot so much as suspest that you arc not the Slave whom thev
have accompanied. For you are not ignorant, that assoon as one is destined to the
grand Signior, she is treated with&gt;ahigh respest, and hath a veil cast over her face
which she never takes ofs but when she is alone ; so that according to this order'
they will not wonder to see you goe out in the same sort; and whereas I purpose
to have you wear the same habk  which &gt;^w»r/ir/» gave to that Slave, they will
doubtless take you for her. And for language, you need not but seem as though you
did not understand ours, and make use ofyour naturall tongue, which is die same
thisSlavcs is.lt was in this sassiion thatBaiaz^t made an end of consirming ./^//«/4
in the hope of her good fortune. And to say truth,  it must be acknowledged that
thisdesignwas not ill imagined; for he was vcrv sure that vs//co/4 was not known
at all to the great men ofthe Port, so that isit should happen that ajiy oncofthem
should be present with Soltman, when he should present her unto him, that would
not discover him: Neither was he ignorant, that those which give Slaves to the
grand Signior, never see them again after they arc once entred into the Seraglio,
sothat is Amurath should chance to return unto Censtantinople within eight daies
after, he could not find out the truth; since the grand Signior thankinghim
for his fair Slave, would not describe her untohim. But hear the success of thii ad¬
venture; The resolution which I have told you of, being taken, ;/ij4-wscallcshis
old Eunuch; recommends fidelity and silence unto him ; and after he had charged
him never to speak ofthe change which he was going to see, he bids him present
Alicoles richest habit to the fair Slave, with all her jcwells, thereby to oblige lier
to part with that which she had brought from Natalia, giving her to undcrstard
by signcs,  that Ba]az,etwould pray her towear that which he then gave her die
next day. The matter was executed as hc desired ,  the Eunuch pcrformeshiscoDi-
million; and as soon as the day begins to break, Altcola attired herself with care
in the fair Slaves roab, forgot nothing ofwhat she thought would be advantagi¬
ous to her;and covering her face with a very thick vaH,vvhich reached down toher
wast, she sjssred not her self to bc sccn again, till she came before the grand Sig¬
nior. In the mean time Bajaz,et, before he parted, goes to the fair Slaves chamber,
labours to make her undcrstand, that he will see her again ssiortly, and that inthe
mean space, she may command all things there:  He calls the Slaves whichsened
Alicola, charges them to have the fame care of the person whom he leaves in their
hands, as they had had of her whom he carries away, and never to discover thts
which they had seen. He adds promises of recompence to his command, and threat-
nings of punissiment, is they were so inconsiderate as to reveal the secret whcrewiiii
they were trustcd. After this he causcth Alicola to mount into his chariot, where
for the more respest hc leaves her alone, and followes her on horseback, accomju*
nied by those which had made the voyage ofKatoUa with him, who never perceived
but that it was the Salve, for as I have already declared, seeing her ofthe same
stature, with the same clothes, and her face being covered , they could observe no
disserence. lii this manner .S&lt;jJ4J.rs arrives at &lt;rc»/?/j«ri»oi&gt;/r, goes direstly to the i''

Slave. But behold here, great Princess, the caprichiousoess of fortune, ^ho mock-
ins at our prudence, raakcs it oftentimes serve for our ruine.  At ^s &gt; ™r^.*?.^7
liman hath alwaies been very civill,  espccially with women,  he t&gt;cheld^/'r./^
with an attention that gave her hope ofthe victory: and whereas she underssood all
that ;*//&gt;»4«said, although she made shew that she tmderstood not the langiiage ,
she was ravished to hear <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> testifie that he was much obliged to the Beg^erbet
of Natalia, for having tendred him a present of that importance. And when as
this Prince gave over speaking, to consider her the better,  she imagined that tsof
silence was already an effect oflove.Sothat glorious ofthis conquest, and notable
to retain all her joy in her heart, she could not forbear looking on Bajaz&gt;et,as it were
to tell him that her victory was assured.  This hope proved forall that but ill
grounded, for though Alicola was fair, though she was very young, and that Soli^
man was so too, this Prince, which could never be vanquissicd, either in war, or in
sovc, but onely by gcntleness, selt not himself sensible of Alicolaes attrasts. He con¬
siders her, demands out ofwhat country she came into the hands of Amurath, com¬
mends her beauty, professeth that few desests cotdd bc found in it, but at length for
conclusion, he tells Ba}az,et, that stoutness did never please him but in war; and that
there was something in his heart which did so raightily resist ail the attrasts of
this Slave, as he could not be raoved with her. Alicola, surprised with this dis^
courscjcould not choofc but strokcher hand over her eyes to assure her countenance.
Baiaz,et on the other side, who had never thought that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> could have resuscd a
fair woman, and that feared nothing so much as to see his design sail, was so ama¬
zed, as he could hardly spesk. Howbcithe had a spirit, that left him not long in
unquietness; so that striving with himself, after he had answered to all the
questions which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had asked him, hc assured him that the journey had made
this Slave lose something of her beauty, and that is it pleased his Highness to see
her again a few days after, it may be he would be better satished ofher. Never a
whit, replyed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who thinking that Alicola understood not what he said, dis¬
guised none of his thoughts.  But, continued Baiaz^et, raay I dare, without lofing
the respest which I ow to thy Highness, demand of thcc what I shall write to Amw
y&lt;rt^, to let him know what the desests of her are whom he had chofen for thce^
Thou ssialt tell him, answered Solimm smiling, that she looks more like a souldier,
than a woman ; that she would bc sitter to conduct Amaz,ones to the wars, than to
live in a Seraglio ; that I should fear her valour would equall mine; that when
I should give her marks of my lovc, she would give me some of her courage j that
I hold her more capable to raake prisoners of war, than prisoners oflove', and that
in conchssion, finding something redoubtable in her eys, she hath pofsessed me
with more fear than desire.  I leave you to imagine what anguissi the arabitious
Alicola was in, it vvas such, as forgetting all things, she purposed twice or thrice to
have spoken; and had she not been retained by the thought,  that her undoing
would have been annexed to that of Baiaz,ets, is she disoovered the trick which
they played ;o/;w4», it is certain that she had given some marks of her resent¬
ment. And to raake an end of enraging her, aud Ba]az,et too, the grand Signior
told him, that to doe an ast of justicc in this incounter,  he would put him in
"^Mhon of Alicola, willing him to hold this present dear; for , continued he  in
this sort I testifie the esteem I raake  of Amuraths liberality; I recompence the care

<p>py as she descrves to be, since I bestow her on a man whom I love very much and
that without doubt hath some conformity of humour with her, is her physio'an ,
my do not deceive me.  How much Bajaz,et was asshsted with this discours"
you may easily conceive, but though this adventure grieved him extremely
was it nothing in comparison of Alicolaes rage, who by the changing of her
colour shewed but too much, that she had understood what the grand Signior had
sayd, is hehad marked it.  Ba]az.et having perceived her unquietness, beingdcx.
trous, cast himself at his feet to keep him from seeing her, under pretence of reni
dring hini thanks, and testisicd a great deal of joy fora thing that troubled him
exceedingly. But fearing that inthe end ^//W^s/grief would break forthjhe with-
drew as soon as pofsibly he could. Scarcely vvas he outof the Sultans chamber
but she would have  begun to cry out, and give some marks of her choler'
He speaks very gently to her, represents to her, that she would undo her sds jj
well as him, is by her imprudence she should give any notice of their impofture.
She holds her peace, but not so much to obey him, nor to conserve her self, ashc-
cause she was so sussocated with choler and rage, that she thought she should have
burst with it.  .P/»j^^&lt;?s re-mounts her into his Chariot, and without goin" to
his house at Conslantinople, he carries her back tothe same place from whence
she came.  And whereas hc rightly judged that she would not much care to con¬
ceal her self upon the way, he would take no body with him but he that drove
the Chariot.  As long as the journey lasted she was constrained to hold her
peace, because Ba]az.et, who foresaw that she would say strange things unto him,
rode thirty or sorty paces behind her ; but when she was arrived at her chamber,
and that Ba]ax.et had followed her, with an intent to pacisic her, what did she
not say against him ! against the fair Slave ! and against ;&lt;7//&gt;w^«! I might well
thinkCsayd she beholding him with contempt} that a Prince unjust enoughto
lovc thee, would be yet more not to love me; but I take heaven to witness, tnatl
will cease to be Alicola, or I will be revenged cither on him, or on thcc that is
sodear to him. Bajazjet seeing her in this sury, did what he could to appease her;
made as though he had an affection still toher, and would have perswaded her,
seeing Heaven would not let her ambition be satissicd, to live better with him
for the suture, than formerly she had done.  But she, that was not in an estate to
be wrought upon, answered him with somuch pride and insolcncc, as judging
it not sase for him to leave her at liberty in his house, hc quitted her in choler,
and comraanded his old Eunuch to ssiut her up, and not to let her go out ofher

unto her,  had rendred  more trastable.  The kind entertainment which Ihe
gave him was a comfort to him against all Alicolaes sury j and comraing at M to

<p>bestowing of his Slave on B.razet, and told sim some of the reasons, which laugh¬
ing he had willed should be written unto him :  now though Amurath had not
found an&gt; such haughty lock in the Slave which he had sent, yet did he not for
all thatsuspcst;^;^^sr of deceiving h ra. Some days after his return hc inquires
after him, and learns that he is lU.lomat Constantinopte^ but when the neccssity
of his attendance upon ;o//;«^//required it; and that the love of a Slave, vvhich
the grand Signior had given him  ab )Ut a year before^ pofsessed him in such
sort, as he was karce anyloncei visiblc for his friends.  This discourse touched
Amurath sensibly j for having had apprehensions for her, which raight be tcarmed
love, yet being at that time in no very good grace with the grand Signior, he
had surmounted them, out of a belies that he should raai&lt;c an agreeable present
to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>;  but now knowing that siie raadc up the felicity ot another, his first
sparckks began to kindle again.  He h.^.d without any trouble at all underssood
from <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>sone mouth, that 7&gt;.s;.tisr had this Slave, but liot that Ba']a?-^ct was
enamoured of her.  And this news so disquieted him, and moved him in such
sort,as without further delay, and without discovcring what design he had in
the visit which he purposed to make, hcset scrLh on his way toii .and ice B.i\t^et

fair Slave, who being much indilpofed by ixason of her great belly, had stayed
Eajazet nincor tendaycs  with her, sothat he had no knowledge of Atnuritths
return.  The house wherein he was at that time was pleasant enough;  in regard of
a fair Garden which opened into a Meadow, that had a little Rivcrrunnini^ tho¬
rough it.  This Meadow was inclosed with a wall, as well as the Garden, and the
River went in and out of the Meadow by certain grates, expresly made for that
purpose. Itwas in this delightfull place that Baiaz.et was walkine; v«jith the fair
Slave totake the air, whenas Amurath arrived there. As soon as the old Eunuch
knew whohc vvas, hc opened him the gate, sent to advertise his Master, and
would haye had Amurath enter into the house, the more coramodiously to abide
his comming; but finding the Court to his mind, he would needs w.dk therein

Slave lists up her vail, as her husband and she had before-hand agreed; for theyhad
been a good while advising as they, came along whether it were sit ssiat Amuth
should see her, or no. Bajaz^et, after such time as the fair Slavp had learned ^ur hn,
guage, had recounted unto her the artifice he hadused to pofsess her, the better, to
testisichis affection unto her. Accprding to the resolution they had taken,tlicn she
pulled up her vail,and said unto hini,that she remembred well he had redeemed her
from the Piratcsjthat she owed all her felicity to him;and that although she heldher
self thehapicst creature inthe world, yet was she grieved for his sake, that
her  desests  had  kept  her from  being agieeable to  the  grand  Sianioc.
This woman spoke thus with an apparent sincerity , lb well counterseited, 4; it
h.ad been hard not to have been deceived with it.  And that which rendred herso
dextrous vvas, for that she really loved Bajaz.et, vvho on his part made an hundred
complements to Amurath, assuring him that he vvas more  obliged to him, than
to Soltman, for the pofsession of aperson vvhich vvas insinitely deartohim; iinK
is he had not had the goodness to conside in him, by giving him the conduct ofthij
Slave, he had never been mafter ofthe happiness which now he injoyed.  Amttrm
answered to all these civilities with more liberty of mind, than he couldhavc
done, is hc had not seen the fair Slave : For finding her somewhat altered, byw.
son of her sickness and being with child, his renewing slames extinguillicd in a
moment, and tranquility re-cstablished it self in his soul.  Howbeit he marvelkd
with himself, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should find this woman to have a proud and haughty
look; forthough shehada great deal of majesty, yet was jt quite contrary to tijit
of-^//«//i; having very much sweetness and modeshe in the air ofher face. Butajh?
knew ; that one and the same thing is diversly judged of by the raoft part of tk
world, so he made no great reslexion thereupon; and the sole unquietness about
the note} which had been cast him, could then trouble him. And whereas he had no
more to do in that place,  seeing the fair Slave touched his heart no longer, he
shortned his visit, and after he had been two hourcs in the haU , talking of therca-
sons which had brought him back to the Port, he took leave of the fair Slave; for
as for Bajaz,ets whereas he had purposed to return that day to the City, he thought
he should bcuncivill in not going along mith Amurath, who did his iittcrmostto
keep him from it; judging rightly that is they went together, he should qetreid
his note till he came to Censtantinople; but at length hc was fain to give \vay toiit-
jaz.ets importunate civility. As they were in the Court ready to depart, ^^t^W
stept in a litlc to say somthing to the fair Slave ,  during the which Armrath stood
looking on the window, from whence the note had beenthrowen him. And vl«s''
as Alicola was not gone from it, she changed her first resolution, listed up thegnw,
and shewing her self openly, she joyned the charmes of her beauty to her rcqucsts;
for isyou have observed it, all our houses are so low, that shc was not far d'st^"'
from him. After she had let herself been sccn a while, she salutcd Amurath nitinU
sassiion of the Country;  and with a suppliant behaviour seemed to demand suc¬
cour ofhim in some misfortune that was befallen her.  Amt:rath finding htntst
beautifull, made sign to her, that he would do what she would have him, notbeiog
able for all that to comprehend ought in this adventure. But at last Bai]az.tt caiBSj
and going away together, they arrived atConstantinople just as it was night, sc-**
z,et waited on Amuraththome, where having left him,  he gave him the libeityw
satishe his impatience. He was no sooner alone then but he opened JlicoUes noiit
which in few woids recounted to him all Bajaz^ets impoAure ; his lovc tothe

ly contented with this coraraission,part; speedily from the Beraglio to do things ne¬
cesfary for the execution ofhis design; whkh could not be so secret, but ^^-^^ss was
advertised, that hewas preparing of a chariot to return to his house.  l»elirlt
thought that came into his raind was, that Amurath was become inaraoured ot the
fair Slavc,and that he would take her away by force. He departed then m all polhble
hast, with an intent to remove the fair Slave from the house, and it raay beto rid
himselt of Altcola, not knowing in so crofs an adventure,iu what place to put her
for his own security.Novv though he vvas more diligent than Amurath, and that by
a ncaier and a by-way he arrived there a little before him , yet could he not exect'te
all that he thought to have done; for Amurath, who had not stayed for his chariot,
was gone away with twelve armed men, sothat he arrived at Ba]az,ets house, a lit¬
tle after he was entred into the fair Slaves charaber, whom he found still in her
bed: so that prclsing her to make her self ready with all speed,  and recounting un¬
to her in few words the occasion of his fear, hc thought of nothing but of geting
her from thence, and earring her to Conslantinople, where he believed Amurath durst
not enterprise such a like violence.  But he was very much surprised, when as
his Eunuch came and told him that Amurath, who knew not that ;4i&lt;!j*sr was
there, required to enter in the behalf ofthe grand Signior; that hc  cspyed
through a chink of the door that he was accompanied with armed men; and
that to have meanesto advertise him ofit, hehad told him thathe went to setch
the kcies to open him the gate.  Ba]at.et began then to change his opinion ■,
for he was sure that Amurath durst not make use of the Sultans name, is hehad
not been authorised for it.Bchold him then in the belies that he was discovered;&amp;
the better to clear himself therein, he would have entred into Alicolaes cham¬
ber, whom peradventure he would have killed , but he found that she had ssiut it.
For when she saw thesright the old Eunuch was in, and that she doubted not but
her note would produce some violence, she and her suborned slave had barrica-
doed their door as much as pofsibly they could; foreseeing Well that Bajaz,et would
turn all his sury upon her ; as indeed, he did what hc could to have broken up
the door; but seeing hc could not prevail, and fearing left Amurath should enter,
he took the fair Slave, who had made her self ready in hast, crost thorough the
Garden, to get out at a back Gate, without knowing as then which way to sly;

<p>and the better t^p amuse Amurath is he should follow them, they shut bofsi h
^ate of the garden, and that of the meadow after thera.  On the other side V
murath who would  attend no longer, caused the outward gicc to be broke'n o"
pen; and scarcely had Bajaxjet ssiut that of the Garden, when as he was in the house'
Never was there a greater diforder seen ; the fair Slave was all in tears, and sciring
she should not be able to go, by reason of her .great belly and her mdispofitio„
she besought Ba^a^^et to abandon her, and to think of nothing but saving himselt'
But unwilling so to do, he laboured to give her some hope, and to go as sast
as she could, untill they might get up both on a horse, which the Have that was
faithfull untohim, was bringing them.  In the mean time ^*«/^ cryed out that
they would murther her, tothe end that Amurath hearing her cryes, raightthc
quicklier enter into the house, and more easily follow them that were sled.  But
at lask Amurath being got in, and Altcola having opened him her chamber door
acquainted him, how from her window that opened upon the Garden, she had seen
Baiaz^t cscape out of a back-gate; and that it were good he should bc pursued
with all speed. Amurath presently enjoyns some of his men to do sc^; and charts
them, is they met with him, not to kill him, howsoever he desended himself They
do asthey are commanded, but finding the gates ssiut, they were a long time be¬
fore they could break them open; so that when they were without any obshcle
they were not in case so easily to find that which they sought for. They separated
themselves, outof the hope to meet with him the sooner, and omitted nothing
of whatsoever they beleeved might be of usefor this fearch. Two of them indeed
incountred the slave which had followed them, and that was resolved not to re
enter into her Masters house ; howbeit she served but to turn them out ofthe way,
which undoubtedly had brought them to those sugitives. For not knowing that
she belonged to 'Baiaz.et, they asked of her isshe had n^t seen a raan carrying; away
a woman t She nothing daunted told them, that they had past by her a little be*
fore; that leaving the ordinary road they had taken on the right hand over the
sields.  This slave said thus unto them in such an ingenuous manner, as theybt-
leevcdher ; so that abandoning a way which would have made them incounter
what they sought for, they took another which led thera far from it.  After so
vain a labor, seeing the night approach, without having any hope to perform that
which had been commanded thera, they returned to Amurath, who in giving li¬
berty to the arabitious yl//W4, was constrained to lose his own, such power had
the charms of this woman over his soul.  For whereas she had rcmembrcdhow
disadvantageous her proud humour had been toher, at such time as she appeared
before <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, she constrained her inclination, and adding artifice to her beauty,
she wasso pleas\n^to Amurath, as hc could not resist her.  She related to him at
length all that she had written to him in bries, and calling him her Deliverer, with
her eyes full of tears, she aggravated all the rigors which Sajaz,et had used towards
her, after that the fair Slave was in his hands.  She was caresul! to let him know,
that Baiaz,et could never surmount her, either with submissions or menaces; and
casting her self at Amuraths feet, to implore his protestion to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, left he
should punissi herfor being an astor in the suppofition that was made him, Ihe
moved his heart to pitty; and he hiniself beleeving that this was nothins; but
compassion, found it afterwards to be love.  But at last Amurath seeing by the re¬
turn of his people that hehad no more to do in that place, and that his Chariot
was arrived a good while before, he placed jilicoU in it, together with the slave
that had been faithfull unto her ; and though it was exceeding late, yet they set
forth on their way towards Constatttinople. Amurath caused also the old Eunch tobe
brought along, that hc might be made to consirm Alicolaes discourse.  When they
had marched a pretty while, the night surprised them , which was so obkurc and
dark sfor neither Moon nor starrcs were to be seen ) as he that drove the chariot,
having never been at this place before, lost his way in such sort, as after he had tra¬
velled half the night in hope to find it again, he was constrained to send one to his
Master to advertise hiin ofthe fault he had committed. Amurath seeing the Cha¬

ready to whiten the clouds a littk on the Sun-risin2 side, when they heard the
II ampling of an horse, and suddenly after the cry and sall of a woman.  Amurath
being inssantly advertised thereof, thought it mightbe the fair Slave ; they went
then afoot to that part where they had heard this voyce, with as little noisc as
poflibly they could make; it was not long before they heard a man speak, without
distinstly understanding what hc said.  But at length approaching ncerer to th«n,
they heard how that woman conjured him to abandon her, and to think of nothing
but his own safety; how he saw well that it was heavens pleasure she Ihould bc cast
away, andthat it was irapofsible for him to save her.  At the same instant that

made sb great a noise, that ^wxr^sA, who thought it was not sit to give Bajaz^et
swhom he knew by his voice) any leasure to put himself in desence, advanced for¬

vliat prest him to yeeld himself: And whereas hc knew not certainly whether
ihesc were ^w*ir4s/»jnicnor no,hetold thera that they did not know him, and
that assiiredly they were raistaken.  But when he heard AmtvMh bid the fair Slave
notbe afraid, for that she should have no harm, his despair was then so extreme,
as leaving those from whora he desended himself, he made direstly towards Amu*
rath; but before he could arrive at him, hewas seized upon behind by those three
against whora he had sought, who presently took his Scymitarfrom him.  Behold
him then in the power of hisenemie, as well as the fair Slave : for thinking to
do the hest for their safety, they hadhid therasclvcs most part of the day in a wood,

helped to deceive him.  As for the fair Slave, the fear alone of lolmg Ba\iii:t
made her shed tears: But at length, they arrived all before Soltman.  And where¬
as none of them durst somuch as list up their eys, it was the Sultans pleasure they
should speak separately; and first he commanded Eajax,et to render an account of
his doings. Whereupon salling down on his knees, he spake much after this man¬
ner ; for I think that I have heard bim repeat it over above an hundred times. As
love only hath been the cause of my crime, so love only must also be my desence;
for, my Lordssaid he unto him) I know but too well, that reason and justice are ab¬
solutely against me. I have contemned the counsell of the first, and I have not been
afraid of the second j I have betrayed a Prince, who is not only my lawfull Prince;
who is not only the greatest Prince of the World ; but who, for the greater ag¬
gravating of my fault, is a Prince which hath alwaies loved me, and whose good¬
ness hath beenso great towards me, as it hath scarce set any bounds to my hopes.
Now is after sogrcat a crime, it is requisite to consider therest which I have com¬
mitted,  I have betrayed a man that consided in me; Ihave abandoned a woman
whom I had loved long, and have made her pay very dearly for the testimonics
ofmy affection, with unheard-of rigour ; aud to say all, I have abused the sim¬
plicity of a Slave which was destined to thee, and depriving her by my auiEceJ
of the honour of being thine, I have wronged her raore than all the rest.  In sine,
my Lord, which way soever I turnme, I see the marks of my crime; butisnot?
withstanding it would please thy Highness to consider by what violence my rea¬

onof a man whose imagination hath been troubled with melancholy, why Ml
we not have it of a man whom loVe hath bereaved of his understanding? What
imports it whether the cause of his solly be interior, or whether it proceeds from
without ^ so it is, that I have not sailed, till love had seduced my reason; till! W
lost my judgement, till my will was no longer in mine own power; tillaUmy

crinie.But the misery vvherein i find my self is so great,as I cannot think to save him
this way, but in rendring him the more faulty. I must say then, my Lord, tjiat when
Amurath put me into his hands, I knew not that I was destined to thy Highness;
he conducted me to his house, and retained nie there without ever suffering me to
understand so much;  and having rendred me all the testiraonies oflove and re¬
spest ; which I could have desired from a man that had not had me in his power ,
\ acknowledge that his affection moved me; that I gave him mine; and that inthe
wretched condition, whereunto fortune hath reduced me , I esteem my self happy,
tobehis wise, I acknowledge also, my Lord, thathe hath consessed his crime unco
me since; but whereas this crime was a testimony of the affection he bore me, and
that our mariage had made me unworthy of being able to repair his fault , by
restoring me into thy hands, would not thy Highness have blamed me for coming
to accuse my husband ofa seult, which he hath not committed but out ofan exce^
of love ? After this, my Lord, I do not think thy Highness can doubt of mine in¬
nocencie; and not doubting of it,  I dare hope that thou wilt not punissi me more
cruelly than Ba]az.et, by letting me live, and putting him to death ;  and that con¬
trarily thou will have the goodness to grant me his pardon. For, my Lord, what
reason would there be, that I who am absolutely innocent, should have the same
destiny that the guilty have &gt; Is k not enough'that fortune hath forcibly carried
me from out ofthe armes ofmy parents, to put me into the hands of Pirats? that
I have been sold for a- Slave; andto say all, that she hath deprived me ofthe

But to carry presumption as far as it can goe, or to say better/he considence whidi'

theless thy Highness is otherwise resolved, grant me at leastwise the grace that'll
may die with Baiaz.et.The fair Slave mollisied the heart of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>-.and as hee wic
about to have spoken, Amurath made hast to say to him; I know very well that I am
the accuser of these ofsenders, and that in some sort too I am a party with them • so
that, my Lord, I am to be their descndor also in this occasion , and doe most hiim-
bly beseech thy Highness to pardon them : It is an ast worthy of .Se/iw^zw not tobe
revenged on them that arc in his power; and the true felicity of Kings is with.
out doubt to raake up that oftheir subjects. It will be long of none but thy self then
is thou be not satished, in rendering us all four happy. For, my Lord, isthoiih'
vest the pofsession ofthe fair Slave to Bajaz^et, he will certainly esteem himselfhap-
py, as well as she. As for me, my Lord, is the purpose which I had to tender !thee
a presentjthati thought would be agreeable to thee, merits any recompence, asthy
highness hath bceiie pleased to assure me, I beg the pardon and pofsession of Alicoht
who by whati have noted in her discourse, is raore sensible of ambition than love;
so that injoyingrby thy bounty, a rank considerable enough about thee, sbe will
have means to be satished, and I too ; seeing I am constrained to acknowkd-e^that
my opinion is not like unto thine, for the beauty of Altcola ; and that I have been
a whole day the most amorous ofall men.  Salman seeing him about to proceed,
would not permit him, and reaching his hand to him smiling, I am glad s saidhe.
unto him) that we are not ofthe fame opinion for beauty, since thereby I am en¬
abled to satishe thee.  And for thee, said he to Ba]az.et, I rerait the ofsence thou halt
comraitted against nie; but know, that is Love combatted for thee in thy dis¬
course, the goodwill which I have alwaies born  thee hath far better dciended
thee in my heart.Then turning him to the fair Slave, hc commended her generosity,
and the affection which shee caxriedto Ba]ar..ct, alsuring her that he vvould never
trouble her rest.  As for Altcola, he told her, that to render the conquest,which she
had obtained, raore wohhy ofher, and more capable of contenting her, he would
make Amurath sy:and visier.  After this ihe said to Baiaz,et, hee was forry thatfor
the preservation ofhis authority, and for example sake, hee could not lethimllve
at Constantinople; but in regard it was impoflible the matter should not be divulged
by those who had accompanied Amurath, he must needs resolve to absent himlels
from the Port, for fear least this importunity should give others the boldnessto
commit the like, or greater faults than this.  That he did not condemn himto^o
out ofthe territories ofhis Dominion, but he would have him abide in one ofthe
Islands ofthe Achipelago, and there lead  a private and particular life.  To rqw-
sent unto you the joy ofthese four persons, would be an impofsiblc thing, however
so it was,that after they had rendered a thousand thanks to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>,andt\\at hehad
made them all recount the severall thoughts which they had had during t'l-

he was troubled with a continuasl remorse for what he had done, and anguissi
of mind that never  abandoned him ; for the raore he sought how to re¬
establissi himself, the  kss likelyhood he saw for it.  In the mean time the
littk Raxelana grew  up stisl, and shee raight bee about four yeares old,
when as Bajaz^et considering her upon a day, in the raidst of a great asserably,
where every one admired her springing beauty, and took pleasure in beholding
her; he heard one ask her what she would raoft desire in the world? she straight an¬
swcrcd without sticking at it, that it should be to raake her father rich and power-
full.  This was no sooner spoken by her, but Bajaz^et coraniing as It were out ofa
dead sleep, took a resolution, which I will relate unto you.  And consider I pray
you, how a weak beginning hath many times a long and dangerous consequence s
the little <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> was not more beautifull that day than at other times, howbeit
her fathers anguissi had been so great, as one would have thought he had never
taken notice that she was the fairest and wittiest child that ever had been seen; for
as soon as he had opened his eyes, and ssiat the acclamations which were given to
<hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had raade him perceive she was aMaster-piece of Nature, his heaviness
diniinissicd,and al his industry and care was no onger,but to endeavour to make her
wit as dextrous as her beauty wascharming.  Andtruly it was not hard to bring
her to what he desired; for as she had all the beauty ofher raother, sohad ssic
all the inclinations of her father.  And whereas they are persestly discerncd in
that innocent age, she that acquainted me with all these things, and that lived
with her both at thattime, and afterwards in the Seraglio, hathtoldme, that in
her tcndrest insancy, she had an imperious spirit, which could not endure to be
controlled by any body. Sae would alwaies be mistris of all the other little girles
that played with her; and her very play was dextrous still, andmalitious.  She
told me surdicr, that she was never sccn to weep, nor ask for pardon, neither did
ever person tesl a lye with raore considence.  She was curious to know all things,
and one of her greatest delights was to see beasts fight together.  This cruesl hu¬
mour vvas for all thatso well concealed, by the gcntleness of her look, as she
seemed to be the raoft amiable child that ever was beheld.  I leave you to judge,

<p>onr, did not make up an accomplissicd work.  He did notteach her to be vem
but onely to bc carefull to seem so.  In her youngcst years he l^oured to sra"^^
her toagracefull behaviour, and to entertain her alwaies with great hopes-  ^
promise her that one day she should be rich,and that she should have stately Pala'ce*^
to the end that he might insinuate into her betimes, that Greatness was thesev ^*
raign good : and that so desiring it with passion,she might be the more easily carded*
afterwards to do all things necessary for the acquiring of it.  WScn shehad at
tained to the age of eleven or twelve years, and that she had a forward wit, able to
apprehend his maxims, he began to speak more plainly to her, and to tell her that
being born with no common beauty, she was to make herself an extraordinary
fortune.  But as it was the ofsice of the eyes to obtain conquests, so it was the ofl
sice of the wit to conserve them. That all things which are gained by violence, arc
to be retained by address.  That it was time for her to learn to kno\^ her
scis, and to know others; to the end that being accustomed to apply her mind to the
divers humors ofthose she convcrsed with, she raight one day be capable oV the.
roughly disguising her though t8:that she was not to live so out of abase compliance
and with no other design than to please ; but only to attain to some thing that was
great. With such like discourses as these did Bajaz^et instrust Ro.xelana, whose incli-
nations were but too much carried todissimuIation.Neverthelessitistrue,thatthese
dangerous lessons, whichshe willingly learned, were combated by the wildom of
her mother, whora I have alwayes called the fair Slave, because my nicmoiy could
not give you her name.  This woman was good and vertuous, and did all that
she could to make <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> reserable her, as well in the qualities of the soul, as in
the seatures of the face : which Ba]az,et perceiving, and having in vain forbidden
her to reprehend her daughter for her bad conditions, besell into such a hatred of
her, as he could not indure her; and having looked upon her in former times
as the objest of his love, heconsideredher no longer but as an obstacle of his am¬
bition. But to keep her from dcstroying that whichhe had established in the young
heart of Roxelana, he thought it would be requisite to make her hate her.  And
to that end, he dextrously perswaded her, that her raother standing yet upon her
beauty, was jealous of seeing hers surpass it; that her reproving her, was an clsest
rather of hatred than affection, and that therefore she should beware of hearkning
to her Remonstrances; there needed no more to stisle all the motions of Nature in
so depraved a spirit, and to carry her to insolency.  Roxelana, to obey her father,
was to do no more than follow her own humour, but to content her mother, die
was to fight with all her inclinations.  The first was the easier, and made her hope
ihatit would produce great things;  andthe other being harder, and withouto-
ther recompence , than that which gives us the satissaction to d-o what we ought;
she had not much adoe to resolvc upon the despising of vertue, and inibracing of
vice.  Behold her then abandoned toheV own sense, and to the evill counsells of
Ba]az.et, and the fair Slave almost reduced to be a Slave to her daughter, who with¬
in a while used her so cruelly, that she sell sick with grief upon it.  Now to make
a tryall of what she could do in dissimulation, as long as there was any company
with her mother, she secmed respestfull, asscstionate, and obedient; but as soonn
they were gone, she mock .d openly at her goodness, and with an hundred bittct
jeers, struck a dagger into the heart of her that had given her life.  This prudj"
woman was for all that so good as not to publissi the cruelty of her daughter, vwo
in the oi^inion of all them which saw her, was as vertuous as beautifull.  ;,v0]
seeing so fair a beginning in Roxelana, caressed her extraordinarily, and by this
criicH pr.xe.ding still advanced the death of her, whora he had loved so niucB
before.  At last, that deadly moment, wherein she was to leave this life, being ar¬
rived., this infortunate one called to her the Slave, who hath recounted all theie
thing? unto r.e, and that had wit and some vertue, and secretly commanded hss
not vo,:b..nd m her daughter after her death, because it might happen that thijnrtt
heat or yo di being over, she raight peradventure be capable of following t^e

hand,Thou seest then, my dear child, said he unto her, that love did heretofore un¬
do my fortune, and that a Slave which I took from the grand Signior, took from

stiall restore n^c into grace vvith <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>.  And not to conceal my thoughts from
thee, I purpose to present and give thee to the Grand Signior, leaving the rest to
fortune, and thy addrck.  Ik\iow that this Prince being advanced in age, is be¬

Princes of the world. Is thou makest good use of the lessons which I have given
tliee, continued he, and of those which I will give thee, thou mayest become Sul¬
tana, and crown the rest of my days both with honor and wealth. Ba']az.et stopping
here, K&lt;7.vs/rs«&lt;«an[wered him according to his desire, and assured him, that isshe
could be received into the Seraglio, shc would raake no doubt of the rest: and for
a conclusion, sheso prest him to part away, that in a little after having found out a
Vessell which was bound for Constantinople, he irabarqued himself in her with his
daughter, and the slave to whom her mother had rccoranicnded her ; who had so
insinuated her self into her affection, as she had often believed her in things which
Gontraried her inclinations. At length they arrived at Constantinople, and went to
the house of one of ^rsj^^irr/antient friend?, where the day being come, in which
he purposed to prelent Boxelana, her slave helped to dress and set her forth, being
glad to see her going out ofthe hands of Ba]az,et, forthat she was perswaded there
coald be no place in the world where she would not be better than with him.  But
whereas the habit of the women of the Isle of Chto is raore advantagious than ours,
it was in this sassiion that she was attired ; and I have heard it said, that one could
not see any thing more magnificent, or more beautistsll than she was in that estate.

also an apron of cloath of gold, a little ssiorter than her petticoat, and which wa
tyed behind with two silvcr strings, whereat hung two tassclls of gold.  She had
upon her shoulder?, as it were to sasten on the sleeves ofher wastcoat, a ercac
many of ribbands of divers colours, and athwart her neck a scars of Tissany hang¬
ing baudrikewise, and closed together with Diamonds, in such sort as all her neck
was seen, aboutthe which she had a chain of Pearl, with a little jewell of Eme¬
raulds.  The attire of her head was of cloath of silver, plaited with a great dealof
address, and inriched all over with Pearls and Diamonds; This head-tire was of
a round form, and standing up very high behind; and to hold it on the better,
she had according to the use of the Countrey a little gold sillet with which it was
made sast behind on her neck, where hung two tassclls of the same in the midst of
a great number of knots of severall colours, which sell carelesly updn her shoul-
ders. And on the cop of her forehead, descending a little into a peak, she had a
dressing of Cobweb Lawn streaked with gold,which also was sastned behind,leavine
her hair hanging down in curls on either side of her cheeks.  In this manner was
<hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> attired; but before hc led her to the Seraglio, Bojazjet would give her his
last instrustions; wherefore he took her asidc, and willing her to hearken attentive¬
ly unto him, he spake to her much after this sort; for the slave, who hath toldme
asl thcsc things, over-heard him without his perceiving it.  It is time, my daugh¬
ter, for me to discover unto you the means whereby you may arrive at the point
which I desire.  I have indeed said something unto you at severall times, but now
I am resolved to hide no part of a Science sirom you, on which I have a long while
meditated.  Before I shew you then the ways you are to hold, I raust propound un¬
to you the term of your pretensions, which ought not to be only to please the
Grand Signior; to make him in love with you; to bc a Sultana , as many othersj
but indeed to become his wise.  For although none of the Of Aww/iw Emperors since
;&lt;ijitaiss the first hath been maryed, because they would not ssiare their power; yet
ought not this obstacle smother your desires, but contrarily it ought to inslame
them the more.  You perceive then, continued he, that in so great a design, diere
is need of a great deal of prudence to carry one well unto it.  The gencrall pre¬
cept which I will givreyou upon your entring into the Seraglio, is, never to do,
nor to say any thing, which tends not to this design, either direstly, or indircstljr,
and to remember, that all the ways which may conduct us whither we wouldgo,
are permitted us by true reason.  Never amuse your self then in consulting, whe¬
ther that which you do bc just; but indeed whether it be advantagious for you.
Consider not, whether you hurt any, but whether that which you do may serve
your turn.  For in sine, you go to a place where you will meet with cnvyers, and
enemies, and no sooner shall <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> be striken in love with your beauty, but you
will be hated of all the Sultanaes.  Prepare your self then to know how to make
a right use of all these things; andso do, that the hate which is born you may
destroy them, who would destroy you. Never undertake to be revenged, but when
you can absolutely do it; yea, and is it be pofsible, revenge your self so as you
may not bee suspested for it.  Moreover, Alicolaes adventure makes niers*
membdr, that Sobmau is pleased with modesty, wherefore so carry your iss)
as it may be very much seen in all your actions; and beware of trusting a"?
body. Regard every one as your enemy, caress all your sellows, and love non«
of them ; make not their desests known to Solimn, but in seeraing to cxcuse theni;
be carefull  to let him  understand by  some  other  the malice  which tti^
bear  you ;  bee liberall to them that are about the Grand Signior ; d«
very submissive and pleasing to him, untill you know that you ^rc abso u
Mistris of his heart; for in sine, you must serve, that you may reign; but then,
you must change yoursiile, and by some artifice, whkh you may invent accorams

rhcnce and that he had not been seen in sixteen years at Censtaittmople, he did not
fear he should be named to Salman.  The matter sell out ashc desired ; and the
crand Signior, very luckily for his design, hapned tobe in the bell humour ofthe
world, by reason hehad received newsof a great Victory which he had obtained
over the Christians.  Wherefore he presently comraanded, that this slave, and he
■which brought her, should enter. V^hen Ba]az,et first appeared, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>knewhxrrx.
not  whether k were for that time had altered him, or that his eyes and heart
were so sixed on the beauty of Roxelana, ashc did not consider him. But as soon
as Ba^a^et had cast himsess at his feet, and that he had begun to speak, the tone of
his voyce made him call himtomind: He did not interrupt him for all that, but
looking still on Roxelana, hchcarkncdto Bajaz^et, without turning his head to¬
wards him.  <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> on her side appcancd with so modest a Majesty, andso
charming a sweetness, asit had been very hard to discern the motions of her soul
in her eyes, and not to bc strucken in loVe with such powerfull attrasts.  But
whilst <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> takes in so sweet and so deadly poyson, ^^j^sces spake to him in these
terms; I know very wcll,my Lord, saidhe untohim, thatit is a crime in me to
present niy self before thee, after I have been banished; and that is thou bcestnot
the most indulgent Prince of the World, thou wilt not permit meto give thee
reasons for it, which may cxcuse me.  But since thy silence seems to accord me
so much, I shall let thee know, my Lord, that this young Slave whom thou seest
here, and whom Ipresenttothy Highness as a thing chat appertains unto thee,
is the daughter of that fair Slave whom I presumed to retain for my self, though
she were destined to thee. Rejest her not, my Lord, since though she be the daugh¬
ter ofan ofsendor,yet is she so too of a woraan that belonged'unto thee,and whose
vertue hath passed into her as well as her beauty.  In sine, it is a sacrisice, which
I ofser up unto thee, to expiate the crime which heretofore I committed, and that
also which at this present I commit. Consider, I beseech thee, that having robbed
thee of one slave, it is but just that I should render thee another ; but with this
disserence, that the former was thy slave by violence, and that this same isavo-

hath been alwaies conserved as an ofsering, whereof the purity ought to deface
the blackiiess of my faults. But is nevertheless thoujudgest her unworthy of this
honour, I am mofi ready to give thee both her life and nrlnc own, rather than re¬
solve to live any longer abseht from thy service, and to spend the remainder of

<p>z,et had made qn end of speaking , he cryed out, reaching forth his hand to him
O happy was that thest of thine, since it was the cause of thy now rendring me
an inestimable treasure! For I profess unto thee, that I never saw any thine so
beautifull as thy present. Then turning him to <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> ; and for thee, fair maid
sayd he unto her, be assured that in lofing a father, thou findest a lover; andthat
in consideration of thee alone, I will give Bajaz^et his liberty again, and restore
him to all his former charges and honours.  <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> made no other answer
thereunto, than with a profound respest ; but Bajaz^et was sb over-joyed with
so happy a beginning, as hc thought he should never have done rendring thanksto
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>.  At last, after some other speeches, the grand Signior caused one of the
Governesscsof the women of the Seraglio to come to him, and remitted her into
her hands, with order to lodge her alone, and in one of the fairest lodgings in
the womens quarter.  And outof a particular grace, he commanded to be given
unto her the very same day, great store of jewek, apparell, sumptuous houshold-
stuss, and mony, with six slaves to serve her.  And whereas she seemed to regret
one which she had, the Grand Signior caused her to be instantly brought in unto
her.  But I had forgot to tell you, that when she was separated from her father,
she assested to seem good and sensible; the tears came into her eyes, she lookedas-
ter him as far as she could see him ; and with this seigned testimony of naturall .is-
sestion, she touched the heart of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> yet more ; for whereas her tears were
withoHt bitterness, they did but make her shew the fairer.  But consider, I pray
you, how deceitfull and ill-assured humane prudence is, especially when it works
against reason and equity.  Bajaz,et had all his life-time been maftered by two
mighty pashons, love, and ambition ; the first raade him lose his fortune, when as
he betrayed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and the other raade him lose his life ;  as is the divine Justice
.would not let him enjoy a good, which he had acquired by a crime : For he had
not been eight days rc-cstablissicd in his charges, and <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> in the Seraglio,
when as being gone to visit the Basla of the sea, vvho was then at Pera, where the
Arsenall and Magazine of ail Maritime things were, he arrived there just as they
were ready to try fifty Cast-pieces, which were to be used in some shipping that
was ssiortly to be set forth.  And whereas the Bassa would bc present in person at
this tryall, it was in this employment that Ba]az.et found him.  After the sird
complcments,the Bassa told him, how that which he was going to do, vvas as niucli
to congratulate his happy return to the Port, as to acquithimself of the dutyof
his charge ; whereupon he commanded fire to be given : But to shew that the ju¬
stice of heaven would punissi Ba]az.et, the first piece buiso asunder, and in the midK
of two thousand persons, and some four paces from the Bassa of the sea, a shiverof
that Cannon picked him out, and carried him away, with such violence, as he
was almost reduced into powder, so strangely were his limbs dispersed. Andthat
which is yet remarkable also in what I deliver, is, that he was the sole man,l£lo
not say of them that were killed, but of them that were hurt, and hovv that ss a'
the onely piece that burst in sunder.  Behold, generous ./^Ar/rsw/r^, in what man¬
ner Ba]az,et enjoyed his hopes, and the recompense which hc had for ali his crimKj
The news ofhis death was soon carried to the Seraglio ^<hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> shewed a great deal
of sorrow for it ;  and out of a sense of interest she was really grieved thereat.
But in a few daies, the markes which the Grand Signior rendred her ofhis assestioj
comforted her. For whereas she did not regret him ,  but because she had htsm
him to be usesuU for her greatness, when as she hoped that she might attain there¬
unto without him, she quite forgot hini; Yeaand was glad that Oie was discbar^t'i
ofthe care of his fortune, and to have nothing to think of but her own.  Roxom
had not been sisteen daies in the Seraglio, but she so absolutely pofsessid the Grand
Sii-ni. ir, as none ofthe rest of the Sultanaes could pretend to a favourable regard
fromhim,  but by speaking well to him of her ;  or that he knew they had bee"
somewhat gratious with her; which pofsessed thera with nolittk jealousie, and no
less spight! Butthat which vexed them more was, that they could nothnd occa¬

Tom their Mistresses, and that ranch assested her,was advertised thereof But hear,I
PI ay you, in what manner she opposed this storra vvhich vvas rysing up against her
snd I am fore you will acknowkdge, that she was then as ingenious, as she h^th
been wicked lincc. This conspiracy nothing daunted her; she seemed neither more
unquiet,nor raorcpenlive; and asl the change vvhich she brought to her life was,
that she never saw Solimait, without speaking some good of one or other of the Sul¬
tanaes She piaised the beauty ofonc,the huraor of another, the gracesulness ofthis,
and the stature of that; but particularly she seemed very much to esteem of the rao¬
ther of Mustapha; and so caressed that young Prince , as it had been impofsible at
that time to have forcseen by the apparcnces that which hath since fallen out. And
whereas she knew that the raother ofthe Sultan had a great power over bun, she
wonne her wholly to her scls. Now i?o.vs/^m design was, to destroy by this arti¬
sice all the ill which the Sultanaes could say ofher to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. For said she, when
he shall see that they, for whora I do so many good ofsices to him, would hurt me,
he wil have thera in horrorjand think the better of me.The matter sailed not to suc¬
cecd as she had imagined it. For one ofthe Sultanaes, whom <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had the most
commended, having understood that she had sent a little cofser soil of jcwells out
ofthe Seraglio, which is not perraitted in that place, she advertised ;&lt;?//iw&lt;a» of it,
who scarcely hearkning to what she said,called her ingratefull and disacknowledg-
ledgine; and without obHging^o.ve/4«4 to the justisying of herself, he sent her a
presentofiraportance. After this, none of the Sultanaes durst venture upon any
such like adventure. But Roxelana, who was not contented with keeping them from
doing her hurt, and that placed her suprcniest felicity in doing hurt to others
absolutely gained to her three Slaves, two Eunuchs , and suborned also two of the'
Sultanaes; who went jointly together and advertised <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> ofthis secret counsell*
which was held against Roxelana, without raaking shew for all that of her know¬
ing any thing of it, ;o/w&lt;e« recorapences thera for this advice, commands them
n^'t to speak ofit; and whereas this crime was too generall, he resolved to punissi
tl. m who had committed it, and by one onely way, which wasto raake Raxelatub

<p>never thought of any thing but maintaining her sols; but when she canieto consider
that Mustapha would reign one day, and that according to the custom of the Em¬
pire, her son should be strangled; this awaked her former ambition, and aU herded
iigns tended no longer but to be speedily the wise of a Prince, of whom she was the
absolute Mistress; to the end that in this illustrious estate, she might the more ea-
sily destroy Mustapha, for her son to reign.  And mark a little whereunto ambitj]
on carried this woman, who thought already of setting the Crown on the head of
a child, who knew not as yet that he was living ! howsoever, it was not out ofthe
absolute power that she had over the mind of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, that she attained to herde-
sircjbutbyanartifice which I am going to relate unto you.  She knew that in
one of the books of our Religion the Soveraign is forbidden the pofseshng ofa sret
woman ; and she knew also that in another, a Slave is not permitted to busld cither
Mofqiie or Hofpitall, or to doany other thing that may be available for the other
life.  Upon this foundation she built her design; and knowing that theMuski
carried a great stroke vvith the Grand Signior ,  she won him vvith pre¬
sents, vvhich  she  sent him secretly ; and so being  sure of his ailistance
when shee should have  need of it, behold hovv  shee  proceeded therein.
She sent to the Muphti, who is the man that takes cognizance ofall matters of Re¬
ligion, to let him understand that she had an extreme desire to build a Mofqucjand
an Hofpitall, where all poor Pilgrims might be lodged and sed; but before she
would undertake it, she would fain know whether this would be pleasing to the
Prophet.  The Muphti answers according to her desire, and as she knew that he
would answer; that the thing would be pleasing to the Prophet, but absolutely
unprofitable for the second life of her soul, because she was the Grand Signiors
Slave, and that whatsoever she hadbein^ <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s, and not hers, all that sheshoulJ
do in this estate would bc to the advantage of the Grand Signior, and not of her.
This answer received, she seigns to be exceeding melancholick, she deprives her
self of all her ordinary delights; and when the Grand Signior visits her, she lets
herself be surprised still in some muse, whereat she seeras afterwards to bc some¬
what grieved, and to strive to break her self from it.  At last she playes her part
so dextrously, as the Grand Signior began to bc troubled upon his observing this
change of her humour. At first he was contented to ask ofher what it wasthat
made her so sad ? but she answering that it was an effect of her temperature, it put
him into further pain. He inquires of the slaves that serve her, whether any one
hath given her cause to complain ? they answer, that they know of none; but
how it is true, that their Mistress had been for a good while so melancholick, as
they did not think she could live long in that sort.  For indeed when Roxilm
was alone with them, she always seemed exceeding sad, to the end that being the
first deceived, they might the more ealily deceive others, fore-seeing rightly, that
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> would inquire of them that served her, what she ailed. But because she
would not be always in constraint, she ssiut herself up the most part of the day in
her Cabinet ; and this unaccustomed retirement served yet very much to make it
be credited that she had some hidden grief. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> being advertised then of ill
these things, began to sall into extreme unquietness: he conjured <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> toac"
quaint him with the cause of her sadness, and not to conceal the secrcts of her
heart from a Prince, who had given his so absolutely to her; he told her, that is
anyone had wronged her, he would revenge her for it; and in conclusion, thi^
there was nothing which she might not obtain from him. Hereunto she anlVeredj
that the respest alone which she bore him, kept her from obeying him, and thatsn^
had always rather die than displease him. So pressing a discourse sailed not to
work the effect which she attended from it; <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was mightily moved with'tj
and beholding her with eyes, which ssiaredwith her in her grief, he svvore that he
would not part from her till he knew what it was that troubled his felicity. ^^'
resists yet a while, he presses her the more, and speaks to her with such earncstnei^
as she thinks it was high time to discover her scls.  She sells then at his feet, be-
seechcs him to pardon her, and at Ust srames a discourse silled with artifice, where-

<p>As indeed the next day he sent her a Patent of her Assranchiiement, which he had
caused to be drawn up in the raoft aiithenticall form that is used amongst us, and
withall ordered so much money to be delivered unto her as she vvould demand.
Behold her then the most contented woman that ever vvas, seeing so profperous a
beginning of her enterprize. She thinks no longer in apparencc of any thing but
her buildings; shccoraraunicates herdcligns to ;o/;w;&gt;4;;, vvho on his side esteem¬
ed himself very happy in having been able to cure the raind of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> ofso black
amelancholy. But when as a little after he vvould have her come and pass the
night vvith him at his lodging, he vvas much abashed to see her, being alone vvith
him, cast her self at his feet, and vvith her eyes full of tears, and a voyce interrup¬
ted vvith sighs, hear her say unto him; I know full vvell, my Lord, that thou art
the Master of our goods, of our bodies, and of our lives;  and that thy will
ought to be absolute Mistress of ours.  But, my Lord, it novv concerns the Ordi¬
nances of Heaven, the Precepts of our Prophet, and the Law vvhich we profess,
vvhich wisl not permit thee to dispofe ofme being sree.  Give heed then, my
Lord, to that which I say, and draw not the indignation ofHeaven upon thy head,
for a crime whereof I should be the cause : For rather than I wisl resolve to com¬
mit this fault, I am capable of taking away raine ov/n life, so much do I fear left it
should prove unlucky and satasl unto thee. As long as I was thy Slave, I never re¬
sisted thy pleasure, knovying that both divine and humane Laws commanded me
unto it: But now that I ara sree, andthat therefore I cannot be thine, without
transgreslmg the Law, I think that I do asl ought in this my opposing thee. Soli-

<p>tished Religion, and reason of State, vvhich ordained him so to do &gt; Ah, no,no he
cannot live without Roxelana, and whatsoever comes of it we must be insepa'rablc •
and without ofsending Heaven, I must render her happy in contenting my self. \[
my Subjects murmure at it, I shall tell well enough how to bring them to their
duty again, and teach them to submit unto the pleasure of him, to whom they arc
but Slaves.  This resolution being taken, he imparted it to Roxelana, who, as you
may judge, rejoyced excessively at it.  Howbeit she in appearance received this
news with a great deal of moderation, saying, that she thought herself unworthy
of so great an honor.  But within a few days after <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> mary id her publick-
ly with a solemn pomp.  She sent presents to all the Sultanaes, but the Mother of
Mustapha, to decline the seeing of jber that day, seigned her self sick.  Now to do
her the more honour, and to declare her more absolutely Queen, and Mistris of
all the Sultanaes, he caused agreat Hall to be most sumptuously surnished, where
at the one end he made a Throne of four steps to be erested, covered all with
cloth of Gold,  and two Cussiions of the same stuss,  upon vvhich sate hee
and Roxelana, who had a Crown on her head, and her Gown set all over
vvith Diamonds.  Upon the second degree of the Throne vvas the Mother of
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, wholoyed <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> as her self; and upon the two lowermost, sate the
sisters and daughters of the grand Signior, for he had three by two of his slaves.
Things being in this estate, all the Sultanaes came one after another richlyap-
paialled, to do obeysance to <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> with an high respest; and fora mark of
their dependance, they all brought magnificent presents,and placed thera some four
paces from the Throne where <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> sate.  Divers of them brought Maunds of
Gold full of Flowers; others, Vases of Emeraulds rcplenished with Essences;
some, little Cofsers, garnished with precious Stones, and silled with Persumes; and
after they had left their presents at the foot of the Throne, they went and placed
themselves in order on both sides ofthe Hall upon their knees, as it were to doe
homage to the new Queen.  All these Sultanaes having remained so awhile, an
hundred young children, which are brought up about the grand Signior, came
out of a particular grace to the womens Seraglio, where this ceremony was per¬
formed ; and being arrived in the Hall, they beganto dance, and to sing somewhat
to the glory of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> ; and being retired, all the Sultanaes went to kiss her
Robe, and then her hand, which she held out unto them.  And for a mark oftheir
slavery, and her liberty, she gave to each of them a chain of Diamonds; and so re¬
turned in the same order as they came, carrying in their hearts as much envy and
jealousie, as <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had joy. Asfor the mother, the sisters,and daughters om*/'-
w&lt;i«,they conducted <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> tothe Grand Signiors lodging, where they Icsthcr
in the height of her selicities, and retired to the old Seraglio thorough a door that
opened near upon <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s chamber.  Untill then sraud and artifice were tHe on¬
ly things which she had employed to arrive unto the point she had desired; but
alass, how well did she in this estate remember the bad lessons which herfather
had given her! when as he had told her, how that which was gotten by addrest,
ought to bc conserved by violence.  For she no sooner saw her self the Wise of ^♦Z'"
man, but she would needs ssiare with him in his power, and be acquainted with all
the affairs of the Empire; she banished from the Port such as weienotplea%
to her; and for fear left the Muphti, whom she could not make greater than hc WJ,
should reveal to some one, that her good fortune was not so much an effect ofher
devotion, according to her own saying, as of her artifice ; it was thought tli«

MotU linking it a crime to resuse her sonne, takes the sruit whichhe present,
her with, and to content him, eats It with her eyes all batihed in t^ar'; ^ut "e
infortunate Mtsstapha knew not that hc gave death to her who had given hint
life'and that this crime vvhich he committed so innocently should be one aay
scvcW punished in his person, though he were never accused for it: Having been
in this occasion, like those innocent ofserings, upon whom in times past amongtt
certain Nations the crimes of asl the people were charged.  The pcjyson whicti
<hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had caused to be prepared was sloWj to the end U should make no noise;
and that when Muslapha should bc out of the Seraglio, and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should be told
thathe was sick, she raight make him bcleeve, that change of air had caused this
malady.  But destiny would not have the matter go so ; for in sine, not to pro¬
long this discourse any further, yl/«/?/tp/j4 went out ofthe Seraglio in good health,
with no little grief to Roxelana, vvho had been advertised that he had not eaten
of the impoisoned sruit. As for the mother, that never troubled her; forthough
she sesl sick the very same day, and dyed a moneth after, no body beleeved there
was any thing extraordinary in her death ;  because <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had caused it to be
bruited, how the sorrow for ^/«/?/e;iA4ssj cloignment was the catsse ofit, and how
since that day she had never been well ; as inciced she lyed not : snd this was so
generally beleeved, as the sick Sultana her self sayd so much to them that came to
visit her, she never suspesting any wickedness.  Behold, Madam, Roxelanaes sirli
pcrsccution of the Prince Mustapha: Indeed it is true, that he was not sensible of
'it, for he never knew any thing of that which  I have told you.  l^ow you must
not imagine, that this violent desire which she hath alwayes had to destroy Musta^
pha, whereby her children may reign, is a sense of affection for them ; she hath
not so legitimate a design, and the only thought which s^hath, is tip remain the
mother of an Emperor asoer the death of ;o//&gt;»4« ; because she knows very well,
that this quality gives alwaies a great credit to those which pofsess it i and brings
them into veneration amongst us.  I should never have done, is I would relate all
her wickednesses unto you.  But at length M«y?&lt;s/&gt;/?4 in spight of all her artifices
lived, was brought up with great care, raaryed an excellent Princess ofthe bloud
of the antient Kings of Capadocia,whom he loved passionately, and proved, as you
know, as excellent a Prince as ever was. And the hate which she bore him could not
keep the Prince s7/Vz«^sr from having as much good wisl for him,as she had aversion.
But to strengthen her self still the raore, as soon as her daughter had attained the
age of thirteen yeares, she got <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to raary her to the traitor Rustan; who for all
that hath not forborn often betraying her self, for he seekes his own greatness and

hath had sb much power with <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, as she could never, he being the most vc"^'
ous of men, make any ofher wicked devices succeed,  either against him  noT'^
Mustapha, or danger s for he loved them both dearly ) untill siich time a's for ou
ill fortune, he went away, some six monthes agoe, upon a secret expedition vvhere^
ofall the world t.ilks diversly; for seeing the mischiefes which have arrivedbyh'
absencc, it is feared left she hath caused him to be" murthered by the way. h bein!!
very certain, that ishe had been here,  the rage which shehad long ssiut up in her
heart, had not broken out so deadly as it hath done.  Alas !  said <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> inter.
rupting her, how much hath he whom you speak of been wished for in vain ofthe
Vrince danger !  And how often hath he spoken to me of him with a world of
praise! B ut mother,  continued she, you have recounted so many things unto me
as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> me thinks should be above an hundred yeares of age, and yet he seemed
not io old unto me on that unhappy day wherein I saw him.  It is, answered HMi.
7na, because I having enchained two Histories in one, and begun to speak of Solmm
at the age seaventcen yeares, your mind, by the length of my narration, andthe
number of things which I recounted, hath thought that which you say. But isyou
please, I will let you see th:  contrary: <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was seaventcen yeares old, v^hen h-
jaz,et put the suppofition of the Slave upon him; at the end of sixteen yeares, when
<hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> was presented unto him, he was thirty and three, she sisteen, and Mnslntk
scaven: So that isyou are ignorant of all these thing?, you will find, that'Roxelm
is not above scaven and thirty yeares of age, Mustapha was nine and twenty, Gm-
ger eighteen, and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> is fifty and four, though he seem not to bc more than for¬
ty. And that which is strange in this Prince is, that hc is at this present of a more
amorous humor, than he was in his younger yeares. I shall not have much ado, an¬
swered <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>,who had not spoken yet, to believe that which you say; and I kjiow
but tco well by mine own experience,  that there are men in whom age doth ra¬
ther stir up passions, than appease them. With such like discources, /s&lt;«/w;-« indea¬
voured to divert thePrincesses melancholy; but rcmembring that she had notea-
ten any thing ofall that day, she went to give order forthe serving up of dinner,
On the other side <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, who had not forgot the design which he had, and the re¬
quest of Ulama, after he had sjpent part of the morning at the Dtvano , which was
held that day, and the rest of^it with the Grand Signior, without speaking of any
other thing than the war of Persia, he returned to his Palacc, there to take along
with him the Slave which Ulama had sent to him , that he might carry him tothe
Castle of the scaven Towers, whither he went with an intention to case the mise¬
ries of others, since fortune would not let him find a remedy for his own.

and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> were prisoners,he commanded the gate to be opened to him,
as they used in times past to do, when he came to visit Prisoners of State.
But whereas the Governor of that place had not understood of the grand
Visiers return, there had been no order taken for his entrance; howbeit
his people had no sooner advertised him of his being there, but he came to
let him in himself, and to crave pardon for making him stay so. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>,
having accepted his excuses, sent him to advertise <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> of his arrival, and to know of
her, whether he might have the permilsion to see her. This man sailed not to obey the com¬
mandment he had received, but this news so surprized <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, and the imagination, that
soe was ready to see a man, whom Prince sj/&lt;««^sr had loved somuch, troubled her in such
sort, as being but in a weak and languishing state of health, the vioknt motion ofher thoughts
h;d like to have made her sall into a swoon. Not finding her self then in case to entertain
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>^ she sent her dear <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> to cxcuse her unto him, and to desire him to pardon her,
issoe were constrained to retard a thing, which she desired so passionately. <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> acquit¬
ed her self of this commission with a great deal of address, and entertained <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> at Itali-
ma's lodging. But after the illustrious Ba^a had received <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> s civilities, and had
told <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, that oming but to ofser her his service, he should have been very forry to in¬
commodate her, he perceived the unquietness, which appeared in the face of SAlxana. For
whereas he had commanded i;/&lt;«7w«'i Slave to follow him, soe had no sooner saluted Ibra¬
hm, but casting her eyes on this Slave, soe changed colour. And scarce barkening to the Bas-

hich so obstinacely persecuted me, that you are to pardon me the doubt I am in of iny happi-

to approach, who casting himselfac Silix.. na's feet, would have kist her robe, but she readi¬

would have gone outof thechamber, but StlixanapttctWm^xt, called her back again. It
isbut just, said she unso her, that as you have been the onely consolation which I havefound
in my misfortunes, soi should riot conceal from you the succor which Heaven sends me alter

bit a P of hdrs <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was glad to see herin this resolution for he hoped he siiould
knoXc by herwhich^./,&gt;«.« would nottell him; so that causing hjr to sie down nd
nirby her, he summoned her to the performance of her promise, which she accomplilh-
ed in this manner.
</p>
<p>She Btforj of the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, Ulama, and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>.
</p>
<p>THat which you desire to know of me, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, hath coft me so many tear?,
andsiehs, that is I did not strive to turn away my thought from the last adventures ot
this History, it were impofsiblcfor me to relate the beginning, where you will finde nothing
but the hopes of an extream felicity for me.  But to take things from their first fource, and
to render my discourse more intelligible, I am to tell you, that Scach <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, whom we
call the Sophi, otherways Kingot the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>s, remained a widower almost as soon as his
wise swho, as I have heard say, was an excellent Princess) had brought him two sons, Ismael^
and Mahamed, whereof the last is blinde j and two daughters, of which the one is the.
Princess v^A-J-&lt;wiV^, or to say better, the wonder of her age; andthe youngest, named Psr-
ca, is of an indisserent beauty, of a malicious humor, and of a minde uncapable of anykinde
of friendstiip. As for Ismael, it might be said, that as he hath no great virtues, so he hath no
great deseds, and that he is in the rank of those persons, who do almost pass away their lives
so, as they can hardly be known to live, is their quality did not make it appear that they are
in the number of the living.  Now for Mahamed, the same cannot be said of him, but con¬
trarily ic seems, that Nature hath deprived him of thelight of theday, to make itshinethe
more in his minde: For whether it be that this privation of sighc is the cause of its better re-
colleding it self, and operacing with the more adivity; or thac his memory, which is so mar¬
velous in him, as ic miy be thought he hath never forgotten any thing, doth surnith him wich
that which renders him agreeable; so it is that his conversation is so charming, as one an ne¬
ver be weary of it. But thac which is most excellent in him is, that he is exceeding virtuous,
and thac his passions, chough violent, have never surmounced his reason.  Behold, my Lord,
what the royal Family was, whenl was brought to the Court, which was at thac time in
the City of Tauris. My Sacher had always been considerable enough in chis Monarchy,and the
Sophi, to testifie che esteem he had of him, had made him Governor of Strabat and Maz.an.
dtron, two very fair Towns,which are scituated on the bank of the Calsian Sea. But where¬
as my Father had marryed the sister of the Governor of Tauris, it was by his means that I
was put to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, with a many other maids of a condition equal Co mine, which were
divided between those two Princesses; and were wich ihem, as one might say, rather to
help them co pass away the time, then to do them any service.  <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> mighc be about
fourteen years of age, and I sisceen; and whereas she was younger then the Pnncs her Bro¬
thers, Mahamed, as I think, was not far from sixccen.  But to let you sirss know all t he per¬
sons of whom I am to speak in chis History, I stiall tell you, that there was at the same time
m the Court, one named Deliment, whose birth was not very noble; but who hsd, by means
of hishighspirir, and excream riches, sowroughc himself into the Court, and good grace
ot t\^tSopht, as there was nonebut wasafraid tobe in iUterms wichhim: I say afraid, be-
caulc It IS certain chat no man desired his friendship, but for fear least his hatred should be pre¬
judicial untohim; and truly it is not tobe marvelled is one could have no other opinion of
^™;. °V^'was ^^^olent, Moni, undertaking, beleevit^g there was scarce any thing
rS  A  ea% ofsended, never pardoning, and that which rendred all his bad inch-
nations more dangerous, was, that he had a great wit.  Now \iT)eliment were of thii humor,

</p>
<p>VlamayN^^ opposite to him in all things, for his birth is noble, as being the chief mannsr
ramaniai his courage is without brutishness; and whereas you have not seen him bur s"
hc was infortunate, I conceive I may be permitted to tell youwhathe wasdurln^hiss?
ty. When I arrived at the Court nothing was spoken of but the valor of Vkma •''for i «-
a httle after the War of the A^emites, where having done wonderS, and to say ail beenT
cause of the Sophies carrying away the vidory ; to recompence him for this greac action h
made him Satrap of Canamania ac two and twenty years of age, and gave him hissider'^
marriage, whom Vlama espoused rather out of obedience, then out of indination • Ith?
ing certain that this Princess, as the incomparable <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> bath oftentimes told me y"
nothing recoinmendable in her but her birth. And indeed, as is Heaven had found thislur
riage unjust, a month after it was accomplished she dyed of a burning Seaver: And whticis
it is the custom of the Kings of Tersta to have all the royal Family lodged in one and thesame
Palace, Vlama, "as brother-in-law to the Sophi, was lodged there too; sochat thoughtlie
women hve very straitly kept all over Persia, yet left we noc for all thac co have a great deal
of liberty, and to lead a life happy and pleasant enough; having in the same Palace, thetwo
Princes and Vlama, whom we saw as much as they pleased: for che Sopht had ordained that
the Princesses lodgings should be open to them when they would, I and that all the Sitm
young sons mighc see and speak to us when as they accompanyed the Princes.  Things bcJDg
in these terms at such time as Vlamaes wise dyed, tsie Princesses went by the commandment
of the Sophi, a litde after the Suneral, togivcavisic to Vlama, whom I had scarcely ever
seen, because I had noc been above a month ac the Court, and thac during the same the Prin¬
cess bis wise had still been very sick. I have already cold you, my Lord, thac VUmhi
not loved her, and I put you in minde of it, to the end you may not think ic strange is in tliis
occasion Love took his beginning in the time of a mourning, which had not drawn any tears.
iiysxiamira and Perca made th\syisit with ceremony, the young Princes conduced them,
or to say better, Ismael held up <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, andPerca led Mahamed, who, as I have told
you, was blindc from his birth,though he had the fairest eyes to see to in the world; buthelct
himself be guided with so much addrcss,and went along with so considenc a pace,as therewJS
no body but would have been deceived in him. All the maids of honor followed after,as also
six Ladies of quality, reasonably well stept in years, which had been placed abouc the PrincelTs,
to have a care of their behavior, and ours.  And truly it must be acknowledged, chat Seadiof
rejoycing do scldom shew any thing more goodly to behold, then the mournir^ whxiiiiin
this Court; for whereas black is not in use there but when one mourns, is any of it bestssl
about ones apparel, it sufficeth; nor is it exempted from magnificence.  We were sll then it-
tired much after one; and to excuse Vlama so much che more, for letting himsds be toocli-
ed wich those few charms which you see in my face, I will describe Axiamimes habit unto
you, thac you may know what mine was; for she had already taken so great a liking toK,
as she would have no other disserence between her apparel and thac I wore, but great sloreof
Diatnonds which she caused tobe added thereunto whensoever she pleased; and wichall,ta
that satal day did beget love in four such disserent hearts, it will not be amiss for roe co rtcooot
unto you all the particularicies of it. A.viamira chtn had on a pstticoac and wastcoat of cW
of silvcr very gliccering, and over that a gown of black Tissany exceeding sine, vvherccjs tM
body was plaited, so thac it shewed the stiape very perscdly ; and the boctom of the skitii
which was cut in peaks, made way for the cloth of silvcr to be seen athwart ir. The sl«sti
were indisserenc wide, but to give more libcrcyto the arm, they were sastencd uponi'^
shoulder with clasps of Diamonds, leaving almost to open view che cloth of silver se)'^
that were under.  Her Girdle was of great Pearls cnchaced amongst Diamonds: Anil dc-
hinde at her back were moreover two hanging sleeves reaching to the ground, borderedwi'^^
large borders of silver Embroidery, as well as the lower pare of the Gown. Her neck w
half hid wich most delicate black cobwebdawn, which was tyed on her stiouldsrwitni '
ver siring.  And whereas our dreshng is very high, there hung from che top of h r head ■■
hinde a great vail, trailing to the very ground, of silver Tissany, streaked with black, anaca
hsly plaited ; which certainly gave a great deal of grace to the beauty of Aximira,
also sopplyed that little which I had.             cptrsu,

abT kemgchac every time civilicy would permit him, he sattened his eyes so on my face, as I
was'constrained co tu'n away mine; which made me observe how Delment took more then
ordinary care co encercain Axiamirit; for this man of blood and fire had not till hen looKed
upon any woman, bur to despise her. And as is this chamber had had some satalness to en¬
chant the mindes o^ those that were in it, the Sophi himself came to y\sn Vlama, whilst
we were there, and for my ill fortune, hc beheld me so favorably, as I past wich him for the
fairels ching chac ever he had seen. But whereas the time was not proper for gallantry, all
these springing passions were no ocherwise made known then by looks, except in Deliment
who when che Princess hapned Co go away, and that <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> was recired, advanced to lead
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, whil'st Ismael wss yet Calking wich Vlama. She, that thought the Prince her
Brother would tarry behinde, received him with her ordinary civility, akhough she was ex-
treamly avetse to him. On the other side, Ismael having sinished bis complement, gave his
hand Co Tcrc.i, who, without thinking howtheblinde Prince had not brought his ordinary
guide along with him, sust'red him to lead her; and whereas Mahamed perceived it, and was
very dextrous, he made his discourse endure as long as he could out of hope thac some cne ot
other would lend him their hand to condud him. I consess that having marked the pain ha
was in,and moved with pity to see so goodly a Prince,so handsom,so sprightly,and so amiable,
in che unquiecness wherein I saw him, J stept to him, wichout demanding permission for it
of the Govcrnesses. My Lord, said I unto him, the Princesses are gone, will not you be pleased
to follow them ? He chac knew me by my voyce, Yes gladly, discreet <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, said he unto
mL% is yon will have che goodness to lead one that isblinde, whonorwichstandinghisblind-
ness cannot buc know your meric. I observed by Vlamaes countenance, thac he had a desire
to have spoken a gallantry Co me chereupon; as indeed he hach since assured me, thac civility
onely kept bim trom ic; buc in sine I led Mahamed to the Princesses Lodging, for che which
he was so obliged unto me, as thac which the eyes of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> had wrought in the heart of
"Deliment, and mine in chac of the Sophi and Vlama, my courtesie esseded in Mahameds;
who from thence forward began to have an inclination for me, which mighc well be cermed
blinde, since is I had had any thing thac was agreeable in my face, yec could he noc have been
touched with it, being not able to see it; and as for wit, I was in an age, which ordinarily is
not capable of making greac conquests.  Indeed it is true, that my complying with him mighc
render me pleasing to him; for whereas all my sellows were not of my humor, they, when
Mahamed was wich <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, declined his conversation, or ac least« wise applyed not chem-
slvescoit, and this, ouc of the thought, thac being incapable of seeing their beaucy, they
beleeved him co be also incapable of love, and for this reason, they would not lose thac ?ime
wich him, which they thought mighc be better employed in the entertaining of all those
young persons of quality, which accompanyed the Princes Co <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>.  As t?jr me, who
cired noc as yec,either for loving,or for being loved, I gave my self onely co things that pleased
me; and whereas I was insinitely taken with che conversation of Prince Mahamed, and chac
generoiity ic self carryed me chereunto, I set my self as often as I could to talk wich him  buc
that which engaged me yet farther to this compliance, was, chat the Princess Axilmira
loved him dearly; for whereas Ismael and Tcrca wtxe unworthy of her ass'cdion.the first for
thedetedsof hisspirir, and the other for her malice, she had placed all ber liking on Mah-'
iu\  that when the Princess could not encertain him her self, she comraanded me to stav
with him, which I did witha great deal of joy, because there was nothing of more power
at that time in my minde, then the desire to please the Princess, who in alLher adions seemed

nc)t served to deceive him, used to come sometimes to the Princesses, withouc giving me not¬
withstanding any greater mark of his assedion, then to behold and commend me more then
the rest, when occasion was presented for it; for whereas I was very young at that cime he
durst not, as I understood ascerwards, speak plainly to me of his pashon, fearing Ishoald'not

ber, and by a second view consirmed himself in the advantageous opinion he had conceived
of me; and so strorgly resolved to love me, as fearing he should be obliged to dinodgsroni
the Palace, because the Princess his wise being dead without children, he was scarcely any
longer of rhe royal Family; he purposed co endevor all he could to discover his alsedion unto
me, for fear he should be deprived of the commodity of doing it so easily, is he were con¬
strained to be gone from thence. As for me, I consess to you blushing, thac in this visit
which he gave CO the Princess, I selt a desire arise in my heart that I mighc be pleasing unto
him; and wichout making any reslexion on this thought, I remember well, thac although it
had been a greac Courc thac day, I never thought of heeding my apparel; butassoonas
Vlama was entred, I observed my self wich care, and withouc knowing any reason sotir,
I would have been glad chat I had been better drest chen I was.  Buc in sine, my Lord, two
or three hours after, Fortune was so favorable to'L'/^iw^'j design, as having found me alone
in the Princesses Chamber, who was shut up in her Cabinet, he spake to me of bis affection
wich so much passion, as I knew not what to answer him, having never met with such like
encounters.  And whereas his speech had ever since remained in my memory, and that it
hath been the beginning and cause of all my pleasure, and of all my misery, I cannot forbr
repeating it unto you. He no sooner entred inco the chamber, but I advanced towards him,
to let him know thac I was very forry for chac he could not see che Princess as yet; and thit
having forbidden me incerrupting her, I durst noc adsercise her of his being there. Do iKs
asshd you self, fair <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, said he unto me, for a thing which is insinitely pleasing tonis;
and is you will render me persedly happy, trouble not my good fortune in doubting of tiis
trucb.  Whar, said I unto him exceedingly surprized, do you come to see che Princess, ml
yet are glad that you cannoc meecwich her.? truly this seems so strange tome, as I cannot
comprehend tbe reason of it. Ic is noc for all thac very dissicnlc to finde out, answered henie,
for I come to see the Princess .^.vj&lt;?»?t&gt;s« out of duty, andthe beautisul Selixammid's'

that in six months space Vlama gave me so many marks of his love and discretion, as I ^^^^

with che raore liberty. <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> having willed me co lend AlaLiw.d my hand, hc let hini-
sclt be guided by me, and the Princess leaned on him. After we had walked a pretty while
some ten or eleven pices distanc from the rest of ny sellows, who out of respcd durst not
follow neerer, hiving wdl observed, that the Piu c is was not wdlmg they should. M.-.ha-
»?s^ first speaking, asked ofher, whecher itwas to say nothing untohim that she had senc
for him; ic being certain, thac all the while we had wal ed together she had not spoken a
word ; for, concinued he, my dear sister, whereas I do noc see buc with the cytso. my
minde, il you have a purpose co encercain me, ic must be with your discourse, siice walking
can haveno other charm tor me chen what I finde in going along wich you uii:'cr the con¬
dud of the discreet <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>. My silence, answered the Princess, will cronbk you kss it msy
be, then my discourse; seeing I know yon Coo generous, and Selix.ma roo wise, and too
assedionate to my service, to conceal my misfortunes from you. It is cercain thac i was very
much surprized Co hear che Princess speak in chis sort; for though sh:- had been a prcccy wh'le
past somewhacsadder chen she used robe, yet perceiving no apparant cause for ir, I had at¬
tributed ic co one of those melancholies without a cause, which seizes upon all the World at
one time or other, and proceeds from ones temperature; buc when as going on in her sp-tch
she acquainted us, that ever since the visit which she had given to Vlama after the loss of the
Princels h;s wise, and that Deliment had presented her his hand to lead her to her lodging, as
I remerabred very well, he had been so audacious as Co speak divers times ro her of love, al¬
though she had at the very sitst very severely forbidden him; my amazement ceased, knowing
well enough the excream aversion which she had for Deliment, and how much her great heart
ought Co be incen{ed,that a man of a birth so unequal to hers should be so diring,as co lose the
resped which he owed unto her. As for Mahamed, who knew buc tco well j by the report
ot some of bis servancs, thac 'Deliment shghced him, he was so neded, as he could not for¬
bear saying aloud: How, sister, hach this Insolenc lost the resped which heowstoyou? Yes,
replyed the Princess, and in such a manner, as even to day, when as the Sophi brought him a-
Icing with him into my chamber, upon procext of talking with me abouc an affair, which I
did noc finde was very necessary for me to know, he stayd there behinde him, and had the
insoknce to lee me understand by his obscure discourses, chat che greatest happiness could ar-
rive to me was to be his wise; because, said he unco me, so you may one day be the Sophies.
For che cruth is, //»&gt;«^/knows not how to reign'; Mahamed is so far from guiding of an

<p>held by some body; that Ismael and "Strca are of his party; that they bate Vhmahitx^[^
he is of ours; that the J'o/)^/our Father is not sensible of love to his children; and thatthe
passions, which predominate in him, prevail with him over all things. Just hereupon wesj^
Ismael, 'T&gt;erca,vr\d all her women appear afar ofs, so thac to shcw there was no mystery in out
talk she went to meet them, and going away prayed us, that wc would sever out selves far
from all others, to think of that she had said to us, and that in the Evening I stionld tell her
the resolution we had taken.  I led Prince Mahamedt\\tn into another alley, where we wete
still for all thac in the sighc of the Princesses; and there, after we had well considered the mat¬
ter, we resolved, that ic was needsul, before it should break forcb, to discover, whetherthc
Sophi authorized the love of Deliment • whether Ismael and Perca had any intelligence with
him, or any interest in this love; thatfor this essedZ^/^jw^j was to be made use of lot so
much as regarded tbe Sophi; and that I on my part should endevor to know the secretsof
Perca, by the means of a maid whom she had loved very much, and who did noc hate me-
and that when we knew the truth of the business, it would be far more easie for us to remedy
the same; for in sine, said I, is the Sophi doth not proted Deliment, he will be lost assoon
as be understands of his insolence; and is Percahenot interesled in chis astair, the discourse
which he hath used to the Princess will quickly make her change party, wben she knowsit:
buc is th^ Sophi, asit is very likely, hach given some secret hopes to Deliment; andthit
Tercaontheoihetside hath any share in this adventure, it would be to no purpose to com¬
plain precipitously Co them of the insolence of this man, seeing they are the cause of it; and
other remedies are to be sought out. But Prince Mahamed said unto me, Is it poflibletht
the Sophi swho heretofore, as I have understood, hach beenso rigorous an observer of the
Laws ofthis Empire, thac hc banished the Sacrap Arsalon, for marrying a maid that wasnot
noble) should so shamefully insringe them for him. In authorizing the love oi Deliment! This
is a thing, my Lord, said I unto him, whereof we must be cleared by the way which! be
shewed.  This discourse being finished, and our resolution taken, I perceived that we were
a great way distant from the Princeslles, so that turning the Prince about, hc observed that I
would recondud him to a place, where he would not have the liberty Co speak unlome;
wherefore standing still, and wringing me a lictle by the hand; go not sofast, said heunto
me, itniabk <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, and be pleased, that as y^Arwwjri* hach to day judged you worthyof
communicacing all her secrets unto you, so I may acquaint you wich one of mine thac concsiK
my life; to theend thac our interests being so well joyned together, cur party miybetk
morestronger, and our enemy the weaker. And whenl had answeredhim, cbat it waseasie
for him to judg by my past adions of the desire I had to serve him; you may well think, hid
he unto me, according to the discourse which my sister used Co me, that I should lack reason,
in making protestations of love unto yco, were I not constrained thereunto by the forceof
truchand my passion.  Protestations of love tome, my Lord, said I? Yts, dearmaid,ic-
plyed he; and though I know very well, how it is an bard thing to beleeve, and hard to per¬
swade, thac a blinde man, who cannot truly sigure unco himself what Beauty is, should he
despcracely in love with you; yet is it certain that none hath ever been somuch as IJW |
hear all those that come neer you, talk to you of the attrads of your eyes, of the bcautjo
your complexion, of your stature, and ofyour neck ; buc I hear none tell you, that youtsoul
is fair, that your spirit is great and generous, that your goodness is excream, and that in o"-
clusion you are the mofi virtuous person that is in the world; yet is it with these beauties tto
my soul is touched; and chey are they which doubtless render my love more strong and wre
pure, then all those, which, as I have heard say, are destroyed by the loss of tbac beautyi«
i^ unknown to me.  But that which I have for you stiall certainly last as long as my h'Ji '°J

we came CO the Princesses, and with them we iouni'Delment, whom Ismael had sent for
bytheperswasionof P^rc^. As soon as he saw me neer to my sellows, he came to quarrel
with mefor having walked so long with thePrince, and separating me fromhim  without
an.' incivility, because tbe Gentleman, thac used to lead Mahamed, had lenc him his tiand a-
gain, I quickly discerned by hisdiseourse, chat chere was a greac intelligence between the
Sophi and bim: For as soon as be saw me alone, he bs gan to tell me, that I was the happiest
person of my sex, isl knew well how to manage che assedion which the Sopht bore me j
that be gave me chis advice as my servanc; and thac is I pleased, he would serve me in it
with all his power. I thanked bim coldly enough for chis ofser, and told bim, howl knew
very well, that all my happiness came from the Sophi, seeing the beautisul <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> made
up all my felicity; and saying so, I returned Co my sellows, which already were going after
the Princes, and Princesses, who recired with very disscrenc choughts.  For <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> had het
minde silled wich choller and hace; Mahamed added Co all those things the love he bore to
me&gt; Perca thoughc to work soby ber artifices, as we understood afterwards, that a man,
who was of no greac birch, should marry her sister, Co che end she might make use of ic when
time Ihould scrve: Deliment imagined how he might deceive all the world for the sacissying
of his love and his ambition; and Ismael alone knew noc very well what he was thinking on.
As for me,I was so surprized wich the insolency of Deliment towards the Princess,of the arti¬
sice of Perca,of che love of Mahamed,^nd of chac of the Sephi,as I could scarcely speak. But in
sine,my Lord,tbac I may noc amuse my self Coo long about peccy things, having such great ones
to tell you, you shall understand that we learned a little after, by the address of Vlama, by the
intelligence which I goe stora Perca's consident, and by the innocency &amp; simplicity of Ismael,
all che seyeral designs ofthese interessed persons. As for the Sophi, the greatest interest that be
had in this affair,was only in my person; for though he durst not speak to me of his passion,for
the reason I have alledgedj yet was ic so strong,as he was constrain'd to discover it to Deliment,
who prorpised bim co speak to me of ie; and in case I should not be discreet enough to con¬
ceal this secrec from others, be would be so consident as to disavow all that he had said to me.
Vor Ddlimegt, he had a long time before won an old Satrap, in whom the Sophi very much
consided for tbe affairs of che Empire, and who had ofcentimes perswaded him by Deliment's
diredion, thac tbe Law, which had caused Arsalon to be banished, was very judiciously
made for his subjeds, but noc for him; perswading him, that Kings, which did not marry
their daughters CO forraign Princes, were never Co admit the nobleft andthe greatest of their
subjedsinco their alharce; because ebac most commonly was to take Tucors, in taking sons
in law of an high birth; and chac for the good of the Prince, of the State, and of the Prin¬
cesses. It would be better to do ocherwise. For, said he unto him one day, comin-topar-

tb*; rash man was so audacious, as to speak with such insolency Co che Princess. For where¬
as he had tryed thac love could noc move her, he beleeved that ambieion might; and that the
hope of reigning over Tersia would move her more, then the certainty wherein she was oi
reigning over his heart. As for the Princess Perca, they bad a long time before created toge¬
ther, and he had perswaded ber, thac che Crown of Persia was co be shared between her
and her sister; and for that essed sb- was Co be kepc from marrying any man, whosegeneto.

sired. For after she had rauscd awhile, as well as h;, what need have we, said she untohim,
Co seekso far oft for chac, which we may finde in the person of Delment.? He, seeming to
have no other interest in this affair then the good of the Princesses,hcld ofs a good while,thsthsl
might be the more prest unco it. But ac length, being come to agreement abouc cheir conditi¬
ons, they judged, that albeit Ismael was noc capabk of rendering a party much stronger then is
he were not of it, yet ic would be advancageous for them to seize upon bis spirie; and Tiru
took the care to do it.  As indeed, she easily perswaded him, that ic was requisite Aximn
should be marryed to a man chat depended on him, and not on Mahamed, who after tlie
death of the Sbphi might trouble him, in demanding a greac porcion, as is he were not bliiiil;
so that to weaken his party, ic would be good to marry <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> to Deliment, who would

St would not permic him co chink so soon of a second marriage e'p cally wuh a person,
whose birch, though noble and illusinous enough, came not nee. forall that to the former,
things being in these terms, we were a go.d wh.le without having any great occasion to n-
crease our unqaiecness; because the Sophi and Delim^^ hav-ng consn ted a second cimMo-
eether. and resolved to seek to gain me by gentkness, bJore they would come to -rce, there
tis nothing buc sports and entettainments. And whereas accord.ng to che order I had for ic
so ofcen as Dehment spake co me of rhe Sophi's love, I made as though I did not bthevc there
was any truth in his wotds; Tachma. being thereof advertised.ind desiring to give me a proof
of the esteem he made of that they called beauty in may face, he did a thing, which bath since
been the cause of a greac deal of mischief; for, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, it happened tor our ill tor-
eunc, tbac there arrived abouc chat time at this Courc a Painter of £«re/»^ whom chance, or
the desire of cravelling had broughc thither, and thac drew pidures in lietle, so admirable re¬
sembling che life, as che like had never been hear of.  And ae the same time certain Merchants
came thither also, who, amongst other rarities, which they had, made shew of a number of
the pidures of the fairest women of such several Nations, as they had pasied through.  These
two chings joyned cogecher, caused the Sophi, ouc of the design he bad ro oblige me, to give
command thac all the maidens of qualicy, which were at che Courc, should presenc themselves
ac his Palace on a cercain day, appoinced for it, cogether wich the Princesles and their maids,
sumpruoully apparelled. This ceremony, whereof we knew noc thecausesfor they made a
secret ot it) somewhat troubled us, butae lengch that day bei.^g arrived, and all this fair As¬
sembly compleated, che Sophi followed by Ismael, Mahamed, Vlama, Deliment, and the
Paincer, of whom I have spoken to you, enrred into the room, where we were all see in or¬
der, buc wichouc che Princesses holding the rank, which they ought Co have had, for so had
rhe Sophi ordained ic; and that which also redoubled the impatience we were in, to know
for what reason chey had caused us Co be accired so richly, was, co see the Sophi hold in his
righc hand ewo Crowns of gold set with Diamonds, and caking the Paincer wich his left hand,
whom neither the Princesses, nor any of their maidens knew as yet, to say unro him, thac
he cstablished him che judg of che beaucy of all chofe which compofed this fair Asserably; as
knowing beceer, then therest of the world, che just proporcion of thsseacures of the face;
that which made up che delicacy, s reshness, and vivacicy of the complexion; and what the
disserence wasbecween an animaced beauty, and another tbac hach no life nor grace in ir.
And chac to make bim give a more equicable senccnce, hehad so ordered it, as he could not
discern the condition of the fair ones,ot whora he was che judg; buc howsoever that he never¬
theless reserved co himself the righc of crowning chem, whom he should judg co be wor-
rhy of that honor. This said, be led him all over the room, and making an cxad stand at each
of chem, thatso none mighc be disobliged, he sinished his first turn, none being able Co judg
thac he had given advantage to any; nevertheless I perceived, when the Painrer made a stand
before me, thac the Sophi, seeing me cast down my eyes, as pretending co no pare in this vido¬
ry, had said softly, thac I had not so much as need of their sparkling, to merit the Crown
having beauty enough ocher-where. Ic is certain chat I blushc ac chis discourse and chac list¬
ing up my eyes again, lencouncredt^/^w^V, wherein I marked somuch unquiecness asit

shussled in my self amongss my sellows, wich as niuchdi''pleasure for my vidory as th
had vexacion for thac chey had noc carryed ir.  Buc in conclusion, my Lord, <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> and'^'
were painted inthehabicof Amazons, which, as he said who drew our pidures, wasobs
ing to all Nations: When they were done, the Sophi caused him co make six copies ot ach
of us, whichhe put into Cases of Gold, enriched with Diamonds, and gave them to thof
Merchants, whohadshew'd him so many forraign beauties; but with an oath, thatthe
should never sell them to any but Princes, and thac they should always reserve one of each J
them in their own keeping, to publish ^Arww/r«'j beauty and mine overall the Countries
through which chey cravelled.  These Merchants promised all thac he required, and lor out
ill fortune kepc cheir word but too well, as you shall understand hereascer.  From that same
d^y Deliment persecuted me more then ordinary, ic seeming unto him tbac IwasnoWei
to doubt of the Sopht's love, ascer thac which he had said unco me.  And whereas I desirej
ta decline his encounter, ss much as I could, I stood ofcentimes talking with Prince yls^.
med; because chough he concemned him, yec his qualicy'made him chac he durst not separate
me from him, when we were in discourse rogetber. And I remember thac one day, as this
poor Prince was entertaining me, and chac Deliment was come Co che Princesses with IJmul
ouc of a design Co say something to me from che Sophi, chis insolenc man did so tar lose the
resped which he owed to Mahamed, as I hated him for ic more chen I did before. Ihavt
already told you blustiing, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that this Prince was in lovewich me; and
though I had noching but good-will for him, and that Vlama absolutely pofsessed my heart,
yec did I in some fore comply wich MahameJ, for his discourse was so virtuous, and so ob¬
liging, though pashonace, as is Vlama hid heird ic, I verily think he could noc haveiattii
this illustrious Rival. I was also willing to conserve the good-will of the son, out of thein-
tent I had to resuse thejove of the father.  It was then with his pashon that Mahmd en¬
tertained me that day, when as 'Deliment had sogrcat a desire to speak with me, and thit
finding himself hindred from it by the Princes presence, bethought good to observe both te
adions and mine. And whereas ic is hard for the motions of the face not to give some mills
of those of the heart, especially when love pofsesscth it; Deliment perceived somethiij
which was extraordinary in that of the Prince; for Mahamed, albeit he was blinde, yc:
came up close Co me, as is he could have seen me; and because his eyes could noc adveiiisc
him when there was any one neer us that could hear him, and that ic would have but putra:
in remembrance of his desed is he should have said any thing Co me of ic, he always uied to
speak softly unto me; which chac day,amongst ochers,gave no hede unquiecness to I)dm*i\
for having marked chat I had blusht twice ot thrice, and ic seeming to him to be without
anger, hcsuspeded somewhat of the truth. And whereas he was insolent, and accustoaid
to a biccer jeering, which made him to be yet more haced of everyone, he said, speakingol
me, to P trots Consident, who was hard by him sfor those two Princesses were retired into
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s Cik'met, accompanyed by Ismael,) doch noc this so long and soparticulin
conversation pofsess yeu wich curiofiey ? for as for me, continued he, I profess unto youthit
I cannot comprehend it.  Is ic be of indisserenc chings, I am cercain, chac he cannot taM
her of che rarities which he hach seen in his voyages; is ic be of War, he cannot reoderto
any ocher accounc buc of the noise of the Canons; and is ic be of Love, I am well iW^
that he doth not encercain her, either wich the whiteness of her skin, or che sweetness ot h«
look; so thac I conclude he cannoc talk CO her but of his dreams, which should not W
pleasing, since che objeds he hath seen conduce not much to the sumishing him wit"''''
idea's. Deliment spake so softly, as I could noc hear him; but whereas che privation ot'ig"
seemed co have rcdoubkd in Mahamed the delicacy of hearing, he lost noc one wordot m
which I have delivered.  I perceived very well, chat upon a sudden he had held his peace, i
he had blushed, and that wichout barkening ro me he had lent an ear to Velment; buti ^.^

<p>Tv'e see me more.  This last jeer so mightily incensed Mahamed, as he would have goneto
hat pare where he heard the voycc of Delment; buc knowing chat his misfortune would not
oermiehis coming ae him co punish his audaciousness, I recained him tbe best Icodd; and
roc thinking of Perca's Consident being chere. Let this sensless sellow go, my Lord, laid I
ante bim, and consider that your hand is too noble to punish his arrogance; and that in Itead
of doing him an asfront, you will do him an honor, whereof he is not worthy.  At this
noise the Princesses opened che C'abinee, and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> asking what thematter was, saw
Ptince^/^i'^'^ws^ exceedingly moved; Icis, answered he, an insolency of Ds/jw*»s/, which
I may not tell you so suddenly; for,my dear sister, chofe of his party are yec too strong here.
Ptrca secming not Co understand chat chis discourse was addressed to her, I assure my self, said
this subtle Princess, chat chis was one of Deliment's merrimencs, which the Prince hath mis-
understood ; hue left chis diforder, concinued she,should oblige che Sophi to forbid the Princes
from bringini? any body Co our lodging, I will go and endevor to appease this tempest. Spare
thac pain, replyed Mahamed; for cercainly, on my pare, ic shall never be appeased but with
the death of 'Deliment. But Terca, without answering this discourse, took Ismael by the
hand, and all amazed as he was, carryed him away whither she pleased. We were no sooner
ac liberty Co talk, but Mahamed recounccd to the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> all Deliment's insolen¬
cy, and ehae withso much choller, and marks of rcsencment, as made me much to pity this
poor Prince. Will you endure, dear sister, said he unto her, that the Enemy of Mahamed
shall become che husband of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> .? That a man, which hach made use of your cham¬
ber, as of a sanduary, co assrone me wich impunity, shall be yet so audacious as to pretend
to the pofsession of your person ? Ah I no, you are too generous to have such base thoughts:
and I hope, though my eyes are not able to guide my hand soasicmay give this Insolent an
hundred stabs, yec char yours will ac che least cake all che revenge of him you can, in shew¬
ing him so mmy marks of your rigor and disdain, as the love and ambition, which reign in
his heart, wanting saeissadion, he may howsoever have two domestical Enemies, which will
persecute him inccdantly, or to say betcer, until such time as I havefound out a man generous
enough to guide my zxm, or to lend me his.  Vlama enered into the chamber just at that in¬
stant, and having heard those last words, wichout giving che Princess leasure to answer, he
vtent to Mahomed, and assured bim, thac excepc it were against the person of the Jop/j*, he
might dispofe of him in any thing, and employ him in such revenge as he pleased.  Maha¬
med having quickly known Vlama by his voyce: Ah I generous Vlama, said he unto him,
that I am not in a condition to acknowledg thy virtue, racher then to have need of thy cou¬
rage against an infamous sellow, who cannot pretend to any other part of valor, but that
which thole cruel beasts may have, who are noc valianc, buc because they are strong, and
of a bloody dispofition. The Princess, who perceived thac in stead of being appeased, Ma¬
hamed gxevj che more incensed wich talking, made him enter into her Cabinet with Vlama,
and me; where we no sooner were, buc she beginning co speak, assured Mahamed, that shc
was no ess sensible of Delimenis insolency then he ; that she promised never to marry him
not, said she, because I would have you obliged to me for ic, or chat you stiould think I do
iC tor che ove of you buc concrarily, I desire you would belecve, chac when Deliment sltie^edi

ocher, which was to no purpose, since ic could not b*! doubted of, it would he battrs"'
them to employ ehe time in cor/idering, whethex Mahamed stiould complain wik Soph^
or whether he should stay, to see in what manner Deliment would live with him for thcs'
ture, ascer he had forbidden him his preience.  This advice Iteming just unto thtm, they be
gan to examine the matter. As sox Mahamed, he would neicher comphin, nor stay, but
onely revenge himself.  Vlama, who foresaw cbat no good could come of this rcvenee ei¬
ther for the Prince, or for the Princess, or for himself, stay'd rill v^x/^w»/rrs had ddivered'hct
opinion, pretending chac he was noc to speak his, inregard, saidhe, thatit bdongcdondy
to him to execute chac which the Prmeess and Mahamed should tcsolve upon.  So that Axl
amirabeing unwilling to speak alone by her self, commanded me to say what I thought wis
sit to be done in this affair.  I consess co you, generous/^rrs/;/»?, chat notwithstandine the
hace which I bare CO Z)s/i»!Jt'«r, I advised, chac things should be gently carryed; andthatis
he cam-to submir himself to Mahamed, he should be received, and shew made of pardon¬
ing him J buc upon condiclon nevercheless, ehae he should appear as scldom as he might in
places where Mahamed should be.  And chac which carryed me hereunto, was the thought
that is Z/*/&lt;«»*,« enrerprized any thing against Z's///wi;«s, ehe least that could arrive unto me by
it would be, that Vlama would be constrained to abscne himself, and leave me in the power
of the Sophi.  Asfor che Princess, she was of che opinion, thac a gendeman stiould be lent
from Mahamed co complain co the Sophi of Deliments insolency; and chat withall great
care stiould bs; caken to publish ic, because, said she to Mahamed, it will be requisite to make
him be contemned and haced of every one,as much as pofsibly we can,chae we make use of that
hatred and contempc when time shall serve; for, continued she, the world is not acquainted
with his remericy and audaciousness; and whereas he is rich and liberal, he hach parcitans and
servancs, who durst not declare chemselves to be so, is they knew chat you and I did lute
him.  Why, sister, replyed Mahamed, would you have me publish, thac I have receivedin
assrone wich impunity ? Yes, said she, I would have icpublishcd, ehae you may be revenged
of Deliment, seeing you may do ic withouc ofsence to your reputacion.  Consider, added
shc, chac is the generoficy of Vlama should carry him co sighc wich DAiment, your revenge
would bedoubcsul, since you cannoc be ignorane, chacchesuccessof Arms is always so, and
is peradvencurc ic should coft you the blood and fortuntof so excellent a man, you would
repent you of this violence.  No, Madam, said Vlama incerrupting btr, never Is and on these
considerations; leeing my fortune, my blood, and my life, could rioc be employed more
glorioush', then in revenging Vxmee Mahamed.  Buc, replyed she, eheraaccerisnot soease
as yoa imagine; your design may be discovered; checppo.cunicyof ex:cucing it perchance
will noc be prelcnted ; and chen co speak sreely unto you, I cannoc approve of chat violence

which he had to Deliment, his virtues, his merit, the assedion he bare to the Princes and
Princesses; and/»^»ts, continued he, the greatest mark that can be given me of the passion
one is in for my service, is, to render the same honors to Delment, as is he were my son;
and as for you, said he, leaning on yI^&lt;iiS'4&gt;»/r&lt;i'.r shoulder, I command you to love Deliment,
and to live well with him. It would be methinks more just, replyed ihePdnce, that you
would ordain him not to asfront me, since he cannot do so without qstending you. I dp ex¬
cuse, answered the Sophi, the ill opinion you have of Z)*//w««», seeing it isnot occasioned
buc by the litde knowledg yoa have ofhis intentions. But howsoever Iwill be obeyed;
and wichouc examining whecher my pleasure be unjust or equitable, I command you to jre-
ceive his submissions and his friendship.  Hereupon Deliment began to speak, and disguising
the malice of his soul, he said so many obliging things to Mahamed, as is he had not persest¬
ly known bis wickedness, he might have beleeved that he was cjpable of repenting.  So it
was, that Mahamed was constrained to make shew of no longer resenting the ofsence he had
received. This peace brought great joy to "Psrr*?; but/^^Arwwira'i coldness made it appa-
rane enough thae chey were noc boch of one party.  The Sophi continued yet some time in
talking of indisserent things, during the which he shll sixed his eyes on my face: And where¬
as out of a sense of compassion, and to avoyd his looks, I turned my head all that while to¬
wards Mahamed, he began to chink that there might be some verity in Deliments sqspicion.
He was no sooner returned to his lodging, but thinking of the means to be cleared therein,
he conceived that the gentleman, who served to guide Mahamed, might peradventure be he
from whom he mighe learn something. He had no sooner communicated this design to Deli¬
ment, bue that having apprwed of it, he thought of nothing else then execucing it.  And to
that purpose he waiced, chat he might give no suspicion to ^&lt;*/)4Wts«/, till he was retired in
the Evening, for at thae time che Prince not using to stir forth any more, always left his guide
at liberty; Deliment, who had caused him to be watched, was no sooner advertised that he
was come out of the Princes chamber, but he made him be secretly told, that the Sophi would
'peak with him.  This man, who had not been accustomed to receive such like favor«, pre-
leneiyobeyed; and the Sophi, joyning che hope of agreat fortune, presents, and entreaties,
to his commands, had quickly suborned his fidelity. After then that he was well assured of

was not without unquietness; The spight to be so ill entreated by the Sophi, and so unwcr
thily asfronted by Deliment, without having an assured mean to be revenged of it put h m
into no litde pain: And then again, when he came to think, that the next day he should en
counter with Deliment again ac <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s lodging, his great heare could noc so soon re"

ed for it, assuring her, that the greatest remedy he had need of was her conversation
or to be alone. The Princess understood well enough what the Prince desired of her'
so that as soon as she had met wich occasion sit for ie, she went to see Mahamed, carry'
ing none with her bat an old Governess, one of my sellows, and me. Buc Terca, havirg
understood chat <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was gone to see Prince Mahamed, who was noC well, perswaded
Ismael and Deliment to go thiehet too; so that we were hardly arrived ac M^ihmeis
chamber, but we were advercised, that this Enemy troop was coming to trouble our rtll,
The Prirce was so enraged ae it, as <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, fearing he should be carryed to some violence,
made haste tobe gone, so chat meeting rhem in the anei-chamber, where she stay'dchen),Ihe
told them that the Prince being asleep, she would not sussr tiim tobe awaked, and thereby
obliged them to return.  In the me^n timt Mahamed, who could &gt;iul forbear giving me to
understand, that he hved still forme, called to him his guide, nm)edAmariel, whoolten-
times served him also for a Secretary. He recommends secrecy and discretion to him, and
after he had made him swear an hundred salse oaths,he didaces a leccer unto him for me, whicd
he wrote very saichfully; And having caused him to read ic over more chen once unto hiu,
he gives him order to go che next morning for to know how the Princess does, and then to de¬
liver me that letter as secretly as he could.  Amariel promises to acquie himself thereof ashe
ought; and very glad of his adventure, he retires from the Prince, and goes wich all speed to
do an ad of sideliey to ehe Sophi, and of treachery to Mahamed. The Sophievit^t% himex-
traordinarily, and aking the leccer with very much impatience, he sees that it wasextreamlji
passionaee, and ihu Deliment's suspicions were not ill grounded.  He senc immediately for
hiri), shewed him the letter which he had, and exceedingly moved with choller, demanded
what counsel he stiould take ? T&gt;eliment, as more cunning, and less preoccupaced, told hm,
how by this letter well considered one might easily see, thit Mahamed was passionately in
love wich me, bue that one could not judg, whether I answered his passion or no; sothstto
be cleared therein, Amariel was Co deliver this letter to me, and crave an answer of it. Tha:
for his part, he beleeved thac I did not hate him, because oneof Perca's maids had heard m
say somewhat, as stic went out of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s chamber, that made him chink so. This reso¬
lution being taken, Amariel according to his direstions came unco me, rendred me Mahmi
letter, and gave me the commodity to answer it. For whereas he was come very early, tne
Princess was not yet awake, and I was still in my chamber, wichouc any ocher company in^n
a maid that waited on me. Uncil then,I had beleeved, that I was not obliged toletW&lt;i»'
know any thing of Prince Mahamed's love; buc whenl foresaw that itwas like toMv
some sequel, I resolved, when I could finde a favorable occasion, to say someehing co him J
it; and in the mean time so to live with Mahamed, as he stiould have no cause to oeottc "
cd with me, nor yet hope to engage me to the affection which he desired of me. I aniw
him with a great deal of respest, and turning the sence of his words as dextrously as lco«.
I answered to a letter of love, as is it had been a letter of friendstiip. ^w^ns/hadno oo _

did noev^ricc unco me, and Ididrioc answer him, without ever knowing for all eh e what
we said ^ne to .nother; because ehe Sophi recained all Mahamed's Leccers, and caused ochers
tobe writecn come; and likewise k.pe allmy answers, in making me speak as he pleated
Iconsess thac many eimes I marvelled at ehe questions, wherewich thole Letcers, which i
beleevcd'were Mahamed's, were silled : and confronting the first I received from him with
therest I found so greac a disserence bee ween chem, were ie for the gracesulness ot ttieltilc,
or for the things he said Co me, as I knew noc whac Co chink of it.  Ncverchcless, seeing le was
always che same hand, and receiving chem ehe same way, all I could conclude up-nic was,
Thac che blindness of chis poor Prince pofsessed him wich such thoughts for love, as ncvci
any body had the like buc he.  For whereas che Sopht's and Deliment's design was, Co render
Mahamed concemptible co me, ehey made him wrice strange chings by Amariel.  Some¬
times chey made chis blinde Prince say, thac he was grieved he did noc see me; thac ehe beau¬
ty of my eyes was always presenc before him ; in another Leccer, thac for che more confor¬
mity he would willingly cbat I had been blinde as he was, and cbe rather for thac chen s slr-i:!&gt;t
noc see the Sophi, whom he knew Co be his Rival. Inanocher, he conjured me co lee him
have my pidure, and co send him word whether I were fair or brown.  I leave you Co chi.'^k,
since I could noc despise Mahamed, because I esteemed him very much ocher-ways, whecher
these Leccers did noe move me to compassion ; and chough Deliment's cunning did always
intermix someehing of the Sophi among, yec I had always so much discrecion, or good hap,
as not to make any answer co chat particular.  Buc is Deliment drew up such sensless Letters
for Mahamed, those which he made for me, as I understood afterwards, were noc much
more reasonable.  And tbe Prince hath told me, ehae when Amariel read them to him, he
could noe chuse buc make him read them over again and again. Ie was not because Deliment,
who ordinarily didated chem, had made them very obliging, but because the Prince, finding
them so badly pen'd, was perswaded that ie was/^w^nV/'j saulc, who read them ill; forbe
could noe imagine, that a person, whose wic seemed worthy of his eshcem, should express
her thoughts with so bad a grace; and to thac essed,he made him read chem over many times,
that he mighc be able c i discetn che faults of che Reader, from those which chey mide Co pass
for mine.
</p>
<p>Buc whil'st ehe malice of Deliment criumphed over the Saphi'^ sacility, and our innocency,
yj/rs^rsws^being well amended, caused himself to be led to thePrincesses lodging, co render
her his first visir, or ro say betcer, Co have a precexC eo give me one. For he hach told me since,
how he was noc withou; impatience Co hear me talk, to che end he mighe know, whecher I
had still che same wic, which hc had so much prized in me. He did not marvel, thac I had
always answered him with rigor enough, because he mighe well chink that mine own vertue,
and che fear of committing my self Co the disaecion ofhim thac was to read my Letecrs, would
carry m^ chereunto; buc to say things from ehe purpose to him,was that which he could not
comprehend. As long as his sickness had lasted, the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> had been often enough
to visie him, buc Perca had most commonly been in her company, so that we spake not toge¬
ther, uncil thae coming, as I have said, one morning to visit <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, with a purpose, is he
found her aIone,co declare co her tbe pashon which he was in for me;not finding her yec awake,
and making as chough he would accend cill she was, he caused himsds to be led to my cham-
Der; when he came thieher, I had almost done reading a Letcer from Vlama, who, provoked
Dythetorccof hispashon, and ehe fear he was in left the ^o^A^s love should prevail wich me
more chen his, conjured me co remember che promises which I had made him; never to love
yJai!"' and consequently, passed overagainallcbe tcstimonies of assedion which I had
rendred him, that so he mighc oblige me not eo deprive him of it.

<p>much the more, for that he had commanded Amariel to stay in a gallery, thtouohwh" h
was to pass for to come into my chamber. When I saw my self alone wich A/ZJS ^
cept It were a maid that served me, and in whom I consided in all things, I was taken witsi
such impatience to mike an end of reading Vlama's Leccer, as presendy after the first ci I
ties, I began co unsold it as softly as pofsibly I could, and wichouc answering precisell'r'"
Mahamed's discourses I read chat which Vlama writ unto me.  Mahamed, who certaV
hath a great deal of understanding, and that according to rhe custom of rhe blinde isjIw^k
alitjiesuspicious, though out of discretion hemakesashcrle shew of icas maybe, hearing
the noisc which the Letter made in turning ie from che one side to tbe other, ss, r it was indis¬
serent long) imagined that there was some mystery in it which he did not comprehend • thai
peradventure the Sophi had during his sickness absolutely gained me, and thac tbe pap^T
which I h Id, and whereof he heard the noise, was a Letter from him, or from Delmmt-
In so grievous a thoughc, this so wise and so moderate a Prince could not resist tbe ttmptati!
on of clearing himself of a doubt,wh!ch gave him so much urq lietness; so that at such tinn
as I never dream'd of it, and chac I was solding up Vlama s Leccer again, and deeply muling
on thac which I had read, Mahamed direding his hand by the noise which I made in doing
it up, chance led it so just where it should be, chac he snatched ic from me sooner then I was
able to wiehstand him. / must needs know, said he, amiuble Srlixana, whether this hklti
Paper, which hath kept you from answering me, merits the honor you do it to mj prmdici.
My Lord, said I unto liim exceedingly eroubled,//^yo^sua/^/ss what ts in thu Letter, I
Vnouldnot resist jour pleasure ; but smee you cannot know W'hat it is but by a third iirjw
permit that I may conjure jou to render it me.  This extream earnestness ihae I shewed to
draw that Paper ouc ofhis hands was chac which provoked his curiofity che more; and thoDgh
he did insinitely fear to displease me, yet did he fear much more to be over-reached. And
then again, beleeving Amariel to be very saichlul, he thought he should hazard nothing, in
resolving to let him read it.  In this opinion the .more I importuned him, ehe more did hc
desend himself fromaccording chat which I required; and I verily beleeve chac in sogreati
trouble I should have told him the truch of the matter, and consided in his generofity, \[dt-
liment, who had been advertised that Prince i^&lt;i^4Wir^ was m my chamber, had notcoiw
thieher wich Ismael, of whom he made use upon all occasions, co trouble our conversation
For he feared that so particular an incerview would discover che crick chey bad playd us j and
that thinking to destroy our friendship, chey should seccle it beceer then before. Bjt thit
which they feared was far from arriving, for Mahamed and I had other manner of thougta
then to entertain our st Ives wich Leteers, which we bad received from one another. Wtei
first I saw//w***^^ and Deliment, I testified a greac deal of unquiecness; and addressing my
self to Mahamed wich an anger, which I had noc much ado co councetseic: Toupercetmns]
Lord, said I unto him, that bad examples are soon followed; andthat the liberty vk^
JOU have taken to enter into my chamber, hath d^an&gt;n in a company, ivhich I ou^htnitu
have admitted Without the commandment ofthe Trincess. The Princess, teplyed I)tlit»s^\
doth sljedissofe of all your anions? Tes, said I untohim, andso absolutely, aslmn-
capable of ever disobeying her.  So chaC, continued he, is one were in love \\'ithy»H, »&gt;«/
he address himself to the Princess ? That he must without doubt, answered I him round¬
ly . for I beleeve her to beso just, as she will never force me in things, whereuson iest**
all the felicity, or aH the infelicity of my life.  We had, ie may be, concinued in further aK
had not one come and advertised them, that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was awake, and chac chey mightlw
her.  They left me then to go to her; howbeit Prince Mahamed stay'd noc long in thesti"-

cess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, whom he had found yec more rebellious chen she used to be. As soon as he
appeared / "^Hl no longer seek , |»icl he unco him, for that which ts the cause of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> s
riqor and that which makss her despise my presents, my love, and even the hope of my
O-owH ■ for ic was crue, chac Deliment entertained me dayly wich such like matcers. Ithmk,
mv Lord, answered Deliment, how that Vehtch renders <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> inslexible ts. That the know,
ledg of your greatness permits her not to beleeve, that you Wil I forget it for her advantage ;
and the resttsals Vehichst^e makes, are nothing doubtless but that she maj be the more strong-
ly assured of that which she desires it may be more then you. No such matter, replyed Che
Sophi, and thti which I have here Veill certainly make you change your opinion; in saying
so, he shewed him Vlamp's Leccer, whereby chey knew but too well the good-will that was
becwixe us, and how much he was informed ot chac which the Sophi bore me. Ac sitst,
all r^c/!)W.M thoughts ran into violence; he would commie me Co prison; he would destroy
Vlama ; and his gentleft resolueions were ac least Co banish him.
</p>
<p>^m Deliment, who always joyned cunning to wickedness, told him, that che first ching
he should do, was, eo banish <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> from ehe heare of Vlama, and Vlama from cbe heart
of <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>; tbac Co begin by che easiest, Vlama was to be dextrously acquainced, that!
had a particular commerce wich Mahamed; and chac Co perswade him the beceer thereunco,
he was to be shewed some of the letters which I had written Co ehe Prince,and which ehey had
recained; leting him know,in giving them to hirn,tbat they were che first he had received from
me; ehae Co disquiet him further, his own Letter was eo be shewed him, wich an assurance
ihat I had pue ie inco bis hands, tor to give him an undoubced mark of my assedion; and thac
ac the very same cime, whtn as chis crick had exciced crouble in his soul, he was co be com¬
manded Co gee instantly ouc of ehe Palace, and the next day from the Court, with order to
retire co the Province, whereof he was Governor; co the end he mighc noe have leasure co
clear himself Co me; and chac beleeving he was becmyed, he might have the less care to let me
hear from bim. Thac things being in chesc terms, ic would be the easier to vanquish me, be¬
cause not knowing tbe occasion which Vlama had to be incensed against me, I would take it
ill chac he did neither write to me, nor see me before his departure. That the most important
pc)inc of chis sst'air was, to be so well assured of all chofe which came neer me, as I mighc re¬
ceive no Leteers from Vlama; and thac m sine, the absence of a Lover was a greac advantage
for a Rival.
</p>
<p>The Sophi found this advice to be very good, and thinking on nothing buc how to exe¬
cute ic, chey turned their eyes upon one of Mahamed's Officers, thac had before rimes served
VUma, who had rid himself of him by reason of his bad inclinations. They caused him
tobcsoughcouc, and having immediately found and suborned him, he without surcber de¬
lay sascer he had been instrudcd by Delment whac to say, and had Vlama's Letter, and ehree
ot those which I h^d mitten to Mahamed, pue into his hands) wencdiredly lo Vlama
wnom I could noc yec advereise of chac which had past betwixt the Prince and me, becsuse
the Sophi'i love disquieted him so much, as he could not resolve to see nie, for fear of giving

<p>too much notice of his thoughts; and therefore to keep him from it, he made as thn^oi, J
were exceedingly busied about the affairs of Caramania, vihexe the Sophi intended ; l
some Levies: Yet heard I for all that from him every day by thac faithsul Slave which hp s
to you, and you have brought to me.          '  ^'
</p>
<p>This Agent of the Sephi'% found him then in such an estate as they desired for the surprizjnp
of hirn; became to him, and finding him alone, makes him'a long discourse of the inclinits
on which he had always had to his service; protesting untohim that he would never rdin-
quish it; that he acknowledged him still for his Matter, and chat to render him a prod of
his assedion, he came, without considering Prince i^*^si»)s&lt;:s'/ interests, to advertise him of
a Treason which I committed against him. Vlama upon chis occasion had a secret spspi.
cion of this mans malice; and imagined thac he was sent unco him to discover whethct there
were any intelligence beewixt us; so that nothing moved with chis discourse, / than\ tkti
laid he untohim, for thy z^eal andaseClion; but k»ow, my friend, that <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> W4;M
disoblige me, but cannot betray me, having had no commerce Vpith her, nor havino tvtr
trusied any thing to her discretion. I perceive very ^ell, my Lord, answered this man
that you do not trust in mine ; but it may be this Letter,Vc'hich I present you Voith,willi)tttcr
perswade my fidelity unto you. In saying so, he gave him chat which he had written to me.
You may judg now whecher Vlama were astonished when he came toknow it; Howbeit
this first motion being over, he imagined further, that I peradventure mighc have lost it, and
some one have found it. But che cunning of this man left him noc long in chis opinion; for see¬
ing Vlama moved, and capable of being perswaded, he told him. That Prince AUhmd had
loved me a great while, andthat I also loved him; Thatso long ashc beleeved, that there
could no other harm arrive to him, chen to bc deceived by me, he durst noc betray Mik-
med; buc having seen by the Letter, which he had written to me, andwhich, hesaid, I bad
put inco the Princes hands, thac he spake in such sort, as is it came to the Sophi'% knowledg,
his fortune would be utterly ruined ; he was resolved to make use of the Princes blindnessto
draw it with address from out of his hands j and, my Lord, continued he, tofhev ytittk
I ssseak, truth, I have taken also three of tbe Letters ^hich <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> hath Written utk
Prince in the beginning of their aseShon; str as for the resl, I durll not meddle ^ith thtm,
because as they are more obliging, so the 'Prince makes them to be read unto him almofiitp
ty by Amariel, '^ho is the Consident of this love.
</p>
<p>Vlama barkened to t.his discourse, looked on her Letters and his, knew the hands, mi
no longer doubting of myinsidelicy, he thanked chis wicked man, and asked him an hundred
questions about the love that was between ehe Prince and me. But the other fearing thithe
would demand so many things of him, as in the end he might coneradid himsds in some one
or other, he besought him he would be pleased to let him depart, for fear left is any ot Prince
Mahamed's Officers should see him go out of his lodging so long ascer he was entred ino
it, ihey might susped the truth. Vlama deceived by chis artifice, dismissed him, promised
to recompence him, and prays him to continue advertising what should pass betwixt PrWK
Mahamed and me.
</p>
<p>He was hardly out of Vlama's chamber, when, according to Deliment's advice, that ow
Satrap, whom as I have told you he had corrupted, came and commanded him from the
Sophi to go itistantly out of the Palace, and che next day to depart to his Government, until
he received further order.  And whereas 'L'irtiw^ importuned him to tell him, whyhewij
entreated after that manner ? The .J^i/rrs;? answered him, That the Soiphi onely k"'^''''"^
that he had charged him not to leave him tilh he "Hoas out of the Palace.  Seeing then»**"

Bering, that he left all the Letters which I had written him in his Cabinet, JiewentDoi J
thither to take them away; and without knowing whether it were out of a sense ot en

well satished ofher, andthat it is rather choller then love, which carries me to the entertatn-

somany strange things at once, said the Princess unco him, asl doubt whecher I should be¬
leeve them; for to cell me chat you are in love with the beauty of Seltxana^nd thit Seltxatta,
in whora I conside in all chings, stiould make your assedion a secret unto me, is thai which!
cannot comprehend, and chac which I stiall not beleeve, unless you give ms stronger proots ot
it. I didnotsaj t0yoM,xep\yeithe?xince,That lam in love With the beauty 0/<hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>,
butindeedthatlloveVeihim; And beleeve, dear sister, that the beauty WbereVsiith I am
taken, though it wounds not tbe heart through the eyes,yet leaves not touching it very power¬
fully J but in conclusion I am not come hither to tell you what hath made me in love, but onely
that lamso. Asfor Sdixana, that Which hath kept her,as I conceive,from speaking to joh of
thatasseClionwhichIhadfor her, is, that she hath none for me. Ani would to heaven I
cryed he. That she had not concealed a thingfromyou, Which without doubt touches her more
sensibly at the heart. Whereupon be recounted unco her the discourses which he had used to
me; ehe answers which I bad made thereunto; the leccers which he had written to me, the
returns I had made bim; ar^d ac last acquainced her how he had snatched away a letter from
me, whereae I had shewed a great deal of unquietness; and that having caused eAmariel to
read it to him, he had found ic co be a Lovedeeter, and had thereby understood that I had been
a long cime engaged in assedion Co him tbac wrote it unto me, and who questionless sas might
be judged by chac which he said )ougheeo be a man of great qualicy; That his misfortune
not permiting him co know the hand, he requested her to read ic, that he might at leastwise be
assured ofthe name of his Rival. Saying so, he presented her wich that soistcd paper, which
Amarielhii given bim in stead of Vlama's lecter, and the Princess having taken and opened
is, wichout finding any thing wriccen therein, could not chuse bussigh, and lament the mis-
fortunc of this poor Prince.
</p>
<p>Surely, said she unto bim, you have deceived your self in taking one paper for another, for
I see nothing in this same. 0 Sister I said che Prince, who litde suspeded the wickedness
thac had been done him, /^w^r^s truth ; you know the hand ofthis letter, but out of discre¬
tion you will not tel it me,and by this adress you would draw it out of my hands. No such mat¬
ter replyed the Princess, and I assure you chac I have spoken seriously: Why did you sigh then,
continued he, in unsolding this letter ? Ic was, answered che Princess, because I saw it was

<p>ved them The Princess, impatient to see whac I had written to the Prirce. took one of rt
letters which he presented to her, and having read it, was as much surprised asheW
</p>
<p>I think you well remember, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> , that all the lectcrs which I had w'rirss^^
yr^4^^w.^ were in the Sopht's hands, and chac those which Aman. I had given to the S

Princess knew persedly my hand, I cannot tell, said she to Mahamed, whether you willb^
leevc that which I am going to say to you; buc I am assured thac <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> never wrote the
letters which you have shewed me. Certainly, answered the Prince, is l could doubt cs mr
love, I Jhould not beleeve that which yoa tell me; but, my dear sistir, ^s I chirsl InLun-
treat JOH to read them aloud, that Imay know whither by any imhammsr,t the seHctUil,
been altered as well as the hand, Which Amariel hath always assured me was Sclixina'j
The Princess,to satishe him, read two ofthose leccers, which che Prince acknowledged tobe
the same he had heard before. I should beleeve, said the Princess chen to him, that Schxur.i,
knowing you could not see but wich ehe eyes of another,batb counterseited her hand, or it may
be hath caused chese letters eo be wriccen wich an unknown one, for fear It st some of them
should be seen, or lost; but thac which perswades me chere is something in che matter which
we cannot comprehend, is, Thac they are noching like eo <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>'s side, which I know very
well; for I saw almost every leccer thac she sent co Mazanderon when as she wrote to her
Father. I cannot for all that C6mprehcnd,rt^\yed che Prince,:r^rtr trick_there Jhould be intlis-
for surely Amzxklis faithsul to me, andyet the letters which Ihave shewed yeu are not jt
obliging as ¥ehxindi's discourse ujeu to be, when I entertained her. Ac length after they had
reasoned well Cogecher abouc ic, withouc being able co comprehend oughc therein, and had
sent a faithsul person to che Princes chamber to fearch for Vlama'skttex, chey resolved to
send for me,ae thac very cime when as having striven to banish shame and tear trom my minde,
I had resolved co go and cast my self at che Princesses seec, and to rely more upon her assedion
then on mine own innocence.  I arrived then ac her chamber just as she commanded oneto
go for me; which I had no sooner heard, as I was coming in, buc seeing tbe Prince with her,
and a many of Leccers on the Table, wich a paper made up in che same manner as I/'/^jw/j
was, which the Prince had taken from me, I no longer doubced buc thac ehe Princess knew
the cruth of everything, for I could not be ignorane thac she was well acquainced with l'-
lama's hand; So ehae salling on my knees before her, I perceive very well, Aladam, said I
unto her, that all my faults are known to you, andthat coming with a purpose to accnsent]
self, there is nothing mere left for me to do, then to beg your pardon for them, after I l:d
tryed nevertheless to render them more excusable then the incensed Jpirit of Prince Mi-
med would make them appear to you.  ^omplain not of the Prince, answered Aximiu,
since is he be culpable of any thing, it ts of being too little sensible of ycur fault; wW
yet I ought not to condemn in him, since notwithstanding the ii'.jury you have done m, I
have indulgence enough sttll to hear your reasons, or rather your excuses,  AfterlsisJ
thanked ehe Princess for this grace, I began to recounc unco her all chac had pist betwixt "'-
lama and me; for whereas I beleeved chac I saw his Leccer lie by che Princess, and that I was
sure she knew his charadcr, I disguised noching unco her: Buc for so much as regarded ths
Prince, I could noc tell very well how to speak of it; for noc knowing whac he had said to
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, I feared Co displease him, is I should deliver things as chey bad past. Howbeit
thePrincess, having marked my unquiecness; Fear not, said she, to speak ofthedjst^"'^
Which my brother bears you, .seeing I am not ignorant of any one circumstance of it: h-
vertheless, to justisie the relation which he hath, andwhichyou have also made to me of it,
will know it from your mouth too.

<p>thac Vlama made no exception but of her alone, would be an impoflible thing, as well as
to recounc unto you thac which I said in this occasion; the lamencacion chac Pnnce Mdmd
made; tbe pardons chac he begged of me; and che sorrow A.viamira was in, co see herself
deprived of the en.ly man, in whom shc consided; and withall, ie would be toolon.^and
toowcarisom a discourse; buc in sine, ehe Princess, having caused chat Slave to relate unto
her in whac manner Vlama wenc ouc of ehe Palace, told him, That is he had any s^s«
say to me from his Master, he might do it Without fear ; and I having consirmed that which
the Princess said to him, he gave me a Note, which I shall never forget,and whose veiy words
were thtse.
</p>
<p>Ulama's Note to <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>.
</p>
<p>IS you had not betrayed me, I should have dyed with grief, rather then havedsentci
my self sris^ you ; but after your infidelity, my bani/hment is a grace; stnce I ^uittii
i^^t <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, till <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> abandoned me. I cannot for all thatr^olveto part, Ssithmt
telling her once for all, that I part the most infortunate of all men living • and that is k
end of my life may ast'ure her felicity, she Jhall soon be in the eslate that I desire k
to be irt.
</p>




<p>Theend of the reading hereof was to me the beginning of the shar pest grief thatevctl
selc: And che alone choughc of being beleeved unsauhs^ul by a man, forwhom Iresusedthe
Crown of 'Persta, was so strange a corment Co me, as my reason is noc strong enough tore-
tain ehe resencmene which I had of ic. Whac I Madam, said I co che Princess, can you live
in a place where such wickednesses are commieeed? and against persons tbac apperninto
you? Was it not enough Co banish'L'/^iw^, withouc perswading him by some impoOuts,
which is unknown Co me, thac I bad betrayed him? andiemsybc icis I which causes him
to be banished. This arcisice doubtless hides some greacerdesign,chen ches paratingof us;
and I greatly fear chat this violence will quickly be followed by anocher; and chac after thcj/
have taken from you che onely desender which you had here, you will know by your exp-T-
ence, that you have as much incerest, as <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, in cbe conservaeion of Vlama. For sure¬
ly Deliment thinks not so much of concencing che Sephis passion, as of sacissying that whiclj
he hath for you: And this Insolenc regards you withouc doubc, as a reward chac was destinw
to him for the conquest which he preeends to make of me; buc s am righc certain thatdeatlj
shall deny me her succor,or he shall never triumph in chis fore. The Princess seeing a great de^
of probabilicy in thae which I said, could noc chuse buc accompany my cears with hers; ana
vW^i^rsWsi/was soasshded, as achwarc my sorrow I saw his resentment.
</p>
<p>Butatlasi, for ehe becter clearing of ehe maecer, ic was demanded of chac Slave, wni
V lama h^d done all theday, and what hehad seen? Then herelaced, how oneof Pnnce
Mahamed's Officers came unco him; had calked wich bim in secret, and given him some k^^
tcrs, which very much asshded him; and thac immediacely after he had received the a^^ J
mandment to be gone. But in What place u Ulama at this present, said the ^J^^^^^

vet was ic ac che least morequiee, and his despair was curned into a more moderace assiirtion.
Mahamed also Would gladly have been able himself to have sene some marks of his friend¬
stiip to Vlama, buc he was fain co assure him by the hand of the Princess, thae he would al¬
ways be nis friend, wichouc ever being his Rival again. These LeeceiS being wntctn, che
fear left they should be incercepced came inco my minde; so chat eo prcvene ic, che Prmeess
sene for an old Slave, whom she had proved to bevery faithsul, and having given them to
him, she commanded him to attend thae of Vlama ac ehae gacc of the Ci;y where be was to
pass- and there to deliver chem to him in such fore, ss no body might perceive ir. This pro¬
vidence was noe in vain, for this Slave of V lamas was no sooner come forth of tbe Princesses
lodging.buc he wafarrested by Deliment'soxdex,2x\d asked for ehe Leteers which he carryed to
Vlama; buc knowing very well chac he had none, he answered wichouc daunting, how he
was ready eo mike ic appear chat they were mistaken; and said surcber, thae his Master having
had no cime to take his leave of the Princesses, and none of his servancs being wich him buc
he, he had sent him wich a complemenc to them; and whereas he was hard by Perca's lodg¬
ing, he would have gone in there, to give the more colour to this ofsicious lye; howbeit they
would not permit him cill they had throughly fearched him all oVer, to see is he had spoken
the cruth: And when chey found thac he had noe that which they thought he had had, they
let him go, and so he finished his voyage, afterhehad taken our Letters from him to whom
we had committed them.
</p>
<p>As for us, seeing the matter in these terms, we resolved that the Princess should assure her
scls of them, whom the beleeved were faithsul unto her, by new protestations ofthe assedi¬
on they had promised her. That I should write secretly to my Sacher, to the end chat is we
were enforced to have recoursc to excream remedies, and thae shghe was the onely one that
rested for us, Mazanderon might be in an estate co receive us. Thae in ehe mean cime, to
prevent ehe Sophi, before hehad taken his last resolueions, we should publish the business,
complain to all the world of Deliment's insolency; and thac the nexe morning she should go
and request ehe ^o/&gt;^&lt; to forbid him from ever seeing her again; because it mighe be, thae he
durst ns)e so easily then propound a thing to her, whereunto she shewed her self so averse, as
when disguising her ehonghes in the maner she had always done, he mighe seem eo be ignorant
that she had so much repugnancy unco ic Thae to perplex him so much the more, she should
send to encreae sive or six persons, thae were well assedcd to her, to be present at the Sophi's
rising rhe nexe day; and chat afterwards we should srame oar designs according to the an¬
swer he should make. That Mahamed should by his Governors means do whac he could to
cause ^W4ns/to be caken; that for so much as regarded me I should by no means bc absent
from the Princess, and that for fear of some violence I should lie in her chamber in the place
ot her that always waiced upon her there. This resolution was execueed,as we had conceived

<p>though the banisttment of UUim had both surprized and assiiUed her, because she hde
him to be the most asselied of all hii su bjeCls to the good ofhis Empire, yet the reshell "ll
she bare him Would never permit her to murmur at it: And to tell you what hath br
me hither, continued she, with both a modest and an hardy countenance, it is not to aS
grace, but to complain of an outrage Which Ihave received, and for which I come to dm J
justice of you, in the presence of those that hear me ; for stnce I hold the publishing ofacrim
to be the beginning of punishing it, I Would that all your subje£is were Witnesses of the n-
sation I am going to make.  The Sophi was so surprized with this discourse, that in thecoiv
susion he Was he never dream'd of Deliment; so thac after he had assured her, that he would
proted het against all that would wrong her, she proceeded wich raore assurance chen before
I have ever beleeved,my Lord, said she unto him, that having the honor to be your damkir
you would take my interests for your own; and therefore I do not fear to tell you thiu n m^,'
Whose birth is base, whoje minde is full of artifice, whose bad inclinations are disguisti m

he conceals all his deseEls from you ; hath had the temerity to pretend to marry ms, ani u
Ipeak openly to me of love: And though I have forbidden him with all the severity ■nhtrt'
of I am capable, yet when he saw that my re^seU to you k^pt me from complaining to yonts
a man whom you love, he hath continued With so much insolency, that I was not abletofits.

to bear that glorious name, is I could endure, that a man, who Without your bomtymiskt
Without shame be mystave, Jhould be so audacious as to tell mt that he will be my husjud.
Tar don me, my Lord, is I am carryed this Way in this occasion, since this ralh man kjkii
insolency asfronts you no less then me; and your interest is no less consident'^ tomttki
mine own.  Howbeit I do not desire that you should deprive your self of his presence, is it
be agreeable unto you, but onely that you Will forbid Dehment from ever seeing or j|imss«|
to me more.  Behold welnigh after what manner the Princess spake; who, to keep the Sofk
from interrupting her, had st) much address, as not to nanje Deliment, but ac the end of het
discourse, which strangely surprized the Sophi.
</p>
<p>Now though he was very much in choller, and that he had resolved to make thismartlage,
yet durst he not before so much company tell het openly what his minde was: Buc to disgi
the matter; I see Well enough, <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, said he unto her, that Deliment's ^rsrs/;/ crim
is your beleeving him to bean enemy to Ulama; howsoever stnce you have recoursc ti«j
justice,I will neither condemn nor absolve him,till I have heard his reasons. Which ptrdm-
ture Will not beso weak as you think: In the mean time be assured,that Delimenc &gt;?&gt;«//w'/j
any thing to you henceforward, but by order from me. The Princess Would fain have rcplytd,
hue the Sophi made her a sign to withdraw, which she did with a great deal of respest; k»-
ing the Sophi very much displeased, and all them thac had heard her ravished wich hcrgeneso-
sicy, and excreamly wondering at D&lt;r//&gt;we«t'i insolency, andthehtcle resencmene which *
Sophi had she wed. At our going from chence we met with 7/w4*/,followed by Deliment,viiB,
knowing noching of what the Princess had done, would have obliged the Prince co conduct
her to her lodging : But <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> beholding him with contempt, said unto him with an itj
censed voyce; / far bid thee from the Sophi to follow or to speak. to me ; and is thou w
know the cause of it, repair to him, and thou stialt learn that at last my patience huth ^.w
place to my generofity ; and that I am declared thy most mortal enemy Delment, m
with a discourse which he expeded not, could scarce tell what to answer; and wclet'^"
so blank, as he remained a good while in the place without knowing what to do.  ,
</p>
<p>But a length, having left Ismael, he went unto the Sophi, who gave him an accoP
^Wrllvsi. after he had commanded all those forth whom he suspeded  ^g
sswthTn that it was time for him to employ all his address; and to that essed he catt b ^
at the ^rss feet, beseeches him to remember, how it was by his command thathe t.

I have already Cold you, illustrious Bassa, how he who waited that day at the Sopht 9
Cabinet door, over-heard all that I have recounted unto you; for the passion, wherewith
Deliment was carryed away, permitted him not to have so much prudence as to speak low;
n-itherdid the .yo&gt;^t's love and choller leave him the sike providence. This man having heard
all these things, selc himself so couched with the mischiets they were preparing for us, ashe
resolved to advertise us of it. Ic is crue indeed, that his generofity was in this occasion excited
by a particular hacred whichhe bare Deliment, who had many times opposed the advance¬
ment of his fortune.  At length this man came in the Evening to advertise us of all these
things; after which we alsolearned that which had past inthe trick that y^?»&lt;«m/had put
upon as.  For Prince Mahamed had caused his anciene Governor so to deal, as he had layd
hold on the Tray cor y^WsirtV/, who out of thesame weakness wherewich he had becmyed
his Master, recounced unto us how Deliment had corrupced him; and how he had carryed all
my leccers Co cbe Sophi, who had always caused ochers to bc wriccen for Co bc sent to Maha¬
med ; from whom likewise they had retained all those which he had made to be written to
me, to give me counterscic ones in stead of them.  That afterwards he had carryed Vlama's
Leccer, which he had snatched from me, to the Sophi; who by Deliment's counsel had cau¬
sed ic Co sall inco Vlama's hands, wich three ochers of those which I had essedively writeen
to the Prince.  We knew chen chac Evening all the hurt that they had done us, and all that
which they would do us; whereupon we promised to pardon the Tray tor, and to recom¬
pence him thac was saichsul unco us, dismishng chem both, with diredion to eieher ot them co
be vigilanc for ehe good of ehe Princess. Ascer these sad news our tears redoubled far more
then before.  The Princess would dye, Iwas fully resoved to follow her, Mahamed wis
mad because he could not assist us; and in so great a trouble we lamented our misfortunes,
withouc knowing how Co avoyd chem.  "  '  ■  &lt; •  - ■  • ^

was going to undertake; and to that end, when as he stiould come to speak to the Princts
she should have recoursc to tears and to prayers, rather chen to reason, which he would J,'
understand: That is they should not be strong enough to divert him from his dcsit^ns, as it«/«
very likely they would not, she should then request him co asford her some time to resolve
to obey him.  And to the end she might not by her sadness give him new occasions of dis
pleasure, she should d.^mand permission of him to absent her self from the Court for can n
months, with a promise no longer to resist hi? pleasure when she returned thither again; tb
in the mean time it might happen, that che Sophi might repent him; that the love wh'chhc
bare me might be alcered,or allayed by absence; but, conci.iued he, the principal is, Thatso

Priacess but to dye.  tAnd for my part, said the Princess, / k,now full well th^i Sehxsm
siall not dye without me, and that I will never abandon her to the violences esmisatkr,
In conclusion, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, without rchearsing this sad conversacion to you, it m
resolved, that is the King should accord <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> that which she was to demand of him
and yet would retain me, I should then desire him, with all che shew of sorrow and tendr-
ness I could pofsibly express,to permit me to follow the Princess; it being credillc that the.Jt.
phi would not resuse me the first thing I should crave of him ; especially not mentioning ttai
my opposing of his pleasure.  It was not because the Princesses great heart did not resist tk
following this counsel, but because she being unable to finde out any other,was forced tocon-
sent unto it. The next day the Sophi came to the Princess, where after he had amplisied the
merit, the vercue, and the courage of Deliment, he told her that shc was not to take it ill, is
he had had the boldness to speak to her of love, seeing hc had not done it but by hifordet;
because, having resolved to marry her to him, he would have been glad that he should have
got her good-will.  My Lord, answered the Princess, with a seigned amazement, is I kl
known that the boldness, which Deliment hath used injpeakjng te me, had been an ejstHij
his obedience toy oh, I bad received him in another manner, I had not termed him aukc'm,
I had been contented With complaining, and not accusing of him, and had cast mjsstls*t]i»r
feet to cause you to change a design, Whereunto I have such an aversion, as I canmt simi
of it Without grief.  The Sophi seeing some change, as it seemed to him, of the PrinceKsS
minde, was extream glad of it; and though he saw she did not render her scls, he betetved
nevertheless, since she came to' entreaties, that with some pacience he mighc vanquish her.
This hope was that which induced him ehe more easily to grane her rhe request she madehim,
to give her time to resolve upon ir.  And truly he had been the cruelleft of all men, is ht™
not let himself be moved with the reasons, complaints, supphcacions, and tears of thers
amiable Princess chat ever was. But when he had permicced her to go co Mazanderon^ w^
she had propounded untohim for the passing away of the time of her exile, as insS
where she had been before times for her pleasure, he told her that she was to leave me bchrt
with the Princess Perca, tothe end the Court might not bedesolated, and for fearalsow
my father having me in his power, stiould not restore me nnto her when she returned. I ^
in a corner ofthe chamber, where I anderstood all thac they said; but when I h"^'^/,'"^'^

my self at his feet, and I said so many things, Ished so many tears, and answered hiinio^

on me, as atlength I found, that the tears of a beloved person are very powersul arms;  .
\ne,the Sophi granted me that which I demanded of him, though it were absolutely K

given us tobe revoked, wc parted away the next morning; yet was't "o^ without oir^

world, he did chac which you shall hear, and which txtreamly surprized us: for when we
m'mditMazanderon, we found chac my sacher was gone from thence to the Courc by the
commandment of the Sophi, from whom he had received express order to repair thither with
all speed; and thac by cbe counsel of Deliment, who as soon as he knew that wc were gone
to Mazanderon, perswaded the Sophi to send for my father, before we should be arrived
there; ini to ordain him to come another way, for fear of meeting us; to the end, said he to
the Sophi, that ss//'«^«s?, knowing her father in your hands, may not carry che Princess to
disobey you, nor her self to resist you, as hitherto she hath done. I leave yoa to judg whe¬
ther rhis adventure did not give us unquietness enough, especially to me. What I said I,
must I betray Vlama, or abandon my father to the Sopht's violence ? Ah, no I I had rather
dye; and not able to satishe both my duty, and my love to Vlama, I will dye that I may not
be wanting either to the one or the other. But at length we understood by a Letter, which
Prince Mahamed caused his sage Governor to write unto us, and by one thsit my Sa'.i.cs
sent me, how che Sophi entreated him very well, and made him hope for great things.

<p>The first sense of grief then being over, we began to breathe, and take some rest; But

since not doubting of his asscdion.you cannot doubt of his resentment of it. But indeed I will

tream v. inc^ ic might peradventure cause a general revolution of the State, which would
no be ad o'age us to him: So that to provide for all the misfortunes, which t™ght «rive
unto h.m, he had recourse to artifice.  And to that purpose just at the time W^jn »s the jJ.-
phi commanded Vlama to repair unto him, &lt;I&gt;enment made him be several ways advertised
of the bad designs, which were upon his life, and carryed themattersodextrously, as the
faithsiill. st of tny Masters friends served to the wickedness tjs this man; who in stead ot
keepine the design of ruining Vlama very secret, caused it to be bruited with address abroad,
two days before he, who was to carry the commandment to Vlama, set forth towards him:
So that when he came eot^/4»»4, he had already received advice spom many not to come to
the Court. Even Mahamed himself had caused him to be writeen unco about it, bue with
so many circumstances, as made him see his undoubced ruine, is he obeyed; in so much as it
was impofsible for him Co susped, that there was any artifice in all these things.  Some coun¬
sclled him CO seek out a place of reereat amongst strangers; promising to labor the justisying
of bis shght whil'st he was absent.  Ochers would have had him sortisie himself in his Go¬
vernment. But none advised him to trust to his innocency. I leave you to think. Madam,
whether De/iws«s's wickedness could have had a more favorable success? and whether all
these things were not capable of bringing to pass the design which he had, soto order the
matter, that Vlama should not onely not repair to the Sophi, but should also render himself
essedively culpable in the eyes of all the world, who after this would not be so forward in
undertaking his interests.
</p>
<p>'L'/^iw^ in this crofs con jundure knew not what resolution to take: for is, on theone
side, he considered the peril whereunto he should be expofed, by going to put himself into
his enemies hands; is he thought, I say, that you not being at Court, his party would thereby
be the weaker, znd'Deliment'sx.heskxongex; on the other side he saw, that in not obcylnr:
be left his Enemy Master of the Sield; that hesurnished him with Arms to destroy him , 'Cai'-
he should behave himself as is he were guilty; and to say all, that he should abandon you, and
&lt;\m<hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>. This last thought made him resolvc to go couragiously to the Court j how¬
beit he was kept si^om parting so soon, by a sickness wherewith sie was taken: but at length
finding himsds betcer, he see forth on his way, with a purpose to oppose Deliment's malice
as much as he could, and to forget nothing that might conduce thereunto. But scarcely had
we made two days journey sfor as you know. Madam, I have never abandoned him) when
as we encountred one of his dearest friends, who came in all haste to acquaint him, that all
the Courc was silled wich the news of your loss, ;ind <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>'s. That in the Royal House
ic was said, howgoingasishing yon were cast away; but chac such, as looked farther into
raaccers, beleeved chac your loss was a meer suppofition; and that without doobt youwera
kept shuc up in some pare. That it was an essed of the Sophi's passion, and of Deliment's
violence; that in the sassiion as the matter was carryed, there was no remedy to be sought for
It; thac going to the Court, he should sacrisice himselfnnprofitably for you, and much to the
advanrsge of Deliment; and that in conclusion, the best he could do was to seek a sanduary
with some Prince, mighty enough to desend him, and just enough to acknowledg bis merit.

us to bring him to his senses again, because withall we restored him to his sorrow and despair.

you stiould not discover any thing, yet must you take up Arms: For is you are igriorant where
<hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> is, you are not ignorant at least-wise who are the Enemies of the Princess Axii-

him, that it would be almost an impofsiblc thing ; again he would present himself to M-

a conclusion of all, he still returned to the resolution of dying.  At leng.h without opposing
our selves diredly to his grief, we knew so well how to inspire his minde with choller, as isc
sole design of revenging you preserved hishfe.  He resolved then to return tohisGovOT-
ment for to think of the means he was to use for the same.  As for his friend, he sent m
back again, and pray'd him still to advertise him of whatsoever stiould pass at thetoflrt,
and to endevor to discover in what place you were retained; for he made no question at au,

^noLs whadie bad written, and considing inhis generofity he would put h'mself into
nitiHra which is within <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s dominion, and not above four days journey from Via-
tt.'. Government. As indeed. I was no sooner departed, but my Master, after,. had writ¬
ten to tbe taithiuUest of his friends, to entertain some intelligence with them, in case he Ihould
have need ot it, set forch cowards Siri/iA; and committed himself into the hands of one,
named .S.r.s^^^. unto whom this Town appertained, as Vassal of the 0//jow^« Empire. But
thouph^'/^?».»told him, that he came to seek the protedion of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and that he
hid ^o thac essed dispatched one eo <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>; yeC chis man, being of a cruel dispofiti¬
on and provoked by an indiscreec and bruicisti zeal, in stead of barely assuring himselt of his
person, by pucting a guard upon him, uncil he heard from <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, he caused him co bc seiz¬
ed upon, Co be bo'und, and in chic deplorable estate sent him to Constantinople.
</p>
<p>In the mean time I had made my voyage very happily; and having delivered my Letter to
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, I well perceived thathe was very joysul of ic; that the reputation of my Master
was come even unto him ; and that he was not ignorant of his high birch; As truly a little
after, he obtained for Vlama all that he had demanded ; And as he was preparing to send to
receive him with honor, and was talking with him in the Hipodrome, before his Palace gate,
about my return, I saw my Master arrive bound upon a horse, his hands manacled, and his
face so changed, as I hardly knew him: but being sure it was he, without thinking of the
resped I owed to the grand Visier, Hest him, and approaching to'L'/^w**; My Lord, said
I to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, suffer not him whom you mean to proted to be so unworthily entreated; nor
let the valianc Vlama be chained like a Slave.  Vlama I cryed che grand Visier: Yes, gener¬
ous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, concinued I, you behold chac Vlama, whose valor is incomparable ; whose'
bitch is as noble as any in all Tersia; and who bach demanded protedion of none but you.
I had no sooner said thus, but <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> ran himself to unloofe my Master; and beholding
them which accompanyed him with sury, he willed me to help him, which I did witha
great deal of joy. As for Vlama, he was in such a consusion to see himself in that estate, as
he could almost have wished that I had not named him: but the thing being done, and hav¬
ing understood that the ^rrs«s/ Sister spike the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> Tongue; These chains, said heunto
him, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> sfor he had observed that I had named him so) are glorious unto me,
seeing they are taken siom me by so illustrious an hand as yours: And owing my liberty to
you at our very first encounter, judg whether all tbe rest of my life I shall not absolutely de¬
pend on you ? It is true, replyed <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> embracing him, that these chains are not slaamesul,
but for thole that have made you wear them; and by a sate clean contrary to that of all deli¬
verers, I must, ascer the sreeing you of them, crave pardon of you for the ill usage you have
received; yet sofar happy at least-wise herein, as you cannot susped ^o/&lt;w&lt;«» for it, who, is
I be not deceived, will make them seel tbe weight of your chains which have layd them on
you.  Vlama answered thereunto with a great deal of civility, and at length the grand
Visur caused him to enter into bis Palace, which was hard by, charging some of his servants
to se;ze upon them thac accompanyed Vlama, for fear left any of chem should steal away, to
go and advertise Seresbeg how his indiscrcet zeal was not well received.  When these two
illustrious persons were come in, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> shewed Vlama the Letter he had written him
the order he bad taken for his reception; and after he had told him, that he might comand ill
his house, he went to give an account of his arrival to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who wasso incensed a
gainst Serejbeg, that his anger broke out terribly upon him, as you shall understand

<p>In the mean time the Bassa came back to setch my Master to the Serraolio • and,, rh.
a sympathy between great men, which makes them from the very first tsm of thet In  ''

suddenly to be such friends, as I was mightily surprized with it.  But nt rpsots^'

Iignv, the very same day that he arrived at Constantinople, the War of Persia was condudd
w,Krher .t were inregard of thatwhich theGeorgiens had done; or of the Levies whih
Tachm.u had made; or of some reasons which I could noc well learn: So tbac Ibr,ihimK
&lt;\^x^^nt^n-Vlama there with.and asking of him,whether he would willingly serve in it hews,'
morejoytu! at .t then I am able co express. The ;-^/^ understanding his inccncions'adve
tised Sohman thereof, who thought sit, whirst the War was a preparing, to have o7. «,&lt;
return un o the frontier, the more easily to entertain his intelligences.  But to make him re-
rurnthuli:r with glory, and execute that which bad been resolved, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> caused W.
beg to be declared guilty of high Treason; and Bitiltsa. which the other pofsessed, to^e"
tha With all the rest of his estace, to be conserred on Vlama; as also a yearly Pcnsion ofin
sundred thonsmd Sultanins, and the Government of Carahemida, the frontire Townof
Diarbech, or A-Iejapotamia. My Masters generofity carryed him to resuse tbc spoyls of his
Eieoiy, as much as pofsibly he could ; but the Sultans pleasure was to be obeyed.
</p>
<p>This Declaration being made, i'tr^/^s^ was advertised of it by some friends that he had
at Const-antinople; so that, provoked wich anger, he stole away; and pashng inco iheSofhi's
Territories, he went andofs'ered him his service.  In so much as it seemed, that thesetwo
Princes had made an exchange, and given hoftages to each other: Though it is true, that the
matter was not equal for the persons, Seresbeg having nothing recommendable in him, but
a brutish valor, which carryed him into perils without knowing them.  But at last Vlmt
repaired to BitiUsa, whereat his first coming hefound sit matter to exercise his generofity
upon ; for Seresbeg's Wise and Children came and cast themselves at his feet, and wholly dis¬
solved into tears, humbly besought him to grant them the grace of her Husband and their
Father. "L'/^w** jRiswered them, that had he been in an estate to receive it, hc would havc_
used bis uttermost endevor to have obtained it of the Sultan: but as things were, it wasa
propofirion which he durst not make.  Then they rcquesled him, at least-wise not to entreat
them ill.  Vlama, who had no such intent, assured them, thae Bitilija exapted, which he
was bound to conserve for the grand Signior, he would not keep any part of their estste
from th' m,though thty had very great riches; and told them moreovcr,that it they would con¬
tinue in BitiUsa, they stiould be respeded there as himself; or is they would go from thents,
hc would obtain permission of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to have them conduded whithersoever they pleased.
This aslsl:ded and generous woman, see'mgV lamas courtesie, besought him so to deal as
she might be suffered to follow the fortune of ber Husband; ^Nh\ch Vlama promised her,
and performed a httle after.  For having obtained of the Sultan that which he had desired of
him for her and her children, he caused all their wealth to be loaden in Waggons; and having
assured them ofthe restirution of BitiUsa, is peace were concluded, or is Seresbeg re-entred
into favor with the Grand Signior, he sent them with a convoy of four hundred sHrnurit'
into the Sophi's Territories; for some Troups were already come unto him for his saseguard,
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having given command to all the Sangia's thereabouts to march whithersoever s/«-
ma would lead them.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, whereas you and i='&lt;'/».s:&lt;i«« were the cause of all that he did, hisontiy
care was to discover is any news could be had of you.  He wrote also to Prince Mahnwdi

S JhL; Heso animated his Soldiers then by his ^^s Pl^'/'/s K Tsof s'^l

terred in any Countrv, but his own: and to chat essed, though Seresbeg had so highly ofsend¬
ed vet he obrained of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> that he should be layd in the sepulchre of his fathers at Bitt-
Hsa wbi.h was accordingly performed with all the ceremony accustomed in such like occasi¬
ons' As long as this War lasted, Vlama did what he could to encounter Delment; but not-
withstanding^sll his endevor for it, fortune would not let him fight wich him.
</p>
<p>Inline, Madam, Wincer approaching, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> put part of his Troops meo Garrison, and
retired to Constantinople with <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>; leaving Vlama on the frontire, where he desired to
remain, not being able, as he oftentimes told me, to eloign himself from a Land, where he
beleeved you were still abiding. Not long after Vlama being advertised that the Sophi was
gone from Sultania, whither he had retted, and seemed to have some great design in band,
he drew most ot tbe forces out of the Garisons, and making up a body of an Army, he went
with it to opposc the Enemy. But the Sophi, who did not desire to fight with Vlama, saw
him no sooner in the sield, but he began to recoy l,contenting himself oriely with seizing on the
passager, and cutting ofs his viduals, carefully forbearing from descending into the plains, for
fear he she uld be forced to come to a battel. This artifice, which proceeded from ^Deliment,
would tor all that have availed him little, and my Masters valor would have surmounted this
stratagem, is the anger of Heaven had not been joyned to the anger of men, and sought for
tbe <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>s. For it happened that Vlama, having had bad intelligence, went and encamp¬
ed in that great plain, which is neer to Sultania, and as you know is invironed with four
mountains, whose tops are always coveted withsnow, chiefly those of Cassi^ indNipha-
tes. Vlama beleeving then that the J'&lt;?/&gt;/;/was retired behinde those mountains,at thefoot
whereof are the goodliest plains in the world, andthe most proper to fight a battel in, was
there erxamped, as I have already declared; but the Sophi bad taken another way, and
was retired into the Country of the Coraxens, As Vlama then was in this place, there a-
rofe on the rop of those mountains so terrible a tempest, as thewindc carrying away those
huge heaps of snow, wherewith they were covered, drove them in such abundance, and
with such raging force upon Vlama's Camp, as all the Tents were overthrown by them j
most ofthe Camels stisled; all the sick Soldiers overwhelmed; some of the others burieda-
live wich them; and all the test in consusion.
</p>
<p>And whereas rhe Snow had extinguished all the sires in the Army, the darkness joyned
to the roaring of the winds, to the noise which tbe Snow made in overturning the Tents,
totbecdesot the Souldiers in answer tothe Commands ot their Leaders, and to the la¬
mentations of dying men, rendered chis night so dreadsul, as I do not think one can meet
with an occasion able to give more terror then that did: the constancy of Vlama was noc for

Judgment: and causing himself from the first beginning of the storm tobe heard c '7 .'
could, he commanded every one to get out of their Tents, and afterwards to keeTinl'
S^aces, for fear left thinking to avoyd death, they might the sooner find it iVapproTcL^^^^^^
the^Mountains. But at last upon the return of the day, the tempest ended and the S"
us see one of the pitifulleft objeds that ever was beheld. This deadly fight, able to I!!'
courage of any but Vlama, augmented his; and he resolved to be revenged ofhis Enem.!
the loss he had sustained by the Tempest.  Wherefore he made a speedy review of his I7
and finding that he had lost but two thousand men that nighr, he concluded to set upon7'
Enemies.  He sent forth some then to discover, whil'st they were labouring in some sort t ^
repair the diforder of the Tents; and having gotten an advantageous place, be stay'd ther
till he understood that the Sophi came on suriously towards him; for whereas reports increase
at a distance, he had been told that Vlama had lost above sisteen thousand men.  My Maltet
glad of this occasion, albeit his Army was overtoyled and weary, couragiously exhorted them
to fight.  But, Madam, without particularizing a Battel unto you, whereof the event was not
profperous to my dear Master, I will only tell you, that after he had almost vanquished hisE-
nemies, suffering himsds to be carried away by his extream valor,he was hemmed in by shove
an hundred men, who knowing him to be the General of their Enemies Army, assailed him
with such sury, ashe was dangerously hurt by them in four several places; so as all thathe
could do was to rid himself from his Enemies, still fighting till hc got to his own men, where
he was no sooner arrived but he sell down dead amongst them. This accident made the vido¬
ry change party, and range her self wholly on the Ter pans side, who remained Masters ofthe
sreld : In the mean time Vlama's wounds proved great and dangerous; he was carried to the
nearest town, and from thence to BitiUsa, where he hath always continued, whil'st the So^ln
making profit of his misfortune and absence, regained all that/^r^i!)sw and he bad conquered.
Howbeit Vlama was a long lime wichoat knowing any of those things: for his wounds re¬
duced him to so bad an estate, as no affair was communicated to him. And whereas I was
always about him, so ofcen as the violence of his sickness would permie him to speak, itwas
always of grieving to dye, before he had revenged you; but when an Arabian Pbylician,
which looked unto him, had assured us that he was out of danger, the first thing hewas ac¬
quainted with, was the defeat ofhis Army, the loss of Tauris, your imprisonment, and Ptk-
ana's.  But he understood this last by such consused reports, as he could not comprehend by
what adventure you were here.  His first thought in this occasion leaned to joy, and he wk
very glad to hear that you were living, that you were not in the power ofthe Sophi, andthat
at length he might hope to see you again.  But this first motion being over, he entered into
another quite contrary.  What, said be, do I fight against my lawsul Prince,to endeavor the
delivery of the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, or to revenge them ? and whil'st I hazard my
life with this intention, it salls out that I shed my blood for the service of a Prince, who keeps
them prisoners; and Sortnne,that is become ingenuous to persecute me,makes me fight against
those which oppose him who oppresseth and ill-intreateth them I Pardon me, continued he,
great Ptincess,the crime which I have done; pardon me,dear <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>,the error which I have
committed ;-and knoW,that though I am covered all over with wounds which I have received
in serving thy Enemy, yet have I heart enough still left me to undertake the deliverance of thee.
I stiould never have done, Madam, is I would recount unto you all that hc said upon this oc¬
casion.                  ,,,
But at last, after he had used his uttermost endeavor to be carried into a Chariot, againlttK
advice of his Physician, he was constrained to stay two days journey from BitiUsa; soth«
knowing itwas impofsible for him to proceed further on his way as yet, hessentmetotw

It was said he was gone, to attend for him, and to endeavor by his means to see you, jnJ ^o

<p>My imagination, representing to me all at once whatsoever I am to recount unto you,silleth
my mind with so much consusion and grief, as I doubt whether I shall be able to deliver things
precisely unto you, as they arrived unto us, and whether I shall not stand in need ofthe Prin¬

cumstance of that which you desire to know. But to come to my discourse, I will not stand
then to tell you in what manner we suffered Shipwrack; only I will say to you, that wben
we judged by the cries of the Mariners we were in danger of perishing, I approached tothe
Princess, whose great heart was not shaken inthis occasion, but contrarily feared the Port
more then Shipwrack, and casting my self at her feet, I demanded of her with tears the
grace that I might dye by her. This generous Princess imbraced me, and taking me by the hand
she never quitted it, till the Vessel, driven by the wind and the waves with an incredible im-
pecuoficy against cbe point of a Rock, broke all to pieces, and separated us,butii'. what raanner
it was done I am not able to tell you; for I was so troubled, and the horrors of dtath seized
on me in such sort at that dreadsul instant, as I knew not what became of me. Yet was not
tbe Sea altogether unpitisul unto us, for by an extream good fortune in the midst ofour ill for¬
tune, it carried us to the shoar, which was not far ofs; and not only prescsved our lives, but
made me be found within thirty paces of the place, where the waves had ast up the divine

him; my sex, my age, my habit, which was rich and extraordinary; and more then allthat

insinitely changed me, he conceived that I was not altogether unknown to Iwm, and thatse
had seen something that resembled me. But he had no sooner made the sand, which deavtd
to my face, to be taken away, but his memory brought back into his imaginatitn my pidure
whichhe had bought of that Merchant, andwhich he believed to be Axi^mir/i. And
whereas by chance he had it about him that same day, he opened tbe case wherein it was, arid
observing there all the seatures of my face, though the ayr ot it was somewhat charged, he no
longer doubted but that I was the Princess of Psr/i&lt;», consitminghimstls further inthiscpi-
nion by my apparel, which he saw to be altogether like to that which I wore in my p slute.
Vox the Sophi having found, that the habit of an Amazon, which the Painter badgivenus,
was more advantageous then ours, would needs have the Princess and I wear it ever after. In
this belies. Prince Cw^^^r redoubled his care; and seeing me setch a sigh, which made him
know that I was still alive, he caused me tobe carried to the next house to the place where I
was; and commanded some of his people to go along by the Sea shoar, to see is thty could
find any other person that had need of succour, imagining rightly, that I had not susscied Ship¬
wrack alone. But scarcely had he given this Order, wKen one of his servants came and tdJ
him,that some thirty paces from thence there lay a woman attired in the same manner, and
in the same estate that I was,who without doubt was not dead,because he bad discerned stnic
motion of breathing in her.
</p>
<p>The Prince, having left me to the care of his people, went to see that which this man told
him of; but he did no Iconer cast his eyes on the Vx'meess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> s for it was she whora
this man had found) but he selt himself prest with an extraordinary desire to be able to sive
her; and the compassion which he had on her added so many charms to ber beauty, as k
swore unto me afterwards he had never seen her more beautisul then she was in that dtplonblc
estate. He himself helped to carry her to the place where they had already layd me; and
though he was perswaded that I was the Princess of Tersia, and that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was oneof
my maids of honor, he took at the least as much care of her as of me, and it might be said ihat
he did not serve me but out of resped and interest, and that he assisted her already out ot incli¬
nation. At length, my Lord, meeting wich some women in the hcuse whither we had been
carried, they took such a course with us, as they brought us out ofour swoon. I was thesitlt
that opened my eyes, and to whom reason began to give a sense of our mis-sottunes, by the
astonishment wherewith I was seized, in seeing my self in the bands of so many unknownp^t-
sons.  Buc is their faces,their habits,and their language surprized me, their ofsicious endeavors
gave me some hope. This astonishment being over, my first thought was for AxiAimru. A as •
poor Princ'ss, said I aloud, what is thy destiny I Prince danger hearing me speak thus sts'
he alone understood the "<hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> tongue; believed that by those few words I deplored ssj

was equally surprized, both with heating Cww^^r speak to me inthe <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> tongue, ati
with his taking me for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>.  Howbeit finding my sds in the hands of P^oP's/"". ^^,

<p>know them to be <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s Subjeds.  Madam, said I, I cannot answer to so many things,
</p>
<p>though I have for above two hours observed with a judgment found enough all that hath been
</p>
<p>done here.  But this I can tell you, that he,who seems to be the Master of all thera I have teen,
</p>
<p>is exceeding civil,and stiould be a man of great quility, so far as I an guess by the high respett
</p>
<p>which the rest do give him. But that which troubles me is, his taking me for you, and his
</p>
<p>assuring me in our language, that I shall have the same honor done me here, as in the Court or
</p>
<p>the Sophi my father.  It may be, said the Princess,! can remember some words of the Turktlk
</p>
<p>tongije, which I learned of an old Slave when I was a child; and then making a sign to one
</p>
<p>of those which accompanied us, that she would say something to him, when as he came neat
</p>
<p>her, and that she had studicd a while, she demanded of him with much ado, and in a language
</p>
<p>that was not very inceliigible,the name ofhim that commanded them. This man apprehended
</p>
<p>noe ac first whac she would say to him, but at length joyning signs to her speech, she made her
</p>
<p>self be understood.  He answered her then in his language, that it was the Prince Gianger.
</p>
<p>This name of^/4«^tsr touched the Princess sensibly, and raaking a sign to this man, that she
</p>
<p>had no more to say to him; I knew full well, said she to me, that Fortune did not save me,
</p>
<p>but to undo me; and that she kept me not from perishing, but to expofe me to new miseries;
</p>
<p>for, said shc, he in whose power we are is the son of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>.  It is not beciuse Same doth
</p>
<p>not speak advantageously of him; but still, hc is the son of a man, which hath caused me to
</p>
<p>bc forcibly carried away.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s discourse seemed so full of reason to me, as Icould not make any Reply to it;
but in the end canried by the pashon which I had to serve her, I told her, that to avoyd the
mischief she feared. Prince Gianger was not to be disabused of the opinion hc was in, that I
was the Princess of Persta; that in the mean time we stiould labour to know, wherefore he
took me for that which I was not; and that in trying to discover his designs, we should srame
ours according to thac weChould leam of him. The Princess was so asshded, as without ex¬
amining whether that which I told her was reasonable or no, she consented unto it at the same
instant, when as the Prince, who out of resped had always marched before, came close to the
Chtret. This while we arrived at 6'j«i»g^r.s Palace, who kd me to a stately lodging, and
who would also have given another to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; because, saidhe, sbe was not in case to
serve me: But having requested him to leave her with me, he quitted us, and wentout of the

<p>chamber

</p>
<p>chamber, as soon as that old Jewisti Physician came in; who, after he had ministred unto us
that which he thought was necessary for our recovery, left us at liberty to talk of the estir^
of our fortune.
</p>
<p>I will not declare unto you, my Lord, the cares, the civilities, and the duties, which c,-
anger rendred me stom that very first evening in the quality of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, since it would be
to spend time unprofitably. But you stiall understand, that coming to see me tbe next day I
demanded two things of him; the one was, to tell me how he knew that I was the Prinass
of Persia ? and the other, not to publisla that I was in his hands, till I had time and slrencth
to entertain him with my misfortunes. To the sitst he answered me, in letting me see ?he
Case wherein my pidure was, which as soon as I had beheld I knew it straight. But, my
Lord, said I unto him, who told you that this was Axiamimes pidure ? The Merchant
said he, that sold it to me; and who long before had also sold another to the Emperor my sa!
ther, which he said was a maids, named <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, whom the Sophi very much esteemed •
whom you exceedingly loved; and who withcut doubt ought to have very much merit and
beauty, since, as this Merchant told me, she was crowned as well as you, as the fairest of all
Persia. This <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, answered I coldly, had questionless a beauty extraordinary enoutjh
to oblige Jo//&gt;»&lt;j« to buy her pidure. Now, my Lord, it is certain that this discourse sur.
prized me; for then I knew, that the Merchant, to whom our pidures had been given, was
deceived, and had not understood the Sophi well; the likeness of clothes hiving no doubt
conts ibuted much to the making of this error. So it was, that I plainly perceived how Wi-
man had essedively loved <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> by means of her pidure, but under the name of Selixn-
na, which had occasioned her forcible carrying away; and how the saw error, and thesame
change of pidures, was the cause that Prince danger took me for her, as the Emperor had
before taken her for me.
</p>
<p>Touching the second thing, which I had demanded ofthe Prince, he easily granted itme;
for whereas he was become desperately in love with the Vx\x\ce{s <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, bis deiire was
not to be obliged to carry us so soon to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, as maxims of State required: It being un.
likely, that the daughter ol a great King should be inhis hands, and he not remit het into
the Emperor his fathers, as soon as it was known. So to content me, and to satishe himseli,
he forbid those, which had had any notice of the quality he gave me, to be known of it: And
still, to gain time, I made my indispofition last as long as pofsibly I could. In tbe mean space
thePrince, who at first fight had been mightily taken with the beauty of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, id\
not forbear giving her some marks of it, but with so much resped, as is she had appeared
to be that which truly she was, she could not have been ofsended at it. This generous Prince
told us since, that he tryed to withstand this springing passion as much as he was able; and
that against the custom of his Nation, which considers not the nobility of blood, he was so
troubled to think that she whom he loved was not of Royal birth, as he could not htm
inhis minde. He had yet some intervals, wherein his imagination shewed him the truth,
and wherein it perswaded him that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, whom I called Ismaida as long as our plot
lasted, was something more then she seemed to be; and in this thought he engaged him¬
self so deeply in loving her, as he could not forbear giving her testiraonies thereof in my pre¬
sence, though he rendred me nevertheless all the resped, which was due to a Prmeess, ot
whom I borrowed the name.            u o ■ «
</p>
<p>We lived some time in this sort, with content enough, that is to say, as long as the Princes
visits kept us from thinking seriously of our misfortunes. For when we were alone, the re¬
membrance of what was past, and the fear of thatwhich was to come, gave us but w»c
rest.  The presence of the Prince was oftentimes also somewhat grievous to me, e'peciJjJ
such time as he pressed me by his entreaties to tell him by what adventure I had suffered in p-
wrack upon that Coast; having much ado to finde excuses to dispense me horn it, being nor
yet well resolved on that which we were to tell him. This Princes love i'^^wite Degan'

for ever lose the presence of one, who was so dear to him as Axtamira was.  And the
thought which he had had, to condud me to Conslantinople, seemed so much the juster un¬
to him, because he should thereby retain in his Country the person whom he loved.  I ob¬
served how he looked upon the Princess y^ArwwiV^j when I made this motion unto him, and
• that changing colour he sighed twice or thrice. But at length after he had endevored to an¬

clothes suborn some cne of the Guards that are about us, to let you escape and con¬
dud you away, either here, or during the voyage we are going to make, where you will
not be so observed as I stiall be. Ah, my dear Gid, said she unto me I in what place of the

Prince, who, trsnsported by the assedion that he bears me, would ill entreat you ascerwards.
Ah, no, SelixAna t death hath something sweeter, then all the remedies you present unto

somuch as regards m?, it would be too much glory for me to dye for your service: And isl
saw that slying might be advantageous to yon, I would press you further nnto it; but since
by your reasons I come to know the greatness of your misfortune, were ic not better for us

Axiamtra; that I am verily the daughter of the Sophi; and that it was LlimawT^Z
have me forcibly carryed away? Truth, answered I, hath lights which makes her to be"r°

wben we shal mark him out the time that he came to Mazanderon,he wil remember wlieth
he were at the Port then or no- or is he be ignorant thereof, he may dextrously enquire in
what place he was at that same time: Moreover, is he perissicd when we suffered shipwrac
his death will justisie my discourse; and is he escaped, it is impofsible but that the brnit of
this accident should be spread abroad amongst some; and that at least it stiould be heard
spoken, how he thought he stiould have been drowned, though it be noc known upon what
occasion, or in what voyage.  But, Madam, without fearching for somany proofs, to con¬
sirm that which I purpose tofay, I am consident, how I stiall no sooner tell GiWrr that
you are the Princess of Persia, but he will finde in your eyes the jnstisication of my discourse •
he will wonder thac he did not know you; and repenting him of his error, he will crave
pardon of you for it.  For, Madam, there is something so majestical in your face, as I doubt
not but you have had more ado to conceal your self, then you will have to make your self be
known.  And then again, the greatest misfortune that can arrive to us by it, is not to be be-
leeved, and that being so, we are in the same estate, as now we are: and inthesamelibeity
to have recourse unto death.
</p>
<p>ThePrincess, perceiving some reason in that which I said, permitted me tofpeak toCi.
anger, provided that she might be in het Cabinet during our conversation. I sent then pre¬
sently to desire the Prince that I might speak with him, whereupon he came forthwith to my
chamber; and when as he would have used the same respeds to me, as he had accustomed;
It is no longer time, said I unto him, my Lord, to abuse your goodness; It was requisite at
first, when as yet we knew you not, that we should be unknown to you, for reasons that
you shall hear; but now that we know your wisdom, your vertue, and your generofity, it
is just chat you also slbould know us; and that the sreedom which we use in acquainting you
with our misfortunes, and in considing absolutely in you, should obtain us that pardon
which we crave for having deceived you. The Prince remained very much surprized with
my discourse, and whereas I perceived ic; I see, my Lord, said I unto him, the impatience
you are in, to understand that which I am to say to you, doth disquiet you; and therefore,
to satishe you in few words,know, that I am not <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>. You are not <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, said the
Prince unto me exceedingly amazed I 0,Madam, labor not Co perswade me the contrary,rince
it would be in vain. No, my Lord, continued I, I am not the Princess of Persia, and yon see
before your eyes onely that <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>,of whom you have heard speak too advantageously :yet
think not that I will take the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> out of your power; she is in it,my Lord,and
she is in it in an estate,that hath need of your protedion : It is you alone on whom her goodot
bad fortune doth depend; or to say better, it is yoo on whom her life or death doth depend.
And to draw you quite out of the pain wherein I see you, know, my Lord, that the same in¬
comparable person, whom you have so esteemed of under the name of Ismaida, is trdy
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, and the most excellent Princess that is in the world. This last amazement of the
Prince was as great as the other; but with this disserence, that amidst the trouble of his soul
I saw some joy in his look. He beleeved me not for all that at first, but I perceived that it
was a matter, whereof he would have gladly been perswaded. Is it pofsible, m^
unto me, that you stiould speak the truth ? and will you not take it ill is I should not be¬
leeve you? or is not being able to rely on your words, I request you to tell me some circum¬
stances, that may clear me in a thing that is so doubtsul.
</p>
<p>Icis just, said I untohim, that you should not beleeve me upon the bare report ot my
words, but'that your reason should perswade you. And then I recounted unto him, notonj-
ly Rustans arrival at Mazanderon; the slcights which he had used to get a fight of me; t
forcible carrying of us away; the discourse that he had made to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; "owy
given her to understand that ;o/iw4« was fallen in love with her pidure, which tie naa

</p>
<p>deron, the Sophi's rigor, and the Princesses avcrtion io Deliment. I made this relation with
somuch sincerity, ^sdanger found himself capable of discerning it; and that wh.ch yet
helped meto perswade him that I did not lye, was that he ^^'^^^^^ how he had heard
thlRusian, who was his enemy, as well as his brother .^«y?.;^. s, was gone from the
Port upon a secret expedition; and had embarqued himself at s.r^ in a vessel laden with
merchandize. This consideration having removed all scruples from his minde, I saw a great
deal of joy in his countenance, andthe questions whichhe asked of me afterwards were no
more then testimonies that he was perswaded.     ■  r r  l
</p>
<p>But why ssaid he unto me after some silence) do not I see this Princess, of whom I am
to crave pardon for my error ? Is it to punish me for the fault, which I have ignorandy com¬
mitted, that she will deprive me of her fight? My Lord, said I unto him, this great Princess,
to leave you the liberty to doubt of my words, is retired into her Cabiner, whither is you
pkase we will go unto her.  Saying so, shc opened the Cabinet door, and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> advan¬
cing towards them in some consusion, the Prince went and cast himself at her feet.  Ah I
Madam, said he unto her, howfaulty soever I appear in your eyes, my heart is innocent;
it being most certain, that it hath advertised me more then once what you were: I have bad
respeds and thoughts of veneration for you, which I durst not make shew of, m the error
wherein I was, both by that cs the Merchant, and your discourse. My Lord, said ihz Prin¬
cess listing him up, your error is so much the more pardonable, because in taking <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>
forme, you were not much deceived, seeing icis certain, that she is another my self.  Bur,
my Lord, continued she, let not the considence which we have in your vertue be in vain.
Nor let nor, Madam, replyed he, the remembrance of that which is past be disadvantageous
to me; and tor my parr, beleeve absolutely, that there is nothing which I will not perform
to do you service. For, Madam, since my good fortune would have you unknown to me,
that I might take upon me the boldness to testifie some part of the passion I am in for you,
which peradventure I durst not have done otherwise, although it be most pure, and most in¬
nocent ; be assured, that now, when as I know how this paslsion is worthy of the son of So-
liman, nothing can separate me from your interests.  Command then absolutely, and be
most consident that you shall be obeyed. I had not much ado to be perswaded, continued
he, that a person, whom I judged worthy to be Queen of all the wodd, should be the daugh¬
ter of the Sophi of Tersia; but I marvel much at my blindness^ that I could not discern you
were that indeed, which I haveso often wished you were.
</p>
<p>Since your generofity permits me to speak, said the Princess interrupting him, Let not the
wicked dcsigns of Rustan, my Lord, be executed by Prince danger; let me not be con¬
duded by your hand to the Serraglio; nor let thePrincess of Persta have the destiny of
Slaves. For, my Lord, not to conceal my thoughts from you, I will dye a thousand times
over, rather then doany thing unworthy of that which I am. You know my Lord that

putation with.  So do then, my Lord, that I may not go to Conslantinople; that I may not

unto her, found out the means to place you in safety, and to content my self also, I stiould dye
with grief; but is I be able to ofser you the company of a Princess, whose vertue is without
stain, whom you may absolutely command, and who is wise to Prince Mustapha my Brother
I think you will have cause to be satished.  <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was exceeding glad of this propofition,
having oftentimes before heard speak of the vertue d Mustapha's wise, who she bad been
told was descended of the ancient Kings of Cappadocia.  So that addressing her sds toitie
Prince with a great deal of satissadion, may I hope, my Lord, said she unto him, diatPrinoj
Mustapha, and his excellent wise, will permit me to live unknown in their Palace, until that
Fortune, weary of perlccuting me, sball no longer keep me si;om returnkig into my Country s
Your vertue alone will oblige theirs to succor you, butis that were not, t*e strist friendlh/p
wbidi is bet wixt us will oblige them sussiciently unto it. All Mnstapha's interests are mine,
even as my Fortune is his.  And truly we are far from those apprehensions of State, which for
so long a time have made the children ot the Othoman family to tear one another in pieceshlie
enraged Tygers; and I am well assured that \s Mustapha, my eldest Brother, comes tmto
the Empire, he will let me enjoy the felicity of his Raign, and will not send me either xsmw
slaves to strangle me.  I tell you all these things. Madam, to the end you may not doubt but
that the sanduary which I have propounded unto yon, will be inviolable. Moreover, where¬
as Mustapha is Governor os Amasia, and that Oty is the Capital of Cappadocia, whidi wc
call Amasia, you may wtll conceive that you will bc far enough from Constantinople, and not
so far from Persia, but that you may easily hear from those which are asseded to you
there.
</p>
<p>All these particulars having seemed very reasonable unto me,I the more consirmed the Pnn-
cess in the deiign she had to accept of them, both for her interest and mine own; it being moll
certain, that I no less feared the Sophi's love, then she did Deliments.  This resolution nktn,
nothing was thought on but executing it: G»/w«^sr dispatched a man, who was saitbwlto
him,to let Mustapha understand that which he desirc^of him; but with such pressingteiwj,
as it had been impoflible for his brother to have resused%im.  And giving order for the «-
par ture of the Princess, whom before solks he intreated as he was wont to do, we set tort'i
two days ascer for Amasia,vj\ih as Uctle company as mightbe, and in Turkilh h;bics,tot)etn

werl asseded to her in S.r&gt;., without ever receiving any answer. And whereas tLe saw no
Tnd 0 her mi eries, she ciuld not be without unquietness; which at length brought her to a
sickness which it ias thoughc would prove mortal co her. Her Sever was not very violent,
but i warwithouc intcrraission; and Ibougb she selc no greac pain, yet was she so weak, and
so low broughc, as wc durst noc hope she could surmounc che disease wherewith she was
aE dSgJhewhich ^....^.and I never abandoned her; and the two Pnncessawher
asoften, as cheneceshty of cheir affairs, andcivilicy would permic them.  N^w though .^«-
Ijapka had nothing but friendship for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, yet seemed he to be as much asshded as G«-
dnger ■ such a sympathy was there in all things between these two excellent Princes.  We
continued three Months in this sort, without knowing what we were to exped concerning
the Princesses life: for albeit ac lengch the Sever left her somecimes, yet was it for so little
while, as it did not permit us to hope the recovery of her health.  But whil'st I was shedding
tears for her, the Princes and Faraida took great care to conceal from the Princess,and me too,
that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had made War in Persia; which was the cause I knew not that Vlama bad
betaken himselfto his party.  And that which kept Mustapha from saying any thing to us of
it, was not only the fear of asssiding <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, but the doubt G«&lt;«»^er was in, that is she
came once to know ic, she would be averted from a Prince, whose father went about to deso-
late her Country.  We lived then above two Months in this ignorance after the Princess was
out ot danger: for whereas we saw no body but MuHapha,Faraida,%nd danger that under¬
stood our language, it was easie for them to keep us fromknowingany thing but what they
pleased.  But one day as the Princess and I were alone, Jpeaking of the assedion that danger
bore her, and amplisying his vertues, which I opposed tothevicesof Z)ts/iws»s, I in some
sort pressed her to acquaint me with the thoughts which she had for him.  Why I will tell
you now, <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, said shc unto me, I esteem of Gianger as much as his vertue doth merit;
I do acknowledg his good Ofsices as much as one can; and I bear as much good-will to him
in my heart, as I do to Prince Mahamed my brother: but for that passion, which diforders
the mind, which destroys Reason, and which troubles the rest of them whom it pofsesscth, I
am not capable of it; and I could wisti ihnGiangercixxied a more quiet assedion to me.-
That weakness is a blemissi, which I do not desire should be in great Souls: nor is it any thing
but the subtilty of men which hath perswaded us, thac^his pashon is not vicious, since all o-
thers ate, and that every one believes them to be so, though they do not produce such deadly
csseds.  And to know how much more dangerous it is then the rest, we are but to consider
how it commonly stirs up all of them; Hatred, Anger, Envy, and Ambition it scls, are many
times the followers of it; yet do not think, that I will be ingratesul to Prince Cww^rr; for
know, how averse soever I am from marriage, I would notwithstanding resolve tobehis
wise, rather then render him unhappy, is the Sophi and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> could consent thereunto.
For, continued she, I may indeed oppose the Sophia pleasure, but I can never be drawn to dis¬
pofe of my self without his order. Asl was going to tdke danger's part, he entered into
the Princesses chamber, and approaching to her with all the observance which he was accu¬
stomed CO yield her, he began to talk to her of his assedion; and he represented unto het the
resped wherewith be had served her, thegreamess of his love, the little testimony she had
given him of accepting it, the deplorabie estate of his Fortune, the small likeUhood there was,
thac astet so many Letters vainly written into Tersta, that the friends which she had left
were still generous enough to scrve her. That he knew how the Sophi was more asseded to
Delment then eycx, andthathe alone governed the Empire: So that she could never hope
ether to alter Z)^/t/wm, or to make the .s^/&gt;/;j change his resolucion, but by the neceshty of
resolving on that which they could no longer avoyd.

to begin wich the Obligations wherein I am engaged to you; I know that I owe yon niy hse.
that the resped which you have shewed to me, in a time when you knew me not for that
which I was, hach sensibly obliged me; and that the generofity which you have demonslta-
ted in providing me a sanduary, and preserring my interests beioxe <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s and the Em'
pires, merits an eternal acknowledgment.  I have also observed against my custom, that yoii
bear an assedion to me, and I am so powerfully perswaded cs it, as you cannot deiire I
should bc more: but, my Lord, is I may be permitted to speak sreely, I must tell you, that
the esteem I make of so many rare qualities, as are in you, joyned to che obligacions wherein
I am engaged eo you, could never for all chat beget an assedion in my heart like unto youts.
Yet do not think I am ingratesul, or insensible; but contrarily, I love you somuch the more
persedly, asl can speak it without blussiing ; I, my Lord, I love you with a friendstiip, so
solidly established, as neither sense nor fortune hath any part in it.  I can pubssh it without
shame, and conserve it wichouc blame, and loving you as is yeu were my brother, I donot
see that you have reason to complain.  I know wdl nevertheless that you are not satished;
buc whac would yon have me do, it love be a passion, whereof I am not capable i" and is
marriage hath always past with me for a captivity, which is to be avoyded as much aspofsibly
may be ? I protest unto you by the holy Prophet, whom we worsbip, that it I could be touch¬
ed wich this passion, it should be doubtless for you ; never having bad thac indination for
anyoneas I haveforyou.  But let not this impofsibility, I pray yon, of my being in love,
disquiet you, since the friendship, which I promise you, is incomparably more excellent, and
morepersed. And to testifie unto you, that I do all that I can, is you have not power enough
to contain your self from desiring to marry me, I do permit you to use the best means you can
to get the Sophi and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to consent unto it; which being obtained, I do here engage my
word to you no longer to oppose your desires.  Behold, my Lord, allthat I bad to lay to
you; and never hope for any more from me; for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> s vertue can have no further in¬
dulgence for your passion.
</p>
<p>Most vertuous Princess, replyed Gianger casting himself at her feet. What occasions do
you give me all at once, both of grief, and of satissadion I with one hand you draw meoiit
of danger, and with the other you put me to death. You cannot answer my passion, and yet
you love me more then all the wodd bcside; who ever saw an adventure equal to minei' my
Mistress resuses me her love, but in such a manner, as I am not permitred to have the comfort
to term her cruel and unpitisul; but conuanly, I must give her thanks for the vvrong Ihe docs
me, and must admire in her the vertue which opposes my love, danger, in saying thus, look¬
ed on <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> with so much grief, as made me pity him. And whereas the Princesl"es good¬
ness hath always allowed me a great deal of sreedom with her, I took somuch upon me as
to intermeddlein their discourse; sothat addreshng my self tothe Prince, The permishon,
my Lord, said I untohim, which hath been given you, should inspire you, me-thinks, with
other thoughts, then those which I perceive you have. Ah I my Princess, said he unto mt)
s for he had always called me so, ever after we had put that trick upon him,) that which the
goodness of ^.v&lt;^w»V4 grants, Fortune resuses me; interpofing such obstacles as are not ealie
to be vanquished : And in the state wherein things are, there needs a supernatural power lo
change my evil destiny, unless you will help me to perswade <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, that she will peroii
me to marry her; for being then no longer in a condition to be Deliment's wise, or a«/"»J*^
Mistress, tbe knowledg thereof would peradventure make their weapons sall out ot the
hands.  How ! said <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> mightily surprized, have the Sophi and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> any mterei
to be decided between them ? Is it known thac I am in your hands ? and may I be so untiip-
py as to be the cause of the desolation of my Country ? Gianger was very forry that he
said somuch before he was aware; but seeing the matter past remedy, and that likewae
War could noc be always concealed from Axtamira, he recounted unto her, that a "t»e

self in that sort, because being ignorant ofthe assedion which Vlamaboxeme and believing
that he would be glad to return into his Country, is he met with an occasion for it; heima-
Pined that the Princesse, who had often spoken to him of Vlama s zeal and fidelity, would
quickly give him intelligence of her being there, and then that Vlama to see his Native Soil
again, and to be well received there, would perswade the Princess to return thither. And it
rnay be also, as all Lovers are suspicious, chat he had surmized by <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s discourse, which
he had interpreted amisse, how t;/^w^ was in love with her; at leastwise IcouldnoC con¬
ceive a better reason for it; howsoever he never acquainted her with any ching conccrn-
</p>
<p>I will not tellyou, my Lord, in what astonishment the Princesse wasto hear of the desola¬
tion of her Country, by a Prince, whose Son had so much obliged her, and whom she could
not wich reason hace. Howbeie she was so just, as to accuse none but <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and Forturie
for her miseries. It is not enough then, said shc weeping, that J'oAw^w caused me to be carri¬
ed away by force, but that he must also wast our Empire. And it was noc enough, that che
War stiould have an unjust beginning, buc that I must too be found on the enemies Party,
and in such a manner, as I am not so much as Co desire Co get from it. And my misforcune is
such, as I cannot make vowes for the Sophi, but I must make them likewise for Deliment,
who fights for him, though I have such cause Co hate him; nor make vowes against So liman ^
without ofsending Mustapha and gianger. In sine, my Lord, said she, turning her self to the
Prince, since I am in such a condition, as I am not able to make wisl^es wichouc injustice , I
must resolve to put my selfe into such a condition, as I may no longer be able to desire any
thing, isit be true, thac death is powerfull enough to deliver me from so many miseries. Such
were in this incounter <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s expresllions; and as for me, I consesse coo wich consusion,
that the Princes discourse gave me an unquietncsse, which was particular to me.
</p>
<p>For having had no news of Vlama, smee che cime that he deparced from che Court, I*
could not judge what he bad done during so great a diforder; this thoughc troubled me so
much, asl could not forbear demanding of Gianger, whether he knew not whac was become
of I'Lima} and whereas I was afraid, least che Princesse should condemn me for chinking of
r/&lt;4w-«, rather then comforting her, I looked on her at the very same instant, which, as I
think, consirmed danger the more in tbe opinion, that I have told you, I believed hehad. For
after he bad considered me, and then the Princess, he told me, chac chis War having much
asshded bim, he knew not very well what had passed in ic. But to abridge my discourse ,
Mustapha and Farraida were called in, as well to comfort the Princess, as to advise on that
which they were to do. And whenas G^'^w^rr had requested the Princess, she would permic
him to cell Muslapha what she had granted him, she answered him , chac never doing or say¬
ing any thing, which she would have to be concealed, he might acquainc him wich all chac he
pleased. As soon ts Mustapha appeared, she advanced cowards him. And will you,my Lord,
said shc unto him, be so generous, as not to hate a person, who weeps for che vidories of ^^
liman? and who sheds tears when she sees the bounds of an Empire, which is destined to
you inlarged ? Madam, answered courteous Mustapha, it s$ not for me Co ask of you , whe¬
ther you will be sojust, as noc to confound the innocent with the guilty, and also to indure

of all things. But by ill fortune, you were gone away before, upon a secret expedition
wherein <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had imployed you, although ic was buc four or sive daies ascer tbeTriuaiph'
which was cclebraced for him ac your recum from Tersta. Inthe mam time, to sacihtate
things on all sides, they believed it would not be amisse for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> to write once more to
some one ofher ancient friends, and that by chis Letter, he, to whom she stiould addrtsse her
self, stiould be obliged Co acquaint the Sophi that shc was living; andthathe should also
dexcroBsly inform himself, whecher by a marriage of her wich a Son of Solimms, a peace
mighc noc be propounded. The Princess said hereupon, chac she would never make thispropo¬
sition ; but Mustapha answered her, how it would suffice, is she did only write a letter, that
did make known she was living; and thac did likewise assure, how che letter, which he
would write, was of a person considerable and powerfull enough, co creat of an Affair ot
this importance.

<p>The Princess, after she had a little chought on it, wrote to the Governor of Sultam^vik

.S'o/'^i to a peace all thac ever he could. Buc before che pablishing of her being alive, and
making cbe Propofition, which he should find in che lecter, he should send her his Opinion,
and acquaint her in what terms ^Deliment stood with the Sophi, whom she denoted unto
him, wichout naming him: she moreover assured him, that the Letcer then written unto him,
came from a person, who was able to perform all thac he would undertake; and he that car¬
ried it, had order to name him, even Mustapha, The Princes chofe a man for this voyage,who
had lived a long time in Persia, and that understanding the Language and Customes of it,copld
easily get to Sultania, when once he had put on the habic of che Country. This Governor,
having with extream joy learnc chac che Princess was living.and transported more by zeal then
discretion, went; without doing ought that the Princesse had injoyned him, to Prince Mdn-
med,v]ho had been set ac liberty,as well as my Father,when as nothing could be proved against
them. For I forgot to tell you,how they had been made prisoners,out ofan opinion conctivi d,
that they had caused us Co be carried away. This man, I say, cransporccd wich an inconlidc-
race zeal, wenc to Prince Mahamed, and reading the Princess Letter to him, together with
that from Mustapha, they concluded Cogecher, chac this Propofition would but exasperate
things, knowing very well that Deliment would never consent to a peace, which put Axu-
mira into the power of another, and therefore that it would but inslame the War the more,
instead of extinguishing it.             r t, c  r

<p>On che ocher side, Prince Mahamed, who was not ignorane how much averse the Snnceis
had ever been from Marriage, could not believe, but chat che consenc which she secmed to give

any thing ill which she should say to him. That for Musiapha, he beleeved him to be too
well born to pluck away the Scepter from him, and Co despoyl him of an Empire, that was
destined co him after his death. Roxelana, seeing thac this artifice wrought not ail the effect
she expeded from it, consults anew with the Traytor Rustan, who told her, that at any
rate whatsoever Mustapha was to be made away before you were returned to the Pott, and
that the easiest way for it would be to seek to poyson him; for which purpose they wercto

outjwhich made her change her resolution. But, my Lord, admire here che strange proceeding
of things ofthis world I whil'st <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> sought for means to destroy Mttstushn,
and that all their malice could finde out none,chac could fully satishe cheir cruel hatred, the zeal
and fidelity of one of the ancient Officers of this deplorable Prince, surnished them within
occasion for ir. This man had been his first Governor,when as he went out of the Serrai^liii;
and was he to whom <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, during che youth of his son, had given in charge to rendst
him an accounc of his adions: But whereas the Prince had never done any, but such as wcit
worthy, he could not advertise ought, that was not to the advantage of his Master.
</p>
<p>Now after chat Mustapha's age had dispensed him from the obedience, which he had yeelded
to this man, he had still retained him at Amasta; conversing a little less samiliarly with Wm,
chert with his other domesticks, by reason hc was of somewhat an austere humor, and tint
his former authority did as yet conserve some awe and resped in Mustapha towards h;m-
This man for all chat loved che Prince txtreamly, who on the other side heaped wealth and se¬

h S/ii«was anU'urper; which the other unable to endure and being become more
udacious, because hewas nigh to a place where he knew he stiould be proteded, he drevv
ou his scimitar, and very siercely set upon the P.rJ?.«, who, being more dexrnr,^ and ber-
'er mounted then he, quickly d-Cded the combate with three blows chat he gave bira, which
Lade h.m sall dead at h.s teet. Th.s being done wichouc witnesses, the T.r/?.« continued bis
way and almost a minute after he was out of fight, Musiapha s said ancient Governor ar¬
rived at the place where the combate was sought, and presently knowing that man, because
h-bad belonged to tbe Prince, he approached tohim, marks whether hc gives any tign ot
hse and laying his hand upon the region of his heart, he meets chere with cbe pacquet chac
wasdireded Co Musiapha, which that man bad pue inco a httle bag that he had hung about
his neck. The fight hereof pofsest the Governor with some curiofiey, so that seemg no mark
of life in that wretched man, but contrarily observing all the signs of death in him, whssh
are wont to be seen in them whose end hath been violent, he speedily withdrew bom tbac
same place, carrying tbe lictle bag along with him; and being got far enough out of the
way, heopened'it, and was much abashed, when he perceived the i'op/)ss seal.
</p>
<p>I leave you to judg, my Lord, whether that exad fidelity, which he had always observed
to Sol-sn.'ji, did permit bim to deliberatelong upon that subjed: he never stuckatit rhen;
and to ctstisie his resped Co the Grand Signior, as well as his fidelity, he resolves to send him
those Lrtters withouc opening them. And seeing by the superscription of that which was
direded to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, that she must needs be in Amasia, be rtsleded on che being of tvvo
women conceded in Mustapha's Palace ; and calling to minde an hundred petty circumstan¬
ces, which when they arrived had made no impression in his minde, he certainly beleeved,
that the Vi'meds of Persia was m Muslapha's hands: So that perswaded of this truth, he
re-entrtd into the Town through another gate then that which be went out at -, and withcut
making shew of what had befallen him, he the next day dispatches a man away to Constan¬
tinople, enjoyns bim to address himself to some of the Bassa's for to present him to the Grand
Signior, and commands him above all things Co use great speed.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> being arrived at Amasta, and not fearing Co be accused for
tbe death of him whom be bad killed, since their combate had been without witnesses, he
comes boldly to the Palace, demands to speak with Mustapha, and after he had made hi.ii-
self known to him to be a <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>, and had given him assured marks that hc came from
Vi'mo^ Mahamed, hedcsires tobe admitted tothe Princess; which was granted him. And
when he had acquitted bim of bis Commission, <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> remained very much surprized;
for III. knew by hisdiseourse, that be whom theyhad sent to .y^/raw/^ was too long in re¬
turning, since this man, who set forth a day ascer bim, was already come. She hoped never¬
theless, as well as the Princes, that this unquietness would soon cease; and beleeved that somg
inconvenience having kept this man from coming so sast as the other, be would arrive at last,
and s. give an end to their fear. But the day following, tbe body of him, whom the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>
had slain, having been found by some that passed by, he was brought into theTown, and
known to be one belonging to the Prince, who was presently advertised thereof. And where¬
as it was a matter of importance, he wenc in person to cause the Letters to be fearched for,
vvivch we beleeved hehad hidden somewhere in his clothes; but having found none abouc
him, the Prmeess was very much asshded at it, fearing wich a greac deal of reason, s st chese

man who, as be said, was cunningand dextrous, seeing himself engaged in a combate, had
without doubt thrown chem away, for fear they stiould be found about him, is he should
happeii to have che worst in this occasion. At length, not able to do ocherwise, she suffered

servation of his person, to discover a matter unto him, which would much amaze and grieve

curiofity, and already even excited some trouble in his soul, she went on, beseeching him to
remember the suspicions which she had of Mustapha, though he had negleded them, and
atlength intermixing the praises ofthe Prince, with her accusations against him, shc presents

people loved him; chat the "S^/^'j feared and esteemed him; and that r«ji»s this affair was
so important, as ic concerned boch his Empire, and his life.

<p><hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> hearing all these things, knowing the fidelity of him that sent him this Letter, see¬
ing T^^c^nw^e^ seal to it; and coming toconsider, ihn Muslapha hzd with address declined
theWiX of Persta, he no longer doubted but thac hewas guilty; albeit <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s ^■
wrack perplexed him, and kept him from comprehending chis pretended marriage. His tcn¬
derness of chis Prince made him nevertheless seek in his heart, how he might favorably inter¬
pret the accusations, which were brought against his innocence. But the conjedures were
so strong, and RaxeUna's perswasions so powersul, as fatherly assedion gave place to reason
of State. He would fain have put this affair into the deliberation ofhis privy Councel, but
in regard you were not at the Port, he knew not whom to rely on. He propounded Achmi
to Rexelana, but she, being in fear of this mans vertue, represented unto bim, that he was
too much asseded to che Prince to hope for any faithsul counsel from bim in this encounter.
In the end she knew how Co sway che Sultan's minde with so much address and malice, as
he himself commanded Ruslan to be senc for, who was the onely man that <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> did not
except against. H- was no sooner arrived, but the Grand Signior asked his advice concerning
the mater in question. He answered atfirst, with a seigned submisljon, that it was onely
for him to execute his Highness resolutions, and not to give him counsel. But after he hsd
caused himself to be commanded mo^e then once todeliver his opinion, he aggravated the
matter with so much art, and made sbewof such dangerous consequences in this affair isit
were negleded, as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, being absolutely resolved to look to his conservation, coromnd-
ed him co make himself ready Co set forth with six thousand men, which should march away
under pretext of being sent to Vlama as a recruit. That in the mean time, in passing by ^'
masia, he stiould aslure himself of Muslapha s person with as Uctle stir as pofsibly he could,
for seaV of causing some revolt in thac Province.

<p>cies- thatthe people were everywhere ready to revolt; chac he was noc in a condition tcj
oppose somany Enemies; and in conclusion, that his presence was absolutely necessary for
the calming of this storm. Now that which made Ruslan advereise <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> ok 2\\ these
things was because he certainly knew, that the vertue of Muslapha was so generally beloved
in all that Province, as is he undertook to go with open force against him, he would be in
danger ot being lost, and of utterly ruining Rexelana's designs. He considered withall, that

</p>
<p>This consideration of his succeeded but too well; iot <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> no sooner understood so
much from bim, but he resolved for his voyage. Howbeit chat which powerfully carryed
him to do whac is«/?&lt;«« desired, was che incelligence he gave him, how by a second Letter
from Mustapha's Governor he was informed, that the Princess of Tersia was in his hands.
So that Soltman, silled with choller and jealousie, and thinking that as Ruslan had escaped
shipwrack, so <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> not being dead might be in the hands of his son, who was fallen in
love with her, parted instandy away, with all the Troops and sanizaries which he had about

all chings to think of his own security. Vertuous Achmat told us since, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had a
strange combate within himself, and chac Nacure and Reason a long cime opposed the wick¬
edness of chis woman. Buc ac length she made him see the peril so great, and so neer unto
him, as in parting from her, she got bim to promise her two chings; the one, chat he should
not see Mustapha, and the other, that he should sacrisice him to his own proper safety.
With this deadly resolucion he went and joyned with Ruslan,- chese things nevertheless were
not sodofely carryed, but the Bassa Achmat was adverdscd, how this tempest was going
to sall upon the head of Muslapha; so that at the very same time, when as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, being
encamped neer to Aleppo, had sent the Prince a Command to come unto him, to render him
an account of the Princess of Persta, Achmat dispatched away a Poll, Co advertise him chac
some great design was plotting against him, and that he was accused of someehing, wherein
the Princess of Persia was mentioned: but noC able Co Cell him precisely whac ic was, all chat
he could do in this occasion, considering the state wherein he saw things, was to counsel him
not to come.
</p>
<p>I leave you to judg, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, whether, receiving at one and the same instant
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s command, and Achmat's advertisement, the Princes and che Princess were not
strangely surprized ; And so much the raore, because that Perstan was on the very same day

her part found no way to escape this peril; she would fain have saved these two Princes and
saved herself too: bur noc able co go into ?^r/»^, neither to see .yo/;w^«, nor rest sase in,
place, where she was no longer unknown, she found that death alone could draw her out ot
so many miseries. As for Musiapha, his greatest sorrow was to see che asshdion of his bro¬
ther, and the fear he was in, thac his Palace would not be an inviolable sanduary to the Prln-
cess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>.- for Couching che rest, said he unro her, I am noc much troubled. Is Sohmm
deals rigorously wich me, ic will always be with injustice, knowing as I do, that I havenevtr
had a thought against the service which I owe to him, and ascer this satissadion, I fear
not death. But chac which asllids me, continued he, is the doubt, that is I go and present my
self to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, chey will come and do you some wrong in my absence, and thac is it lot
which I do not see how we can finde a remedy.

<p>Farraida.hemng her husband speak in this sort,cast her self ac his seec Co disswade him from
this design, and Co pray him co remember s said she, after she had craved pardon of Gianger)
how exceedingly <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had sought for a pretext to undo him; that having met with one
he might be assured she would make use of it to his ruine: and that it was better for him to
stay in Amasia, and there to desend himself, or sly away, then to expofe himself to so evi¬
dent a danger. But Mustapha's generofity not permitting him Co resolve either for theone
or the other; it becomes your assedion, answered he, to counsel me in this manner, but it
becomes not the courage of Musiapha to be perswaded by you: and since I am innocent, I
will never sly like a guilty man. For in sine, though I seem to have sailed, according to rigot*
ous and cxad policy, in not advertising <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> that the daughter of his Enemy was in my
power, yet I chink chac I swerve noc much from soveraign Reason in serving so excellent a
Princess and my brother; and in contributing nothing to the Sultans unjust lovc, so that
after rhis incerior sacissadion, I will remic my innocence Co the condud of Heaven, which
is always che procedor of ic. gianger seeing his resolution, desired <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, not to take

answer, told him, that he would noc suffer ic, but he would leave him to guard the Princess
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, and his dear Farraida.
</p>
<p>I should never have done, is I would reporc unto you all that, which love, fear, genero¬
sity, and despair, made these illustrious persons say in chis sad conversacion. As for me, I
heard all cheir discourse wichouc speaking: when as on a sudden, ehe desire which I had to

<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, dxy \xp Farraida's ie^xs, render danger moxe excusable, signalize the assedion
which I bare che Princess, and destroy all che wicked designs of Mustapha's Enemies. Veri-

midst che tears which I shed: but whereas I feared that the Princesses generofity would be

Madam, said I interrupting her; and I cannoVtbink that a great Princess will ever break her
word. ' And then again I do not see that my loss is undoubted; for howsoever, continued I,
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> cannot accuse me but for a little while receiving the honors, which were rendered to
me as to the Princess of Persia, though I were not she; but thereunto I am to say, that to be
in the more safety, out of the resped which was beleeved to be due to my condition. I had
not disabused the Prince, staying to make my self known for thac which I was, till I was ac
his Highness feet, to beg his pardon, and to besecch him to grant me my liberty.
</p>
<p>Farraida,stemg a great deal of likelyhood in that which I said,earneslly intreated <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>
no longer to resist this design. danger called me his Deliverer, and said such obliging thirgs
unto me, as I shall never forget the remembrance of them. For Muslapha, though he saw
some probability of that which I propounded, yet his great heare could noc resolve to disguise
the truth; and had he not certainly known, that it was the only Way which could permit
him to hope, that he might put the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> in safety, he had never consented unto
it. But that consideration, joyned to the extream assedion which he carried to his brother,
made him resolve at length for all that was desired of him. We prepared our selves then to
depart the next day; I will not relate unto you whac the separation was between the Princes?
and me, between Gianger and Mustapha, between Muslapha and Farraida, since ic would
buc renew our sorrows for a matter that is not absolutely necessary you should know. Buc I
will only tell you, thatthe separation of the Soul and body is never made with such violent
grief as ours was, at the sad moment of that deadly and last farewelL I was put into a Charet,
with two women which Farraida gave me to wait upon me, and Mustapha accompanied
with a small train, to shew the more considence, marched on horseback some fifty paces
before us. Wc arrived at rhe Emperors Camp a day later then we thought we should,
because the Charet,wherein I was, being broken, took up so much time to re-accommodate it*.
And you will know, my Lord, by the sequel of my discourse, how it is not without Cause that
I have noted this unto you. We were no sooner lighted at a Tent, which had been prepared
tor us, buc Prince Muslapha,who thoughc he stiould have conduded me to J6//iw^»,received
an Order to attend his Commandments there, and to remit me into the hands ofa Bassa who
was to present me to his Highness. I consess that this proceeding amazed me and that I be¬
gan to be in fear for the Pnnce. At the very same instant he received sondry advices, that his
ranne was resolved and certain, is he did noc repel force with force: che Chieftains of the Ar¬
my, and the Aga oi the jamzaries gave him to understand, that is he wouid they would re¬
bel, and noc only save his life buc see cbe Crown upon his head. To all this hc aniwered no¬

<p>At my first appearance <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> seemed to be very much surprized; and beholding me
with an angry look, he demanded ofthe Bajsa that brought me, where the Princess of L i,
was ? My Lord, said he unCo him, Prince Mustapha delivered no other then this ptrsonDn'to
me, whom I saw him creac as is she were che Princess of Tersia. I no sooner heard this an-
swer sfor I had already learned a litde of your language ) but I cast my sels at ik Sultm
feet, and humbly besought him to hear me. I will hear no lying, answered he. My Lord
replyed I, it is not to keep thy Highness from punistiing it, that I beg the favor of thee tobe
heard, but to keep thee from confounding the innocent with the guilty; for in sine, my Lotd
I am faulty, and Muslapha is absolutely innocent. I would I had given thee, answered the
grand Signior thereupon, che half ofmy Empire, chac Mustapha were not guilty. My Lord
replyed I with more considence chen before, Idoaavebuc cwo chings ot thee to give thee
thac satissadion; che one is, chac thou wilt hear me without interrupting me; andtheothet,
thac thou wilt permit the Prince to justisie himself in person. This last, answered he, isim-
pofllible, buc for the other I do grant it thee; and promise thee moreover, that is thou doft
justisie Mustapha swhich I do not believe thou canst do ) there is nothing which thcu Qiih
not obtain ofme. I did not yield at the very first; I besoughc him ehae he would see tht
Prince; I labored to vanquish him with my reasons; but at last seeing I nothing prevailed, I
declared the matter unto him, as we had resolved it; and thac wich so much ingenuity, asl
well perceived he beleeved me. I repeaced chis History from Rustans arrival at Mazmicm,
and coming Co speak of our shipwrack, I lamented che loss of the Princess, I spakeof heras
beleeving herco bc dead; and recounced also, hovs Farraida had received roc from those,
who hadfoundmeoncheSea-shoar; and consequently, how a litde before Prince Gw»^&lt;r,
having seen me with Farraida, where I had been for che most part sick, had beleeved that I
was the Princess of Tersia, by reason of a pidure which hehad ofme, and which a Met-
chant, who had deceived him, had sold him for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s: I told him moreover, that as
soon as A/«/?&lt;&lt;p^^ was perswaded, chac I was theVtincess of Persia, he had prcpatecl him¬
self for che conduding of me to his Highness. Thac for me, I had noc disabused him, as
well Co be the more secured, as for chac I hoped I should che more easily obtain my hberty,
when as I should request it of him by che memory of che infortunate <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, moved wich my words, setched a greac sigh, and cestlsied both by his carriage
and his discourse, chac he was asshded for che loss of che Princess; and yec that he had some
joy, in regard he could hope th%t Muslapha vi^snoisohwhy ^sheh^^d beleeved bira tobe,
and chac in the end he mighc justisie himself. In chis choughc, the Sultan spake very gently

<p>/;«/?^« surprized with tbe liberty of this discourse, began to deal in another manner; and
letting gianger see the absolute power which he had, he put the Princess into despair, and Gt-
dw^^r into sury, who, without considering that his resistance would render him culpable, lesc
not, quite unarmed as he was, to do strange things in opposition of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>'s carrying a-
way by force. He would have snatched Rustans scimitar from him, to have used it against
him, and doubdess he bad done it, is those with whom he was accompanyed had not hindred
him. He soughc all abouc ehe chamber for someehing wherewich he might have desended
himself; butat length seeing all his endevors vain, he past trom one extremity to another,
and after he had exceedingly reviled bim, he on a sudden conjured him with tears in his eyes,
that he would have some pity on him in the person of the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; that ha
would remember he was the son of Roxelana, whose daughcer he had marryed, being assu¬
red is che Suit ana his Mocber knew his designs, she would approve of chem; that ha
would consider how Mustapha coming one day to raign, he could not meet wich a beecer oc¬
casion CO secure his fortune, then to oblige him in this encounter; that besides, knowing how
considerable the interests of tbc Sultana. Queen were to him, he found that he should not do
her any very good scrvxe in conduding a Princess*to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, with whom hc was desperate¬
ly in love.
</p>
<p>To all these chings, iJ«/?&lt;j» answered wich an insolent coldness, how he remembred very
well, that he was the son of Roxelana, and for chac onely reason <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should noC know
of che resistance he made co che execucion of his commandmencs; ehae he feared noc che dis-

I should abuse your pacience, is I should repeat unto you all that lovc, sury, and despair, made
Prince Gianger say upon this occasion; and all that sorrow and generofity put into the Prin¬
cesses mouth in so grievous an encounter: but in conclusion they must give way to force, and
obey. Farraida also had a command to enter into a charet with y^.v&lt;4&gt;»t^4, which she did
without any resistance, as soon as she had obtained, that an onely son, which she had, stiould
not abandon her; but contranly, shc seemed to have some consolation, out^of the thought
that she was going to meet with bet dear Mustapha again. As for Gianger, Ruslan told him,
that he might do what he pleased, but this Prince was not in an estate to reason upon that he
had to do. It is easie for you to comprehend the deplorable condition wherein he found him-
icit, and what the separation vyas between that Prince and the Princess. He earnestly desired

ed out her hand to him in turning away her head to conceal her weeping from him and as
sured him that whatsoever Fortune could do, she should n^ver destroy the friendstiip and"
esteem which shc had for him: That she promised him, for a testimony that she would not

to attempt any ching on her life, is noching were attempted on her honor.  Thisdiscourse

<p>Now, my Lord, I have already told you, I think, thac Ruslan arrived ac Amasta the next
day after .^/ajy?**/)^/* and I were gone from thence; sothat our voyage having lasted a day
longer then it should have done, by reason of that breaking of the charet, whereof, it I be
not mistaken, I have spoken to you before; and i?»/?&lt;i» having caused thePrincesses to set
forth cwo hours after his arrival; chance, or to say betcer, our ill forcune, brought themat¬
ter about with so strange a justness of cime, thac ac che very same instant, when as I was be¬
seeching <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> by the memory of the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; when as I was lamenting het
untimely death, and was all in tears with the grief thac I said I was in for her loss, I saw het
come in followed by Farraida, and conduded by Ruslan, who at the very first named het
to the Grand Signior.  To Cell you, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, whac a case I was in, and that whidi
this sighc esseded boch in <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s minde and mine, isabsolucely impoflible for me: the

Farraida, hearing her husband named, cast her self at <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s feet, to protest unto him
that hc was innocent: but he, withouc hearing or heeding her, curned about to the Princdii
with a little more civility, and said unto her with a countenance chac yec resented the trouble

Si^nioy's Tent,to go to that whither they were conduding us,we encountred danger,whom
the Ckp«&gt;« had not suffered to enter at such time as we were carried in. This Prince, seeing
us all in ctars, approached eo <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; Well chen. Madam, said he unto her, what, ;m I to

destiny, and chac ofmy dear broeher, Co cbe end I raay regulace mine by yours, and chat there¬

conversation, neither would incense the spirit ofthis young Prince, before his intentions were
accomplished, for fear he should be carried to some violence, answered him, tha.t <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s
anger would be appeased, that patience would overcome him; and left he should be ofsended
is he came to know it, that it was sit he should forbear speaking to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, because he had
expresly forbidden it, and thac without exception. I am undone, replyed Gianger, love or
choller hath been the cause of this Command, and howsoever ic be,'I am equally unhappy.
Comfort your self,said the Princess to him, and be sure that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> will never do any thing
unworthy of her birch, of her courage, and of the esteem which you have of her: Buc inthe

<p>Rustan, seeing this conversation continue still, committed the Princesses and me to the cu-
stody of them that accompanied him; but Farraida increated him, that ber son might at least
be restored to her; for he would not let <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> see him for fear he should have been moved
with it: this cruel raan granted ber this grace, out ofthe doubt he was in, V st her cries and
lamentations should have caused some tumult amongst the Soldiers is they had heard them. As
for him, hc stay'd with gianger, to whom he said so many things, to pacisic him, and to
make him believc,that the more patient he was, the more submission he shewed, and the more
considence be put in the goodness of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, the raore would he make it appear in this occa¬
sion, as any other then danger would have been deceived therewith. But he, who knew the

came to them at that very time, had not counsclled him the same thing, though it was with a
very disserent intention. He promised him to go to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, for to endeavor the appeasing
of his sury; and intreated him that in the mean time he would repair to his Tent, wichout
permiecing any body co see him; as well because he was come Co the Camp without tbe Em¬

him that after he had been wich the Sultan, he would come and give him an accompt ofwhat
he had done. Giangtr would fain have spoken with his vertuous friend in private, to have dis¬
covered unto him his love, and his brothers innocence, but itwas impoflible for him. Not
being able to do otherwise then, he went Co Achmat's Tent, there Co attend his return, wich a

<p>The generous Achmat did his uttermost endeavor to oppose ic; he represented to Solmti
the assedion which he had always born to that Prince; the brave things he had done,- the
rare qualities that were in him ; the little hkelyhood there was, that he would blemisb sofjii
a hse with so dettstable a Treason; that assurtdly there was something concealed inthisassait
which could not be comprehended; thac ac the least ic was to be well examined, and not con-
demn the lawsul Succesfor of the Empire without hearing his Excuses or Reasons; thathe
should be obliged to condemn himself by the acknowledgment of his crime; and that tar Itooi
judging him, without hearing his Justisications, he held that it stood with thegreamess and
goodness of his Highness, suppofe he were guilty, to pardon him his fault, so as he consessed it
with repentance j and in sine, thac in remembring he was a King, he stiould not forget he was
a sacher.  Ic was with such like Reasons, that Achmat soughc to move the heart ot Stlmw -.
hMitheTxiytox Rustan, without giving the Grand Signior kisuxe Co answer, drew venom
ouc of all these fair flowers, and undid the infortunate Mustapha with the same Reasons
wherewith Achmat had desended him. Hc answered him, that tbe more <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had bed
him, the more ingratesul he was in betraying him; that the brave things he had done, wen
not so much for che good of che Empire, as for cbe ruine of ic, since he did not make use of tbe

<p>^ I eave you to judg, my Lord, whether chis wicked man gave Soltman any leasure to repent
scimofsocrueland unjust a Commandment ? or whether contrarily, hepoftednot with an
Seam p ecipitation to obey bim ? Achmat perceived wdl by h.s countenance that the or-

would have gone sohastily on: sothat albeit he was in some unquietness at th.sprofcd.ng

</p>
<p>the Sultan commanded him to stay, and sell a walking, sometimes very tast, somet.tnes more
kasurely • one while he stood looking on Achmat, without saying any thing untohim; by
and by he listed up his eyes to Heaven,then soddenly turned them down to the ground ; ac lass,
after so violent an agitation both of body and mind, he ka^ned on Achmat, and b holding
him with more marks of grief chen of anger. Mutt I, said he unco him, ascer s have hved uncil
now, exempted from ill ehe crimes ofmy Predeccssurs, be constrained by Muslapha to lay a
stain upon my life ? and must ie be said of me, that I have dipt my hands in the blood of my
son ? Achmat, surprized with this discourse, and willing to make use of so good a motion,
cast himself at his feet, and said so much unto him, that s neither his Reasons, nor the good
nature of this Prince, being any longer combated by the malice of i?»/«i«; he told him with
tears in bis eyes, that he feared he had been but two well obeyed, and that his re pcntance came
but too late. And then astet he had consessed unto him the Order he had given Ruslan,he com¬
manded him to go with all speed to revoke it. But, my Lord, there was no more time for ir,
because as soon as <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had gotten permishon to exercise his cruelty, the wicked man had
taken four Mutes along with him, having each of them a Bow-string in his hand, for in that
manner it is, as you know, that the children of the Royal Family are here put to death, and
carried them to the Tent of Mustaphajxom whom at che first they had required his Scymitar,
which he had given them without resistance. This Tyger staying without the Tenc with
them ehae had accompanied him, as well Co keep any body from entring, as to hear whac this
miserable Prince would say in breaching out his last, his Execucioners began Co aceempt che ac-
complishing of cheir charge.
</p>
<p>When Mustapha first saw chese four Mutes enter, he made no doubt but hc was lost; yet
being strong and courageous, he could not resolve to suffer himself to be strangled wichouc
some desence. The first that would have put che string abouc his neck, he layd ae his feet j
the like be did to the second ; and having put himself in a pofture that he could not be seized
upon behind, he not a little troubled his Executioners. He had already taken three of their
sirings from them, and it may be he raight have desended himself so long, till Achmat might
have arrived soon enough, had not the Traytor <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> put his secad into the Tent, and by signs
threatened the Mutts Co do their duty. Mustapha, hearing thisvoyce, and knowing it, lesc
his Executioners to go Co Rustan; which was the cause chat those four men salling all upon
him, overthrew him the more easily to the ground, and put the string about his neck. This
deplorable Prince had the leasure yet to say in strugling with them sas some of them who ac¬
companied <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> have reported) Do so much at leastwise, thou cruel man, that I may be the
only sacrisice to appease die rage of Roxelana; and that my death may obtain the hves of
Gianger, Farraida and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. With these last words, which interceded for
anothers life, Mustapha lost his own ; and in his person dyed one of the greatest and most ex¬
cellent Princes ofthe World. The people have brutcd abroad, how by a communication that
was there, from <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s Tent to Mustapha's, that Prince had the cruelty to excite the
Mutes to strangle his son; but very tar from thac, Achmat arrived wichin a moment after
Muslapha cxptxed, who, as I have told you, came to change the satal Order, yNhich Rustan
had but two mW execuced. This Prince was no sooner dead, buc Rustan, as is some ebrv
would have redounded to him by so barbarous an ad, wenc Co render <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> an accompt ds
"'7m^" J ''"owing ought ofthe alceracbn of his mind; for Achmat had been so surprized

<p>This first motion of sorrow being over, the vertuous Achmat believed that he owed tli
consex^nixonofdangertoihememoxy of Mustapha; he wenc then with speed to him sr
tear left being acquainted with this lamentable news by another, he stiould take some s^nm
resolution. In che mean cime the report of this death being spread over tbe Camp, all the si
nizariesame siocVm^io Muslapha'sTent, where finding him dead, they rendered him all
the eestimonies of grief, which assedionace Soldiers could render to their General.  Allthe
Commanders did che like; there were nothing but cries and lamentations; some threw
themselves upon his body, and embracing him wet him with their tears; others said aloud
that they must revenge his death, teer out Ruslan's heare, remove Salman from bis Throne'
go and burn <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> in her Serraglio, and declare Mustapha's son Emperor, though he was
but a child.  Some again,less violenc and seditious, chrevs down their arms, made a vow never
to bear any, and having thereof sramed as it were a Trophy, which they ereded to the vertue
of this Prince, they layd his body upon it, and abode round about it weeping the loss they had
sustained. Never was there a more general consternation seen; all che Soldiers continued four
and twenty hours without eating: and is the prudence of Achmat had not shewed it self in this
occasion, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s Throne had been overturned, and his person in danger.  As for us, we
heard indeed a great noise, but it was impoflible for us to comprehend what it might be; and
they whom i?«/?4» had lesc Co guard us were so saichsul untohim, as they would not clear it
unto us.  We imagined with our selves, that peradventure Prince danger, having made one
part ofthe Soldiers to rise, endeavored to deliver Muslapha, to the end be might come after¬
wards and deliver us also; and in this estate we were between fear and hope.  In the mean
while <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> was gone back to Soltman, who seeing him enter alone, demanded of him what
Mustapha said ofhis clemency.  My Lord, answered he mightily surprised, Mustapha is no
longer in a condition ever to say any thing to thy Highness that may displease thee. Ah! in¬
fortunate that I am,and most base as thou art,continued Soli7nan,how readily hast thou obey-
ed me in a wicked adion ? He asked him then whether he had not seen Achmat; and having
understood thac he arrived noc cill ascer the death of the Prince, he shewed such exceshve grict,
as the like was never seen.  <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> amazed at so sudden a change, would have represented
unto him, how much this death assured che quiec of his Empire; buc the Sultan, exceedingly
moved wich choller, chased him from his presence, and forbad him for ever appearing belore
him again.
</p>
<p>In che mean time <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> not knowing whom to make his moan Co about his crime and
his misfortune, commanded Achmat co be sent for again to him. He was lought for, and
found with Prince danger, much busied in moderating the violence of his grief, tor he hadic-
quainced him with che death of his brother. These two Princes had always loved so dciily
together, as never was there a morepersed and dis-interesled amity then theirs; sothatits
easie to imagine the despair Gianger was in, when he knew not only chat his brother wasdeid
ofa violent de'ath; but thac which touched his heart more nearly, that he dyed for his sake,
withouc being culpable of any thing, but of coo much loving him. Ah I my Lord, that Icould
repeat vnco you all that this asshded Prince said in so lamentable an adventure I butyouw"!

der this mircbies, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>ievxt Achmat to let the Soldiers understand, how ^^rr^t^u was
in that Tent, and that in seeking to revenge Muslapha, they were upon the point of burning
his wise and his son. But to take from them an objed, which might exasperate their grief,
Achmat held it convenient, not to leave <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, Farraida, or Mustapha's son any longer
in the Camp; so that having drawn J"&lt;i//»w« to like of it, and kepc the Soldiers stom ofser¬

man, that she stould be entreated by him with the resped which was due to her condition j
and that in attending till they might advise what was sit to be done therein, he desired her she
would be pleased to suffer her self to be conduded to sConstantinople. As for Farraida, he
told her with tears in his eyes, that theGrand Signior pexmitted het to chuse a retreat, in
whatphice of his Empire she would; assuring her, that he would have as much care of pro-
ledingher, as he had had violence in the person of Mustapha. Farraida no longer doubt¬
ing of the death of her dear husband after this discourse, and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> being but coo well

as ic had past, excusing <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> as much as he could, he made them comprehend that Ruslan
was the cause of all this mischief.
</p>
<p>In the mean tixne <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, in the midst of her asshdion, demanded news of Gianger;
and after she had been assured that he lived, mdthzt the Grand Signior had none buc good
thoughts for him, she aaved pardon of che infortunace Farraida tor having been the cause
of her miseries; and made this discourse With so much tenderness and grief, as Farraida
her self was moved with her rrsentment. Mustapha's son yet surcber augmenced che Prin¬
cesses displcasure; for albeic this childe had noC attained Co the cenlh year of his age, he seem¬
cd to be so asshded for tbe loss of his father, and said such generous and reasonable things,
as it might bc said, that he would have as much resembled him in the qualities of the minde,
as in the seatures of the face, is Fortune had permitted him to live. He assured Farraida,
that he would one day revenge the death of his father; he grieved that hehad not somuch
strength as courage, and that he could give her nothing but tears in this occasion.

<p>I mould never have done, my Lord, is I should repeac all this conversation unto you: but

voyce, wich a more quis-t countenance chen before, Let some of you, O Soldiers ssaid he) i

his death, he hath pm this steel into my hand ; and lee the Princess of Persta know also, that I
did not dye cill I had lost the hope of pofseshng her: saying this, he stab'd the dagger into

unto her, the greatest chat can happen to you in the estate wherein you are. Wc heard a
redoubling then of the wailings, lamentations, and cries of the Soldiers, who making the nime
of danger to xefound all about, said so much of his death, asthey had acquainted her but
too well whac this misfortune was, without putting me to the trouble of telling it her. She
commanded the charet, wherein we were, to stand still; but the consusion was so great, and
the noise so dreadsul, as her Order could not be heard; besides, they that conduded us, took
such care to gee us speedily ouc of the Camp, asl beleeve is they had heard what Ihe said,
they would not have obeyed her; so that we wenc away in this manner, without more par¬

generous Soul, which never fainted under her own misfortunes, found it self then too weak,
to support those of another. For chough love had no place in her heart, amity, compallion,
and the obligations wherein she slood engaged toVxinee danger, produced the same esreof
in her upon this occasion. Whac said she noc Co testifie her asshdion I or to lay better, what
did she not that she might not survive this last miship I she absolutely declined the care of h"
preservation, she resused co eat, and I dare say, she would never have resolved to live,«
with my tears and prayers I had not conjured her not to leave me in the hands of a Princs,
which might entreat me as one culpable. It was not because I was pofsest with that tear;
but seeing this Ptincess no way sensible of her own conservation, I beleeved, that the same
generofity, which made her despise her life, to lament anothers misfortune, would induce her
to preserve it for the easingof mine. As Indeed, after that she suffered metotake acaieo

to expofe himself inconsideratly,and chac having noching more to do there for the service ofthe
Sultana, he might go and render her an account ofhis doings. He parted immediacely then as
secretly as poflibly he could; but he stayd nevertheless at che first Town he came eo,where one
of his servants, whom he had given in charge abouc ie, came and acquainted him with all thac
had been done in the Camp; I mean,the revolt ofthe Soldicrs,the death of gianger,So Umans

<p>to the parts ^bo\xt Prusa, and from thence sent to Farraida one of the ministers of his s
who was his Slave, and who made shew that he was come to this excellent Princess tromT
Grand Signior, to assure her of the continuance ol his good-will and protedion He js^
broughc presents to her son, as being gages of the Sultan's assedion. He cold her hxtk
that his Highness would make Muslapha revive in che person of chis young Prince • and th't
he commanded her to have a great care of his health and education. This infortuna'te mother
who knew by the publique voycc how much <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> seemed to repent him of his violence'
suffered her self co be perswaded chac all which chis wicked man said was true. In the mean
time he chinks of execucing his design any way whatsoever; and seeing it was hard for him
to remove chis young Prince srcm Farraida, either Co finde means to poyson him, or to do
any violence in a Town, where the memory of Mustapha was in so much veneration, he be¬
thought him to perswade Farraida that she would accustom her self to take the ayr, for seat
kst keeping always in thac sort within doors, her melancholly stiould pass unto her son, and so
prove prejudicial co his healch. After he had gotten this Princess to yeeld unto that which he de¬
sired, he propounded to her a thing, which, very much agreeing with her sad and heavy hu-
mor, seemed to be a very sie and pleasing encercainmenc for her; which was to go and see the
Grand Signior's Tombs, that were four or sive miles distant from this Town, and whose
stately Mofques are co this day very carefully maintained. Now, my Lord, that which in-
duced this Ttaycor to give Farraida chis counsel, was, thac having suborned him, who wasto
drive her Charec, he had broken che axlecree of ic, not quice through, buc in such a manner,
as he foresaw how upon their arrival ac a very disstculc passage, which was just in the midll
of che way, chac which he expeded would assuredly come Co pass, as indeed the matter suc¬
ceeded accordingly. In helping che Princess into her Charec, he perswaded the young Prince
to go wich him on horseback, who, according co che custom of children, was ravilhedwith
this propofition. Farraida, out of a thought of tenderness, or ic may be out of an instinsl
that advertised her of her misfortune, opposed ic as much as she could; buc seeing her son
asshded at it, and chat this man promised her to hold him in his arms, and co have a great care
of him, she consenced co ic. She was no sooner out of the Town, but this Traytor who car¬
ryed the young Prince, beganto gee before, and by lictle and little going farther from the
Charet, as is he had not done ic of purpose, Farraida lost the sighc of him.
</p>
<p>This infortunate Princess seeing her son no longer, began co fear without knowing where¬
fore, whereupon she commanded her Charet-raanco drive as sast as he could, but whereas
he was suborned, he obeyed noC ac first, howbeie shc threatened him in such anger, as hewas
constrained to do whac she would have him; but chis speed was chac which retarded her de¬
sign che more; for che axlecree sas I have told you) being half broken, and tbe Charet going
violently on, it btokc sooner then otherwise ic wonld have done. Farraida,behM^,s^
overcurned,and no longer seeing her son,never consulced on chac which she was eo do; so that
abandoning her Charec, and walking on sooc, followed by two women that accompanied ber,
she continued in che way which she had caken, with a crembling of her heart, and anextreissl
grief. And whereas she was carryed by assedion, shc wenc so sast, as buc one of her women
could follow her. She arrived then neer tothe Grand Signior's Tombs, but alass I What
was the objed which she encountred there ? she beheld her son strangled, still warm, pant¬
ing, and almost in the last pangs of death. This deadly spedacle touched her in so Itrsngea
manner, as she sell down as it were dead upon the body of her son.     ,
</p>
<p>In the mean time hc chac had driven Farraida's Charec, being remrned to the Town, J"
the remorse of his crime making him to answer those from the purpose which demanded o
him where the Princess was, a great part of the Town, men and women, went themicivej

were both carried back to Prusa, where this accident caused so general a mourning,and touch¬
ed every one so sensibly, as there was not any testimony of assedion, or mark of honor, which
they ofthis Town did noc render CO che Corps of ^^^-m^^i and her son, which ot their own
authority they layd in the Sepulchres of the ancient Emperors, a thing without example. The
chiefest amongst them went in all haste to pursue the Murtherer of this young Prince, but he
was already gotten far enough oft" with Rustan, who no sooner understood that his Command¬
ment was executed, buc away he pofted to carry <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> che news of it, who received it
wich unspeakable joy.
</p>
<p>Now whereas the Sultan was to arrive within two days, she counsclled him to conceal
himself, until she had appeased his displcasure. In the mean time she willed bim so to order
the matter, as it might be believed, that the death of Mustapha's son came by the Command¬
ment of ^o/j?w^.», for fear left hc being suspeded for it, should draw the peoples hatred upon
him, who would easily be perswaded of that which they were willing should be. As indeed,
the most part were ot that opinion, though it were otherwise; for that Slave ot Ruslan's not
long since consessed it on his death bed. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> at his return understanding the death of
Mustaphas son,testifieda great deal of sorrow and anger for it; but <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> accustomed to
prevail over the spirit of this Prince, with her wiles and rears. Cold him, chac chis adion ic may
be was noe eoo much disadvaneageous Co ehe quiec ofhis Empire, for she had been informed,
thit Farraida, since her being ac Trw/i, bad concinually inspired her son wich choughcs of
revenge; chaC all ehey of chac Town, whensoever he palsed through che streees, did nothing
buc wish him a longer life chen his sacher, Co ehe end he mighe revenge his dcach, and mount
up CO a Throne which appercained unto him; that without doubt some roan zealous for his
Highness hid undertaken this bold adion; and therefore according to her sence the Author of
it was not to be much looked after. This discourse, which sbould have begot a suspicion in
the mind of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, perswaded him, and was so prevalent with him, as there was no further
enquiry made ofthis crime, which consirmed tbc people in the opinion, that it had been com¬
mieeed by his Order. Ascer this, <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> did her uttermost endeavor to obtain Rustan's
grace, but she could not pofsibly do it. In the mean time the vertuous Achm,it, having un¬
derstood more particularly the extream assedion, which Prince Muslapha and Prince Gianger
had born to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, to shew how dear their memory was unto him, had obtained the per¬
mission to see her, which be bath done as often as his occasions would suffer him. And it is by
him also chit we have understood, how <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> would not sincc his return IcC any body speak

<p>The Third Boo{.

<p>THe next day <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> went to the Grand Signior, and with a dextrous discourse he gave
him to undcrstand, that he had learned what he durst not tell him. But in imparting thii
to him, he lee him see also, that he lamented him wichout accusing him; and carrying him
insensibly CO spea.^ oi <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, he besoughc him to grant him one grace which he would
demand of him in favor of her and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> gave not the Bassa leasure to explain
his desire, but assured him chac he mighc do whac he pleased iot <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; the repentaqce
of his saulc, and che remembrance of his misfortune, having so absolutely extinguilhcd the
love which he had born her, thac is he would even send her back into Persta, although Ihe
was the daughter ofhis Enemy, and thac sh: might serve for the good of his affairs, yet would
he not resuse Co consenc unco ic. My Lord, answered <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, I precend Co no other grace
for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, then to make her change her prison, in obtaining of thy Highness, chat Ihe
may be sent Co Bitistsa, and that she may be encreated as a person of her birth. And then to
oblige him the more to that which he requested of him, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> acquainced him with the
interest which Vlama had in <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>: Hc made it appear unto him also, that his in this
occasion was annexed to thac of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; that it was requisice he should by his good us&gt;g«
of her justisie himself Co her, for the violence which/?»/?&lt;*» had ofsered her, in carrying her
forcibly away against his Highness will: that she would be in his power as well at BitHis*, ^
at sConslantinople; but that being ncerer to ber Country,she woiild receive tbe mote comfort
by ic, and might be even the means of an advantageous peace for. his Highness.
</p>
<p>After all chde reasons, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> answered him, thac they were necdless, since his entreaty
alone sufficed co ihake him consenc to all thac he could desire; there being but cne onely ttog
which he could never obtain of him. The gran^ Visier, not daring to be curious in thisen-
councer, for fear of receiving some distasteby it, contented himself wich giving Solmis^
thanks, and omitting no time, he went and^e oVder to have a stacely equipage provided
for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>. And whereas he was exad in all chings, he used such diligence, as theday
after all was in the state which hc desired it to be. 'He went the next morning to theultK
of the seven Towers, where in few words he propounded to the Princess her going to Biti¬
Usa, whereof Vlama was Governor, and where she stiould haveno straitera prison tnen
the walls of the Town, nor other guard chen his and Vlama's faith. He cold her s"oreove^

to do you, but also make me beholding to you all the days of my life, provided you will sus¬
ser your self ro be perswaded, that his Highness had never any intention to have the Princess
of Tersia be carryed away by force; that he hath not been violent towards Muslaphahis
son, but at the instigation of others; thac the onely desed of this Prince is onely a tacihty,
whereof love and his gentle nature are tbe causes: and that in sine, he hath so raany rare qua¬
lities, as he is not unworthy the esteem of the incomparable Axiam'-ra. The assedion which
yc;U bear to chis Prince, replyed shc, jusiisies, is not all that he hath done, at least-wise all
his intentions. And though he be in some fore the cause of the greatest part of my miseries,
yet I promise you, O generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>,to give credit rather to your words,then to mine own
experience; and never to speak of this Prince, buc as you speak of him your self. I will
complain of Forcune, wichouc raurmuring against <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; and albeic I am resolved to weep
allmyhse-timeforthelossof those two illustrious children of his, yet will I not accuse any
for ic buc che crutl Roxelana, and the persidious Ruslan. This conversation lasted yet a good
while longer, and was spent in civility on either part. <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> in her particular gave Ibra¬
him a world of thanks, and assured him she would render Vlama an exad account of that
which hc had done for her, to the end he raight help to acknowledg ic in pubUstiing ie, since
they could never acquire themselves of it ocher-ways. Presendy chereupon, che Grand Visier
took his leave of che Princess, and cold her, chac she mighc deparc the nexe morning, is her
healch would permic her: As indeed all her equipage was ready accordingly, buc with such
magnificence, as is she had been in sersia. This excellent Princess had made her self to be so
beloved of chem that guarded her, as they could not see her part wichouc abundance of
tears, though they very much rejoyced for all that toknow, thac her prison stiould noC be
thence forward so strait. But amongst the rest, Halima was so asshded at it, as sbe was not
to be comforted; she gave her two Slaves, who had always waited upon her during her im¬
prisonment; tnd <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, in recompence thereof, gave her a chain of Diamonds, which
she had still kept in all her misfortunes.
</p>
<p>In tbe mean time <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had sent away Vlama's Slave, whora he had broughc away
from the Castle of the seven Towers the day before, to advertise his Master to repair co Biti-
Usa, ishis strength would permic him, chere co receive the Princess. But in case he should
notbe able soto do, he dispatched away another man, with a command from the Grand
Sigmor to all the Governors of those Towns, which were upon the road, whereby she was
to pass, to render her as much honor, as is she had been the Sultana Queen. And the Grand
Vtsier, to otnit nothing that might be for the Princess of Persia's safety, had also coramand¬
ed hve ehousand 7^«.;tm.. to be her convoy, whom she found ready attending for her a
days march from ^a«y?.«^;«„;/,. This Princesses journey had as profperous a success, as
Arahim had wisoed it should. She was received with a great deal of magnificence at all che

<p>But whil'st <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> asswages other solks sorrows, his love renders him evervdavrnl
unhappy The more he sees Salman, the less appearance he sees of obtaining his liberty whi
he had resolved to demand of him ac his departure from <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>. This Prince ceased nt
dayly telling him, that he had been d:ad is he had not rccurned; that he was the soul of his
Empire; that he could not subsist wichouc him; chat six monchs absence of bis had been the
cause of more misforcune to him, chen be had had in all his life besides; and chat z«/i; foot
being able to live without him, he must resolve to dye with him. To all these particulars the
illustrious Ba^a made no other answer then with low submissions, buc by his sighs and silerce
he testified sussiciently to the Sultm, chac he expressed not all his choughc; and chac thelight
of his Mistress had racher augmented his lovc, chen diminished his unquietness. Neverthe¬
less, whereas che Grand Signior was desirous to avoyd all occasions chac mighc constrain him
to resuse <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, he made as chough he did not perceive his sadness, buc endevored co gain
him absolutely, and divert bim from his melancholy, by all the honors, by all the liberalities,
and all the caresses, that a greac Prince can conser on a great Minister. But the more die Btjsn
saw himself obliged, the raore asshdion he had: He received the Sultan's presents, as soma¬
ny new chains, which tyed him unto him; his favors were torments unto him; and though
in his heart he loved this Prince dearly, yec would he not have been loved of bim, so certain
it is that love is stronger then amity.
</p>
<p>Inthis deplorable estace hved <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> Wiih^n extream constraint; he dele no longer in
affairs as he was wont; he declined che wodd as rauch as he could; yea the very fight of St.
liman became insupportable to him; and not daring to desire of him the power to return in¬
to <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, out of the opinion he had that he should be denyed, he sought no longer for any
thing but onely solicude. Ie was noc because his grief was che less sensible to him by it, but
it was because he knew, that the liberty to bewail ones sds is some kinde of consolation to
an asshded person.  At length, after he had well consulted with himself, he resolved to speak
plainly to the Grand Signior, with an intent it he were resused sas he almost made no doubt
but he should) to abandon himself in such fore Co grief, as death would bcconlirained to
succor him; but he knew not, when he cook this resolution, chac hecould not execute it:
for as often as he went Co che Serraglio for thaC purpose, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> with so much addreli a-
voyded all manner of discourse thac might carry che Bassa co speak Co him of IsabelU, d
always cook such care to lee him know ehe neceshty he had of his presence, as the Gmi
Sister, no longer doubting, but chac J'o//7»/«« would deny him is he dcraanded his liberty of
him, undertook not to augment his displcasure yet further, by the certainty of an evil, wher^
of he was already but too well assured.  He reraained then without speaking, and tbutting
up his thoughts in his heart, he grew to be the melancholickest man in the wodd. He aban¬
doned the care of affairs, and making to himself a prison of his Palace, he went no more a-
broad, but now and chen to go to the Serraglio, and that too very seldom.  His presence,
which was wont to charm all <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s unquietnesses, now begot nothing but grief in him;
forbe saw him so altered, his eyes so sunk into his head, his face so pile, his huraot sofad,
and his spirit so croubled, as he could noc behold him without extream displcasure, but a dis¬
plcasure which he held to bc so rauch the more just, as he knew it to be the cause of that of
our illustrious Bassa. He soughc nevertheless to deceive himself, by laboring to be perswaded,
that peradventure ehe aleemeion which he saw in his dear <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, was a raalady of the bo¬
dy, as well as of ehe minde; wherefore he consulced wich a Jewish PhyHcian, and an Ar*-
bian, abouchim, who, having some cime observed the i?4/&lt;« without his being a ware of it,
judged the alteration, which was seen in him, Co proceed hom some strange cause, diCwnj-

Xwas?onble to discern, whether it were an essed of choller, or of asstid.on, sh. cm-
p oved all her address to be cleared therein.  <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had no longer that violent love ter her
ssich had so often blinded him, yec had she still that Empire over him, as he could never
resofe her any thing, but the grace of Ruslan; so that in this occalion he almost suffered him¬
self to be vanquished by her. He consessed not the whole truth unto her, but he told her,
rhat/^M/»»Vs melancholy was che cause of all his sadness; and withouc impa-'-iw roher,
that he was a Christian under the habic of a Turk., ox ofwhat Country he was, he coiu het
further that being fallen pashonately in love with a Christian Princess, whom hehad seen,
durin^'the voyage which he had made by his order; che grief of being deprived of her pre¬
sence and of the hope of pofseshng her, had brought him even to deaths door  Afterwards,
he declared unto her the sorrow he was in for it, and how he would give half his Empusi
to save <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>. My Lord, said the Sultana unto him, is thou wile accord me one grace,
which I will demand of thee, I will oblige my self to restore thy favorice eo his wonted joy,
I swear by Alia, rep'yed Soltman, to accord any thing, so as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> raay be saved.  My
Lord, said she unto him, Iwill ask of thee but till Co morrow Co engage my selt absolucely
for che performance of thatwhich I have propounded to thy Highness. Akhough Salman
saw no great likelyhood in chac which che Sultana said, yec he found same content in not re¬
solving so soon to be dcpnved of Ibra him.  s
</p>
<p>In the mean season Roxelana, without lofing a minutes time, sent Ruslan word, who lay
still concealed in ConslantinapU, Co come ae the beginning of che nighc to one of the gates of
the Serraglio, where he stiould finde two ofher black slaves attending for him, and not to fear
repairing thither, because the Capigibassi, chat kept che gate, was absolutely hers.  Ruslan
sailed not to be present ac this ashgnation,no more chen che Slaves eo receive him,and to bring
him in.  When he was in her chamber, she told him, chat whatsoever she could do, it was
impofsible for her to obeain his grace; and chac she thought he would never obtain it, but by
some very extraordinary way; thac there was one did chen presenc it self, which she would
propofe unto him, to the end ehae is he saw any likelyhood in ic, she would finish chac which
she had begun; and chen she recounted unto him what <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had said co her, and what
she had answered. But it appeared that Ruslan was beceer informed of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s fortune,
then Qie imagined; for chis man, who choughc of nothing but his re-establisbment, had
suborned one ot the Grand sisiers servants, to endevor Co finde out, whether chis illustrious
Basa were che cause chac he was not restored. This servanc, suborned by Rustan, wenc ofcen
to him to give him account of chac which he learned: and the very same day that Roxelana
had sent for him, he had acquainted him, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was in love with a Princess of Italj,
to whom appertained a Town called <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; that che grief for being absent from her had
madehim sick, and would cause his death, is the Grand Signior gave him not liberty to re¬
turn thither to see her • that he had heard all this chrough <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s chzmbex door, who talk¬
ed thereof in private to an Italian Slave, whom he very much loved, and whom he had com-
minded, is he dyed for sorrow, ashe secmed not to doubt, to obtain permission of the
Grand Signior to go and exccute hij last Will, in carrying a Letter to the Princess whom hc
loved. <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> having acquainted <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> with whac he knew concerning <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, Cold
her afterwards, thac is <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> vjould bc pleased to lee him speak with him, he did not
doubt but I0 finde a lemedy for the grief of his favorite. It is not^ said <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> interrupting

demanding of an Army of .Wjw^w to bring awaychij Prinais by force, whose abseJc
cmsed <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s suffering: bat Ruslan replyed, thac as long as or^.^conld work by addrest
no recourse was Co be had co force; chat for him, he knew better how to beguile then t
fight; and in the end, without explaining his design unto her, h; promised her toperi|]°

war, throughly provided; and might be permitted to say, in the places where he should a
board, cbat he was going to che King of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, in the quality of a Chaoux, from the Grand
Signior.  Roxelana, seeing <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> so resolute for ^this enterprize, sent bim away, and told
him that the next day he should hear from her : as indeed, she delt in such sort with'the Grand
Signior, as he promised her the grace of i2«y?-«», is he could persoim thatwhich she pro-
pounded to him; and thisPrinceresolvedeven to endure the fight of him, that he might try
to render his dear <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> happy, without absenting him stom him. At sitst Rusinn craved
pardon of him, but when as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> pressed him to tell him,which way he hoped ro make his
design succeed,wherewith <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had already acquainted him. My Lord,answered he, I do
not think it a harder matter to carry away a Princess of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> by force, then a Princess aiPtr.
sia; wherefore let thy Highness be assured, that is that be given me, which the SuUam with¬
out doubt hath demanded of thee for me, andthat thou wilt make me hope I mayre-entet
into thy favor, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> shall quickly be the happiest man on the Earch; for wanting nothing
to make him so, buc ehe pofsession of this Princess, I will bring her to him ere it be long, no¬
thing save death alone being able to keep me from performing it. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had at the begin-
ing some aversion to this violence, but coraing to consider, chac ie was the onely way to
retain <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> wich him, hc forgoc all other considerations.  So that before he dismillcd
Rustan, he was absolutely resolved Co accempc che raacecr, and therefore he assured him that
he should depart within two days: but in che mean cime he charged him Co enereat the Ptin¬
cess of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, who was she chaC he was to bring away, with the same resped as heww
obliged to have for the Sultana Queen.  ,
</p>
<p>Things being in chese cerms, the Grand Signior caused all Rustan's equipage to bc made
ready, with all the diligence that pofsibly could be; he surnished him likewise with gteat
store of mony and jewels, in case he should have need of it; hehad also his dispatch, as is
indeed he had been senc co the King of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, in the quality ofa Chaoux.- and lacking no¬
thing else for his voyage, he set sail in as favorable a season as might be. This happy begiti-
ing of Navigation gave no salse hopes to the Pilot, who made such use of the advantage of k
wind and fair weather, as, his vessel being an excellent sailcr, he raade this cue with a speed,
the like whereof hath not been heard speak of in all the seas of the Levant. Ruslan v^^mi^-
ing to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, sent his skiss with one of his servants, and an interpreter, to demand per-
inishon of the Princess for his entrance into the Port, there to mend his vessel, which hesaid
was bruised with the sury of the Sea, and he had caused one mast and some of the tackle there¬
of Co be really broken, coche end, is whac he desired were not granted, he might havei
precexc Co stay in that place, and so might bc able to seek out some means for the executing ot
his design. But ic happened chat ehe Princess, having been constrained cogocoG^w"'^'^'

<p>would say was severed from him by a Tempest. The matter being thus resolved, he executed
it accordingly ; and taking into the main Sea again, to the end he might be seen to come from
the Levant, he sailed to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, where hewas received, not only as the Grand Signior's
Chaoux, as soon as he had shewed his dispatch, but as one sent from a Prince, to whom the
Republique had a great obligation. In the mean time he dexiroully enquired after the place
where the Princess of ATow^jco's Palace was; and having learnt it out, he made oneof his
Slav ;s watch always in the same street to discover, whether any preparations were a making
thereabout for a Voyage. He caused some to observe at the Port, whether any Galley were
ready to set forth, and all to be informed when she went; In conclusion, he omitted nothing
tbac m'giK- serve for bis design. He was certain days in this expedation with a great deal of
impatitnce; but Fortune, thac would not yet abandon him, sutnishedhim with a far more
favorable occasion to carry away the Princess, then that which he attended.
</p>
<p>One nighr, when as be wss in his Vessel, which notwithstanding the intreatics of the Se¬
nate he vvould never abandon, after be had heard a dreadsul noise of armed men, both ac the
Pore, and in rhe City, he was advertised by those whom he had senc thither, that all was in
con'ni^on there; that tbe gates were all open; chac the Port was no longer closed; and that
in this diforder, it could not bc comprehended who were che enemies.  Ruslan making profic
of this occasion, and others misson unes, leaves one part ofhis Souldiers in his Vessel, and sol¬
lowed by the other goes diredly to the Princess oi <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>'s Palace, sets a Petard Co che gace,
blows it up, enters in with his Forces, and conduded to IsabelWs lodging by che voyces of
her women, who called all the servants ofthe house to their succor, he forces it, and finds che
Princess, who first presented her self, beleeving she shculd meet with people that could un¬
dcrstand her language, and bc moved with her prayers: Bat she was much amazed, when she
saw they were Turkj; whereupon sbe gave a greac skreek, and stepping three or four paces
back, she would have sled into a Cabinec, buc Rustan, who perceived ie, recained her, and
puc her into the bands of his Soldiers, no way doubting but ic was the Princess, as well by
reason ofher good asped, as ofthe eagerness which all her women and all her servancs shew¬
ed in opposing ber carrying away. Nevercheless fearing he mighc be mistaken, he caused E.
milia, whom he saw Co be more richly apparelled then che test, to be likewise carried away -
for alehoughie was night, yec had all che women of s?#»o«&lt;« their clothes on, being risen out
oftheir beds upon the fearsul noise they had heard in the City.  And chen again it was easie
for thera to carry away i;«&gt;/7;rs, who seeing the Princess born away, did only cry out inthe
streets as they wcnc along to oblige some eo succor thera: As indeed there were those who
knowing her voyce would have withstood this rape, but ic was in vain; for Ruslan tiakine
use both of the valor of h.s men, of ehe diforder of the City, and of the darkness of the night,
caused these two fair asshded ones to enter into his Vessel,which had been made ready whil'st
he wasgone to this Execution; and from chence into <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s Galley, whereof the Turkilh

The unquietness and soar which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was in of lofing the Grand Sister, took himun
in such sort, as though the aefairs of y^r/^ were excream preshng, yec could he not resolve
to srame any design, concencing him onely with giving L'Z/iw^ order to oppose the Enemy
as much as he could, is he attempted any thing; buc noc to cntaprize ought against him un.
til he had a new order from him. This commandment no whit displeased Vlama; for albeit
he was one of the valiantest men of his age, yet was he very glad thac the War did not keep
him from abiding some ame with <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> and Selixanst. The Enemy himself contributed
dso to his design J for though he had goccen the ad vantage in the last occasions, yec was he a
long time without undertaking any thing.  That which caused this suspension of Armj wis
the news, which was Iwoughc to ihe Sophi's Court, ho^N <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>mxm
the hands of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who retained them prisoners. This last circumstance exceedingly ixxM-
hied the Sophi zndDeliment: they did not wonder, to know cercainly that they were not
dead, as all the world had beleeved them to be; nor to understand that they were in Turku,
because they aforetime siispeded that Vlama had carryed chem away ; bue to see him Gene¬
ral of the Grand Signior's Army in <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s absencc, and to hear ac che same instant that
his Mistrese was a Prisoner, was a matter which they could not comprehend. They resolved
nevercheless to endevor to be cleared therein, by the means of those seacc intelligences,which
all greac Princes have in their neighbors Courts; and in the mean time co make greac prept
rations for war, that they might serve their turns of them according to occasion. Mdmul,
who was acquainted wich this news better then they, testified a great deal of joy for it; It
was not because he was not forry to know that <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> were in prison, hot
having beleeved them to be dead, or in the power of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> and Deliment, he was rarilh.
ed to understand that they were living, and out of their tyranny; not being able to imagine
that cwo persons of thac importance could be ill entreated in a place, where Vlama was so
powersul.  Mahamed wasnot he atone, who wasglad to VxviVsj thzt <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> wajnot
dead, for this Princess was so generally beloved throughout thac Empire, as this news being
spred amongst the people, every one gave such marks of an unspeakable rejoycing, as is a me¬
morable vidory had been obcained over che Enemy. All the women of quality of the City
of Sultania, where <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> was resident, when as he received this advice, sent hambly to
beseech him, is there needed a ransom for the redemption of the Princess, that he would be
pleased to let all their jewels serve for a pare of ic j estecming themselves more then happy.''
with the loss of their liberty they could buy out the Princesses. This generous mark of asscst*

txciced as rauch crouble in bis soul, as jealousie did in the .y^^^^s.
</p>
<p>As for the ambitious Terca, the onely desire that she had to reign raade her Co move; and
that soe miqht rise to that sopream greatness, she thought there was buc two things wanting
to her • the^death of Delment, and the peoples hatred to <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>. For touching IJmaa
^nd Mahamed, she did noc beleeve that thestupidity of theone, andthe bhndnelsot the
other would p.rmit them to oppose her. So that to execute her intention, she perswaded
Deliment, that he was at this time to hazard all things; that it wasnot forhis honor, to
know <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was so neer the stontire, and not do his uttermost to draw her out ot Y^-^-
ma's hands: And for <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, she made him do that which by her counsel he had resolved
upon. He said before all his Court, that he Cook it very ill, soch joy should be testified upon
notice had that his daughter was in the power of his Enemy; thac the belies of her death had
touched him less, then tbe news he had received that she lived in that raanner; and then he
publiquely declared her guilty of high Treason, aggravating all that P&lt;sr&lt;:&lt;e had said tohim.
But though this Manisest bad some appearance of truth, yet found it no credic, eieher wich
the Grandees, orthe people. The violences of Deliment, the wickedness of T^rrs^, and
tbe vertue of AxLtrntra, were too well known to have the matter succeed, as <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> hoped
it would. Aad the people, on che contrary, seeing so great marks ot aniraofity in a father a-
gainst his daughrcr, in a sister against her sister, were ready to rebel, and be carryed Co some
strange rtsolunon.
</p>
<p>In the m-jan time Deliment thinks of levying of Troops, and making up so mighty an Ar¬
my, as, va; qiisotr or vanquished, it should absolutely decide the fortune of this war; being
resolved to dye, or to return with <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> on his side, following his resolution,
dispatches an Eoibassidor to the Grand Signior, toderaand his daughter, znd <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>oi
him; ofsering tvvo millions for their ransom, though by law he beleeved not himself obliged
to give any thing for two persons, that were not prisoners of war.  He sent away divers spies
at the same inls ant to BitiUsa, to learn what past there; but all of thera reported, chat che
Princess and Sdixana seemed to be absolutely at liberty; that Vlama rendred chem all iraa-
ginable civilities; and what care soever they took therein, they could not discover for what
reason the Princcis had been conduded to BitiUsa; the people saying no other ching, but
that it was bcs eved she was come neer unto Perjia to make propofitions of Peace. A few
days after, a Messenger sent by <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> came and broughc him a Leccer from this Princess,
who not doubting buc chat the Sophi had heard where she was, choughc ic was sie for her to
write unco him, to the end she mighc noe be wancing in that duty which she owed him, as
being her father. When he received this Letter, Perca and Deliment were there present,
who would have obliged him not to have read it, for fear left he should have been moved
therewith, but they could not prevail with him; for this Prince, provoked more by curiofi¬
ty, or the thought that he should finde something in ic which regarded <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, chen by any
kindness, opened ic, and reading it aloud, he saw thac was thus.

<p>The reading ofthis Letter touched the Sophi va a diverse manner; hc selc tenderness, con*
susion,and anger; and itmay be is he had been alone, Nature and Reason had prevailed so
powerfully for i/ixiamira, as she had carried away the vidory from her enemies; but tlie
counselfofP^rsrs, and the speeches of Deliment, wrought a clean contrary essed in him.
serca, told him, thac ic was coo daring a pare in her to be so bold, as co write such thingsto
him of a man whom he loved; chac wichouc doubc <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> spake noc chus, but because Ihe
was well assured, chac whatsoever ransom was ofsered, she should never be remitted into his
power; chat he was co eestisie a greac deal of resencmene for chis insolenc proceeding, andto
inereac him ill whom che Princess had sent, who questionless was come to Prince Mahml
ot as a Spy, racher then co bring him this Lecter, which could not serve <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> for ought,
whecher slbe remained in the sjr4»^ .yi^«*or'j Dominions, or whether she returned into his
Erapire. Deliment seeing the Sophi sussiciently incensed, took a disserent way from that
which Perca had held, which yet produced che same essed. He besoughc the Sophi, with"
salse generofity, to permit him to withdraw himself from affairs, and from about him, tor the
contenting of <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>. But che Sophi, as Deliment had rightly forecast it, forbad him the
further profecuting of this discourse, bis anger redoubling so rauch the raore by this artisics'
And fora conclusion, he called che parcy before him, who had broughc him che Letter troin
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, charged him never to come within his Dominions again, and told him, thatitne
had not purposed to have him carry back his Commands, he would have had him severely pu-
nished.Then he willed him to say unco her thac had senc himsfor he would not call her the VtiJ-
cess, his Daughter, ot <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>) chac hc had no other answer to make her, but that it t-
ransotn, which he had sent to ofser for her, did noc bring her back into Persia, he wouWg"
and setch her in the head ofan hundred thousand men; and chac in che view of lo mignty
Army, he would deal with her,as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had done wich Muslapha.     .

<p>nrsiudice him is!; were met withall, yet had she not sofsiciently concealed the extream assec-
Son which wasbetween them, and the incelligence tey had he d together, when she was at
Z^a.  So that as soon as it was read, it was reso ved, for fear^^.^.«..^ should nMive
Xis by some more secret way, eo have cwo things done. The first, to change all his House.
'othe end that having none thac he could crust abouc him, he might not receive any news from
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>.  And d e second, to secure his person, left some abroad should attempt chac which
was doubted trom them. This deiign being resolved, was quickly cxexuted. IhUment  ac¬
cording co his wonctd insolency, went himself to command the blind Prince from the .y.;,^*
noc CO irtr cue ot his lodging, and Co charge boch his Governor and all his servanrs to be gone
from him: Thac done, he placed a Guard abouc him, and left chis Prince in an assl.dion, the
like whereof he had never selt before. Ali thae came near him were his Enemies Agents, arid
whether he would or no he was enforced Co let ehera wait upon him. This detention made
a great noise in the Sopht\ Court, even the people themitlves were divers times about to rise;
but aoiorgst the rest the Princes domestick servants could not endure this violence.  And in-
d£ed,A&lt;lahamea's Governor, having assembled the chiefest ot them together, propounded unto
them' the enterprising ot carrying away the Prince their Master to BitiUsa.  He told them,
that it wasbetter to put him into the hands ofa courteous enemy, as Soltman was to Axia¬
mira, then to leave him in the power ofa cruel and incensed sadier; that as tor them, is they
continued at Sultania,they would not bc in safety,but upon theleasl suspicion that one should
have ofthcra they would be severely punished; so that as well for the conservation of che
Prince, as tor cheir own, ehey were Co undercake che delivery of him.  They all answered
him wich agreat deal of zeal and assedion, that they were ready to expofe their lives for the
Prince their Master; but that they did not think they could coramodiously do it for him.
Whereupon this wise Governor told them, how hc knew certainly that those which guar dtd
him, relying on his blindness, were not very exad in keeping him; that it being so, the mattet
would not be very dissicult, because the Prince lay in a low chamber, that jetted upon tbe Pa¬
lace garden, whereofthe walls were not very high; thac che only dissiculty was to advertise
him not to make any noise,at such time as he should hear his chamber window opened; which
indeed would not bc very easie to do,by reason the Prince could neither read that which slhould
be written to him, nor see the signs thac mighc be made him, so chac hc concluded something
was to be lesc eo chance; chat for so much as concerned cheir geccing ouc of the City, the
Governor thereof was resolved to follow the fortune of ^Ar/&lt;iw;r&lt;a, and to abandon a Go-
vernmenr, which he knew well would be taken from him in a shorc cime, by reason of che
qreat assedion he had testified to this Princess, and chac so ie would be easie for chem co escape.
This Propoficion being approved of by all, chey thought of noching else but of executing ir.
And whereas the nights were very dark, in regard the Moon did not shine, chey deserred it
no further.
</p>
<p>The Governor of Sultania, whom Mahahted had formerly gained, chofe amongst his Sol¬
diers those whom he believed were most faithsul to him, and without any notice taken of ic,
he placed them at one of the gates of the City, through which he meant to pass. Nighc being
CQxneAMahamedt delivcrets mec cogecher ac a Randezvouz appoinced by chem;chey brought
ladders eo encer into ehe garden, whereof ehe walls were bue low, as I have already observed.
For whereas Suhania wa^noc che residence of ehe Sophi, they had noc since the loss of Tauris,
as yet ereded any magnificent buildings there. This generous Troop,pashng between two Sen-
nnels.got into the garden without any obstacle, went diredly to Mahamed'sXodg^ng, opened
oneot the windows ofit, without awakening him, or any of hisguard who lay inhis anti-
chamber; and then he whose voyce they chought he best knew, entered into his chamber
with his drawn Scymitar in his hand, approached to his bed after he had sought for it a while,
and though he wakened him very softly, yet could he not so speak to him, but thae he gave a
a great skreek and dcraanded with raucltresolution, whether Z)s/i&gt;»s«s had sent to kill him.
Mahamed [p^Veso loud, that some of his guard awaked, and made a noise amongst them-

was very faithsul to him, held his peace, and by his silence made them of the guard who wer-

<p>In the mean time Mahamtdh^sin^ understood in few words, in what manner they woi
deliver him, suffered himselfto be conduded by him that spake to him.  All thisTroZ
ceived him with exceeding joy; bur fearing left theystiouldbe troubled with some crofsen"
counter, as soon as they had put clothes upon him, which they had brought purpofdy abp
with them,they went ouc ofthe garden, and presently after forth ofthe City. About an hun
dred paces from che gace they found horses, which che Governor of Sultania had caused tobe
there ready provided, and getting upon chem, they rode away with all che speed that polsibly
they could make.  But whereas che Prince could noc guide his horse, but was constrained to
let him be lead by anocher, chey could noC go so sast, buc chac the second day ot their joutney
they espyed a Troop of Horse pofting after them, which, being far raore in number then they
made chem beleeve, not only thac chey were pnrsued,buc chac they were all lost; nevertheless
they resolved to sell cheir lives deatly.Thc Prince coo,as blind as he was,caused a Scymitar to be
given h m, and Co che end, chac is chey soughc,he mighc noC strike his friends in stead of hissoes,
he commanded his followers noC Co come near him without calling him by his name; and
whereas his eyes did not serve him coassaulcany, he resolved to abide in one place, with an
intention not co suffer himself Co be taken alive.  Buc whaesoever he could do, his people
placed him in che midst of chem, much against his will, being resolved Co dye or epsave him.
In che mean time che Troop, which chey beleeved Co be cheir eneraies, came still oti, and evay
one was already preparing for desence, when as sche son of the Satrap of Mesapotmin, an
enemy to Deliment, advancing foremost, and throwing his Scymitar to the grounts, to let thera
know that he would not sighc wich ehera, made ehera change cheir resolucion of desending
themselveSjinco embracing chem.  Prince Mahamed understanding who be was, and know¬
ing him by his voyce, caressed him exceedingly, and learnc of him, chac it was long before his
shght was known; because his guard, noc having been accustomed co enter into his chamber
buc when he called chem, had waiced cill noon without going in; chac ehe macter being dis¬
covered, <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> ac che first shewed a greaC deal of sury; chac Perca had done nothing but

ofhis Army, co che end chac a man who saw so clear, mighe chuse cue ehe most advantageous

accused him for having been privy to his escape; and thac having been ill-intreatcd bytk
Sophi he was retired from che Courc, and had commanded him co come and ofser bim whatso¬
ever lay in his power, noc doubeing buC hehad caken the resolution to repair totheplace
where <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> had already found a sanduary; chac in che mean cime ic was requisite tot
them to make away with all speed, in regard it might be chat <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> had altered his deter-

rode on as sast as pofsibly chey could: but when they were come to the uttermost part o the

When she capdved you, she had wherewiehall Co make one believe that her thoughts we «

Sd proraised. But,my \.oxd,<hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> hath done rauch more or "ie hath despised death
for <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, she hath expofed her self for her, and this rare raaid hath testified so much c&lt;^n -
stancv and generofity in divers encounters, as it will be hard for you not to love her, when yeu
soall undsrstand it. I stiall sove her without doubt, replyed Mahamed, but the more wortsi

consirmed in the resolution, wherein I have a long time been, noc to esteem my tcls happy, but

</p>
<p>With such like discourses Mahamed and Vlama, without beinglieard of any but him that
guided the Prince, beguiled che cime; whil'st the rest entertained themselves with tbe weak-
ness of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> in suffering himselfto be governed in that manner, with the malice of Perca,
the stupidity of Ismael, and che universal hacred chac Deliment had drawn upon him. But ac
length after they had travelled a day and an half, chis Troop arrived ac and BitiUsa. ^ <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> were exceeding joysul Co see Prince Mahamed, who noc able to enjoy the same
selicicy, was nevercheless charmed eo hear chem speak, <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, who loved che Prince as
much as ishe had been her broeher, durst noc testifie so much unto him; but Vlama, being as
dextrously to discover her thoughes,as he had been in discerning those ofthe Prince, approach¬
ed to her, and told her laughing, that he had made certain conditions with Mahamed, which
he conjured her she should observe. Two such sage persons, answered she, could not resolve
on any thing which is noC just, wherefore I think that I shall not engage my selt inconsiderace¬
ly, when as I shall proraise you not Co break them. Vlama then told her in few words whac
had past beeween the Prince and him, K\dSeUxanapxoxn\sed Co do thac he desired; where¬
upon he lesc her co go and give order for che commodious lodging of all chis Troop. The
Princess would needs see all them that came along with the Prince; and with her sweet car¬
riage and address so absolutely gained them, as they would have enterprized any ching for her
service. Whil'st she was coraplementing, and Vlama giving diredion in the Town, Selixa-
na came to Mahamed, and such was their conservation Cogecher, as ic knic their friendship sast
for all cheir lives ascer. He requested her she would permie him Co be Vlama's consident,
and would forget the misfortunes which his love had been the cause of to her; hc thanked her
for the services she had rendered ioihe^tincess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; promised always to honor her
more then any person in che world; and without speaking to her of love, he gave her to nn-
dersland,that is reason had not prevailed over his inclination, he had still been V lama's Rival;
but ic was of chat power in his Soul, as he never spake a word to <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, contrary to the
proraise he had raade her, Do love her no otherwise then as his sister.

<p>In the mean time Vlama, ascer he had lodged che Prince in the Castle, the rest in the most

with theGrand Sigmor in his garden. It happened then thac one raorning <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> came to
visit him earlier chen he had used to do, and having raade him pass insensibly into his ereat
chamber, leaning on a Cane garnished with gold, which he raoft commonly went with when
he was in health, he would needs have him walk down, to the end, said be unto him he
might sortisie himself the becter by caking ehe ayr. /^r^is'/w, who sought not the preservati¬
on of his health, did noc obey che J«/s«««, for che reason alledged by him, to perswade him
Co walk down; but contrarily he did it, out of the belies he was in, that his weakness being
exceeding great, the more he should put himself into agitation, the more would his forces
diminish, and the neerer he should be to his grave. With such disserent designs did the Sul¬
tan and the .ss&lt;»/&lt;« descend into the Court; and theGrand Signior, seeming as though he
would not have the Bassa make Coo long a walk ac a eime, caused him to lean on the ba¬
lustrade, that divided the Court-yard of his Palace, chere co rest himself with him. Scarcely
had ehey been there a quarter of an hour, when as ehey saw an hundred Janizaries enter, at-
ciredall in cloth of gold, who ranked chemselves in order on boch sides. TheGrand lister
surprized with chis porap, demanded of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> whac ie mighe be ? buc he told him smiling,
thac he must behold che end of this ceremony, before he could be cleared therein. The B«j[i
then saw the Aga of the Janizaries enter, who raarchcd alone gorgeously apparel¬

ornaments that the women of the Levant do use. In some of them were little bats, set all
over wich precious stones; chopines garnished with Turkeyses and Rubies; smoeks embroi¬
dered with gold and pearl; most suraptuous gowns, which being layd consusedly together,
made a pleasing mixture, of curled cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, and of velvet, whole
ground was gold. The last maund was not open on the sides hkethe rest, and appeared tobe
full of all sorts of jewels, of so excessive a value, as ehere were three or four hundred thou¬
sand crowns worth of pearls amongst them.They which carried these precious presents ranked
themselves all along the balustrade, where the SuUan and <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> were leaning. After this
tntnd rwtlvecharetsfullof young virgin Slaves, richly clothed, eachof thera drawn by six
white horsiS, and driven by two Eunuches. Then followed thirty ocher virgins, apparelled
in doch of gold, accompanyed with so many black Slaves, having all of them chains and col-
lars of massive gold : These Slaves being placed on their knees where the Aga of the sm-
^:«r;Vx appointed them, chere entred next cwo hundred Mules laden with hangings of cloth
ot gold, of sattin, ot velvet, ehe ground silver; wich cushions embroidered all over, which
are the seats of thac Country; and with a great deal of other most sumptuous surniture lot

ing two and two twelve cofsers of China, garnished with gold and precious stones, wjoot-

which were covered half way with places of gold, and shined more with the precious Itoncs

oflove, and outof a sense of Religion, before he would consent unto it.  But he was
strangely forprized, when as the Grand Signior had raade a sign to tbe Aga of the sant^a-

his incomparable//*j^&lt;?//a  Ah my Lord I cryed he out in Italian, Isnot this an illusion ?

the Princess ofs from her horse, andto clear himself througlily ot the doubt whereinto this
surprize had put him; but hecould not execute his design, for the Aga oi the samzaries
bad rendered him that service already, and had conduded her to tbe half pace of the ba¬
lustrade, where the Bajsa received her.  This Princess had not seen him yet, because at such
ume as the curtains, which concealed her, were drawn, the fight of so greac an asserably had
not perraitted her to mark him, though she had carefully sought about with her eyes to finde
him our. But when as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> advancing towards her, did by the found of his voyce force
her to look that way, she had no less joy then he, though not so rauch araszement; for she
knew well enough thac he was at Constantinople, and she beleeved too that she had be n for¬
cibly brought away by his order, for Ruslan would never tell her any thing.  And though
this violent design was not pleasing to her, yet selc she nothing but joy for al! chac ac chis first
view; nor did the paleness and change, which/^r&lt;?^&lt;»j's melancholy had painted in his face,
any whit asHid her; being very glad to see the marks of his love, in thole of his grief.  Is
it pofsible. Madam, said <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> unto her, thac I should once more see the incomparable Isa¬

for fear she shiould not render unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> the honor chat was due to him.  <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would

<p>Hitherco che Princess had not answered to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s discourses, save with obeysancesand
submissions, but hearing her self so highly praised. she sell a speaking, and humbly besought
the Grand Signior he would be pleased to justisie the love, which <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> bare her %
some other way, then by thac of her beaucy. She cold him, chac ishe had not stronger chains
then thac, he would be blame-worthy for preserring her before his Highness; but without
considering, either her merit, or her beauty, he was co chink, that the assedion which he car¬
ryed to her, was one of the inevicable esseds of sympaehy or face. Thae she requested him
to bcleeve, hovJ <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had done nothing, buc whac he could noc chuse buc do j thathe
knew withouc doubc as well as she, chac che glory to serve so greac a Prince, was co' be pre¬

he had abandoned Reasons parcy, to follow thac of love.  <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> ravished wich the wit
of this Princess, desired her to pardon him for her forcible bringing away, and to remember
that he had not undertaken ic, buc Co save <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s life. So fair a cause, answered the Ptin-
cess, could noc produce a bad essed, and whaesoever can sive <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, can never wrong
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. With such like discourses, the Sultan and these two illustrious Lovers entertained
themselves very pleasingly; but dinner time approaching, theGrand Signior to\d tk Buln,
that having purposed to bestow the Sultania Afteria upon him for a wise, and his bvenot
permitting chac he slbould be so happy, as Co have the most excellent man upon the Earth in

he retired, leaving <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> extreamly satished, both of his wit, his courtesie, and gene¬

Palace which was noc far from his, incending ouC of resped to leave this wholly to the Prm¬
cess • but she being instantly advertised thereof by Emilia, who had heard him give order
for it to the Italian Slave that served him, she sent for him, and conjured him not to do so j
lam well assured, said she unro him, thst inthe Couiitry where we are, I shall not clash
with civilicy Co remain here wich you; and I know you to be so wise and discreet that I can¬
not fear any unjust designs from you ; withall you undcrstand me too well for me to doubr,
that you will make any ill construdion of the liberty I give you: It will be eriough then for
you to quit your lodging, wichout quitting your Palace unto me, which how fair soever it is,
cannot be agreeable to me without you. This illustrious Basa would not yeeld aC sitst, buc
at lengch he obeyed the Princess.
</p>
<p>In the mean time they who saw <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>,conld not doubc buc that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had found out
the right remedy, which could throughly chase away his melancholy. Hiseye was quicker,
his countenance raore lively, his speech stronger, his gate morcsteddy, and this change was
so great and sudden, that every one spake of it as of a prodigy. In sine, ehe presence of Isa¬
beUa did thae in a few days, which ehe arc of che Physicians could noc do in a very long cime;
and the Grand Visier found himself in so persed an health,as he bad never been in a be:ctT. Buc
whil'st be was happy, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> did noc enjoy so greac a eranquillicy : The sighc of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
through an inevicable sate had cxciced Crouble in his soul. For whereas he had erainently mee
in che person of chis Princess with all chebeaueies of <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> md <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, and agrear
deal of resemblance of both of them, especially of thelast, hecould not chuse bue be in all
ehe pashon for her alone, which he had been in for ehe other two. This greac Prince render¬
ed noc himself for all chac withouc sighcing; and it raay be he had noc been vanquilhed, is at
the beginning hehad known che forces of his Enemy. Buc whac Crouble soever the sitst
s\^toi <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> broughc Co his heart, he choughc nocwichstanding thae Reason, and his
friendship Co <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, would be stronger then his inclination. It was not because he had noC
tryed the weakness of the former; buc for che second, he beleeved chat noching could over¬
come ic. In chis considence, che first days of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s beingit Conltaminople, and chat
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was noe as yec in an estace Co go Co che Serraglio, he concinued visicing him as he
was wone co do: Buc Che more he saw <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, the more charming he found her; he always
observed some new grace in her; and her wic raaking her still Co be more known, his passion
still augmented the more: Howbeit he perceived noc the violence and power of it, till su'ch
time as civility would no longer permic him co see her. For che Grand Visier having reco¬
vered strength enough eo go co che Serraglio, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having no more precexc Co visic
him, saw himselt deprived of che sighc of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and by this privation he selt in his heare
rhat this person alone could raake up all his felicity, or all his raisery. This Prince no sooner
knew the forceof this Enemy, by which he had sofsered his soul to be forprized but
he would have opposed ic. Whacl said he Co himself, unjust and cruel chat I am
cannoc I, ascer ehe obtaining of so many Vidories abroad, vanquisti my self this once?
must I be mine own cruelleft Enemy? and must this predorainanc pashon, chac reigns in

</p>




<p>so great unto him, but that he hoped to overcome it, is he could absent the GranciViL
as the affairs of Persia seemed co require. Whereupon he sramed ehe design of it, after he
had a long time combated in himself, and prepared to give audience co the Embassador the
Sophi had senc to demand <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> of him; seeming to have no other thoueht
then that of the affairs of Persia, nor other ob/ed, but the good of his Empire. He also let
VlamaVnovi, that what he had demanded sox Mahamed \NiS granted him; and the care
of his State seemed to cake him up in such sort, as albeit he became very melancholique, and
that his countenance was alcered, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> suspeded no ocher thing, but that the incer¬

and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, whom he had in his hands, for the making of some propofitions of peace,

ryed to the design of forcibly bringing away the Princess, for to lee her return again into het
Councry, and Co deprive himself for ever ofa man, from whom he seemed to be inseparable.
So as not knowing what to do, or what to resolve on, theGrand ny?sr propounded unto
her, considering the estate wherein things were, that she would permit him toraikeone
warlike voyage more against che <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>s; to the end,that having repaired ehe difordetj which
his absence had caused in chac Kingdom, he mighc ac his recurn come and cast himself at the
Sultan's feet, and demand for a reward of his vidories onely che libercy of rceurning into
his Country; wich the resolucion, that is he did not granC chac which he desired of him, not
to be more generous chen he, and Co obcain that by shghe which he had resused him, since,as
it seemed to him, he mighc do it wichouc injustice. Ae first chis propoficion surprized IstM-
la ; and her heart perswaded her, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had not Reason on his side. What, said Ihe,
will you always abandon me? and will you finde no place in all the world where we nii)i
live together ? when you were come to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, you quitted me to return unto Cw/n"-
tinople; and now that Fortune hach brought me thither,- you will abandon me to go into
Persia; but wich this grievous disserence, that when as you quicced me ac <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, youlc t
me in my Councry; your person was the onely thing, chac I lost; yourabsenccmadeupaU
my grief; and fear found no place in my soul buc for the loveof you: But in chis encounter
I have cause to be astaid of all things. You will abandon me in a Country, whose langaige,
manners, customs, and Religion, are disserent from ours, and where vertue is not found Wt
in the person of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>. I will not make use, concinued she, of che Reasons, which you
made use of, when you would not let me come to Constantinople, in making meconlider
whac would become of me is ie happened that you should dye: But chac is not my tear, ik-
ine it is certain, that in what place soever of the Earch chis misfortune stiould arrive unto ins,
I should always be equally sensible of it; that nothing can increase ordiminishmy gi».
that I shall everywhere finde the remedy to sinish it; and that my death would w«tnou

</p>
<p>I know well enough, answered the Princess, that I ara of a sex which ought not to see war
ssve in pidure; but what will you have me do ? I see too well, continued she, that we are
in a deplorable estate, andthat we cannoc seek for a remedy, whereof che evenc is not very
doubtsul. After the obligations wherein you stand engaged to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, there is no talk of
shght; yea and I seel in my heare someehing that resists it. On the other side, I know full
well that in the estate wherein the affairs of his Empire now stand, and his srit ndship to you
considered, it will not be easie for my tears to obtain our liberty; and sroiu chence I judg,
that nothing but generofity alone can constrain him not to resuse us. Upon the vidory over
the Tersiansowx sreedom depends, is it beso that we may ever obtran it; bud fear too,
that this remedy is not very well assured. For is you prove not fortunate in this war, how
dare you demand your liberty? and is you be vidorious, it is to be feared rhat in fighting
sox <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, you fight not against your self; that the conquests you shall make for him, do
not keep him also stom resolving to part with you; and in this fore, I cannoc make use of che
power which you do give me co dispofc of you in this occasion, my reason not being strong
enough alone of ie self eo take any resolucion.

<p><hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> saw chac all che Princesses Objedions were so powersul, as hecould chink of no¬
thing able Co destroy chem. Buc ae lengch, ascer well examining the macter, chey found how
it was true, that it mighc happen the voyage of s^r/j* would serve them to no purpose; but
they found withall, that it was Che onely ching chac could be benesicial to them; knowing
well enough, thac is <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> covAd be vanquished, ic would be onely by generofity. Ibra¬
him assured the Princess as much as pofsibly he could, thac no misfortune stiould arrive to het
in his absencc, relying in such sort on <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s friendstiip Co him, as he could not doubc but
thac he would be very caresul in proceding her. And chough he knew thac ehe Saltan was
very suscepcible of love, and chac he had feared before ac <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, left he would have been
eoo sensibly couched with//.i^//«i's beauty, is she obstinacely persisted in her decermination
to follow him to Consiantinople, yet had he no fear of it in this encounter. Thae which
gave him chis eranquillicy of spirie, was because he knew, thac chis Prince had never been ta¬
ken, bue with the first sighc of the persons whom he had loved; that love never entred into
his heart but by surprizing him; and thac whomsoever he had once seen wichout passion, was
not able afterwards to touch him with any. And whereas <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, contrary to his custom,
had taken greac care Co conceal his choughcs, hehad noc perceived hishstto <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; but
contrarily, thinking that he had seen her without loving her, he beleeved chac hewassasoon
that side. In this Opinion he che more easily resolved for che War of Persia • and whereas
he knew chac affairs were preshng, and chat the Sopht's Embassador having had' audience, tbe
Z),t;^«. would be held the nexe day, wherein peace or war for the incerest of che Empite
would be concluded, he conjured che Princess to take her last resolucion. Emilia, who was

<p>Upon these and many Other reasons the Princess resolved for this grievous reparation and
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>h^ving left her, after they had raade new protestations of fidelity the one tothe
other, he went unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to begin the preparing of his minde to che war of Persia. This
Prince, who never swerved from che way of vercue buc by constraine, had sought so mighti¬
ly wich che pashon wherein he was for 7/^^s//&lt;», as he raighc perchance have defeated it, or
at least-wiso have never made shew of ic, had noC che Grand Visier himself contributed to
his own misforcune, In propounding unto him his sending him again into Persta. For where¬
as ic IS very dissiculc to re jed thac which raay sacishe us, it was Impofsible for the Sidtan to
resuse thac which <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> ofsered. He had had strength enough, after a long combate and
after he had an hundred times changed his opinion, to resolve noc Co propound this voyage
unco him, since he could noc undercake it without quitting <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; but he had not enough
noc Co accepc of chat which could content his pasllion. He deterrained for all that, because

out communicating unto them the mattet he had in hand; to the end that havitig acquainted
them with the importance of it, they taight give him faithsol and dis sntscressed coUnsel.
Asc r that, he represented unto them iM vidories which he had obtained over the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi>s
through the valor of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>; and theo, the misadventures. Which his absence ind Vlama's
hurt had caused in that Country. He told them that nothing rested of all bis conquests, but
the remembrance that they hid been made: and whereas he had an ititention to carry them
to a war, he aggravated with a gscae deal of vchemertCy, howshamesul it would be tothe
Empire to make peace after they had been last beaten. He told them withall notwithstand¬
ing, that having the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> the daughter of the Sdphii and Prince Mahamed
his son, in bis hands, he was in an estate, is they thought sir, to tender propofitions of peace
mtoTachmof; butthat they should well eximine before-hand, whether that would not be
dishonorable; and that they sbould remember, how in publique interests particular interests
were noe always to be considered, andthat the glory of the Erapire was tobe preserred a-
bove all things.
</p>
<p>After he had spoken thus unto them, he commanded chem to delivrr t^eir Opinion?, which
proved not to be alike, for they were all carryed by disserent thoughts. Some, won by/s^jss-
lana tnd Rustan, opposed the Voyage of Persia; others, for the sole inr^rest of cie people,
were of the same o|;isiion • some again, to please the J'«//4»,counselled she war; and others,
for their particular intesest likewise, opposed peace. Yet did they not for all chat deliver theit
Opinions tumultuously, not withouc giving reasons for them; but contrarily keeping a mar¬
velous decorum In this Cotincel, they spake all severally, and without precipitation.  Buc
whereas, according Co the order which is observed amongst the r»/"/^x, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> \ms to de-
livcr his Opinion sitst, as being the chief in dignity, he was already preplring Co speak, whs h
iS Machmut, Cadilescherof Natelia, vthohid been suborned by Roxelana, besought his
Highness, chat tot chis cime onely chac custom might not be followed, tothe end that the
Opinions, which should bs given in this occasion, raight be the more sincere. For, my Lord,
said he unto him, I ara assured is the noble <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> propounds his Opinion first, that it will
be impoflible for me CO deliver mine, is ie happen co be contrary co his; noc because I can¬
noc take che libercy to contradid him is I could, for I know his generofity too well for that •
but because his Reason renders it self so absolute a Mistress of anothers, asit is not pofsible
for one eo conserve his own sense. A raan cannot desend himself from him; he perswades
whaesoever he pleaseeh; and one cannot chuse buc giinsay in his minde his own Opinions
Insine,myloxd, whether ic be for the love that is born h.m, or for the reasons thac I have
alledged, I am very certain, is the generous/^r^/,/w speaks first, that his vote will carryall
the relt; that there will be but one Opinion found in the whole Assembly; and that in this
forhy Highness will not know our true sence, buc wile onely undexi^.nd <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s, which

nor of che Arms of the Empire would be once again hazarded: and all this without attend¬
ing any recompence from ir, ic being absolutely impofsible to maintain tbe conquests that
were made in Persia, whereof History gave sussicient proof; and therefore is war were to
be made, thac ic was beceer eo sall upon ehe Christians wieh an Army of sive hundred thon¬
sand men, which would strike fear into all Europe, amplisie the limits of the Empire, and
eternize the name of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, rather then to lose thera to no purpose: How it vsould bea

at several times he had led raillions of men into Tersia, and ascer all, chac there stiould not be
remaining under the dominion of his succesfors, somuch as one sooc of ground of thecon-
quests he had made there. Sinally he concluded, that not chis war, but the other, was to be
thoughc on.
</p>
<p>Isus, Cadilescher of Greece, maintained this Opinion, though out of a disserent meaning;
fortheformer was carryed by the perswasions of i2oA:s/«e»&lt;j, and he by the sole consideration
of che publique good. Bue he added Co che others Reasons, chac is che war of Persta conti.

bad travell d so rauch for the sehcity of his Subjeds, that h.s Subjeds also should do som¬

<p>^"^Alhmat Bassa, speaking in his course, consented indeed to the voyage of Persia but not
to the design ot impairing the Empire on all parts, to make new conquests on that tide; since
without hazarding any loss of the one side to gain on the other, there needed no^morc then eo
oblige <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to make one journey o-ore chicher; that it was without doubt trom his hand

order for all things, and to prepare Crowns and Triumphs for the illustrious Ba^a, who would
without question return Conqueror of Persia.           ,
</p>
<p>Wxt yN\s the Beglierbey oi Rami lia of the same opinion; He of Carro concurred with
him; and all the rest being divided amongst the seaven that had already spoken, it was for
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>to deliver his advice; but he was constrained to attend a little, because Machmut
said a second time to maintain his first opinion, that it would bc a stiame Co be expofed to che
loss of che advantage which they had over ehe Christians. Achmat answered, ehae ie would
beagreacer to demand peace after ehey were bcacen. The Basa Tiali added, chac extream
resolutions were diogerous Co Monarchief; and chac in ehe end Pdnces, which loved chcir
Subjeds, and whose Empire was greac enough, oughc noe Co raake War, buc for the procuring
of peace. IJus, to sortisie this opinion, said further, chac che people were noc eo beso lietle
considerable with the Emperor, since from thera came his riches, his force, his power, and his
greatness; that the people had in some parts of the wodd been happy without Kings, but no
Kings could be so without Subjeds: Hesaid likewise, that prudence neve'r did anything
precipitously, and still would have the Prince spare the blood of his people. But the Bassa
of the Sea replyed, that it was ofcentimes just and necessary co lose one pare of his Subjeds tor
the preservation of the other; and that an Erapire was a greac Body, for che maincenance
whereof all things might be done, withouc considering particular incerests. Scander added,
thac a greac Prince was never Co make peace bue wich ehe sword in his hand, and ehae che way
to keep ehe people from murmuring, was eo raake ic advaneageonsly; ehae for ehe esseding
thereof sive hundred thousand men were to bc raised, co the end chey raighc obcain ehae by
force which could noc be obcained by any ocher racan.
</p>
<p>This Bass^a having given over speaking, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> repeaced in order all che opinions chat
had been given ; he consuccd chac of ehe Bassa PiaU; approved that ot Scander Capitan
Basa; mightily opposed Machmut's advice, as also that of Isus; commended the generous
resolutions of y4/t the ;&lt;i]/4 of the Sea, and the prudent considerations of y^c/!;»?/ar, with ex¬
ception nevertheless of the praises he had given him. But at length for a conclusion he said,
that great Princes were always CO give peace, and not co demand it; th^tis So Uman'sehiAdxen
had happened Co have been ehe Sopht's prisoners, all ehae could chen have been done was buc eo
propound ic; and chac even <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> was so generous as noc Co do ic, chough Prince Ma.,

theVisforioustofpeakof Peace, because they thereby deraonstrated, that the sole desire of
glory had made them fight; but that it was always shamesul, how specious a pretext soever
might be taken up for it, to speak of peace, when as one had been beaten. That this were to
yield up the Vidory, and to render ones arras Co his Enemy, Co implore che pity of the Con-
queror, to augment the courage ot his adverfaries, to weaken chac ofhis Soldiers, and even to
expofe himselt eo the hazard of having done an unworthy ad unprofitably; that besides, the
only mean to keep Christendom from uniting their Forces for the destrudion of the r«r/^w:^

this Prince followed in all other encounters,was too weak in this tor the resisting of so power¬

manded ot him in case hi should dye,was a thing whereunto h- could not answer,that thought
being too grievous for him to settle his mind upon it; that for her more safety during his ab¬

that for the exercise ofher Religion, sbs should go forth as ofcen as she would; thac his ma¬

Madara, that on Vidory our happiness depends; that to obtain it I must expofe my selftd
peril; that in all other things Fortune gives the good that she docs, but in War Crowns must
be violently pluck'd out of the hands of Vidory, isone may be perraitted to speak so. One
must fight to remain Master ofthe sield; one must give an example for the Soldiers to follow
and put ones self in jeopardy of being vanquished for to be vidorious.  I tell you all these
things. Madam, to the end you raay noc take ic ill, is I dare assure you, ehae I will not re¬

for me then to deliver you, and therefore do not enjoyn me co raanage my life with so mach
care.  Buc, Madam, without anticipating our raiscries through fear; and without encrealing
those, which we seel through the apprchension ofthose which peradventure will never arrive
unto us, tell me, I beseech you, whecher you can forgive me all the evils which I hive been
the cause of to you, is you do not represent unto your self how you have favorable received

all your cruelleft adverfaries, purpofing eo hurt you, could have done.  Do not charge your self
with the crimes of Fortune, said she unto him, and beleeve thac I ara generous enough todi-
stinguish the guilty from che innocent, and never to remeraber the evilswhich I have suW,
without remerabring those withall, which you have endured for me.  I am as faulty towariis
<hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, as Jushniano is towards <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ; or to say better, we are equally innocent; and
our innoccncy it maybe causes our persecution, since it is ordinary with Fortune tofallsoiil
upon none but vertuous persons.  I hope nevertheless, added she, that Heaven will ere long
give an end to our ciptivity, or to our lives. Is we were, concinued <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, in ehe hands of
a Prince, thac used us ill, and laded us wieh irons, I should methinks have the more consolation,
for in murmuring against the Tyrant thac persecuees us ehere is some eo be found: But this
Prince, who keeps us capcives, does ic not bue because he loves you; and ehe rigor of my d^
stiny is so greac, as I must commend ehae in him, which is the cause of all my misery.

And after a conversation as sad, as their Souls were asshded, she readied him her hand, which
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> kissed,with as great a transport of grief, as oflove. And conduding her wirh Emi¬

<p>Ic was at this instane chat theyseltth;C which cannot be txprest ; You had reason indeed,
said che Princes co him, to steal away from me when you Itrst me ac <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, and to save me
the griefofbidding you farewell; but I do not know, saidshe unco him, whether you have
any now to raake me prove it. Is it your pleasure rhen. Madam, answered he, that I shall not
part? No, replyed soe, donotyoustickat whatI say, it is only grief that makes me speak:
Go and break our chains, carry a stronger heart then I, and that you raay not augment my
weakness, do not oblige me to bid you tarcwell. As she was saying so, ttie gates of the Ser¬
raglio opened, ind <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, seeing himselt Constrained to quit tier in a place where men ne¬
ver come, assured ber at this last instant, that be would quickly return a Conqueror. The
Charec was no sooner entred, but he mounted on horseback, and without speaking a word
more to any body, he went out of Consiantineple with his Train, to overtake the Troops,
which were inarching towards T"***/^, carrying in his heart the most sensible asshdion, thac
ever he had tryed. He had this advantage nevertheless over the Princess, that he could enter¬
tain his thoughts without interruption, but it was not so with her. For a; soon as she had
been conduded ro a stately lodging, which was prepared for her, che grand Signiors Mother,
although she hated <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, came to visit her followed by all the Sultanaes, thereby to please
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who had increaeed her unto it. The Sultana Afteria, as the favorite of the Empe¬
ror her father, had been permitted to learn the Italian Tongue, after the goodwill sbe had
born to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had made her to desire ir; so as it was she that held up the conversacion in
this visit, and that expressed the compliments ofthe othex Sultanaes to Ijabella, who re¬
ceived them with a great deal of civility, although the excreara grief she was in raight have
dispenced her from le. Buc whereas Asieria had address and wic, and knew that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
was asshded, she so ordered the macter as this visit was not long. The SuUanaes went away
then charmed with the beauty of the Princess; ind Asieria foundher self as rauch inclined
to scrve her, as she had been beforetime to save the \[se of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>. It is crue chac chough

<p>bella reprehending her sds, racher z6mxe <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s good fortune, in thathe could oblige
vou to save his life, and afterwards gain the assedion of the greacest Prince of tbe Earth; and
to joyn our good fortunes, as our interests are joyned, I must add further, m having procured
me ttK honor ofyour acquaintance.        . •  j  .  r /  Aa  ■
</p>
<p>This conversation, having lasted an indisserent longtime, combined the Sultana Afteria
and tbe Princes inso strait a league of friendsoip, as they were almost inseparable, to long as
Jsabella continued in the old Serraglio. The day after she was come thither, ScLman vilir-
ed ber, and by this last fight made the chains which captived him stronger then before. The
incertainty he was'in, wholly ceased; and the corabat which be had in his heart, between his
friendstiip to the grand Visier, and the passion he was in sox Ijabella, was at an end; and
love remaining ablolutely vidorious, sJs mind bad some more peaceable raoments, so that he
had no other thought, then ofthe Conquest of//»&lt;^&lt;?//^. But whereas he knew, that to make
himself be beloved, he must first please, he complyed so far with her, as not Co speak of any
thing bcjt <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> in this first visit. He craved pardon of the Princess for being the cause ot
hjs aWence from her; he desired her not to remeraber it was he that caused her to be brought
away by force; and to think that she was in a place, where she might absolutely command ;
where she should see no body but thac would obey arid serve her with joy. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> answer¬
ed to so obliging a discourse with all the civility and acknowledgment she was capable of:
but whereas she was sad, though she constrained her self co seem otherwiie, he Intreated her
to be as merry as shs. could, for tear left melancholy dirainishing her beauty, jt might be layd
to his charge, ehae he had buc ill preserved so rare a ching.
</p>
<p>The Princess having proraised him all chac he desired, he wene away very rauch sacished,
and very araorous, and lesc her wich as great an estecra of him, as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> could not have
more. And whs.reas Asieria seldom abandoned her, she talked to her the rest of the day of
nothing but of t'iie admiration she v}2.s in of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, ofthe vertues ot this Prince, ofthe
greatness of his Tpirit, of that exceeding and generous friendship, which he testified to our illu¬
strious Basa.
</p>
<p>After chis first visit there were nothing but raagnisicences in the old Serraglio. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
senc every day new presencs Co IsabeUa; and in consideracion ofher Co the SuUanaes, which
lived in the same place, for fear left envying her they stiould come to hate her, and so lose the
care of pleasing her. And whereas there passed not a day, wherein this Prince did not visic
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, Roxelana, who knew him to the very bottom of his heart, quickly perceived the
true realon that caused these yisus. Yet did not jealousie seize upon her Soul for all that; and
the only design ofraaking use of this occasion to de^xoy <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and to labor the re-esta-
blishmept of Rustan, was that which raade her work in the raanner, as shall be seen in the se¬
quel ofthis discourse. But for as much as the grand Signiors Mother hated <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, because
soe loved Roxelana, she communicated her sulpicions unto her, and they both concluded, that
in all likelyhood <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s ashduity was an essed oflove; and that it it were so, it would be
almost an insallible mean to destroy tbe grand Vister, who it was said was desperately in love
with this person. For coming to know this pashon, he would questionless do things, which
would make him bc banished, is he did not voluntarily banish himself.
</p>
<p>Having held this secrec counsel, Roxelana, far from txoubling <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s designs, thought
of nothing else but raaking him raore in love with the Princess; being not jealous but of her
authority, and fearing <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s power, rauch raore then Ijabella's beauty. And for this
tss^, whereas there is scarce any faith in Turkey of proof against presents, she suborned one
ot the Slaves, who went dayly to ofser her some new liberality from the Sultan,to the end that
according to the occasions she raight invent some obliging compliment to him from 7^^^^//^
who Ignorant of a I these things, lived with as much content and rest, as the absencc of the
grand VtsHrwoxxldpexmxt her. ^/.m hadso great a care of her, and ^.//«...« rendred her
to many devoirs, as soe had soarcely any leafore to think of her misfortunes. In tbe mean
time the Sultan was not a littk perplexed, out of the fear he was in to discover his love to the
Princess; for albeit he knew soe esteemed him, yet he beleeved that it was as much forthe
assedion which he cemed to bear Co the Bas,, as for his own merit. So that not darL as
yet to decUre himself openly, he contented himself with praising her beauty, her wit and all
he excellent qualities which were in her, in talking to her of Ibrlhim; an7 his name' whih
hadbeenso considerable with him, was employed against him that owed it.  Forsooft^a.

<p>he commanded <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, hc would exagerate how happy <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was tobe beloved ofs
marvelous a person; what judgment sbrahim had shewed in the choyce he had made ot htr'
and out ofa malicious galhntry he told her many times, chac <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was to blame tor aban'
domng her at .'<hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, to come and keep his word with him; chac ie was a great fault in hini
to go to the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> War, and not to dye with grief, rather then to quit her; thai for him is
he had been in his place, he would never have done so, chinking ic a great deal sweeter to d'ye
then to be absent trom her.  So arcisicial a discourse, was noC for all chac interpreted by lU
bella as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> desired, and without seeking for any hidden sense in it, she beleeved thatit
was a pure tssed ofthe Sultan's corapliance, who thinking to please her, would talk to her of
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> in any manner whatsoever.  In this ignorance,she always answered him very civilly
and with a great deal of resped; so chac ineerpreeing in chis fore all that .yc//OT4» said unto
htrr, she put him into an extream pain.  For withouc celling her precisely, that he was in be
with herbeauty, he would fain have had her perceive it; being so afraid eo ofsend her, that
this fear peradventure raight have wrought chac in him,which Reason could not do, had it not
been tor the messages,whsch the Slave whom <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> had suborned, at several times brought
him.                      ,
</p>
<p>But whil'st IsabeUa talked of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s generofity, all the SuUanaes had no other discoutse
bnc ofthe love which he bore her. Afteria, perceiving it as well as the rest, and knowing to
what violences this pashon carried the Grand Signior, was much asshded at it, for IsahtlUi
interest, whom she exceedingly loved. This melancholy was quickly raarked by the Princess,
and whereas her cares and her merie had given her an high place in her assedion, she one day
conjured her eo acquainc her with ehe caule of ic. Afteria judging wieh reason, that is Ihc
should tell her the truth, it would very rauch grieve her, excused her self from it atfirst as well
as she could; but coming Co consider, that it raight be che ignorance wherein Isal&gt;elU\mi,
mighe sureher augment her unhappiness, she resolved to conside in her, and to impart unto her
the suspicions she had. Thac which made Afteria be interessed so strongly for all that con¬
cerned <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, as to forget che SuUan's incerests, was because she had understood how
mighcily he had protedcd Mustapha and Gianger her brothers, whom soe had insinitely
loved; and how he had always opposed the y/idencts of Roxelana, to whom soe bore a se¬
crec hatred, whose chieffoundation was in ber proper vertue. Ashria, following her reso¬
lution, after she had prepared 7/«^s//-«'s raind by a long discourse, to make good use of the
adv'ce she was goingto give her, and after//&lt;i^s//&lt;« bad on her side promised her all manner
ofstdelity, told her, that knowing ihe Sultan her father, as she did, soe feared left het
beauty had pofs.st him with more love for her, then he had friendstiip for/^r&lt;jWw; and
that at list his reason would be found weaker then his passion: Thac she desired to discovet
her suspicions unto her, Co ehe end she mighc through her prudence examine the matter, k"
being altogether ignorant of it, she might increase the CJrand JtgwiVs unjust designs by
* innocenc civilitiey.
</p>
<p>At first this discourse surprized her, she changed colour ever and anon, and out otthe
crouble she was in, she thoughc that Afteria spake not the truth,chough soe could not imgip
any reasonable cause for this sidion. The Sultanaes ingenuity notwithstanding destroyed tM
secret accusation, which she charged her within her heart; and paslling from one extremity
CO anocher, she in an instane justisied noC only Afteria, bue <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> also, and calling to
mind all thae chis Prince had done for/^r^i/w, she beleeved chac the Sultana %zsem\^^'
terprctJtion to theGrand Signiors cwhiies; and Cook chac for eestimonies of love, wwcn
she was perswaded was but an tsscd of his friendstiip eo <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>. This last chought having
quieted hermind, she thanked y//?^ri^ for the care she had of her, cora.mended her genero¬

<p>howbeit Emilia consirmed her in the opinion, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s respeds to her proceeded only
fromfriendso'p, in raaking her consider, thac Asttna's conjedurc was questionless grounded
on the belies of allthe othex Stiltanais, who suppofed thac the Grand Siguior could not
have any assedion for a woman, but straight it must be love; and who out of jealousie for
the presents that he sent her, and the civihties that he used to her, had imagined it could not be
otherwise. This reasoning carrying some likelyhood with it, comforted the Princess a little,
and after she bad run over in her memory all that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had said, soe found, being willing
to deceive her self, that all his discourses and all his adions, might be interpreted to his ad¬
vantage : yet saw soe not so ranch certainty in all that soe imagined, that soe dUrst absolutely
rely upon it: and though soe feared the fight of theGrand Signior, out of the doubt she was

chere were three raarvelous beautisul Slaves presented to the SuUan, who without being ever
a whit touched with their charras, had resused thera, is he had not by chance dcraanded of
thera whence they were; but having understood that they wereof/r&lt;«/^, he retained them
with a purpose Co bestow ehera on//rs^s//^, seeking ascer noching wich raore care, rhen to

be carryed inco the old Serraglio: And whereas Afteria's discourse to her had rendred her
more melancholique then soe used to be, he marvelled at it, and by his much pressing her to
let him know the cause thereof, he raade the Princess apprehend, thac the SuUands suspici¬
ons were justly grounded; yet destroyed soe her self, this her own opinion; and having an¬
swered the GrW Signior, that her melancholy was derived from the remerabrance of her
past misfortunes, rjther then stora any other reason, he desired her to forget thera, and noc
to render her self unhappy with things, which would never arrive to her again. He told her
afterwards,that to corasort and delight her,he had chofen her out three Slaves, which it raay be
would not be disagrceable unto her; and would understand her orders betcer then the others
which had been given her, because they were of her own Country. IsabelU answered there¬

<p>The Grand Signior, desiring to oblige the Princess in all things, went away for to leave h' r
at liberty to entertain her dear friends, and to take order for the delivery of those Slaves
whom she had recommended unto him. When he was gone, embraces and civilities beein
asresh between IsabeUa and these three fair maids: EmiUa likewise testisicd the satissaction.
which she had to see them; but in the midst of their first apprehensions ot joy, the rtmera-
brance of thc^ir pleasures past,raade thera socd tears of sorrow. They demanded ot oneano-
ther, by what adventure they were met together in the same place; and being scarce able to
beleeve what they saw was true, their amazement redoubbd every moment. The desire of
demanding one thing was lost by tbe curiofity of knowing another, and going both at cnce
CO ask the Princess questions, and to answer those which she asked of them, neither of them
answered precisely to each other. Howbeit the Princess understood that those Friends, which
were Slaves, as well as <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, were Horatio, the Srench Marquis, and Alphonso. She de¬
sired to hear some news of the Count of Lavagna, and of Leonora his wise, but Sophronii
told her sighing, that she should know their adventures too soon; and Hipolita added, thit
in a day wherein Fortune had done them so great a grace, ic was not sit to remember so many
misfortuncs.
</p>
<p>In the in.an time <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>,v^ho feared left the name of SerragUo soould disquiet thtm, and
make them conceive forathing to her disadvantage, acquainted thera with the disserence which
there wasbetween the old SerragLo,^ndihditof theGrand Signior's women. Andwherer
as in her discourse she many times named <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> without chinking of ic, and spake of him,
as ofa man, inconsideration of whom the i'«/?&lt;i» favored her, Jo/iAyoxw demanded of her,
who this <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was ? This question raade the Princess blush, but ac length soe informed
them that this <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> W2iS <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; it seeraing unto her, that in the eltate wherein theit
fortune stood, it was not requisite to make a secret of his adventures to them. This novdty
ts\U;\hs suxpxized Hipolita, Leonida, znd Sophronia; not being able to imagine, butthat
all which they were told was any other then a sidion: Their own experience forced thera
notwithstanding Co bdeeve, chat whic had been imparced to thera was true, there being no
more dissiculty in giving credit to that which was arrived to thera, then to that which bid
happened to IsabeUa.

her, ehae according co her order sfor he was commanded co speak co her in chofe cerms) he
had caused Horatio, Daria, and Alphonso Co be delivered; but for the othsr, he could not
poflRbly learn as yet where he was; cbat all he could understand ot him was, how in less then J
month he had changed his Master nine or centimes; buthe besoughc her not tobetroaWed
at it, assuring her that he would the next day make a general review of all the Slaves in to"-

<p>The Sisth Boo{.
</p>
<p>IT was no sooner day, but <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> sent to desire permission of tbe Grand Signior, that she
raight go and visit her dear friends, which he durst not deny, so rauch was he afraid to
displease her; He repented him nevertheless for having raadc////&gt;*/»&gt;&lt;«, Sophronia, ind Leo¬
nida go out of the Serraglio; and feared left chat which he had done for his content should
destroy it; for it was true, that he was not carryed thereunto, so rauch by the rtquisiteness
of things, as the doubc he was in, ehae he soould noc be able eo speak eo che Princess in pri¬
vate, so long as chey were with her. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> then, having obtained the perraission which
she had demanded, went to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s Palace with as rauch raagnisicence, as is soe had been
the SuUana Quieen. Horatio, Alphonso, Leonida, Sophronia, and Hipclita, received her
with exceeding satissadion, yet was it less for all that then <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s, who having understood
from his sister, that <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> was in that Country, was in so extraordinary an irapatience to
know by what adventure he was come thither again, as he had scarcely made his first coraple-
ment, when as he conjured her to acquaint him with it: But she, that was in no less Co un-
derstandhis, and those of his friends, and by what hap they were arrived there, told him,
that he soould not know ir, till he had informed her what good or bad fortune liad condud¬
ed thera to Constantinople. Hipolita and Horatio protested, chac chac was che least thing
they could pay her for theliberty which soe had given thera. As for Sophronia, she consented
not without regret to this sad and pitisul relation, well foreseeing that solamentsble a dis¬
course would coft her raany a tear: howbeit soe desired at least, thac <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> raighc be he who
raight recount their misfortunes, it being irapoflible for her to do it. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, not using to re-
siis Sophronia, W;S preparing to obey her, when as Hom/s, told his sister, that ie would be

which were raingled m ehis advcncnre were his Eneraies, yec were chey still his Kinsmen.

But in the end Alphonso was the rain that contented the curiofity of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. As soon as

of intentions by appearances and events, will not have the designs of Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> tofeal-
wayssodis-incercslcd, as chey have appeared unto us; but««^«s, this is not a place, where
I am Co cell you whac the Count bekeved concerning him: As for me, that ever speaks sin-
cerely of things, I hold that his intentions were as fair as his enterpriz''.
</p>
<p>Bue CO come CO chac which I am co impart coyou, andtokeepyou from being too micli
surprtzcd by the Counts last adion, I am to tell you, that although in appearance hewjsthe
sweeccst, checivilcst, ehe gallantest, andofthesrecstandmost peaceable dispofition that ever
had been seen, and that he gave himself coall the exercisesof a man of his quility, wherein
he had profited admirably, yet had he an iraperious spirit, and was always pofsest with some
great design.  Ambition, and the desire of glory, were bis predominant passions, and the on¬
ly things for which he did all others.His education did not contribute ought to these thou'^hts-
for whereas he remained yet young enough under the government of his Mather, who'was
the most ambitious woman that ever was, she gave him a part of her inclinations.  He had
had for his Governor one named Pensa, by <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> his fathers appointment, whose man¬
ners were wholly noble, and thac had instruded him in all the fairest knowledges, which a
person of his condition raight have.  But chis raan being too moderate for the bringing up of
the Count according co his mochers designs, she placed another abouc him, buc yet without
removing che former, to tbe end thac is ehe one taught him the Sciences, the other Ihould
teach him noc to make use of them, but to arrive at the height of soveraign greatness. These
two men being opposite in all things, gave him also quice contrary counself.  The first made
him in ehe Roman History observe the noble adions of chofe, who had expofed chemsdvei
for che saseey of ehe Comraonwealeh; and che other raade him ofcencimes read che Conspiracy
of Catiline, ehe lives of Tiberius ind Nero; Nevertheless whereas the Counts indinationj
were coo vercuous to love crimes, he followed noC che advice of this same; bue his Soul be¬
ing wichill coo ambicious co be consined wichin the diredions of Pensa, he took a third way,
and loved nothing so much as the reading of the lives of Alexander and Cafar, especially ot
this last; and he was wont co say, chac chey which had called him Tyrant were to blame;
since he can never be so, chie aspires noc co che soveraign power, bue for ehe using of ic well;
and chey which found chemselves capable of governing people, were responable ro Heaven For
noc imploying a Talent, which mighc be advancagious eo all the world.
</p>
<p>These discourses were not ac chac cime considered buc by his Mocher, who cook incredible
delighc cherein: buc ac lengch, che Coune, being arrived ac sevenceen years of age, saw lio-
nora, che sxsket of Julio ind Horatio Cibo, in an assembly, vihexe Jannetin <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, the Ne¬
phew and Favorice of tAndrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, was presenc as well as he.  You have without doubt
observed, tha Leonora, chough gencle and civil, had for all ehae a raajestick reservcdness,
which shewed in her behavior ehae soe had something ot greac in her Soul.. I tell you this,
Madam, co lee you know wiehall, ehae ie was wieh ehis charra, racher rhen wieh her beauty,
thae she began to please ehe Coune.  He regarded and observed her wich care; and seeirg
noching in all her adions, thac was noe boch excream civil, and a little iraperious, he beganto
love her, and so much the more ardently, because he knew that this alliance vvould not be dn-
advantageous to him; is he sought after either nobility of race, or coraraodicy ot riches, lot
thac being born ofa first wiso of her farhers, she was her only heir. Buc is Leonora was agre¬
able to the eyes of the Count, it raay be said, thatheseemedcharmingtoX#«;»slr&lt;»'s: sj^J-
rily I must acknowledg, that I never saw him so araiable, as inthis asserably; and it i^
speak the truth, I do not beleeve rhat there can scarce be found in one only person grs*^^^^
lity then he had.  And for agreeable chings, ic raay bc well assured, that never man was mo
proper CO make himsds be beloved.  His beauty, his good asped, his conversation, hsj

Lion. He is undertaking, and hardy, and is we suffer him to gather new forces, by allying
with the house of O'^o, and Z,so»s7r&lt;»'s riches, he will be capable of encerprizing any ching.
^4»»*rj« barkened Co this discourse as one that was interessed therein, and obeying Andresi'&amp;
ordir, he observed the Count and Leonora, and consirmed himselt in the opinion he had had,
both by his own knowledg, and the talk of the Town. Being in no longer doubt then but
that the Count was in love with Leonora, he advertised his Uncle ofit, who without further
delay coraraanded him to be tbe Counts Rival in this suit. Ic would not be enough, said he to
Jannetin, is we soould bat break ofs tbe Counts marriage; but we must raake profit of his
daraage, and pluck the weapons out of his bands, to destroy him therewith when we are Ma¬
sters of thera. ^oxxmu&amp;mvcxy Leonora, soe is fair and araiable; but were she only noble
and rich, it would be enough to oblige you to marry her. Think of it then, Jannetin; you
are young as well as the Count, you have spirit and courage, and though it may be you have
not so good a grace as he, yet you are Nephew to Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and that is to say every
thing. Think then of winning-^so^ora's heart, before icbc engaged; buc above all, come
to no violence; for ic imporesmuch, chac che adopcive son of him,who hach resfored <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>
to her liberty, soould not engage him to proted bira in such hke things. Jannetin, who
held all his fortune from Andrea Daria, and who reverenced him more then is he had been
his father, proraised him to forgec nothing of all that should lie in his power to satishe him;
as indeed, all that care and raagnisicence could contribute to gallantry, appeared in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>
at that eime; and had not your melancholy retained you then ac <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>, you would have
acknowledged as well as we, that the like had never been seen.
</p>
<p>But whereas tbc Count could not give place to any body, be no sooner understood Jan-
netin's design, but hc overtopped him in all things. There was nothing but running at the
Ring, Turneys, Serenades, Balls, and Seasts; and in all things is the Count was noc raore
magnificent, yet was he more gentile. His apparel was braver, his horses were gallanter
his matches better made, hisserenades better contorted; insne, he hud the advantage in all
things. And wher&lt;;as he loved Leonora really, all the testimonies he gave her of it wrouehc
another essed in her heart, then the seigned protestations of Jannetin, who prevailed not
with her at all. Things contmued a while in this manner, during the which these cwo Rivals
lived civilly enough together, as well by reason of the order which Jannetin had received for

Kjo then, Jannetm, said he unto him, give up a vidory, which you are not able to carrvj

him chac you preser his concenc before your love, and soas he will be yoursti^nd, you will
yeild him your Mistress with joy : Buc so order the matter, thae this raay be heard'by some
to the end that the Count knowing how the world beleeves he I; obliged to you, may also in
consideracion of che wodd, and for fear of being blamed, live hereas crr'wuh you, as is he were
your friend. Madam, do noc chink ic strange, that I should know so many particularitiisof
Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s discoxxxits; but be pleased tounderstand, that a friend'doih not sowell
know what is done in his friends house, as mighty enemies do ordinarily know what they
projed one against another: yet was it not equally so between the Count and lAndrcaB).
ria, ic being certain that this last knew nothing of the Counts dcsigns, what care soevcrhe
Cook for it; whereas he on the contrary could conceal none ofhis from him.
</p>
<p>Buc to ccm^zp\n to Jannetin, be had been no sooner instruded by his Uncle, but he
went home to the Count, who attended with a great deal of impitiencc the answer which
Horatio \N^s to miVehim, for it was hc who had m charge to give it him, he quitted this
musing humor to receive Jannetm's visic wich his ordinary civility ; and according to Anka
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s diredion, three of sannetin's friends arrived a. the same time to be witnelTcs ofthese
two Rivals conversation. After the first coraplements, Jannetin told the Count, thathe
came not only to render him a visit, but also to render bim up his arms, and co demand the
grace of him, that he might b- one ot the captives of his Triumph. I know not, answered
the Count, what Triumph you mean. It is a Triumph, replyed Jannetin, wherein for a
Trophy of Arms you shall have all the chains ofthe Lovers ofthe incomparable Leonora; who
knowing that you alone merit her, wilt follow you without regret or envy; at leattwiselam
come hither to assure you, that that is my'ntention: and is I had known that you had bom
an assedion to her, I would have been your Consident, rather then your Rival; yet ami
not forry, that I have had the comraodity to testifie unto you, that nothing in the world is
so dear to me as your friendship.
</p>
<p>The Count understood presently Jannetin s cunning, yet would raake no soew of it, but
contrarily answered him with a great rteal of civility and gallantry. I choughc, said heunto
him, that I had nothing to vanquish but tbe rigors ofmy Mistress, and is I had bdeeved that
I had had so redoubtable a Rival as you, I hadnot it raay be undertaken to serve her: But
since you are so obliging, as to content your self with meriting her, wichoi,t pretending to her
pofsession, I ara ravished to know that you have judged her worthy of your esteem; and to
understand tbac I shall have noching more then her cruelty ro surmounc, since is you had con¬
tinued serving her, and that she had been just, ! stiould in your triumph have held the place,
which you demand in mine; and which I do not grant you, seeing he that yeilds up a vidory
cannot be said to have been overcome. Jannetin, hearing the Coune speak in this sort, be¬
leeved, that his cunning had succeeded, and took that for a testimony of friendsoip and sree¬
dom, which was but an address ofhis wit; and that not having been able to vanqailh htm in
love, he had at least surmounted him in subtleey, and was arrived ac ehe end he had propound¬
ed CO himself. Bue che Coune was coo clear fighted Co be deceived so easily ; and whereas the
most dexerous guile is chac which perswades our enemies ebac chey have beguiled us, chougti

tented; Julie ieemed satished; //tr^s/o esteemed himsds very happy in it; znd Sophronia
was so much the raore pleased with ic, for thac being ofan age wherein dcsghts, Musick, and
company make up the happiness of a life, soe found all these things in the Counts Pahce,where
soe lived with her sister after her marriage; for it might be said, that this house was the retreat
of all worthy persons, and of all pleasures, which made the Count to be loved of every one.
In the mean time the profperous success ofhis love, had not sraothered his arabition, but con¬
trarily his eskeem of Leonora seemed to have augm.ncedit; ind Sophronia hath assured us,
how soe hath often heard him say, that his Fortune was noc worthy of her. This generous
Soul had noe ic raay be for all that been ever capable of the resolution which he took, chough
he beleeved it to be just, is the counstls of three men, who did but slatter his ambition to sa¬
tishe their own, had not consirmed him in that design. And truly it raust be acknowledgedj
that one hath never heard speak ofan enterprize so daring inso young an age, of a prudence
so extraordinary for the condud ofso dangerous a thing, and ofa success, equal to his, is For«
tune had not abandoned him.
</p>
<p>But, Madam, to raake you acknowl dg that which I say, you are to understand, that about
two years ago the Count finding himself ill for certain days together, wtnt as he used ofcen¬
times Co do inco his Cabinec, whicher his ambicious mocher came to bim, for Co acquainc himj
thae Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who hxd adopted Jannetin for his son and succesfor a good while before,
had chen raade him his Lievttnant to the charge he held of Generalissimo .- And all this, con¬
tinued soe, whileftyou are denyed the pensions which the RepublJquegave <hi rend="italic">Sinibaldo</hi> yom sa¬
ther ; for it was true, that as long as he lived the Senate had assigned him ; pcnsion for a mark
of honor, which bad not been concinued Co the Court, because he had been suspeded by An¬
drea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, an enemy of the Srench, to be asseded to that Nation.
</p>
<p>In the mean time to return unto my subjed, the Count had no sooner heard what his Vo-
thcr said unto him, but would have answered, when as soe staying him told him roundly,
think before thou speakest of saying nothing to me unworthy of thy scls,or of m^ thac brought
thee into the world, and know chad willl disavow thee for my son, isthoube sobase, as to
be contented with thy formne, and to endure, thatthey, who do not outgo thee either in
birth or merit, soould mount into the Throne, and leave thee amongst tne people.  I his dis¬
course netted the great heart of tbe Count, who was but too sensible on that part, yet con¬
cealed he his resentment within himself, and said no more to his Mocher, buc chat all he could
promise her was, how he would absolutely lose himself, or lose them that oppressed him •
and that the sequd or end of hii h^e soould not permit her to complain ofhim.  After this she
left him, but ro consirm him in this dangerous design, soehadconsulted with those three ara-

Chingthac is pleasing totell you. We are in an age, said che Lawyer, wherein good men
hive no greac cause co rejoyce, seeing every day che ambition of some few carry inlolently
away all ehae which oughc co be ehe recompence of vercue. Ic may be some one will ht found
concinued Baptisla, that will make a change in things. But, said the Count interrupting
him, and addressing his speech to Verrin, what bad news have you to impart to me ? My
Lord, answered he, it is badder for the Republique, then for you; for in ^ne, to acquaint
yon thit Jannetin hath shll new honors conserred on him, is totell youthat the power o[
Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> will pass into his hands; that h:s Tyranny will be perpetuated in the person
ofhis Nephew; and that we shall never have tbe happiness to see vertue where it ought
CO be.
</p>
<p>Ie is cercain, added Raphaello Sacca, ehae chis is the sence of all good men; and in the mi.
sery of ehe age, ie seeraj, said he, addresiiing himself co ehe Count, ehae all the woild turn
their eyes upon you. Your illustrious and great birth, accompanyed with so many rare qua¬
licies as are in your person, makes all chem chac love ehe pubbque gbod desire, that your for¬
tune were as greac as your heare: And for my particular, I would gladly see your vertueona
Theater higher then chac whereon you are, eo the end you might be seen of every one: But
you are born in so unhappy an age, as it seems you cannot aspire to the power of doing good
to your Citizens; so crue ic is, that Andrea and Jannetin <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, under the name of the pub¬
lique liberty, have solidly cstablished their Power, or to say better, their Tyranny. And in
this sort, one may well assure, that the people do sussiciently chastise themselves for the blinde
resolution, which carries them to sofke ofs che yoke of a greac and excellenc Prince, to susstt
to be impofed upon them thac of cwo Tyrants, who will be so much the raore crud, by how
much they are less accustmed eo raign. Their weakness, being supporeed byehepowerof
Cafar,ind rendred insolent by the great number of warlike Vcssds.which we see in the Port,
will never suffer a couragious and resolute spirit. They will beleeve the high vertue of a man
of condition too dangerousfor their rising fortune to endure. They will raake use ot the am¬
bitious Tides, of Sachersof cheir Councry, and Restorers of ehe libercy, which havebeen
%\sento Andrea<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, for ehe oppression of ehe raoft raagnaniraous, wich the pretext ot
che common good. So ehae a man of your courage, under chis unjust dominion, is mote sure
of ofsences, then of life: and is unto this day we have not seen such like things, it isbecaule
thepo'wexof Andrea<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, hath not yet attained to its sopreme greatnels; and that his
moderation hach in some fore recained ehe imperious humor of Jannetin. You know h^w
insolenc he is, how proud, and how insupporeable; chink then, is when he soall see himlcit
in an estate of being able to do whaesoever he will, and followed by young people, who re¬
verence him by reason of his Charge, whecher chere be any ching which will noc be permiitea

<p>Raphaello Sacco, could not have touched the minde of the Count it) a more sensible pare;
and tliis man being born for great matters, was extreamly pleased, in that hecould perswade
himself, by ehe reasons alledged unco him, that he might both together deliver his Country,
revenge his own injuriis, destroy his Enemies, content his ambition, and do nothing contra¬
ry to glory. The joy he had ot it raade him resolve to open his heart to his;Considents;
whereupon he acknowledged unto thera, that from his tendrest years, hehad selt a dispofiti¬
on in himself to undertake that which had been now propounded unto him; thac tie had
ever been an Enemy Co Jannetin, though he appeared to be otherwise; that his insolency was
insupportable to him; that having been his Rival in love, he would be the fame in ambition:
Then he recounted unto thera, bow Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> would have broken ofs his raarriage; and
for a conclusion, he declared un.o chem plainly, chat he would change the order of chings, and
for thac essed crave che protedion of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, as being very much inclined to that

<p>tempt some change in che affairs of che .JMrr, as your speech doth witness, I may Om
dear Master, rather hm.nt our common misfortunes, then draw any advant.-c blcon^!^^
shding you: buc is my good fortune can make y®ur prudence give some ro^mtofeS
thoughts, which ordinarily are che intest, you will in this occasion make tryalosths^H
and fidelity which I carry CO your service, by the liberty ot my discourse, asyoukavtS
tryal ot my diligence, in che encounters where it hath been necessary unto you. Until nZ
yon have lived m so constant a felicity, as it may be said, you have never seen Fortune dispb
sed; and that is the cause why your imagination presents noie buc agreeable objeds tint
you; thac is it which makes you, according to the custom of the hsppy, think of nothiiw
but Vidories, Scepters, and Crowns: But I ara much afraid lels these deceiving hopes be not
one day destroyed by some satal event, wh.ch wil be so much the raore insupportable unto
you, by how much you have less foreseen ic. To go abouc Co alter any thing in the Govern¬
ment of the Republiqae, in a time wherein we are, is an enterprize attended with somany
dssicukics, and expofed to evident a peril, as I cannot forccmy minde to sigure it unto issi
cercain and sacile, as one would perswade you. Yotinsine, you will precend either to make
use of strangers, or to hold intelligence with our Citizens; ofthe former I see no likely¬
hood for it: but suppofe it weie pofsible, at least-wise the raatter could not be carryed witt
such speed and so secretly, but the City, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, or the Emperor, would have notice of it.
Ital-j, for your ill fortune, is at this present in To great a trouble, as every ones eyes areopeii
upon his neighbors affairs: And <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> it self, by reason of its scituation on the brink of the
sea, is guarded as the key of that State, sht Djtchyof Milan, which hath beenalon»
time, both a prey and place ot battel to the fortune of the Imperial and Srench Armies"
makes C&lt;^far regard <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, as the onely desence, and sole rampart, which covers his powet
in <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> also serves the Emperor with twenty Gallies, but a great deal more with
the good-will ofthe Citizens, who believe they are obliged unto him: Besides this.alltheCoJst
of the River of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, especially towards the Levant, is absolutely at his devotion, The
City, that is still much troubled with the Tyranny of the Duke of Milan, and Government
of che Srench, detests the very name of forraign dominion. You may indeed with sraall sot¬
ces discover your inceneion, bue noc arrive ac your end. It is so rauch the raore grievous, that
encerprizes of chis nature are not favorably judged of, but by their happy success, and that is
ic which I do noc see you can obcain. For from what part hope you for great Troops i* The
King of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, on whose protedion you rely, hath not so little to do, inregardof hispre-
teneions Co che Kingdom of Naples, and Dutchy of y^;/i«», butis he had even a minde to
make some new stir in <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>,th^t he could come and succor you wich all his forces, which are
employed for the saseey of his sroneircs. Buc say chac he, or any other Prince, soould under-
take \s, could you believe that the Emperor, who for his own incerest takes that of Gmu
upon him, would not opposc them with forces, is not greater, at least-wise equal to those
which you should draw to your assistancc? And that being so, you would see your designs
bit ill assured, since chey would still depend on ehe loss or gain of abaeeel, whose event is al¬
ways doubcsul: buc on which side soever che vidory doth sall, you are still to follow the plei-
sure of che conqueror, nothing being left you that is certain, but the soame of having depri¬
ved your Country of her Libercy, for to submit it Co a stranger. Buc is you turn your eyes to
a neerer succor, by thinking to finde it in this City; either I know not the humor, and indi-
nations of the Genoueses, or your hopes are but weakly grounded. Tell me, I pray you, trom
which sort of our Citizens do you look for assistancc? Will ic be from ehe Nobles? into
whose hands Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> hath put the power and government, and who being obliged to
him for che auchoricy ehey enjoy, live in an happy and honorable eranquillicy, so that no

that che people will not be raore favorable unto you, since it is true, that the more hate J

rejoyce to see the Noble-rain put in chains,by the hand ofa Noble-man; the bowels cs their
Country torn out by you; the comraon rest troubled by your sury; their Tyranny establiso-
ed by y^ur fault: but a time will come when wholly dis charging themselves ot thesedition
which you have caused, the people will give them the recorapence of your travels, the glory
of your enterprize, and the triumph of your combats.  In what terms will you finde your
Iclt then ? Which way will you turn your self for soime ? Detested of the Nobles, whom
you soall have betrayed; despised of the people, who will deride the means which have
caused their utility and your ruine; abominable to your Country, as having ravisoed her of
her liberty; in Enemy to ^a far, the Protedor of the Republique; suspeded of the King

by a man too of whose assedion he was sowell assured, he seemed very unquiet and unc r-'

tia's discourse, as you stiall hear, and as I understood it even trom Verrin himsds, who alttr"
wards recounted all these chings Co us at tAlbengua .- Behold then in what raanner he spake.
I would to God, saidhe, that the affairs of the Republique were brought to that pass, as all
our Citizens might enjoy their estaces with tranquihty, I should not then be atthisday'inthe
necelsicy of wishing you an happier Condition,since as Vmeentio Cakagna bath well observed
there is never a one in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, cither for Riches, greatness of Estatcs, or for illustrious Birth'
can match you: Neither am I ignorant, that a wise raan ought not to tempt Fortune during
an excn am felicity, inregard ic cannoc change buc eo his disadvantage. Howbeit destiny
the enemy ofyour good, hath in such sort perplexed the State of the Republique, i^s you are
enforced to atcempc something chac is great, ortopcriso. Jannetin <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, who forso long
a time hath regarded the Empire of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, as the term of his desires and ambition, cannot
endure you; and is you do not see on his brow, and in his eyes, che marks of th^ extrtam
hate he bears you J is by his adions you do not discover the excess of his pride, andhiscon-
tempt ofyour vertue; the Gallies, which you have bought against his will, may render you
a sussicient testimony thereof; and perswade you, that arabition hathitsjealousiesaswellas
love, and chac Jannetin regarding you as his R.ival,your ruine isone ofhis raoft ardent desiies.
His insolencv carries him so far, as he will be absolute Master of the Sea, and he will not have
any man somuch as dare to trouble or divide his power wichhim: How chen wiU yoa have
him endure you for a Compeeicor in che Governmenc of che Coramonwealch, since jealoulie,
or che desire of raigning, spares neicher che blood of brothers, of children, no not of fathers
themselves i?

but'destinies, which leaves you no other nieantopr.serveyour life but by the death of your
adverfary, nor will not let your vertue be able to desend it self without a crime. But What
s,v I a crime I this word is for you.O too prudent Calcagna; you have learned it no doubt
In the School of the Vulgar, who know not the politick of Conquerors. With such like terms
the adions of private persons are spoken of, but not those of the Great: And is your Rule
were true, ic might be said that all Empires were Robberies, because there is none of chem
which was noC establisoed by that natural right, which the strong irapofe on the weak.
</p>
<p>Nature brought men into the world with an equality of all things, and yet left unto Vertue
the power of raising chera, which pofsess it, to the glory of raigning over others: From
whence it comes, that the most part of those, who are Princes or Masters of the Earth, carry
not that title, but because their Predecesfors, by the address and by force of Arms, usurped
the Empire over their equals. I do not deny but ehae ehere are some persons, who as well as
jrj««»s'o will blame your resolution, before it be conduded to its end, in regard all hardy
and dangerous adions are never coramended till chey are executed; but as soon as the happy
success ofehe event soall have justisied and authorized the greatness ofyour enterprize, the
blame will be turned into adrairation; and that which was calsd temerityand iraprudence,
will be termed valor and greatness of courage. As long as the first of the Cafars was in Arms
against Pow/&gt;«7, and that the isow^« Empire was the cause of their conshds, he had not only
T'ow/'s; for an adverfary, but even all the Nobihty were his raoft cruel soes. In the mean
time as soon as hc had defeated his Eneraies raighty Army in the plains of Pharsalia, and that
this vidory had put him in full pofsession of the Roman Empire, all the hatred which was
born him ceased j and he was so dearly and ardently beloved of the Romans, as this assedion
could not siniso with his life, but ehey punisoed his deach wich a memorable revenge. Re¬
solve chen Co suffer che Genoueses for a eime Co call you Tyranc, and do nor cake chis name as
a grievous injury, seeing ie soall be che last insolency of their dying liberty. They will accustom
themselves afterwards to acknowledg you for their lawsul Prince, and as such reverence you.
Behold how rauch I rely on your fortune, in speaking to you cs the selicities of your Empire,
before you have resolved to fight for the acquiring of ir. But things are dispofed in such sort,
as you may sooner be wanting to your selt, then the Erapire to your vertue. For is the dissi¬
culties be greac, according to r»»««rsVs opinion, your courage is yet greater. Letusgranc
him, that the enterprize is dangerous and dissicult; in what History, ancient or modern, hath
it been found, that the way which condudcth to glory is covered with flowers ? and that an
illustrious adion hath been executed without pain? All great designs have always been sol¬
lowed by great perils; and all high places are ever near to precipices: A generous man will
not for allthat let the fear of an uncertain evil, make him a prey[to an inevicable servitude.
Amongst private persons it is an essed of prudence tobe contained within mediocrity; but in
affairs of ^'/^/^« all resolutions are Co be extream, the rest being dangerous, especially in enter-
prizes, which begin not co break forth but by their execution. For it being then no longer
m our power to retain the thing, wc must of neccsllity arrive at the end we have propofed Co
our selves, or sall in the raidst ot che course, and be utterly loss. Yec lee us noc make so un¬
happy a presage ofour designs, but let us forecast the misfortunes which may arrive to us, not
to eormenc our selves in che expedacion of chera, but by prudence Co take from them che
power of hurting us. We are to be guided with precaution, but yec noC so far, as chat ex¬
tream wisdora may thereby render us raore ciraorous and viresolute. You raust, generous
Count, give fomething to the condud of Fortune, who having chofen you for the Deliverer

diforder, by the debts which he had run inco, as judging that he could hardly conceal his mi¬
sery longer, is the cranquilicy of the Republiqiie should hst any time, he was desirous to Heal
it from the eyes ofthe world by a universal con'^usion. He considered also, that is the inier-
prize were profperous, he should raise his fortune to an high pitch; that it contrarily the suc¬

his endeavoring the execution ofa great design, ic would be some comfort to him to think that

</p>
<p>This speech ended, they all resolved with one accord, cbaC sincsi the Governmenc could

of giving soch order eo che raaecer, as ehe end of cheir lives soould be ehe beginning ot the ex¬
ecution thereof. This Consptracy being raade, rhe Count went ouc of his Cabinec, wieh a
marvelous cranquillity of spirit, and wc were all the evening with him, talkingof Musick and
Painting, as is he had had nothing else of iraportance in his thought. As for his Counstllors,
they told her who had eraployed them, chac soe was eo attend greac matcers from her son,
withouc particularizing anything unto her, for fear left soe soould discover thera. Inthe
mean time, the Count, having certain days after taken great care for the Galliej, which ht
had bought not long before, used to go oftentimes to the places belonging tohim; where
with an admirable Providence he surnisoed his Subjeds with Arms, and made them to exer¬
cise thera, upon pretext ofbeing in some fear of che Duke of T/*c«»/»&lt;«, whose neighbor he
was; but indeed, it was to render thera capable of serving him in his design.
</p>
<p>The end of Autumn being come, he xetuxntd to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, and applyed a'l his Cite to gain
the good-will 'sall the young racn,of those samilies newly ennobs d, which are called Popular.
He introduced himself into their conversadon with a marvelous compliance. He sent presents
to some, he served others according to occasions, and ofsered himselfto all, with an extraor¬
dinary courtesie. And whereas he had a quick and pleasing wit, and a supple and charming
humor, he won their assedion in so high a manner, ashe was their Master, rather then their
friend. When as he knew that he mighc begin co conside in chem, and chat their wills de¬
pended absolutely on his, he sdl to jeering, as occasion served, at the Government of<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>,
which hc termed the Tyranny ofthe Nobles. Sometimes he testified with interrupted speeches
that he suffered in the miseries of the popular samilies; scmetimes he secmed to tell them that
the raatter was not past remedy, and that chey might abase the pride of the Nobles, is their
hearts d|,d not sail them; sometimes also with a bitter seofs he exhorted thera to servicude;
yec still leaving chera a sting behind in cheir minds by his doubtsul and uncereain words. And
above all chings, he aggravaced che injustice of the Government, when by chance any acci¬
dent sesl our, that displeased the popular samilies. But is he were agreeable to ehera, lie had
rendred himlels no less pleasing to ehe coramon people, by such means as he had carefully
used for ic. He most readily salutcd some, he siuiled upon ochers as he race chera, he was
magnificent in his apparel, gencle and courteous co every one; and thac which advanced his
design raore was, as you know as well as I, that he was wondersul handfora, and of an ex¬
ceeding jovial humor; that the air of his face was sweet and agreeable; and his carriage so
noble, so tree, and so fair, as one was forced eo love him ae che very first fight. He exer¬
cised himself also in sencing, and riding of ehe greac horse, and chac wieh so gallant a grace,
and so great an address, as they that saw him could not chuse but love a man, who gave chem
somuch delight.
</p>
<p>But whereas liberality is the strongest chain, wherewith the people may be captivated, he
met with no occasion of deraonstracing his unco chera, buc he cestisied ic wich a magnificence
past compare. Yec would noe our prudene Conspiracor cast himself so absolutely inco che
hands of ehe people, as Co minister any jealousie ehereby eo che Nobles; buc he used so just a
eempermaconiundure,where racdiocricy was so hard Cobe observed. thac the good-will
ot the one did not make him lose the friendsoip of the others. And to that essed, choush
Jannetm was become very insolent, since C^ar had admitted him for Generalistlmoihex the
deathof^«^rr.i; though he would be no longer followed by young men but for interest •
</p>
<p>hough he would be no longer served but for fear; though his arrogance had even carried him
to ofser some II usage to the Count; yet began he not only to go oftner to ^«^r.. then he
was wont, and to soew a raore particular reverence to him, but shuttingup also in hs heart

<p>_ In the mean time, he had treated secretly with the Duke of Placentia, who had promised
him two thousand Foot, to joyn with two thousand othcr.^ which he had pick'd forthont
of all his subjeds, for the service of his enterprze when time soould serve. He had also
caused one of his Gallies to come to <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> under pretext that be meant to send her forth to
scour the Seas all along the Coast of Barbary. Howbeit during all this we observed as a most
extraordinary ching in him, chac he was as merry as he used cobe, delighted as much in our
company, and seemed Co have no other greater thought, then of being agreeable to his
friends.
</p>
<p>Now Baptisla, cunning and undertaking as he was, remained not idle; for in a very shott
time he had gained a great number of persons, who proraised to follow and serve him faith.
fully in a secret design which he said he had. With these preparations, they believed that they
had layd foundations solid enough for the execution ot their intentions; and being assembled
together to take their last resolucion, the advice of Baptista Verrin was, that wheieas there
was a ceremony to be celebrated for the perforraance whereof every one would rtfortunto
the Church, he would have them begin the executing o^" the business in that pbce, sstliing to
give Jannetin the first stab.  Buc the ssount's piety being unable co consenc eo chis propoiiti-
on, he made a step or cwo back, crying ouc, He would never endure that the beginning of
his enterprize should be a profanation and a sacnledg.  Raphaello Sacca added thereunto,
that the matter likewise would even be as uncertain, as icwjs ex crable; hcvakdnirt*
Z)m4 mighe excuse himself upon che incomraodity of his age, and sonot come, but send
Thilippo <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> his Kinsman in his stead. To chis Verrin answered again, thac is th:y thought
it sit he would go, whil'st chey were executing the business, to Andrea's Palace, and under
colour of visiting him as he was wont to do, he would strike him to the heart with his Poig-
nard.  But the Count being very angry with him for it, he gave this over, and propounded
another expedient worthy of his wit: He told the Count, that Jannetin's sister beinglhort-
ly ascer Co marry wieh/«/&lt;o Cj^o, Leonar a's bxoihex, he would have him desire chem to sup
ac his house; and Co render the seast ehe raore rasgnisicene, he should also invice Auhtt Do¬
ria ind Jannetin, together with a great nuraber ot Ladies, and all such araongst the Nobles,
whom they might judg were most eo be feared for the execucion oftheir design; That things
being thus, it would be easie for chera whom they had hid for that purpose to kill them; that
presently thereupon the C^j^wr, followed byhistriends, soould go through all the streets os
<hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, founding out the sweet name of Liberty, and acquaineing che people that theit
chains were broken; That in this Tumult the Palace was to be seized upon and lecurtd; that
in the mean tiuae he would pofsess the people with the Count's generous designs, concealing
from them wich address that which he had of absolutely raigning; and letting chem know
the necessity of reforming the Government, or to say better, the cruel Tyranny of theNobks,
for so it was thac he spake; Thatforthis essed he would crown him Duke of the Repub¬
lique, and cause them whom he had gained to take the oath of allegiance unto him; That it
any one, either in woord or deed, should contradid them, he soould be killed upon the
place.
</p>
<p>The Count found this plot indisserently well contrived, buc yet he selt an extream repug¬
nancy in resolving to vsolate the law of hofpitality, in killing men in h s house, whom he )i
intreated thither; but being pe»rswaded that he should not meet with a better nr an to at
to his end, he resolved for it: And to that purpose, he commanded, t^at the Soldiers, wn
be had choft-n from amongst his Subjeds, should come one by one into <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> ^ And on
other side he solhcited the Duke of Placentia to send him the succor which he had pro
him. All these dispatches could not beso secretly made, especially having to do witn  j
of men of war, b\iithn Don Sernando deGanzagua, who had succccded to tne  -j,^^

b- ause r^e young Count of Lav.nrta WAS conspiring some greac micccr.

<p>'Andrea received this advice,'wiir-ouc grounding any thing thereupon; for he was so
strongly perswaded of th.^ Count's assedion to him,and so powcrfullv assured, by the tranquil¬
lity which he always saw in his face, that he had no bad design in hand, as this discourse made
no kind of impression in his uiind ; and to consirm him in his incredulity, the Count entred ac¬
cidently into Andr.ai, chamber, when as the Embassador and he were speakinp ot this assiir;
but he appeared wuh so clear a countenance, and talked to thera with so much judgment, and
hberty of spirit, thit Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, charmed with Ws conversacion, and periwaded of
his innocency, approached to the Embassador, and said to him softly in his ear, as we have
Icarn'd since, Judg you your sds, whether this Prncely look^, this both mo'iesi and consident
carriage, this nobU and cjuiet soul and this liberty of Jpirit, can be capable of so horrible
a conRiracj ? The Embalsador not able to gainsay Andrea's Opinion, raadc a sign to him
that he was of his raind'. And albeit that two days after <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> had a second advertisemenr,
yet the Count's address was so great, as his fight alqne destroyed whatsoever was said against
him. And so wondersul was his condud, rhat Andrea Dsria, above fourscorc years of
age, and held for cne of the greatest politicians of his time, was beguiled byarasnot cwo
and twenty.
</p>
<p>The generous Panja, who had been of none of the Count's counstls, was withouc com¬
parison more advised. For whereas he joyned assedion to prudence, ic was the more easi.."
for him ro susped forajthing of the truth. He had exadly observed all the ssount's adions,
ever since hehad bought the Gallies of the Dxike of Placentia; and carefully exaraining all
that he had seen or heard in divers occasions, he found that he had cause to fear left the ssount
had some dangerousdesign a foot. He saw how he, who was accustomed to communicate
the raoft important affairs of his house to him, calked no longer with him but of indisserent
things; that he was often in a retired and private conversation with ;^pn/?.i Verrin, ani
having followed himfometimes whenas be withdrew himself into his Cabinet, he had per-
cived hm to be musing and melancholique: For though the Count seemed to be merry,
when ashe might be seen of anybody, and by that artifice admirably covered ehe dcsigns
which he had in his hearr, yec was be no sooner retired in privace, bue he became quice an¬
ocher chen whac hehad been seen abroad, which S.w/^ alone had marked, for he had con¬
cealed himself from Leonora, as wdl as from ochers. Thac which kepc ehe ssount from com¬
municating hs design to Pan sa, was his knowledg of the assedion and exceeding prudence
of the man, so that he was assured hewould have opposed his design, or at least-wise have
counsclled hini not to have undertaken it so precipitously : and would have had him seek for
more security in an enterprize, where none had ever been.
</p>
<p>At length, one day when as the Count returned to his Palace more melancholique then hc
used to be, carrying in his face some raarks ofan extraordinary unquietness, and with such a
paleness, as amazement many times paints on the forehead of those, which are upon the point
of executing some great design, whose event is but ill-assured; the generous T^w//sol¬
lowed him to his Cabinet, and resolved to tell him his suspcions, for fear left is he stiould
longer deser to do ir, there would be no cime left for the remedying ofthe evil whereof he was
afraid. After he had sont the door then, he addressed his speech to the Count, who leaning
on a Table, heard him with a great deal of unquietness. I know very well, my Lord said he

fore.  Alass I how do I fear, left ehese secrec counself, which yeu hold so ofcen wich thde
violenc persons, and whose inclinaeions are not very sincere, soould by their address and
cunning draw you out ot the way of vertue! Suffer me, my dear Master, to discover the
diseaso that I may cure it. They, from whora my suspicions arise, are not of soch commend-
able manners, or of so exemplary a piety, as I may beleeve thev give you counself, which
do noc clash either with Vertue, or wich Religion.  Ic may be ehey abuse your little'expert-
ence,and knowing you generous, they propound unto you adions,which in appearance are great
and glorious, but which in essed are rash and vain.  Open your eyes then, O noble Comt,
and think that an inconsiderate man may make you sall into a precipice, out of which the
prudence of all the wisest in che world cannot draw you.  It is easie enoughto set a Palace on
sire.but it is noc so easie Co quench ie: Take heed left they that counsel you do not make use of
you, to arrive at the end which they propofe unro themselves; and that your undoing do not
serve for the benesit of chem which deceive you.  Ie is rare eo meec wich men, who counltl
chac which is good, because ic is good, wichouc regard Co cheir incerest; and yec icisby this
experience, chac we are to be secured of chem.  Examine chen seriously, whecher they,wliicli
counsel you, cannoc become greaccr or richer by that they would have you undertake. And
to cell you all chac I chink in chis occasion, I cannot be perswaded, thae chey, whichspend
their lives amongst crimes, are capable of perswading vercue unco ochers.  For chough theic
be greac disserence beeween deeds and words, ehe most iraporcane parr of perswalion consists
in example rather chen in discourse; and commonly the raouch and the hand ad alike. What
would these men have of you ? To what innovation would they carry you ? The estate ut
your affairs are at such a point, as they have no need of change; there can no mutation arrive
unto you, but will be to your disadvantage.  Envy hath a long time sought to sasten on you,
and will you let hcrtakeholdonyouby thediforder whereunto they are carrying you? St
you are noc ignorant, how there is a great number of persons, who are interior ro you, boih
in Nobility, Estate, and Vertue, which endevor to traduce you.  I know that hope is sweet
unto young people, espccially to chera which can sustain ic wieh ehe greaeness of their cou¬
rage, bue I know wiehall chac nothing is more shppery then profperity: Beware then I^
the hope ofan incertain thing do noc make you lose an aslbred good. They which counsel you
have noching co lose, nor noching co hazird, whether cheir means or cheir repucacionbecunlj-
dered; and eherefore ie is, that these kinde of men wiso for revolts, seditions, tumults, and dis¬
orders, because it is ehe custora of such like persons to enrich therasclvcs with other mensl' li s.
and to find cheir parcicular rest in a general consusion.  In sine, chey which are not very hiA

</p>
<p>In the mean time the second of January being arrived, which preceded that dreadsul nighr,
the Countcaused certain Soldiers of the Gari'on to come tohisPa'ace, whereof some were
hisSubjeds, and the rest soch as had b.en placed there by him, and having Idt them under
the Command ot one of the Conspirators, he went and past awiy ihe restot the day till even¬
ing with/^«^r^^ Z)m4, where he had never been seen more merry, or more pleasanr.  He
intreated ^B«^sj« again, who was there present, to give order at the Port, that his Gaily,
which was chac nighc CO see sail cowards che Archipelague, ra-ghc not be stayed.  He adver¬
tised him also, chac he would noc be croubled, ishe heard any noise, or any Ordnance dis¬
charged; for, as you know better then I, said he unto him, they always sooot ofs some for
the Ceremony of parting, and these things never pass without some stir.  At his coraing
from thence the Srench Marquess and I met him; but it had been hard for us to foresee whac
the Count had in his thought, for he talked to us of nothing but of matches ot sport and de¬
light for the ensuing days; Howbeit he gave us dextrously to understand, chac he should be
busie this evening in seceing forch his Gaily, for fear left we soould go home wieh bim, seem-
ing nevertheless very forry ac it, and celling us chac Leonora ind Sophronia would noC be
friends wich him tor ic. Ascer we were parted from him, he wene to his Palace, which, as
you know, wasin thatpartofC7s«o«4, ctWed Carignan, and which seeras tobe severed from
all the rest of the City, and to command it, as well for its advantageous scituation, as for its
magnificcBce.  You know also, that th s Palace, being built upon a lictle hill, couched che
walls ofthe City alraoft on every side ; The Sea was inthe face of che building, and back¬
wards It had for profped the pleasant Valley of Btsagno.  I put you in raind of these things,
chat you may comprehend, how this Palace, being as it were an Island, was very coramodi¬
ously sciruared for the Counts enterprize; having no nearer a neighbor then Baptista, who
being ofthe Conspiracy was not to be feared.  In sine, being recurned home, he drew chither
about the beginning ofthe night, a great raany of armed men, of those which he had caused
to enter secretly into the City, and of those which he had suborned even in <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> it selt.
He placed them for the Guard of the Gates of his Palace, whom he held to be the most cou¬
rageous and faithsul; with order to leave the entrance cbercinto sree to every one, but colec
no body pass out of them.
</p>
<p>In the mean time one ofthe Captains ofthe Garison, going to see Sentinels, perceived thac
some ofthe Soldiers were missing, and enquired of his Lievtenant whicher chey were gone;
whereupon some oftheir sellows answering that they were gone to Carignan wich che Coune
of Lavagna, it made him susped something; so that he went instantly and gave notice
thereof to the Senators that were at the Palace, and to Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>; and then it was chac
the Counts dishmulaeion wroughe ehe greacest essed, and began Co produce chac which he had
expeded from it. Jannetin hearing chis advertisement, told him, that his fidelity was to be
commended, although this advice had no ground for them to fear any ching. For whereas hc
was prepofsest by the Counts address, who had demanded permishon of him for the parting
away of a Gaily this night to scour the Seas towards the Levanc, he assured chem ehae all these
Soldiers, which were gone to him, being ot his own or the Duke of Placentia s Subjeds,

two or three ofthose assemblies, which are m.de a nights inthe houses of persons of qui
mGenona, where the small time chat he stayed there, he left a n.w admiration ofhL
He was magnificently apparelled that day, and redoubling also his ordinary civility and Pal'
iantry, he wenc noc ouc of any of those companies without augmenting the assedion which
they already bore unto him.  But at last he went to the house of one, named Asjereto where
he found three and twenty young Gentleman of the- Popular order, whom the coiiningof
Baptista Verrin had drawn thither.  The Count caressed them exceedingly, and talkinc with
them of divers things, and supper time being near, he desired them to go home and eat with
him.  He told them, chat it was too fair an evening co pare so soon; ehae che night was too
lighc, and che Moon eoo clear, for chem co cxcuse chemselves upon ehe season; and briesly
he increaeed them wich so good a grace, as they went along with him,  The Countled them
to a back room,willing the ditcreec Pansa eo go and encercain his wise, unco whom he would
come ere ic were long, because,said he smiling,our design will noe brook che piesence ol Ladie.'.
Ac first these young Gentlemen bcleeved,that it was to creat them with the morehbenyhedid
so, and so went on with him.  i n the mean time Baptista Verrin went dextrously to k-e it he
could discover anything abouc the Palace, or at Dortds, that might make bim chink tlcy

<p>Things being in chese cerms, che Count entred into another charaber, after he had told
them, chac he would come co chem again presendy, as indeed he stayd noc long belore here-
turned. Buc chey were mighcily surprized, when as they saw him encer compleatly armed,
and followed by cwo hundred Soldiers, with Partisans or Musquets, which ranged themselves
round abouc him; He had his Viser up, and his Sword in his hand; and beginning then to
lee che hacred and choller break forch, which be had for so long a cime kept concealed in his
heart, his face was all on sire, and sierceness and sury appeared in his eyes. He approached
to a Table, and leaning on it with his Icsc hand, bc continued a while without saying any
thing ; chen suddenly giving a great bounce on ic, he said with an iraperious tone, and a pre-
cipicace voyce, Ic is done, I am resolved, O couragious and illustrious friends! a spirit touch¬
ed wich any generoficy can no longer suffer ic, ehe insolency of chem ebac would oppress us
hach incensed my courage, and wearied my pacience. My imaginacion presents unto roe a
spedacle, Coo horrible and coo deadly, in making me see our Cicizens tyrannized, and the
subversion of our Country indubitable, for me not to oppose my self Co a mischief, which
fear, or co say beceer, Reason, makes me see so nigh ac hand. Is the evils, wherewith the
Republique is mortally caineed, could hope for remedies from eime, I would endure, as others
do, a retardment, which migtit be proficable Co che publique good ; bue since we are arrived
at the last period of our misery, and thac we see our selves quite ready to be ruined, we xm
of necesllity go and encounter chac which is to overwhelm us: and is it be pofl'ible, not only
sustain, but overthrow ie. How greac soever ehe peril is, ic loses much ot its force,, whtn it
is couragiously asfronted ; whereas concrarily, ic encreases and becomes inevitable wbso it i$

<p>But that which touches me further, is, that I certainly know how under tbe authority ofa
Prince he prepares an heavy yoke for the publique liberty. And bt cause I have wichouc con¬
sidering my birch erabraced your cause, noc so much for che interest us your order, as tor sol¬
lowing of Reason,and sacissying of my duty; because,! say,I have never consenced to the inso^

cause I have elleemed of vercue wheresoever I have race wieh ie; because I hav. a' ways c iken

terapt upon my life, and believe that they cannot put you into chains, unless they dtprive you
of him, whora they conceive to be strong enough, or couragious enough, to undertake the
breaking of thera.
</p>
<p>What do we mean then, O my companions, by cur sloth and our cowardise ? Will we be
always the Spedators ofour own misery ? For wliat enterprize soall we reserve our courage,
is in the general desolation of our Country wc abandon our selves ? It is no time for us linger
to complain ofour Enemies, but to revenge our selves of them. Let us leave the use of tears
to our wives, and is we be worthy the name of men, which we bear, let us eraploy our cou¬
rage, our force, and our address, in dcstroying ©ur Tyrants. We have too much already en¬
dured their insolency, which doubdess carries them to bs lieve, thac our patience is an essed
ofour fainc-heareedness. They who leave crimes unpunisoed, are guilty of chofe, ws ich ehe
excess of cheir goodness doch make cheir oppresfors commie ascerwards; who ordinar:ly aug-
mene cheir violenccs,when as chey see chey are dissembled. What do we forther exped,O te-
nerous Citizens ? May it be, to have the Governmenr, and all kindof Authority in the Re¬
publique tobe utterly lost ? May it be, that you will have che heart to plice Jannetin in the
Throne? To see che Ministers of his sury go and take your goods out of your houses, ruine
your samilies, attempt upon your lives, dishonor your wives, and commit those wickednesltr,
which raay justly be attended from a Tyranny, that is born for the ruine ofthe Country, nou-
risocd by the publique dissention, increased by che raiscries of che Cicizens, and established
by the death ofso many good men ? Are our courages so base, and so low brought ? Have
our swords solitdiedg, as we cannoc cue ofs che infaraous life of him, who makes a glory
of our soame, who criumphs over our misfortunes, and seeds on our miseries ? Shall we not
pluck oue of Jannetin's body that Cowardly heart, which hath contrived so many Treasons
and which raay be termed thescource ofall our mischiefs i* Shall we suffer a simple Citizen tcj
be our Tyranc, let him trample us under his seer, and subjeding us unio him as his Slaves
dispofe of our lives and deaths as he pleaseth ? For me, I profess sreely unto you, that I hold
it raore glorious to buy liberty with a great peril, then to sweeten servitude with idleness ai^d

<p>my discourse, and the beginning ofyour vidory.  Let us go out of this Palace, and descend
into the Oty, where we are attended by a great number of our friends, forth end nt
</p>
<p>me, the Gallies upon a Signal given will sall into the hands of a Troop of men, as hX to ren
der thernselve^s Masters ot them, as prudent Co conseive chera.  We have sntheCit'vsihcen
hundred inhabicants, which are armed for us; and even now that I am speaking to you there
are m che Suburbs cwo ehousand of my Subjeds, and as many of the Duke of pLemi.'s
whxh arc come to succor us.
</p>
<p>Lee us go chen, my companions, and caliche people again co liberty; let us return to the
dweetness ofour anccnt Government; let us exterminate the Nobles and /rs^wrt/VsTyrannv
and in one only night, more shining then the fairest days of our lives have been, let us re-
eltabhsh the glory of the popular samilies in their first splendor j let us for ever deface out of
th J memories of men our past siinc-hearredness.But is any ofyou as I cannot believejbe soau-
dacious &amp; so cowardly borh together, as to oppose a design so glorious for us,and advantageous
for our Cou itry, let him behold round about him chis dreadsul company of Arms and SolJi-

</p>
<p>These dreadsul menaces amazed chofe Co whom they were addrtst; they beheld cne ano¬
ther, and chen that great nuraber of Soldier| which environed them; and after they had been
a while without speaking, they cryed all with one voyce, cwo excepted, that they would
follow che Coune even co ehe death; that they would be the companions of his triumph, or
of his sall; and in conclusion, thac they would never abandon him, but would obey him in
all things. The Count embraced chem chen with a great deal of joy, and testimony ot satis-
sadion; and being turned towards chofe two, which as yet had said nothing, they besought
him to have pity of cheir weakness, wich words wherein tear appeared so vilible.as the Count
could noc forbear smiling. They represenred unto him, rhat the request which thty made
him, was advantageous tohim, as well as to thtm; bt cause being so uncapable ot fighting,
they should hurt him more then they could help him; that their fear might beget the same in
others,and their shght give an ill example to his Soldiers: Britsly,chey gave him so many marks
of their assright and terror, as changing his determination, hc only contented himself with re¬
proaching them for their cowardise in a bitter jear, and for the security ot his enterprize he
caused them to be shut up in a chamber, where he left thtm under a Guard, which should
keep them from coming forth. After this he comraanded meat to be brought in, but in such
a sastiion, as this meal might be rather named a collation, then a supper; tearing left they
should be too much taken up wich good cheat. Whil'st chen thae some did eae standing, jnd
others were arming themselves with the Arms which ehe Coune had caused eo be presented
unco chem, hc wene co Leonora's chamber, who was talking with Sophronia hex siiser about
the unquiecness she was in co see so many Soldiers in her Palace. As soon as he was entred,
he approached co her, and taking her by che hand, he cold her in few words the design he had;
desiring her Co pardon him for noc having spoken to her of it till then.
</p>
<p>The great heart of i^soword found not it self sirm enough to remain constant in this occa¬
sion ; and considering the extream peril whereinto che Count was going to expofe hiinsdt,
assedion and fear troubled her iss such sort, as salling at the Counts teet, and her face all be¬
dewed wich cears. My Lord, said she unto him, imbracing his knees, to what danger arc
you going co expofe your selt ? I conjure you by che thing that is dearest to you m the world,

pally, and Thomxso After eta did what he could Co srize upon the gate of DarsoH; at siill
inregard hewasoneo /^w^nVs Officers, and had the word, the Guards sust:red him to
enter; but perceiving so great a number of armed m;n, wherewith hc was lollowed, they
rudely r. pulstd him: Neverth- less st:e;ng ic was necessary, tha? some one so uld enter to open
the gate unro the Count, it was resolved that Scipio, oneof his subjeds, and a Cap ain of
greac courage, should cast himstls with forne Soldiers into hede Boats, kepc thereof pur¬
pofe, in ca eof neccsllity, and by thac means encer by che S;a into che Pore, where the Gal¬
lies hy, and so sacilitate che entrance of the rest of the Conspirators thereinto.  Thisdtlign
was as happily executed, as itwas well thought of; for albeit they found some rtlistance
there, yet in regard the Conrpiiators were more in number,and incomparably more valorous,it
was ealie for them to prevail.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the Count was come by Land to that Gate, where with much impatience
he attended the signal that was Co be given him, which stayd longer then it ought, hy reason
the Gaily with her motion and agitarion had struck her sds a ground, and it was above half
an hour before they could see her asloat again. All these things, which could not be due
without noise, began to raise a great deal; but at length the lignal having been given, the
Count, devarcingall his companions, leapt with txcccdirg courage intoT^n./s Gillies.
This unexp ded violence, and the noise o''Arms and Soldiers, having awaked all the Miri-
nersanj Slaves, a drtadsol and consused din of chains and vojccs was suddenly heard. All
the Sailors cryed to Arms, ail theG^lly-Shvts refoundcd rhenameof Liberty, and labored
as much as they could to break ofs cheir Lons: But che Count, who knew not what to do
with the Gallies is he hsd not m n, considering what a prejudice the shght of the Slaves
would bring unto him, he cast himself asoore again, and wenc with all speed to the Admiral,
which with the sudden and un: uly motion of them wherewith soe was silled, sloated leasure-
ly, and seemed as though she would eb''gn her selt from the Land.

<p>Whil'st rhings past thus in the Port, Girahmo and Ottobuono sailed not in that which haJ

<p>Gallies. Andrea, more foreseeing then he, and fearing some unlooked for accident, would
not have had him gone forth, but well accompanyed; H.s Wise cast herself at his feet Co
keep him from ic: hue he, carryed on by his dcsony, contemned ehe counsel of ehe one, and
the prayers of che ocher, and wene oue alone wieh one Groom ot his Chamber, and a Page,
thae carryed a Torch before him, wichouc any ocher Arras, chen his single sword. When hc
arrived ae Faine Thoma4 gace, which he choughc was guarded still by his own followers, ac¬
cording CO his insolenc humor, whereuneo che choller he was in chac Cime being joyned, he
siercely coraraanded chem eo open unCo him. Jannetin's voyce being straigheway known of
the Conspimeors, ehey opened ehe gacc, and suffered himeo encer wichouc resistance; buc
scarcely was he enered, when as a soowre of Muskee sooc sell on him, and layd hra instanely
dead on ehe ground. This adventure raade Giralomo and Ottobuono change che order which
the Count had given ehera, for going diredly Co <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s Palace. For seeing Jannetm dead,
who was ehe onely raan of ehe Co«»sV Eneraies, ehae could sacishe wich his person; and be¬
leeving ehae ehe Count had rendred himself Master of ehe Gallies, ehey did noe think that
Andrea, fourscorc years of age, and sick ot the gout, could bring any great obstacle to their
design. Moreover they feared, that is they soould go to Dorius Palace, the riches of the
booty would withdraw the raoft part of the Soldiers from the adion, and make them quit
their Arms, to lade theraselves with che plunder of such rich raovables, as it was full of.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, the noisc and diforder stili increasing, Andrea was much troubled for
Jannetin, not being able Co imagine whac soould be che cause of so rauch stir. Buc ac lengch
having sene one of his servancs, cercainly Co know che occasion of chis Tumulr, he broughc
him word, chac ehe Count of Lavagna had raade himself Master of <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>; ehae the Re¬
publique was in extreara peril; that his Gallies were full of his Eneraies; thae che people re-
founded all about the word of ia^ursj, and the name of Giovanni Lodovico; chac surious
men ran up and down with Arras in their hands; thac there was nothing seen but blood and
slaughter; and that every where was talkingof outrages against rhe Nobles, and menaces a-
gainst his life. So dreadsul a relation perswading Andrea that the matter was past remedy,
he resolved to accend ehe violence of his Enemies in his Palace, and eo yield Co chem whom he
could not resist. But his wise, and his servants, with their tears, intreatics and reasons, raade
bim at last resolve to let himself be carryed down into his Palace-yard, where chey see him
on an horse wich much ado; in ehis estace ehey conduded him eo Mazona, which is a Castle
belonging to a Kinsman of mine, and from thence to another place, where they understood
the death of Jannetin, with which he was sensibly touched.
</p>
<p>In the mean time the Conspirators still advanced their design; and whereas this noise and
Tumult had awaked every one, all the Count's particuUr friends having heard the people cry,
Long live the Count of Lavagna, went forth with Arms in their hands to see what the mat¬
ter was, and co joyn chemselves wieh him j and araongst the ress <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, the Srench Marquis,
and I, who by chance lay together that night, going also forth to seek the Co««s, met some
thirty paces from my lodging, Giralomo with all his Troop, who sought for him as well as
we. All the people, that took his pare, required to see cheir Dehverer; but though chere
was crying every where, Long live the Count of Lavagna, and that every one enquired as¬
ter him, yet no body answered thereunto. This silence raade us fear some disaslrous success,
yet did It not raake thera give over the design of pursuing a vidory, which seemed so cer¬
tain. Giralomo left a sussicient Guard at the gates, and senc Ottobuono to cake a care of che
Gallies, in case bis Broeher was noc ehere. The i^r*«c)b Marquis followed him, and I stay'd
with Giralomo, who being accompanyed onely with two hundred Soldiers, went, as he
had resolved, through all the sixeetsoi <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, to cause tbe people, both wich his speeches,
and che hcjpe of Libercy, eo rise. And though the Count appeared not, yec each one decla¬
red himself for him with earnestly demanding where he was. The City in che mean space
was in a general cons usion and consternation; every one ran up and down in the streees,wich¬
out knowing whither they went; every one asked ot one another what was ehe cause of chis
dreadsul diforder, wichouc knowing whae Co answer; ehe women ouc of cheir windows,

gcous for his Master. To that essed he went to the P.ilace, where h= found Cardinal bma a, d
some others, who consulted with the Senate, ^Nhexeof Nicola Prmea was the Chi s there
being no Duke at that time.  They resolved thac Bonisacio LomelUn, one of the TAUxn
cins, and Antonio Calvo, with che Ensign ot the Guard and fifty Soldiers, soould go and
desend S. Thoma4 Gate; but having on the way encuuntred with che Troop where we were
they were constrained to retire into one of their friends houses, but not without leivingiome
oftheir men prisoners.  Part of them went in great haste by another street to the same gate to
learn some n:ws of Andrea ; but finding it wdl guarded, and LomelUn having at the very
first been made a prisoier, thvysltd away with great precipitation, whereat ours were io
joysul, as this prisoner escaped from chem.
</p>
<p>In the mean cime ic was noc known where the Count vvas; they that were withG/^/^wo
thought he was at che Pore; ehey of the Port on the other side believed that he had Ics thtm
to repair unto his brothers; Ottobuono not finding him there, thought that he was gone to
visit the Gates, or it miy be to <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> iViUce; they of the Gates were perswaded thathe
was in the City; in sine, everyone thought anything save the truth. But amongst all the
rest, BaptiHa Verrin, as having the greatest ssiare in the enterprize, was raoft earnest in ask.
ing after him. He saw the business so well carried, and the Vidory so certain, as he was mad
for that he could not see che Coune; the Gates of che Gey were cheirs; ehey were Masters
ofehe Pore; the people favored thera ; the Nobles seemed to.make no opposition; the Senate
had no Duke; ^Andrea was sled, and had left the sield to his Eneraies; and Jannetin was
dead ; in sine, there wanted nothing but thae ehe Coune soould soewhimidt tothepeople
for receiving the Oath of Allegeance from them. ButsllTsmw's care was invain, sothat
hearing no news of him, and seeing the enterprize ruined is he did not appear, he retired in
despair unto the Gaily, to the end thac is ehe Count came, hemight secure him the Port still,
which was a matter ot extream imponance; and is the enterprize were ruined by his si'stncc,
that he might have the means to sly to Marse ill es.- This resolution was the cause of very
much mischks to ssiralomo; because the Conspirators, neither seeing the Count, w'^o \v«
their Head, nor "Baptisla Verrin, who had been always the principal Agent in the Conspi¬
racy, did not so much rely on the cond\idi of Girahmo, who being very young, and of an
haughty humor, carried things wich more irapetuolity then discretion: They followed him
for all chat out ofthe hope that the Count would appear ere it were long; but ic was not with
that considence, which makes one abandon his lite without unquietness, and obey without
repugnancy an Head whom one estecms, and of whose prudence and valor one is allured, so
that onereserves no more care then to fight and obey : but contrarily the most part began to
murmur, yea and some thought already ot seeking some occasion to withdraw, or atleastwne
to go and enquire oue the Count. On che ocherTide, che Stnace, noe knowing what resolu¬

as having served tiimbefore-times, assured him that he was dead; which having understood
with exsreara grief, he thought it sie to come unto us, and acquaint Gir^/^'w^e^ with it; tor as
for Ottobuonohe had lost him in the press. He came presently away then, to acquaint us with
this dolesul news, but having encountred, as he told us, with a great number of armed men
which issued out ofyour Palace, whereof the Gate was broken up, he stayed to learn what
che macter raight be; and thinking that he knew the voyce of EmiUa, whora they were
carry ing forcibly away, he pursued thera fighting even to the Port.   r n u u r a

she to Emilia, that which we could not comprehend, andthe true cause of thstdreadlul

had been forcibly carried away, and after soe had testified her gratitude tothe Srs«c^ Mar¬
quess tor the luccor hc would have given her, and craved pardon of the company for her inter¬
rupting Alphonso's relation, he continued his discourse in chis sort.
</p>
<p>The srsMeiE; Marquess having been a good while pursuing those which cmied you away,
it was the cause that we knew not the deplorable death of the Count.till there wanted noching
but his presence, to make an end of obtaining the Vidory : And judg,Madam, whecher there
can beany doubt ofthis verity, since the Count being dead alraoft at the beginning of the exe¬
cution, it raay be said that his name alone vanquisoed all his Enemies: And certainly is be had
lived, the business had had a quite contrary event. For my part I profess unto you, that I stiall
never bc comforted for chis deach. Had the enterprize succeeded ill; had any ofehe Con¬
spimeors becmyed him; had ehe people abandoned him; bad the Nobles resisted him; had
Jannetin vanquisoed him; I soould say ehae ehese are ordinary chings, ehae ehese are acci¬
dents, whereof there are are examples found: But Co see a mmof twoandcwcncyyearsof
age, che goodliest, the handsomest, the most courageous, the most dextrous, the fulleftof
spirit, and the most generous that ever was seen, to see him, I say, ascer he had contrived a
great design; after he hadso admirably conduded it; afterhehad deceived Andrea <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>;
abused the whole Republique; vvas come not only to the execution, but also had executed
the business; Jannetm being dead,and Andrea himselt sled away; after all these things. I say,
to imagine, that this excellenc man soould tall from ofs a plank, and be drowned not above
three or four steps from the Land in sive sood of mud, is so un upporable to me, Madara, as I
cannot endure the thought of is.
</p>
<p>But to testifie unto you, that the Count alone held the Vidory in his hands, I ara but Co
to tell you the end of this enterprize. The Srench Marquess had no sooner acquainted Gira-
lomo with the death of his brother, but the Deputies from the Senate appeared. At first,some
would have set upon thera, nevertheless this tumult being appeased, one of the Deputies ad¬
vanced, and demanded of Giralomo where the Count was, to acquainc him wich whac he
had in charge from che Senace; Giralomo surprized wich ehisderaand, answered rudely and
inconsideracely, chat he soould seek for no ocher Coune of Zrsz/&lt;i^»^ buc himself, for he was
now che Coune, and ehae Co him only ehey were Co render up ehe Palace, which he ordained
ehera to do, and ehae wich speed. The Deputies understanding &gt;y this iraprudent answer
that the Count was dead, returned back to advereise the Senate ofthe change of things by the
death of the Count. This news put thera in heart again, so thac chey instantly commanded
twelve otthe chiefest of them, chac were come to the Palace, to go and arm as many of rhe
people as they could, and joyning them with the ordinary guard,to use cheir uttermost endea¬
vor to chase the Conspirators out of the City, or utterly to defeat them: But chere was no
need of fighting to put them to shght, for they were vanquished inthedeachot ehe Coune-
which being publisoedover all, puc one and che fame resolucion inco ehe rainds of all thofa
who had taken up arms for him. And whereas the day began to break, chey desired it slnuld
no besaid, that they had been in arms against their Citizens; wherefore they began to retie
one after another to their homes: They which had taken arms in the Counts Palace left them
in ehe streees, for fear left Is cheir houses soould come co be fearched, they S have bee^

so many ocher diforders, whereof che marks were evidcnc; had been the work ot an mvisible
hand. No Enemy appeared, all che Tradcsmtn were in their shops, every man was in hij
house, and <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> was never in a greater tranquillity,at leastwise as we were told afterwards:
For as for us, as soon as we understood of the Counts death, we went diredly to his Palace
to save his dear Zso»s?r&lt;!»; <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>'s in:exe^ in Soprromamide him go thither with incredible
speed ; and though he was Jannetin's kinsraan, yet having never asseded him, and been hard¬
ly used by Andrea, his love met with no very mighty obstacle to overcome. shesrench
Marquess was carried rhither by his own generofity, and s by the desire I had to serve the
Coune in the person of Leonora Ac such time as we lesr Giralomo, he had still some Soldiers
about him, so chac beleeving him Co bt in safety enough we went eo ehe Counts Palace, fear¬
ing some violence would bc ofsered' o her; there we met with Horatio, come thither as well
as we, and ac the same instant, with a Gcnrleraan kxom Ottobuono, who after heknewot
his brothers death, rad got.en wish Bapnsla Verrin, Raphaello Sacco, snd Vincentis sal'

gether, Sophronia. who had h-ard of our repair chicher, \ett Leonora onhex bed, and Ciw
oue unco us; for she rightly imsgined, that it may be we had some disraal news to Cell, which
was ntit sit for her to know. She presently discerned by our looks the raisfortune that was
arrived unto us; but ic being no cime co lamenr, we arrested our cears and ber sighs, and de¬
claring unco her the estate of chings, we repre;enced unco her, thac we were not to suffer the
Count to be outraged in the person of Leonora ; that her loss was undoubted is soe stayed
longer in this Pahce; that the people peradventure would come and set it on sire; or it may
be the Senate would cause it to be razed co the ground; and thit in sine it was reqmliteby
shght Co avoyd outrages wor I e then death; that y»//oC/^&lt;'her eldest brother hated them all;
that ic would be glorious for her Co mike away with a brother of her husbands; and in con¬

albeit the cause of his loss, was notwithstanding to be set in a place of safety, forthegloryoc

it had already put her into such a violent despair, as ic would be impoflible co make her reioiv

you have me stay here, that Andrea may revenge himself on me, for the injury which hc be-
Ueves he hath received from you ? And having lost my mother, and seeing my self forsaken of
my brother, soall I abide here without supporc and coraforc ? I do not desire you co leave So'
phronia, buc chat you will permie me Co follow her. Hipolita spake ehis wich so much grief,
chac every one was couched wich it. And when as Horatio prayed Sophronia, that she would
oblige <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> to consent thereunto, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> imbraced his sister with a great deal of assedion, and
told her, that he was ravisoed wieh her generoficy.
</p>
<p>Hipolita having obcained her desire, and we no longer hearing any passing by, we pro¬
ceeded on in our way Cowards che Pore, where we arrived withouc any obstacle. Ottobuo-
no's Genelcman conduded us to ehe ssount's Gaily, where we were received, aiid Leonora
pue into the Captains Cabbin, being told chac the C&lt;&gt;»»t would come chicher co her. The
Mocher, when soe was ehere, asked of every one, where che Count was ? I approached to
her, and told her thac shc soould know ere iewere long. .In the mean time wc were no
sooner goe aboard, bue we propounded ehe sending co Giralomo, that he might come to save
himsds with us. Verrin wichouc barkening chereunto, coraraanded them to steer for Mar-

<p>AsforcheO««/'/ Mocher, she enered inco a rage that cannoc be represented un^o vou
the apprchensions of a Mocher having re-assumed cheir place in her soul, soe said ah that arict'

she wieh a languishing voyce, have had the consolation to be inclosed Vpith him in the smt

<p>Behold, Madam, what the deplorable fortune of the Co«»^ hath been; as forthe rest of
us, after wc had taken another Vessel ac y^/^s«^«4, and being puc again to Sea would sive
direded our course for Marseilles, our nivigstion was not nore prolpious this second time
then formerly it had been; for we were not tar from the Port, when as the tempest began
again with such sury, as during six days and six nighrs vj^ were continually in expedacion ot
being cast away. Ac length a calm having succeeded the storm, we came to discover Land ;
but we were mightily surprized, when as our Pilot assured us, thac that which we saw was
the City of Marocco. Our Vessel was so bruised, as we resolved to land there ; and this de¬
sign being executed, the King of Marocco received of with a great deal of courtesie. Now
for that which arrived unto us there, and for that which brought us to sson stantinople, I
think it will be requisite to reser the relation thereof to another time: And whereas the beau¬
tisul Hipolita and Sophronia have a greater soare in it then I, you soall, is you please^ learn the
sequclof our fortune from their raouths.
</p>
<p>It is without doubt very deplorable, said <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and I can assure you, thac I have not
selt chac raotion in my hearr, whichtheysay isso ordinary with every one, and causes us in
some sort to be comforted for our miseries, when we see others infortunate as well as our
selves; but contrarily I finde my sorrow augmented thereby. That proceeds from your ge¬
nerofity, said Sophronia unto her, but do not lament the Count so much, as not Co reserve
some sighs for my sister, whom we have lost as well as he, wich ehe grief soe cook for his
dcach. The Princess hereupon redoubled her coraplaines, which had noe sinished so soon, is

him's Palace unto his other friends; and that the Sultan intreated she would
be pleased he might come and visit her. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> not daring co resuse a sa¬

did her Coo much honor, and how soe was very glad ehae incoming Co visie her he gave her
the opporcunicy to thank him for the new obligation wherein soe stood engaged unto him.
This Slave then left the Princess, and went unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, to whora, according to the diredi¬

swaded him, that the Prmeess might be acquainted, without any great ofsence, with the pas¬

use some artifice to keep her from going so often to visit her friends. In che mean cime Isa-

her that she might do as she pleased, cl .^sirg rather to expofe his Empire to all thipp,c, then to
expofe himself to the hazard of her di plea'.ure by constraining her in any thing. ijabelLi an¬

her Co visic them for two or three days more together, because she had an extream desire to un¬

often. The Sultan, who was willing to win the heart ot Isabilta, and Co vanquso h. r rather

also, he wenc away from her sooner chen he had decermined, to give her the longer time lor the
visiting of her friends; unto whom likewise,for a greater demonstration ofhis ssvor unto her,
he sent most magnificent presents, as soon as he was returned to his Serraglio.

they had made of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, which had caused both their liberty and his. He no sooner knew
then chac shc was arrived, but he descended in all haste to go and receive her: And whereas
the change of places, misfortune, and slavery, had broughc none Co his humor, he scarcely
saw her appear before he advanced co kiss her robe; I do noc know, Madam, said he unto her,
whecher I oughc racher co give you chanks for breaking my chains here in Co-Asi.irair.ofk, or

</p>
<p>T Will not renew Sophronia's sorrow in particularizing unto you the loss of Leonora since it
I will sofsice me eo cell you, chac her end had no other cause but her assl.dion; and ehae heC
destiny was such, as dying on che raain Sea, we were constrained to give her the same Tomb,
Which the injustice of Forcune had given her illustrious husband: Buc cogee away speedily
from so lamentable an advencure, you soall undeistand, ehae we were no sooner arrived at
Marocco, buc we lost all chac che Terapest had lesc us, ehae is to say, che wrack ofehe Vessel
and our libercy. For whereas ehey knew us ae che first sighc co be Christians, hardly had we
cast anchor when as chey raade us Slaves. Indeed ic is true, thae in the beginning our servitude
waseasie enough; for as our good Fortune would have ic, theVthceis Manama, met to
King Abdalla, who raigns ac Marocco, passed accidencally along by che Pore when as we
were raaking into it; and chis Princess seeing our soip without sails, without rudder, the
tackle torn, the sail-yards broken, and every part of it almost battered in pieces, she caused
the Charet, wherein soe was, to stay, that soe might see us land, and know of what Nation
we were: for the Tempest had lesc our Vessel no raarks, whereby ie raighc be known. When
as we came near ehe Porr, whicher ehe wind, racher chen ehe skill of ehe Piloe, conduded us,
there was noe one in the Ship which goe noC up on che deck Co behold ehis Land, where we
hoped, is we did noe find a resuge, ae least wise we should escape casting away: So ehae the
Prmeess Mariama, having observed women amongst us, redoubled her curiofity and compas¬
sion rauch the raore. As soon as ever we touched Land,then soe coramanded us to be broughc
unco her, that soe her self raight know who we were, and what our fortune had been. This
order having been observed, chey led us before ehis Princess; and verily chis first encounter
was an happy presage for us, and an extreara consolation for the beaueisul Sophronia,Leonida,
and Hipolita', for ehis Princess hach so rauch raajesty and sweecness, as she caused in us boch
a greac deal of resped, and a greac deal of hope. And whereas soe had noced by our apparel
thae we were of i^/;, and noe understanding chac Tongue, soe would not stand Co send for
an Incerpreeer, buc choughc that some ofus peradvencurc could speak i'j?^»iy^, which she un¬
derstood persedly, and is comraon enough chroughouc all ehe Kingdoms of Sez., Tunis, and
Marocco, by reason ot ehe neighborhood of Spain wich ehis pare ot Asrica, and of che Wars
and Commerce, which in former eimes they have had one with anocher, especially before
the Kings ot Granado, who were originally Moots, were subdued by Serdinando and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>,
And cruly soe was noc deceived in her conjedure, ibr chere was noc any of us hue spake ie well,
or ae leastwise could make our selves be understood in ic.
</p>
<p>When as rhis Princess saw ehae her design had succeeded, soe cestisied as much joy for ie as
we did ; and having demanded of us whicher we were going, of whence we were, and in
whae place we had been caken with ehe Tempest ? we colsl her all chings as ehey had past,
wichouc acquaineing her nevercheless wich ehe occasion chac had caused us Co pare from Ge^
noua, and wichout celling her our names, and salling ae her seec we besoughc her Co proced
us; sot by ehe resped which was rendred Co her,and by her crain, we believed soe was Queen
of Marocco. This excellent Princess raade us rise up wieh a greac deal of courcesie; and be¬
ing couched wich che charms of chofe whom we conduded, she cook an assedion Co us, and
resolved eo serve us as ranch as soe could. Bue whereas she was willing to observe in all
things the resped which soe owed to the King her brother, soe took up Sophronia, Leonida,
and my sister, into the Charet to her, and comraanding us to follow her, she willed some of
che Guard that attended upon her, to lend us their horses. We went in this manner to Ab-
dalla's Pihce, whom we found alone with his Favorite, aWed AU-Ben Ducar, a man ofa
great spirit, but cruel and ambicious. As soon as Mariama appeared, and that the King
saw her followed by so many unknown persons, and chiefly of three fair women sis my sister
can suffer me to put her in that number) he was so surprized therewith, thac advancing pre¬
sendy towards her, he said to her in her language, sas Mariama recounted unto us after¬
wards,) What adventure is befallen you? from what War are you come? what Conquest
have you made? and by what good hap have you met with sofair a Troop? The Princess
Murtama, who had so much goodness, as that soe would not be sofpeded of us said unto

being your Slaves; Liberty cannot be so happy to them as this servitude, and youwill^
cruel to them in using them ocherwise. Alj hach reason, replyed che King in his hnguaee and
to concenc you and chem co, I permit you eo cake care of chem, and to proted them • and I do
withall conjure you to retain them in your service. You know thac all eheChristiiifareour
Enemies, so chac to set them ac libercy, when we have them in our hands, were to violate
our Religion, and Co insringe our laws, wherefore accepc of chese fair strangers tor yout
Slaves: Buc whereas their beauty deserves a gentler usage then others, give them no other
said he smilmg, but cords of silk to reeain ehera. My Lord, answered Mariama, the greatest
of all good things is Liberty, and by consequence the greatest of all evils is servitude; thera
ar? no chains thac are not heavy, and ehe less chey be, the raore do chey straicen him that wc»«
them; In sine, my Lord, cither chey do load him, or chey do wring him, and both the one and

had ac first opposed our deliverance wich speeches of gallantry. Bnc ac lengch, seeing her pet"
sist too much in her demand, he by an artisicial discourse ccdoured the maecer with the pub¬

unco you a part of Mariama's, and acquaint you in whae estace the Coure of Marocco ^a
at thac cime. I will noc stand for all ehae to tell you by what Areisices, ewo Xerises, chat is
to say amongst them, two holy men, and descended of the race of their Prophet Mahomet,
invaded the two Kingdoms of Marocco ind Taradant; buc I will only cell you, ehae these
two Xerisses, though chey were brocbers, could noc concenc chemselves wieh the partition
they had made of their Conquests; and after many breaches of promise on either side, they
came at last to Arms. Whil'st they were in good cerms cogecher, Hamet, who was the
eldest, and co whom che Kingdom of Marocco was fallen for his soire, had married ^"'j'^*
ma, daughcer to Mahomet his broeher, King of Sus or Taradant, co Muley Ztdan, the cldctt
ofhis sons; so that when the War began between ehese cwo brothers, the fair andvcrtuow
Mariama found her self on the party of her fathers enemy; and whatsoever soe could do, it
was impofstblc for her to make them change their resolution. Seeing then that her prayers^*
tears, and perswasions were all to no purpose with her father-in-law H^wss, and that/w*-
ley Zidan, her husband, told her, how he could not but follow him in this War, who had
given him birth; chac he was noc an enemy co Mahomet, buc only an obedient son; that i
was noc for children to ask who were the enemies of chofe co whom they owed their lives,
but only to hazard them against whomsoever they were, for the conservation of the lives i
them, who had given them theirs. This wise Princesii seeing. I say, things in this eltate, aoou

in the Kings of Marocco, and Taradant, had each in their turn had che better and the worse,
the chance of war being fallen in the end on Hamet, soe saw Muley Zidan her Husband re¬
turn almost alone of all his whole Army, which had been ucterly deseaccd, and acquainc her
with cears in his eyes, thac his Saeher, and a Broeher which hehad, tamed Muley Buacan^
were prisoners in che hands of Mahomet. This vercuous Princess hearing chis news, had ge¬
nerofity enough co weep for che vidories of her Sacher; and when a$ she Ciw that her Hus-
band, ascer hehad assembled cogecher all che ^//^sww. Cavaliers, and Captains thac were in
Marocco Co advise on thac which raighc be done, found ouc no expedient which could be
commodious for hiro, she presenced her self unco the Councel, and demanded the permishon
to go and cast her self ae che seec of Mahomet her Saeher, Co endevor the esseding ofa peace;
or to ofser her sell^, and chree children she had, for che ransom of Hamet; or Co obtain at
kast thac she mighc s»ve him during his capcivicy, is her tears could not move her Sa¬
thers heart.

<p>So generous a propoficion was approved of by the whole Assembly j and Muley Zidan
went himself to condud his wise and his children forth of the Gates ot the City ; yet was he
in some trouble to part with her, out ofthe fear he was in, left Mahomet, knowing how ar¬
dently soe was beloved of him, soould retain her without rendering up his Father, and wich¬
ouc barkening Co peace. Bue she assured bim, chac when as she could no longer be nsesul to
her Saehcr-in-law, noching buc dcach alone should keep her from recurning back to him again.
The voyage of this sage Princess was not sruielessj and albeic chat her Father was one ofthe
greatesi Politicians in the World, and oneof the most ambitious Princes on the Earth, yet
her Reasons, her Tears, and het Prayers drew him eo grant her the liberty of Hamet md

so; for whereas chis man was very great in rich?s, most miglity in friends, of an extraordi¬
nary courage, having a great deal of prudence and wit, and rauch raore ambition, there
would havebeensolly,andnolitdehazardjsi9rwhorasoever would have enterprized to dis¬

<p>Abdalla, though grieved with chac which ys/y had done, yec named ic an excess of zeal
and assedion, racher then inhumanicy ; and continuing him in his Commands, committed
unto him almost tbe whole sway of his Kingdoms. But in some sort to repair this cruelty,
he took care to dry up che tears of the ^i\nttss\ Mariama, inforced her co return tothe

thac Aly was not altogether cidpal^le of the Seacn of Hamet and her children, and would ex¬

and hope -iven us that in time we might obtain our liberty'. This resolucion taken, all ou
Soldiers and Mariners were thenextday committed to sasecustody without any ofher ill
usage ofsered unto them; and forus, they contented themselves with leaving us under the
guard they had formerly ashgned us, with this disserence nevertheless, thac we were separated
stom Sophronia, Leonida,ind Hipolita; for il ms Abdalla's absolute pleasure, that they
soould abide in the service of the Psincess Mariama, and that they soould lie in her lodgings;
but with this grace forus, that wc soould be permitted Co go somecimes and see eheni, or
they CO come and visie us. This extraordinary favor having been granted to us, against the
custora of the Country, by the goodness of Manama, whora these new Slaves always found
ready to render them all kinde of good ofsices. It is certain that this separation was grievous
unto us, and seeing ihe terras wherein we stood,we were almost forry that we had not sussted
soipwrack, at least-wise me-thought I observed such like apprehensions in the raindes of Ho-
ratioi^d <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>: But as for the Marquis, it is to be spoken for his glory, that never man
was so soon corasorted as he, and I was not a little surprized, co hear him say laughing, a quar¬
ter of an hour after we were returned from conduding thepersons, who were so deer unto
us, tothe Viincess Mariama's lodgings, chac the ^snV^wi Love could cell how to use his

Mariama, who Was called Lela Mahabit, onely with seeing her at a window.

<p>These new Slaves were no sooner come Co ehe Princess Mariama's lodgings, buC Abdalla,
who visiccd chem very often, repaired chicher, accompanyed wich Aly. And whereas he
found her wich them, and that therefore they would out of resped have withdrawn, he would
nor permie it, telling them thac che name of Slave, which he had impofed upon them, was
racher an artifice to retain them about the Princess his sister, then a design to keep them in ser¬
vitude. This complement was seconded by another which Aly used Co chem, and with a sin¬
cere protestation made to thera by Mariama for the treating ofthcra as her sisters, rather then
as her Slaves. This second view yet raore augmented the love, which the King of Marocco
and Aly already bore to Hipolita; and whereas Aly was cunning and dexerous, and had out
of a sense of ambition for a long eime before caken greac care co observe all Abdalla's raoti-
ons, he quickly perceived that thebeiuty of Hipolita had Couched his hearC, and chat his
Master was his Rival. And whereas he knew very well chac Love, no raore chen Royalty, en¬
dures not any corapanion, heresolved to conceal from theKing the design which hehad in
his head. It was not long, before his suspicions were fully cleared; for Abdalla being become
passionately in love, and fearing left is he soould ia\k too often with Hipolita, his sister, to
whora he carryed a great resped, would come to know his intentions, he opened his heare
wholly to J/j, discovered his patlion unCo him, conjured him eo finde ouc the means to ac¬
quaint her with it, who had caused it. Aly, as wc understood afterwards testified a great
deal of joy unto him, for that he being fallen in love, as he said,"^wi'ch one cs those Slaves, he
had been so happy as no: to prove his Rival. The King demanded of him chen, whecher it
were so chac he loved any of chem ? and ehe other answered him wich a salse considence, chac
iW^ had couched his heare. Thac which obliged him eo ehis lye, was his belies, ehae by
chis mean the King would never be jealous of him, nor would fear his salling in love with hI
p^ita, beiniT perswaded that his assedion was engaged otherwhere; and indeed thematcer
Ml oue as he imagined. TheKing gave him the condud of his Love, as well as chat of his
Eltaces; commanded him always to follow him whensoever he went to che Princess Maria,

so the liberty eo see and speak wich our sisters, or co say better,our Mistresses • for in these o'
casions, love always prevailed over friendship.           ^'
</p>
<p>/«A«s, the greatest of our unquietnesses was, that we could not foresee the end of our
prelent selicities, nor divine wherefore they treated us so favorably, and yet would not d liver
us.  Howbeit we were no: long w'  Jut discovcring it, for the King's and Ah's love still
augmenting, whereas gallantry seems to be natural to all the Moors, they were wilhne to re
store Hipolita to her former joy,bcfore they would speak to her of their paGion. For notwith-
stsnding all the caresses which these fair maids received from the Princess Mariama, and the
ast.dion which they carryed to her, yet melancholy appeared still in all their discourses, and
in all their adions: So that to delight them, there were nothing bu: publique tcalss, turneys
balls, and rejoycings.  But in all these encounters Aly so carryed the matter, as all th: parties'
whereof he was the Head, were, both braver, and more magnificent, then that of others'
wichout the Kings ever suspeding any thing of his true intent, because his rainde was pre¬
pofsest wich the opinion, that it was Leonida he was in love withall, and not Hipolita. And
lurely he should have been very melancholique, that could not have taken pleasure in these as.
semblies, it being certain, that nothing is seen which is more agreeable even in Surope, espe¬
cially for dancing.  For whereas, since the desolation of Granada, many persons ot quality
retired to Sez., Tunis, and Marocco, though the remembrance of their misfortunes ought
to have made cliem renounce all manner of delights, yet their desire to please AbdalU w/io
proteded chem, caused them to be present ac all these seasts.  And truly I do not marvel, is
the Spaniards in conquering cheir Kingdom, though they be conquerors sevcre enough, have
noc forborn raking some of cheir gallantries, chiefly that dance, called Farabanda: But it
must be acknowledged that they are but bad imitators ot chem, no raore chen we, who have
taken ic from theSpanyards; it being most certain that they dance it in a manner wherein there
is so much arc and grace, as we come nothing neer it.  And whereas out ofa panicubr favor
we were present at all these seasts, I remeraber one amongst th:irest, wherein the Maiquis
made an end of lofing his liberty by a Farabanda, which the Princess Lela MahaVit danced.
For whereas all the seatures ot tier sac^ were exctll-nr, her eyes sparkling and passionate, her
shape advantagi¬ous and comely, her carriage sree and ma)cssical, although the colour other
skin was not very agreeable, yet her whole person togenher appeared insinitely pleasing in this
Assembly, where she danced a J'^scd/'^^^/^ with a negligcnc so full of charms, with so grace¬
sul a dispofition, and so gallant and amorous an ayr, asthcMirquis wasinaminde sokmnly
to renounce his ordinary humor, and become constant tor this Princess.
</p>
<p>And Co eestisie unto you, how greac an impresilion she raade in his heare, I only can tell yoii,
chac in four days the Marquess, who was desirous to transtorra himself into the person beloved
as much a&lt;: pofsibly he could, learned this dance so miraculously, that having demanded per-
niisiiion of Aly to intermingle himself araongst a Troop ofGranadins, who were to dance dis¬
guised in one ofthese Assemblies, he charmed all the company in such sort, as che Prmeess Ld*
Mahabid, who was an equitable Judg of such like things, would needs knowwhohev;as:
But she was much amazed, when as sti? perceived that he was not a Granadin, but one of the
favorite Slaves, for so we were called ; Sophronia, Lcoivli, and/:///&gt;o//V.e were no Ic's then
she, to see chac they had admired him without knowing hiro, never dreaming it should be n-^,
though chey discerned him not amongst us.  In the mean time this adventure wasnotdis-
pleasing to her, for ascer thac, there pist not an Aslembly sand there was one almollevery
day) wherein he spake not to her, wherein he danced noc besoiehrr, and wherein with his
adress, and accustomed considence, he gave her noc s kw mark of his assedion, vet without
pasi^ng chofe bounds of resped which he owed to her.  Buc whenas all chese Seasts were
made upon design, the King solicited Aly to speak to HipoUta ofhis lovc, which he did loon
after, but in such a manner, as seemed at first fight insinitely to oblige my silter; hor after»
reasonable long discourse he besought her to coi.sider what beowedcocheKnghuN'  _.

<p>Inhne, after a pieparation long enough, and when as he believed that he had given suth¬
cient good imp &gt;eshonsot his vertue toHipolita, he told her that her beauty had touched che
heare of^ylbdalla, and ehae he had comraanded him to acquaint her with his love; but, said
he unto her with a seeming sincerity, whereas you can never bc but his Slave, Heaven shield
me trom contributing ought to so bad a design ; contrarily, I will do my uccerraoft co hinder
such a misforcune; and chac you raaysomishme wich means to serve you, make known to
theKing, added he, is he happens to speak with you, that I have acquitted my selt of the
commishon which he gave me ; in the mean time assure your self that there is not any chrng
which I will not undertake for your service*
</p>
<p>Hipolita was strangely surprized with this discourse, for coming to consider all Abdalla's
liberahtics, and rhe manner wherein he had lived with her for a good while before, soe made
no question but that Aly's discoutse was true. Nevertheless, whereas she is natu;ally suspi¬
cious and mistrustlul, soe doubted of v^/j^'s sincerity in som^ things; howbeie soe answered
civilly enough coche ofsers he had made her; bnc forso rauch as regarded ehe Kings love, she
spake CO him wich so much sirmness, as hc seemed co be very blank at it. It was not because
he desired soe soould accepc of Abdalla's love, bue seeing in whac raanner soe resu'e^d ehe
Kings assedion, he feared left when he soould come Co discover his own, he should be worse
increaeed. And whereas H&lt;/&gt;o/sM perceived his unquietness; for whae reason, said soe unto
him.arc you asshded eo see me resolved eo oppose my self wieh all my power against, an assedi¬
on which you seera noe co approve of? Ic is, answered Aly, wich as rauch cunmng as malice,
because knowing by your discourse, how much chac which I have used eo you hach croubled
your mind, I cannoc chuse buc grieve for thac the King hath pick'd out Co persecute you, tha
only man in ehe world chac honors you raoft: Bue believe, sixx Hipolita, concinued he, chat
this unjust love couches me as rauch as you, and chac ehere is noC any ching which I will not
do Co deliver you trom ic. After this Aly quicced her, and lesc her in such an unquiecness, as
tbe like was scarcely ever heard of. Noc only the Kings assedion asshded her; not only tbe
sadnessjwhich soe had observed in tAlss face, troubled her; not only the incertainty wherein
soe was,whether soe soould discover Abdalla's love to the Princess Mariama, disquieted her;
buc ao odd and aicogecher extraordinary jealousie pue her mind upon the rack. She did not
complain of Horatio's looking on any odier person ; soe did noc accuse him of infidelity, but
soe was jealous because he was noc jealous: For when as Aly calked co her, soe had marked
how Horatio's eyes were still sixed on her, and albeic he had seen chac man encertain her along
time, yec had he not appeared the raore unquiet for it. And as it is the custora ot pashonate
persons to aggravate things, according to the apprehensions which they have, so Hipolita had
the injustice CO believe, chat her Lover must needs perceive the Kings love, which she her self
had not known. Ishe loved me ardently, said soe sfor soe declared it unto us afterwards) the
fear of lofing me would have raadc him fear all things; he would have taken notice of the
Kings civihcics; his liberalities would have been suspeded unro him; I soould have seen some
unquietness in his eyes, when as Alj talked so earnestly to me: tnsine, concluded she in htr
heart, either he loves me not, or he loves me but a httle; and is he loves me but a lictle, he
loves me not at all, since lovc never endures any mediocrity.
</p>
<p>Whil'st soe reasoned in this manner, Alj, who desired to perswade the King chat he wai
inlovewithZ,s.W^ took great care that notice mightbe tiken how she was pleasing to
him. And whexe^s Alphonso hath not by nature so quiet a mind as Horatio, he seemed to us
almof^ as mucb troubled as HtpoUta, though it were .n a disserent manner. He was not jea-
\mso\ Leonida, buthe was vext to think that ^/; was amorous of her. Hedid notfearthat
soe would be unfaithsul to him, buc hc was angry that anocher was pashonate for her; ic
being his humor, as I conceive thatthe person vvhom he loves stiould never see any but hm,
nor soould be seen of any but him. As for me, that am of a contrary mind; thac would have

of impatience toknow what answer Hipolita had given to Ah; this s IsrConsiC, '
sorty for having encountred with so much sirmness in my sisters mind ^ ^ Jl„° olii '7
</p>
<p>which ^/jr seemed co bear her; ^//,/,.«/. netted with having a Rival, though h w^n "
^tT^a^ ;t to us; the Marquess exceedingly contented with h'avinga M l^ ^
Mahabtdwe\^ satished with the Marquess his gallantry; Horatio with a mind ind.C
enough for all that had past; and I sofsiciently contented in our misfortune, and em
with a secrec sense of loy, co see chat che beauty of Sophronia was so persed, as soe made her
selt be adored of all Nations.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, ehe Princess y^^r/^w*, who hath a quick and piercing wit perceived
all che divers interests of this Assembly: and though soecould noc discover them persedly
yet knew shc thac che King was in some pashon; chat zAly was not exempted from it • that
Abdelcader her broiher did not hue Sophronia; and thn Lela Mahabid was too civl to¬
wards a Slave. This wise Princess resolved for all rhsr,noc to n ake any soew ofall chese things
Till she was more cercain of chem; bue it was not long before she was cleared therein. For
my sister being retired with her companions, and having acquainted them with Alss dis¬
course, they resolved Co advertise the Princess/J/&lt;«r;.sOT^ of ir, and absolutely to conside in
her vertue.  Sophronia was notwithstanding of the opinion,to ask counsel of us first ; to thst
the next morning, according to the permishon chey had for it, thty senc for us.  And wsien
as Sophronia had propounded che maccer unco us, and chac I began already Co give my advice.
Let Horatio speak first, said /^«/»o/«&gt;&lt;« unto me,with precipitation enough; for is to give good
counsel one hath need of a quiet mind, it may well be said that he is^in such an estate ashe
oughc CO be, to counsel us as we should be.  Were it true, replyed Horatio mightily surpri¬
zed, thac I had a quiec mind, che manner wherewiehall you have spoken is enough to trouble
it in such sort, as to render me incapable of counselling others.  Since your resl is so dear un¬
to you, answered she, as you even seek a pretext not to assist asshded persons with your ad¬
vice, leave us at leastwise to think of whae we have to do.  Horatio seeing her to bitter,
■would no: answer her out of prudence and resped, for fear left her santastical humor Ihoald
appear too visibly unco us.  As for me, who co.mprehended noching in chis discoud', i said
unco my sister half laughing, chac I believed che King of Marocco^s love had pofltH d her
wieh pride, racher chen wich melancholy, is she concinued speaking in chac sasoion. But in
theend we resolved, thae these four Slaves should absolucely conside in che Princ.ss yl/«''w-
ma, for fear left isthey should noc advereise her ofthe truth of thematter, soe might hive
cause to chink, should she discover ic some other way, that it was noc displeasin:^ to chem,
sincc chey made a mystery of ic.  We conceived chic from her alone ehey were eo his s'c
their protedion, and their liberty, and consequently that itwas requisite they soould make
all their vertue known to this Princess; who out of sympathy and conformity, would without
doubt be always carried Co scrve ehera.
</p>
<p>Ascer we had a long cime reasoned of all these chings; after thac Sophronia had acquainted
us with her new Conquest, and Leonida with that which soe thoughc soe had made; alter, I
say, we had spoken of all ehis in general, Horatio, who desired to know what he was ac¬
cused of, separated Hipolita dextrously from us, and having led her to a window, where sbe
leaned, he conjured her to tell him what had obliged her ro speak wich so much bicterntsj
untohim, s at leastwise he related it so unto us,) I know full well, said he unto her, thatl
am not faulty; but I do not know ofwhat crime I im accused : Be so good unto me then as
to acquaint me with ie, that I may justisie my selt; but isyou will have me speak like anot-
sendor, although I be none, let me know what saulcl have committed, to the end Imay le-
pcnt me of ic, and amend it. You may peradventure do the former, answered so", but it is
impoflible for you to do the other. J have a long time known, that thcreuouldbetoinc
injustice in accusing you of an insensibili:y, which you cannot chuse but have.; ^'O'^^''^'^
cannot also chuse but complain of my hard formne, iw having a mind so lenhb.c ^^'^^^ ^^^

<p>that is so little himself. The more you complain, said Horatio unto her, the less do I compre¬
hend of what saulc I am accused; for to say that the beautisol Hipolita does noc couch my heart
sensibly,and ehae soe alone makes noC up my selicicy,is a ching wichouc all likelyhood. You have
reason.said soe unco him wieh a biccer lm'\e',HipoUta can do someehing upon your selicicy, but
she can do noching upon your raisfortune :She can fomecimes with a favorable look,or wieh her
discourses, give you happy momencs, buc she can never wich her coldness, or che love chac she
soews tooehers,begee any sadness in you: verily, concinued soe, you are the happiest Lover
thac ever was; noching displeases you, noching raolefts you; neicher fear nor jealoulie trouble
you • you hope withouc unquiecness; you desire withouc irapacience, and of all Che choughcs
which Love inspires, you know none wichouc doubc, bue chofe chac lead Co joy. You m-
Cirprec all chings, as you say, eo ehe advancage of ehe person beloved; bue Co speak ™ore rea¬
sonably, ic is CO ehe disadvancage of your love: For whofoever loves cruly,can never hold him¬
selfso assured of ehe person whora he loves, bue chac fear will be stronger in him chen hope;
now for your pare, you hope all chings, and fear noching.  Ic is cercain. said Horatio unto
her, ehae you ofcencimes reduce me co an estace of fearing noching, and of having recourse
unco hope to comfort me.  For in sine, whereas the greatest of misfortunes is Co see you m
choller, I behold my selt so raany times expofed thereunto, that Ihave nothing else to tear.
No, no, said s/ip&lt;?/&gt;r^ unto him, you are yet more ingenuous then so; my very choller gives
you joy; yon regard it as a mark of my assedion; and chus making profic ofall chings, you
are never unhappy.  Mighe it please Heaven, said he nnco her, chie you spake crue I Con¬
sess CO me, added soe incerrupting him, ehae is I had said noching co you of ehe long conver¬
sacion which I had yesterday wieh ^s7, whecher you would have suspeded any ching of ic.
Any ocher bue you would have been croubled at it, continued soc,and whereas love renders the
mind clear-fightcd,you would have imagined fomething of the truth. But as for you,doubtles$
you believed thathe entertained me with che Governmenc ofcheKing of yWrsrocco's State;
thac policy was ehe objed of our conversacion, whil'st you could in ehe mean cime look
wichouc unquiecness upon the Princess Lela Mahabid, becausis soe danced with a good grace.
Are these, rigorous Hipolita, said Horatio unto her, all the crimes which I have committed ?
Have I done nothing buc see you talking with y^/y, wichouc divining what he said unco you,
and wichouc asssiding my self ae ie? No, answered soe, you have done noching else; buc
this indisserency, or to say better, this insensibility, and this stupid lovc so vexes me, as in
the state whereunto ic hath reduced my mind for a long eime Cogecher, I had racher see yon
despcracely in love wich another,ehen eo see you so quiec: for eieher che spighe ofyour change
Would see me ae rest;or is I hid noe resolucion enough for ehac,I soould say in slaecering my sels,
he will corac ouc of his error, he will repene him ofhis inconstancy,ind sincc he can cell how to
love,he raay be capable of recurning and repeneing, and of having as much assedion for me, as
he bach for anocher.Buc in ehe case wherin I see you ac ehis presene,you wil be always insensible
and always happy,and I always unforcunaee.Thac cannoc bc,answered Horatio,my destiny and
yours arc noe separated so easily But,amiableHi/&gt;o/jr&lt;»,why wil you noC have me live innocentlyj
why will you have me render my self faulty, in suspeding you araiss ? Why will you have me
make my self unhappy voluntarily,and abandoning Reason.forra monslers Co my self co combat
withall ? and why will you not on the contrary have me conside in your vercne,rely on your si¬
delity, and without rendring me infortunate, suffer me to be in seme rest ? Would you kno Wj
said Hipolita unto him, why I will not have it so, it is because I do not seek in you for a Wise-
man, anda Philofopher, but for a Lover.  Love hath a Reason, which is Wholly parcicular
unto it; reasonable persons, who are couched wieh ehis passion, never abandon Vercue soe
ic, buc wiehall ehey do noe follow ehae severe Reason, which will have one receive wich an
equal ceraper, both good and bad forcune.  Love oughc eo be stronger chen Reason; ic doCh
noe destroy ir, bue ic eroubles ic.  I bluso, Horatio, ae ehae which I say, and ac che grief I
am in, for that isl ara to know these things, it hath noc been racher by your adions, chen
by mine own experience, that I have understood Chera.  You oughc co have taught me, that
love IS suspicious, irapatient.urquiet, and curious; chac ie wisocs for chac which it hach not j
ehjcicfearech Co lose ehae which ic pofsessech; you oughc eo have learUCme, that none ofehe
adions ot ehe person beloved can be indisserenc; chac she alone oughc to bc mote considerable
then all ehe world besides; and chac ehe only desire to please hei^ and che fear to ofsend her
soould make a Lover ad. By this reason, answered Horatio, I stiould not dare to accuse you'

bue a m.rk of esteem, and noc a mark oflove: And cell me, I pray you, by whac way ore
tend you to eestisie yours unco me. In proccsting to you, answered Horatio, that you are
all my felicity ; m absolutely remitting unto you ehe condud of my fortune; and in aslurine
you thac I would lose my life with joy for your service. One may do all these things out of
est em, and out of generofity, replyed she, bue one can never be jealous wichouc love- all
other passions may receive interpretaeions, bue chis same leaves no room co doubt of the
csuse of it; and jeasousie is cbe only assured mark of this passion. Is I could cease from
cl&gt;s em:ng of you, replyed Horatio, I soould be jealous, I soould be unquiet. Say, answered
she lilting up h r voycc, and quitting him, that is you could cease from being insensible, you
stiould be a Lover. She spake this so loud, as Sophronia, Leonida, the Marquess, Alshmso,'
and I, heard h^r, and we judged thac chere was some lietle diforder beeween them, elpecially
when I sa w a Carnation colour on my sisters cheeks,which used rot to be there, and a certain
constrained and artisicial smile, which anger always produceth in her face. Sophronia will¬
ing CO pi iy ; he good sister in this occasion would needs know their dispute; and when ai He-
ratio had r counted it unto her, notwithstanding H»)&gt;o/&lt;s &lt;i's resistance to che contrary, we
made their peace, after they had on either part said all chac their wit and passitm could stirnih
them with.
</p>
<p>thereupon we retired to our lodging, andthese three fair Slaves to che Princess y^^ori*-
ma's; where ascer che first civiheies they besoughc her to give thera a particuUr audience.
Mariama, having granted them their dmsnd, comminded her women to leave her ate;
which was no sooner done, bxxi the siix Sofhr on! a, who had in charge to speak in the nattie
ofall the three, requested her to remember the promise she had raade to proted them; and
then siiie related unto her the discourse which ..^Z;'had used to Hipolita ind Leomda-Mt
noc able to obtain so much considence from her modesty, as to tell her wiehall, that Abdelca.
der hid testified a great deal of assedion eo her, my sister acquainced ehe Princess with the
conquest char Sophronia had raade.  Mariama being very much sacished with cheir si'eedom
and cheir vertue, redoubled ehe care and good-will which soe had for chem; and to shew
thac she puc as much considence in eh.ir discrecion, as ehey done in hers.- and colec them see
also, how much interest she had to oppose all the bad designs of Aly, she recounted all his
adventures unco chem, namely, all ehae I imparced coyou at the beginning of this History;
And thereupon assured them, that whatsoever came from a spirit so arcisicial as Alsi, was
ever to be suspeded.  She cold chera moreover, chac whereas he did always work with tun¬
ing, he wis always Co be dele wieh in the same manner: that to that essed, greac care was to
betaken toke^ bim from discovcring, that they had acquainted her either with the Kings
love, or his; thac ic was likewise requisite, that Hipolita soould seem to place some consi¬
dence inchae salse generoficy, whichhe had seigned eohave in speaking to her of ehe Kmgs
love.  ^ox,skid Mariama mto them, I Sanow Aly, he wonld never have dele in chat sort
wich Hipolita, had noC some pashon, more powersul chen his rashce, carryed him thereunto.
Hitherto he hath never contraried the King in any tl ing; hitherco he hath asseded a blind obe¬
dience to all his will, and an exterior fidelity, which hath not permitted me as yet to revenge
the miss hiess he hath done me.  Nevertheless I see fomething in his hearr, since the time that I
have obtained of my k\s to speak wieh him oftner chen I uled to do, which puts me in hope
that I stiall finde ch^ means for ic.  In sine, brlie ve ic, said soe co HipoUta, chac Aly hach not
declared ehe Kingslove unco you, and promised eo proted you against him, wichout some le¬
crec reason chac induces him chereunto, and wichout some particular interest. But tor disco¬
vcry, we must dissemble as well as he, and not speak so severely of the love which he laitu
the King bears you, thac wc may see whae he wiU be ac.  Leomda, for her pare, mult enae-

touching the King, I know that he hath some resped to my person, and doth carefully ende¬
vor to make me forget the cruelties which ^/^ hath done, under the pretext of assuring the
Crown unto him. And grant also that the wickedness of ehis man should prove courageous
to che King, be assured ehae I will never abandon you, and will hazard all chings Co keep you
from having any violence ofsered unco you.
</p>
<p>Thcsc fair Slaves gave her chanks for a discourse chac was so advantageous unto chem; Com¬
mended her vercue and her generoficy; lamenced ehe misforeunes chat had arrived unco her;
detested ehe cruelcy of Aly •• and raaking an exchange of cheir own sorrows, ie mighc have
been said thzt Mariama selc cheir miseries raore chen her own; and chac ehese fair Slaves,
who were no less generous, nor less sensible chen she, had as much sense of her past fortunes,
as of cheir presenc raisoaps.

<p>Aseer ehae so sad a conversacion had lasted some cime, and ehae ouc of ehe compsssion,
which chey had one of anocher, ehey had in some fore micigaeed their griefs, the Princess
Mariama cold chem smiling, how ic would noe be just, chac whil'st she was chinking of
their procedion, one of cheir Troop soould undercake co revenge Hipolita of che Kings love,
wieh anocher love; desiring thera eo advereise the Slave, which danced withso good a grace,
that the Princess Lela A/ahabid was her sister; because soe believed, char eieher he knew not
so much, or that he had forgotten it. Sophronia perceiving by Mariama's speech, thae she
meane ehe Marquis; and that soe also had taken notice of his inclination to the Princess Lela
Mahabid, choughc ic was best eo acquainc her wieh his humor, Co ehe end she mighc noC be
ofsended is hc concinued che gallantry he had begun. Sophronia then drew the Marquis his
picture so agreeably, and so advantageously for him, as the Princess told her that she was
very glad of the conquest her sister had made, and Aat she might in some sort share with het
therein, it was sit soe soould raore particularly know so extraordinary a raan: and so, tha
Princess Mariama, and Sophroni&lt;t,becime his Considents, without having any purpose to be
so, and procured him che pleasure to see the Princess Lela Mahabid alraoft every day at the
Princess Mariama's lodging. The sitst eime he was chere, I remeraber chac we broughc him
thither with forlie kinde of repugnancy; for he had understood from Sophronia her self^ in
whae manner soe had spoken of him. Ic is noe, said he unco us, because I ara angry that
Sophronia hath spoken che eruch; buc ie is because I do noe seel my self in a dispofieionco
make le appear by experience, thac I am as inconstant as soe hath described me: it being
very certain, that I ara perswaded I cannot love any chink here but che Princess Lela
Mahabid.

aMaehematician: Love made me learn languages; by him I grew many times doqulV

to this noble passion.                 "'utotea
</p>
<p>I profess, said the Princess Mariama, chac this is the sinest way of commending ones scls
that ever was heard of. Buc, said she to the Marquis, how comes it to pass, that in so little
time as you have been here, you have so persedly aceained co chat, which the Granadm who
are our mafters in gallantry, are so long a learning } for, as you say your self, there are things
which you understand but supersicially, because your love to those that asseded them was
noc long enough. Ic is, Madam, answered he, because I have ac this picsenc a greater desire
to please, then ever I had in all my life.
</p>
<p>She thae hach given you ehis desire, said ehe Princess Lela Mahabid unco him, soould have
a greac deal of merie, or should be very much obliged to you. She hath somany excellenc
qualicies, replyed the Marquis, as I may say, chac in ehis illustrious person I love all those
whoinl have loved in all my life-eime: it being most certain, that I have never admired any
thing in all the others, whom I have served, which I do noc finde yec more eminently in het
whom now I adore. She is wonderfully fair; she hach a spirie as full of brightness, as het
eyes are of light; and chere is seen in her whole person, a charm so powersul and so extraor¬
dinary, chac ie is impoflible Co conserve so much reason, as to remeraber chac one ought not
to have any other chen veneracion for her; one raust of necesllicy give place Co love; soecm-
noc inspire ocher choughcs; and noc working like ordinary beiucits, which makes one pjss
from admimeion to esteem, and from esteem co love, soe renders her stls ac the first instane
absolute Mistress of all cheir souls chac behold her. One cannoc have indisserenc thoughts for
ber; one must, eieher noc see her, or adore her: and from ehe very first momene that I behtld
her, I had all ac once both adrairation, esteem, and love. I was no longer mine own, I was
absolutely hers; and chough I know full well chac I ara unworehy of chis honor, yec can I
noc imagine chac I amsaulcy. Ic seems Co me also sac least-wise I slaccer my self wich thisopi-
nion) chac by a parcicular priviledg, and Co render her conquests the raore illusirious, she pu¬
risies all the hearts which she enslames; thac she dartssorttia bearaof that divinity which I
adore in her, and cherewich illnminaees chem ehae come neer her; thac in raaking her vertues
known, she comraunicaces a pare of them j and chac one is no sooner her Slave, buc he is
worchy to command ochers.
</p>
<p>The Princess Lela Mahabid, not able to forbear from blusoing ac ehe Marquis his dis¬
course, would ae leastwise make a gallancry of ie. I leave you Co judg, said soe unto him,how
much you would make your Mistresses modesty Co suffer, is soe were here, sined could not
chuse but change colour ac chis excessive praise, chough I have no part in ie. I fear. Madam,
replyed he, thac in chis occasion you cake one vertue for another; and that this change, which
hath appeared in your face, bc noc racher an essed of your greac heart, then of your modesty,
seeing ic may be you cake ic noc well, ehae a Slave should lose ehe resped which he ows you,
so far, as co dare to entercain you wich his pasllion. You speak so agreeably hereof, said the
Princess Mariama incerrupting him, chae is my sister will be perswaded by me, soe soall al¬
ways be your Consident. I am not inconsidcmee enough for ehae, answered che Marquis; and
the thoughts of resped and adoration which I have for her, will not permit me to commit
this fault.                     .,
</p>
<p>Sophronia, seeing that hereupon there was a great silence amongst the company, whicti
might trouble the Marquis, said to him wieh a greac deal of address, ehae soe was glad eo sees
pashon in him,which made her hope thae at last he mighc be constane; since finding in a perton
whom he loved, all the beaucies of the body, all che graces of the rainde, and all the vertuej
of the soul, it was irapofsible for him to meet wieh any ching thae was amiable in another,
which was noc in her. Yon have Reason, answered che Marquis, bue noe alcogether eo re¬

nation, which predominates over all mine, I give every day a new objed CO my passion. To
day I adore her eyes; to morrow I love the beauty of her siiape, the next day I suffer my self
to be charmed with the graces of her minde; another cime her goodly asped ravishes me;

so mightily surprized all the company, as albeit they had no great cause of joy, yec could
they not forbear laughing at it. I soould never have done, is I shnuld rehearse all the pleasing

capable of
</p>
<p>In the ra an time you are Co know, chac Aly had noc sailed in rendering an account to the
King of the comraission which hc had given him: but whereas he wa? a Lover and cunning,
he had disguised the truth of thae which he had said to Hipolita, and of ehae which Hipolita
had answered him. For though my sister had cestisied sussiciently unco him, that Abdalla's
assedion could never please her, yec he feared chat is the King should undertake co speak eo
her himself, soe mighc at lengch bc perswaded; so chae co keep him from ie, he cold him,ehac
albeic Hipolita had noc favorably received che dcclaracion which he had made her of his love,
yec he hdd ie noc absolutely irapoflSble to touch her heart; st having seemed unto him how
hehad observed, thac ehe greacest fear H//»o/j&gt;^ had, was left ehe Vxincess Mariama should
perceive chis assedion. Wherefore, my Lord, said he untohim, iemust be by me that she
must be acquainted wich all ehe thoughts which you have for her, until such time as by great
hopes we have chased away ehis fear from her heare. For chere is no doubc, added he, consi¬
dering che estate wherein I saw her minde, is you encerprize Co speak eo her your self, bnc
you will be very ill sacished of her, for che reason I have cold you.

<p>tAbdalla, though very amorous, and consequently very impatient and very suspicious, yet
made do question of ^'/;'s discourse; and remitting himself absolutely to his condud, he
conjured him to remember, that on the conquest of Hipolita all his felicity depended In ehe
inean while, albeic he had promised Aly to give my sister che least cestimony of his assedion
rhae he could, yec was le impoflible for him co conceal his" pashon: for he no sooner enered

<p>displeased, besoughc her not to condemn him without hearing. For, fair HitoUt^ r. -jT
unto her, it may be you will finde some disserence between the love that Abdalla hArc
and chac which I bear you: He onely loves che beaucy of Hipolita, and I adore the v ml""s
Hipohta.  He is not your servant, but to make you his Slave ; and I do not love vou h V
marry you.  His slame is unjust, and mine is lawsul; the end of his love is his own htlsJ^
on, andthatof mine is your glory, and your conservation. For &lt;« sne, continued he it &gt;
be true ehae you love honor, you will have some indulgence for ehe assedion which I carrv r
you; seeing chere rests no other mean co warrane you from ehe violences of AbdalUS love
bue chac of receiving che same which I ofser you.  I acknowledg, said he further to her that
I am an ill subjed, but ic is noe buc Co be a faithsul Lover, and because I will not expofe vou
to che greatest miseries, which a vertuous person can suffer. For, is you wils said he nnto
her, all che Kings love, all his force, and all his power, shall not keep me, from protesting
and marrying you.                =
</p>
<p>^ly having made an end of speaking, left Hipolita, for that he would not have her, said
he, answer him withouc advisement, in a raatter where on all his happiness or unhappiness
depended. From chence he went to the Princess Mariama, to whom in appearance he bore
a great deal of resped. And whereas for some cime past, this Princess had given him more
commodity to speak to her then before, out of the design soe had to discover bis intentions
concerning him that was to succeed Abdalla, it wasnot dissicult for him to talk with ber in
private; so that after he had protested an inviolable sidesity tt) her, and had sworn to her,
thac nexe eo ehe glory and incerests of Abdalla, noching in che world was so dear to him as
hers; he cold her, chac knowing her exceeding vercue and prudence, he choughc he wasob-
liged to acquainc her, how ehe King was so despcracely in love wieh HipoUta, as he teared
thac his passion would carry him eo lose che resped which he owed Co her, in drawing him to
use some violence to ehis maid: That is in chis occasion he mighe be permicced to give adver¬
tisements and counsel both together, he conceived chac che best course could be taken, would
be to remove HipoUta out of the way,or to marry her; That, as her Slave, soe might dispofe
of her, wichout the Kings having any lawsul precexc co coneradid her, since he himself had
bestowed herionher.
</p>
<p>The Princess received this discourse of AL's, as is soe were obliged to him for it; and
akhough she knew not as yec the interest which he had in this affair, becsuse soe had not seen
Hipolita; yet she believed that chis generofity, which appeared in his speech, was not in his
heart: She chanked him notwithss anding for the advice he had given her; promised him to
observe the Kings and HipoUta's adions; and then told him, thst soe would resolve of no¬
thing in this affair, without demanding his counsel about it; and that he onhis part Ihould
not sail to advereise her of all that he knew. Aly, to let the P. incess see that he lyed not, de¬
sired her to call to minde all che eestimonies of unquietness and assi:dion, which tbe King
could not conceal in the visits he had rendred her for some time past. And when as she had
told him that she remembred them very well, he went very well satished of her. Soe
knowing che vertue and prudence of this Princess, he doubted not buc ehae now understand¬
ing che love which the King bore to Hipolita, she would oppose it with all her power; and
so, is it happened ehae HipoUta should cell her che pr poficion he had raade Co marry her, she
would noe coneradid it; because it would be a mean to keep the King from committing a
fault; and because she would believe al o by this way to puc bira ouc of grace with Abdal¬
la, which he feared noe much, in regard ehae all che force of che Kingdom was in his hands;
thae all ehe Governors of Places depended on him; and chac ic was impofsible sox A bdak
torid himself of him, buc by caking away his hse; whichhe stood in no doubc of, for he
could noc imagine, that a Prince to whom he had conserved che Crown, could make him loie
his head. And aseer this manner he resolved eo make a shew of considing in ehe Princess A?&lt;&lt;-
riama; judging chae noching could arrive cherein thac would noc be advantageous to him.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Abdelcader had his designs both of love and ambition, as we I as Aij;
and though he was no very excellent Prince, yet the desire of reigning isso natural in men,
as ic found a place in his heare, and so much che more strongly, because he knew that acco u-
ing to equity the Crown of Marocco appertained to him as^r the death of his brother, cnoug
Abdalla had a son; for thac che Xenss Mahomet had so ordained by his Teltamenc. in ni^
thought, he had a long time already very much courted Aly, to the end he mighr gam m

<p>as much as he could; out ofehe hope tha is A blalla ame toedye, he Would side wich him,
or ac leastwise rcmiin a neucer beeween che son of Ab UUa and h-m.
</p>
<p>Nevercheless, whereas ac chac time ^/; had other designs, h- never said any thing to/s^-
delcader, which might make him hope for ought from [bim.  siut whereas he was dextrous,
and knew not certainly whether he tbould let Abdalla's son raign, or raign himself, he had
never disobliged him, but was contented to tell him still. Upon the divers propofitions which
he had made unto him, that for matters regarding the State, he was noc the servanc of the
pexsono\ Abdalla, but of theYiv:)gof Marocco; That as for him, he was perswaded, how
it was neither reason, nor justice, that ordinarily made Kings, but Fortune only; And with¬
out conlidering whether soe were blind or no in the distribution of Crowns, hc was resolved
always to serve the State with fidelity, in the p.^rson of those whom she would place on the
Throne of Marocco.  But in the terms wherein things then were, he nevertheless alcered hiS
mind, albeit he bad an hundred times proraised Abdalla, is he should happen to dye before
him, to conserve the Crown for his son, to che prejudice of Abdelcader: And whereas Alj
undertook not this d.sign, but for his particular interest, for in raaking a young King to raign,
he soould in a raanner be King himself; that interest coraing Co change, hc also changed his
resolution.  For after he had well examined both che Kings love and his own, he found chac
whae industry soever he could use, ie would be impoflsible for him co marry Hipolita wieh
Abdalla's consent; who soould no sooner be incensed against him, but the Princess Maria¬
ma, joyning her credit and address to the just occasion soe had to wish him ill, would no
doubt constrain him to have recourse to extream remedies.
</p>
<p>With such like thoughts it was that Alj had entertained himself a good while already,when
as Abdelcader, who believed he was in love w h Leonida, and consequently hoped, that he
would excuse the passion he had for Sophronia, came unto him with an intent dextrously
Co learn of him whae designs he had for chac maid , Co ehe end he mighc rule his by
those of a man, who, as he believed, durst not conderan that in anocher, which he suffered
in himself.
</p>
<p>All their conversation at first was but of indisserenc chings, and of che beauty of Mariama's
Slaves. And whereas Aly was not ignorane of Abdelcader's passion for Sophronia, he was
willing in ehis occasion co incense che mind of ehis Prince against Abdalla, and wholly to gain
him Co himself, eo the end chit ishe were to raake a universal subversion in chis Seaee, Abdel-
cadermiQ,ht surniso Mm wich a precexc specious enough, by giving thepeople Co understand,
chac AbdAla by a ttsta-menc, which always reraained in Alss hands, incended his son soould
raign Co his prejudice: For howsoever, Abdekader was Mahomet's son, as well as AbdAla;
and albeic he was no very able Prince, yec had he no vices, so ebac the people did not hate him!
^/y considered further, thac ishe soould come to extream violence, and dispofsess Abdalla,
that Abdelcader might raign, he soould make a King, without ceasing to be one; ic being cer-^
tain, that he would have need ofhim for the Government of his State.
</p>
<p>After this reasoning which ^Z; had within himself, and after an indisserent lon^discourse
which he used to Abdelcader, Co prepare him for that he was going Co say co him. he gave
him co understand. thac Abdalla, very far from approving che love which he bore ci a Slave,
would noc consenc to his marriage with the greatest Princess of the Earth; because both bv

<p>Now to carry the matter with more certainty, Aly to\d Abdelcader, thae ele prlnciDsl
poinc was eo render chemselves Masters of Marocco.- tot by ehe experience of the pall Wart
and by a satality which seemed inevitable, all they who had seized on it had at the verysanw
instane subjeded all che rest of the Kingdom; That to do ic wiehoue danger he was to make
siiew, acsuch eime as ^^dss/ss4d&lt;r&gt;'should cnee prize the executing of the business, of being
still faithsul CO the King, co che end hc mighc give him bad counsel, and seize upon his and
Mariama's person, when cime stiould serve for ie, Co puc chem in ehe same prison, where
Hamet, Muley Zidan, and his children had lycn. Buc chac ic was first requisite tomake it
be dextrously bruted amongst the people, chac Abdalla would desraud him of che righc he
had CO ehe Crown, and for chac essed would noc suffer him Co marry; Thac eo render the
matter more plausible, he should in a publique audience go and demand perraission to marry
agrand-childofthelastKingof7'«»/rs, who was in the Courc of Marocco; bue said/s*.
delcader then toh^xm. Is she should be granted unco me, I should be excreamlyperj^ext;
for indeed I do noC desire ehe Crown of Marocco, buc co stiare it with the Slave Sophrma.
Fear not chac, said he unco him, for I stiall be of che Councel, and I will oblige ^^i»//4so
severely co resuse her Co you, as you slaall chen have a pretexe specious enough to raake use of
tbe Soldiers, which I shall give you co begin the revolc. And co lee che people see Ahdnlla's
bad saich, and to oblige him not to doubt of me, uncil sncb cime as I am sure of him, you
must go Co my Palace to ofser some violence chere, as it were charging me with the outrage
you have received: And ascer you have made as though you had plunder'dic, you shall shew
the people y^^^&lt;»//&lt;i's testament, which I will give you before-hand. In the mean cime be
assured chat I will take so good an order for all things, as you shall meet bue with few ene¬
mies to fight with; and chac in a lietle cime I will deliver you the key of ehe prison, wherein
I shall have shue up AbdallaMs son,and Mariama; and asccr shis you stiall have ehe Crown
and Sophronia, whom you may marry is you chink good; or according eo our Laws ereac as
a Slave, since she shall be yours: And for me, said he unco him, H»/&gt;o/»r&lt;t is che only recom¬
pence which I demand of you. You mistake ehe name, said Abdelcader eo him, and you
wonld no doubt speak of Leonida. No, no, replyed Alj; and ehen he declared unto him the
truth ofthe matter, and so they parced, aseer they had well examined their encerprize again,
and fully resolved not to let a day pass, without laboring to advance the execution thereof as
much as chey could.
</p>
<p>In the mean space Abdalla lived still in some hope, chat he should be able co touch the heart
of Hipolita, especially sincc che Conspiracy of ^^&lt;is/c&lt;i«/*r; for che subtle ^4/; since thar, to
busie his mind the more pleasingly, had aslured him, chac provided he would continue living
wich her, as bc had done cercain days before, he despaired not to obeain ofher more then he
had chought he should. The Princess Mariama on her pare had imparted eo Hipolita, and
her companions, che conversacion which she had had with ^4/^; ind Hipolita had also ac¬
quainced Mariama with ehe declaracion of love which hc had made unco her, which pofseslcd
the Princess with a great deal of unquiecness. I well foresaw, said she unco chem, that Al)
was not dis-interessed in chis affair; bue when as she sought for means co gee ouc of this per¬
plexity, she could not imagine them. She knew thae che King was so strongly preoccupatea
with the opinion of &gt;i/;'s sideliey, thac unless he learnc his crime from his own mouth, ne
would never believe ic. She was indeed generous enough to venture any ehmg for the lavj:^
ofthese three maids, who craved procedion ofher wich rears j bue she feared eoo, Icin id

more then she was accustomed to do, that soe raight still gain further power oVer his mind for
the dcstroying of that which Alj had gotcen there. As for us, we lived in extream discon-
tent J for being advertised ofall the Princess Mariama's and her fair Slaves unquietness, and
foreseeing no end to so many miseries, we led an idle and melancholick life, which was insup¬
portable to us all, except thcMarquiss, who without regarding our misfortunes, esteemed
himself che happiest raan in ehe world, for being favorably looked upon by che Princess Z,s/&lt;i
Mahabid.
</p>
<p>Bue noc Co prolong my discourse wieh raaccers which ate noC necessary for you to know,
I soall cell you, ehae in four or sive conversaeions ehe Princesses address was so great, ehae she
knew wieh as rauch cercainty as strong conjedurcs could give ofit, thac Aly had ill intentions
for ehe Kings children. And wichout being able co divine chac diey wete in some fore Co ehe
idnnta^eoi Abdelcader, soe knew ehae is che King came Co dye, he Would noC conserve the
Crown for his son. That which raade Mariama more easily discover Alj's designs was, that
seeing ehe civility which soe had soewed to him some days before, and the vertue ofthis Prin¬
cess being more dreaded ot him then all Abdalla's authority, he had used certain obscure dis¬
courses unto her, to make her apprehend, that is soe would embrace his friendsoip, he would
cause the Crown of Marocco to sall upon the head of whomsoever soe would. For whereas
Qaevjistheviidowof Muley Zidan, to whom of righe che Kingdom appercained, isthey
had let him live, he thought that it may be soe was capable of the desire to remount into the
Throne of her Fathers. But that being no intention ot hers, soe seemed not to understand any
of Alss speeches in that raanner, though indeed soe raarked thera very exadly. After slbe
had throughly run over again in her mind, even to the least circumstances, whatsoever might
either increase or dirainiso her suspicions, she resolved to advertise the King thereof But to
prepare his raind for the entertaining of some distrust of Aly's fidelity, slhe willed HipoUta to
make Abdalla perceive, as often as soe saw him, thac soe rook greac care Co decline his en¬
councer, Co ehe end soe raighc be the raore credited, when soe soould assure him thac Aly had
ofsered to raarry htr, for the securing of her trora his violences. The Princess Mariama,
who did nothing inconsiderately, resolved for all that to carry some cime yec for che disco¬
vcring ofher suspicions.
</p>
<p>In ehe mean season Aly took order for all things necessary to his enterprize, and according
to the plot which he and Abdelcader hidhyd^ one raorning when as the King of Marocco
gave audience to all thera which had any thing to rcquest of him, Abdelcader, followed by
certain ofhis Partisans, went and besought the King to grant him the permishon to marry
the grand child of the last King of Turns, and to give him a portion answerable to a person of
his condition J He rold him that he was not ignorant how Princes, which mighc precend Co
A ?Ys"' were noe cheir own, butthe States, and for chac reason he would not dispofe
of himseswithout his leave: He added further, that the choyce which he had raade could
not be blamed, since it was a person of birth equal to his; anda person whora by reason of

<p>to his Estates, and to surnish him with a pretext to make War as often as he mee wich an oc¬
casion foric; That to cake from him che boldness thence-forward to ofser such like propofi¬
tions, he was to tell him absolucely, thae this marriage did noc please him, even wichout co-
louring the matcer with any apparant reason$,as he might do; because, said he, AbdeUader's
boldness could not be sussiciently punished.
</p>
<p>Abdalla following Aly''s opinion in all things, contradided him not in this, where he
thoughc his incerest alone was regarded. He senc Abdelcader word then, chat he tbrbad him
to think of marrying himself, either to che Princess of Tunis, or eo any ocher; ehae he should
leave co him the care of chusing a wise for him; and that is he did ocherwise, he soould then
be declared gmlcy of High Treason. Abdelcader no sooner received cbis answer, buc every
one in Marocso knew ic, and every one murmured ac ic. The Princess Mariama could noc
comprehend chis business; tor she knew chac Abdelcader had cestisied a greac deal of love to
Sophronia ip divcrs occasions; and knew also chac he had never regarded ehe Princessof Tum
bue wich indisserency; and ehae is chere had not been some hidden thing in his deiign, she
should have been the first to whom he would have spoken ofit: but howibever soe reasoned
thereupon, she could not discover the truth. And whereas HipoUta had for some time toge¬
ther lived with the King, as she had ordained her, she observed that Abdalla perceived this
change; so thac seeing the macter in chis estace, she wene one morning co his lodging, where
slhe craved she favor of him eo calk wieh him in privace, and the King having granted it toher,
sbe besought him co promise her, chac is he did noc give credic to whac soe was going to tell
him, he at leastwise would never speak of ic again; being fully resolved noc co acquaint him
with chae she had co communicace unto him, unless he would engage his word unto her
to do so.
</p>
<p>The King, being touched with an extraordinary curiofiey, and yet fearing that Mariama
would speak to him of his love to HipoUta, stood a while without answering her; but at
length having promised her as much as she had desired of him, she began to prepare his mind
with a very particular address. I know, said she unro him, thae for chis which I am going
to tell you I oughc to be suspeded ofyou, eieher of malice, or of prcoccupaeion: I know also,
that Aly being so mightily established in your assedion, I soall expofe my self to ehe hazard
ofdispleasingyou, incclhngyouchac I susped he is noC so saichsul uneo you, as his birth and
obligations toyououghe tomake him: I know too, ehae in whac manner soever you hear
the business, ic will be still ofsensive unro you; for is you beleeve chere is any malice in my
discourse, you will np doubc be forry co find a stain in ehe Soul of a person chat is so dear unto

betrayed by a man whom you have so much obliged will disquiee you; and whedier icbc ouc

withstanding CO che hazard of troubling his rest, and geccing his hatred, which is to me my su-
preamest misfortune.                -  ,.

<p>Abdalla, imized with Mariama's discourse, though hc did not believe that the could
tell him any thing which was true against Aly's fidelity, yet left he noc co assure her, that in

<p>more unlikely then the other, because he might conceive, that Mariama had taken his Con¬
sident for a Lover of Hipolita, yet he beleeved more of it ehen she would have had him.
And making shew of being raore moved with Aly's wane of resped eo her, ehen wieh his
own incerest, he demanded of her very txadly, how soe came eo perceive/^/;'s passion;
and whecher ehe con jedures soe had of ie were strong enough ? because it it proved to be so,
he meant Co pnniso him for his boldness. My Lord, saidthis Princ ss unro him, you do me

Aly. And chen, wichouc Abdalla's deraanding ie, soe recounced all chofe chings unto htm
which had been cause of her suspicions: but at length the trouble of this Princes raind being
somewhac appeased, he beleeved that Aly raight be his Rival, but beleeved not thac he had
any design upon his Crown. Howbeie Mariama said so much unco him, chae in ehe end
wieh her enereaeies and reasons soe obcained of him, chae for sisteen days space he would do
whaesoever soe would have him for ehe clearing of the business. This Prince had much ado
to resolve upon making any doubt of Aly's fidelity, so tar forth as Co seek oue the means of
convincing him; but ac last the consideration of Mariama, and a little touch of jealousie car¬
ried him unto it: yet was it upon condition, that ii Aly wete found innocenr, she should

<p>Mariama hi\ingpxomised Abdalla all ehae he desired, soe began ehe very fame day one
of the most extraordinary Artifices, as ever was made use of, for ehe discovcry of the thoughts
of an ambitious man and a Traytor; and lo, how she proceeded.  She obliged Abdalla to
keep his chamber cercain days, and not Co lee himself be seen of any bue his Physicians, and
the Slaves which served him.  Ac sitst Aly raarvelled noc Co see che door kepc sast aoainst all

and ehae chey which looked eo him, had forbidden any body from seeing him • as indeed che

<p>V^hen is Mariama perceived/s/j-'s thoughc, she advertised ^^^^Z/^, that thenextday
Je would either convince, or justisie his favorite: And having instruded him in that which
she would have him to do, she caused a Guard to come in for co seizc on Aly, in case ehere
should be need of ic; and cook order for all chings so secretly, as no body discovcred any
thing. The day following Aly early in che morning came co Mariama, wirh an intent to
employ all his address for che clearing of che doubc wherein he was: for ambieion and lovc
gave him so much irapacience, as he had no rest. And verily in ehis occasion the protestion
of Heaven appeared visibly, both to revenge ^rsn^w^i o[ Aly's cruelcy, and to preserve us.
For icis cercain, thac as ehe maccer was carried, Abdalla and Mariama had been lost; So.
phronia had been expofed to the violences of Abdelcader; Hipolita to the brunsoncss of
Aly, and che rest of us Co be constrained co dye in desending chem,or noc eo survive their loss
had not Mariama wroughe as she did.
</p>
<p>But in sine, Aly, being come one morning, as I have cold you, to che Princesses chamber,
and she having used as much address in calking wieh him, as soe had done ac ocher times, aug¬
mented in such fore ehe opinion which he had chac Abdalla was dead, as noc able colec him¬
self be any longer guided by prudence, he in plain cerras desired che Princess eo tell him whe¬
ther che King were not dead ? because, said he, is ic be so, ic were sie chac ehe affairs of the
Kingdom were speedily provided for.  Mariama, seeing so fair a beginning co her deiign,
did noc answer him buc wich a great sigh, and wichouc saying any ching unco him, she led
him into Abdalla's chamber.  Now albeic he was already perswaded chac che King waj
dead, yet lesc he not co be mighcily surprized Co see all ehis chamber hung wich black Velvet,
all che windows shuc, in che midll a great bed of State invironed with a balustrate of Ebony,
set all abouc with slaming Torches, and upon Cusoions near to the Bed, the Mantle Royal,
the Scepter, che Crown, and che Turbanc of aAlbdalla, wich his Scymiear ae ehe teet of the
Bed, whereupon was a large black Cloth trailing a greac way on che ground, which seemed to
cover ehe body of the King; some of his Wives and Slaves were about the Balustrade, who
testified by their couneenance so sensible a sorrow, as would have drawn cears from any other
bue Aly.  The Princess having conduded him chen inco chis charaber of raourning, and per¬
ceiving chae this sad objed had sutsiciencly perswaded him chac which soe desired he should
beleeve, she began Co shew an excream asshdion, and Co st quest him wieh seigned cears, that
he would perform ehe Kings last Will, in consc ving ehe Crown for his son, according to
the Testamene he had made, whereof he had ehe custody, chough ic was contrary to the Xerijse
Mahomet's intention. And then, said she unco him, he hach comraanded me eo restore the
Shve Hipolita, and her sellows, Co cheir libercy; inregard iehid seemed uneo him that he
had violated the Law of Naeions in retaining persons in slavery, who by Tempest had been
driven into Marocco.  Buc, concinued she, generous Aly, ehis last ching imports not much;
nor have I cold ic you, buc ehae! would noc sail in any thing which my King, my brother,
and my Lord, hach given me in charge ac his deach.  For so much as regards ehe Prince his son,

<p>Is Abdalla, answered ^/y insolencly, would have me conserve the Crown for his son, ne
should have lived a longer cime; for ic shall never be reproached unco me, that I have placed
an Insant on the Throne of Marocco. The same Testament, added he, which gave the Crown
to Abdalla, stiall set ic on the head of some ocher; for in conclusiion, it is for men eo govern

<p>under which he was hidden; tbv persideousntss must be punished with my hand; saying so,
Ab,\alla\iydho\d on his Scymitar, and all the Guard, which lay concealed for that essed,
rusoing into the chamber, Alj Wis so surprized, and so confounded, as he knew not at first
whether it were an apparition, or whether essedively this Prince, whom he had beleeved to
be dead, was living. In so great a trouble Abdalla without doubt had killed him, is cbe
Princess Mariama, who would noc have him dye by so illustrious an hand, had noe hindred
him; which was che cause, chae ^/y, beingcomeco himself again, and sreeing himself from
che Guard which would have seized upon him, opened a window when as they were noc a-
ware of ie, and whereas all the houses of ehae Councry, as chey are here, are exceeding low,
he leaped inco the Court-yard, and was so forennaee as he did noc hurc himself, bue goe shiet
away oue of ehe Palace; leaving Abdalla so amazed and asshded ae his persidiousness, and
Mariama so sacisied wieh che happy success of her design, thae is the displcasure of seeing
Aly escaped had not moderaced her joy, ic would have been eoo violenc.
</p>
<p>Abdalla instandy comraanded him cobe pursued wieh all speed, and alive or dead Co be
brought unto him: But Aly was already gotcen inco a raans house, whose life before eimes he
had saved. For in whac diforder soever his soul was, yet had he judgment enough not co go
to his own home; imaginingrightly thae he would be soughc for ehere. In che mean eime,
the fear he had left ehe King should cause che gaees of che City Co be shue,raade him seek oue all
kinde of inveneions to escape. For albeic ttie plot which he had layd wieh Abdelcader was
ready eo be execuced, yec waneed ic so rauch cime, as he durst not encerprize ie, especially
oue of ehe thoughc he had, chat chey would noc have made use of so cxcraordinary an inven¬
tion to discover his ineentions, without having taken order for all things. He senc word
then secretly to Abdelcader, chac he should accempc noching uncil he was in one of the places
of cheir intelligence, to the end they mighc be assiired of a reereac, is their affairs should go
iU. Ascer chae, he disguised himself like a woman; for whereas chey are all vailed in thac
Country, he believed chat getting speedily out of the Cicy, before any exad order was given
at the gates, it would be easie for him to save himself, as indeed ie sell oue. He ehae served
him in ehis occasion promised to bring him an horse to a place, which was not above a mile
from the Town; zndi^enAly, being disguised in the manner chat I haverelaccd, wene out
of ^4r«;cs&lt;» a very hede before the Guards had been placed ac che Gates, with a Command
to suffer no body ro pass ouc upon any precexc whatsoever. In the mean space Abdalla had
sene eo fearch for Aly in his Palace, and afterward caused ic Co be proclaimed over all the Cicy
</p>
<p>thac whofoever could bring ^/y unco him should have a recompence able to enrich him for
all hishfe.
</p>
<p>The Inople, no sooner understood thit Aly wiS in disgrace, but salling inco an uproar
and manitelting their secrec hacred uneo him, plundered his Palace; and chis wrecched man
had noe a friend, who for his own sccuriey did not ac least-wise seem tobe otherwise. But
whereas ehe people arc inconstanc in cheir resolueions, ascer ehey had commieeed an hundred
oucrages, there ran a bruit amongst chis mukitude, that Abdattu was dead; and that che pro-
clarattjon which had been made was an arcisice of Aly, who meanc co discover by this sidi-
on, whether he were beloved,or hated. And whereas all extraordinary noveleies easilv find^

<p>who taking che same horse which ehe other had made use of before, he went to ore of the
gates to get forth, but hehad the like success as the former; who, willing to hazard all for
Aly, senc a third person thither: which was the cause, that one ofthe Guard, who had more
brain then the rest, perceived, that although three several men bad presented chcmlclves for
to go ouc of che City, yet it had been still with one and the same horse; sothat hecrtainly
believed there was some mystery in this adventure, and how it might well be that /j/rwas
not far ofs. This Soldier having imparted his thought to him that commanded the gat., he*
conceived chae his opinion was noc ill grounded ; wherefore, to clear himselt therein' he
made shew of being perswaded by the intreatics of this man who d-sired to be let forth;
buc whil'st to gain time he made yet some new dissiculties, he sent for three horses, to the end
he might follow him a far oft'with two of bis compai i:;ns; which were no sooner come, but
having lee him go out, and set them elves to follow rim, they saw thac contrary to thecustom
c s all such as tear co be followed, he went on still without turning his head to rhe place from
whence he parted, so great a desire he had to arrive where the unhappy W/7 waited for him.
Seeing then that they might follow him without his b-ing aware of it, they approached netn:r
to him, then they would have done is he had behaved himstls ocherwise, and quitting the
high-way as weil as he, when chey came neer eo a wood, whither chis man seemed tohavea
purpose to go, they espyed a woman, who having discovered them, hid her self in the thickcst
of thebushes. This adion made him,that was carrying the horse to ^/;, turn about his head;
who knowing that he was followed, would have tak.n more on the left hand, and nut have
gone to the place where he was attended • but this trick would not serve his turn; howso¬
ever it was not because those which had observed her believed that this woraan was essedive¬
ly y^/y, buc being neer unto ic, ehey would needs know cercainly whac ehis adventure was.
The Captain then, having given order to the two Soldiers to seize on chis man, went to the
place where he had seen che woman hide her scls, and had noe gone fifty paces bue he found
her ae ehe sooc of a tree; where, keeping down her vail still about her, she besought him, in
counterseiting her voyce, not to do her any violence.  And when soe saw chat this man had
no incenc to use her civilly, and seemed fully resolved eo discover whae soe was, soe would
have cempced ehis Capcain wich che hope of a greac recorapence; so chae suddenly listing up
her vail. Thou seesl, said she, the infortunate Aly, r^ko can ma^e thee happy is thou bee}
Vpije; for is thou VciU resolve to let me escape, I \VUlput thee in a condition that thou shdt
never need to atk. any thing more of Fortune.  This Captain, who was saichsul, or it may be
did noc believe chae Aly in ehe case he was in could recompence him as much as he said, an¬
swered him, chae he would never enrich himselt byalreaion, and wichouc further delay he
called his companions, who, having eyed cbe man, on whom ehey had seized, Co a tree, went
to help him co cake the miserable v^/7,who,though without A'ras,left noc ofs rt sisiing them tor
while.  Buc ac last ehey broughc him co Marocco, and having conduded him before At-
dalla, rhis Prince reviled him wieh all imaginable reproaches.  And whereas Aly had always
been happy, chis one blow of unhappiness so mightily surprized him, as chac judgment and
prudence, which had rendred him so consid-rable in his profpericy, wholly abandoned m
m his missoi tune: so that in stead of seeking to colour his fault, he consessed ic as ic was, ana
relaeed unto Abdalla all chac he had said and thought, just in ehe bme manner as I havede I-

<p>But, Madam, to make an end of celling you at once, both the goodness of Mariama, and
our fortune, you stiall understand, that in the consusion wherein all the City of y^.&lt;rofc-o was
this day, when as the Princess Mariama entred into a Chamber where these three fair Slaves
were, and saw them all in tears, especially Hipolita, who knew well that sh;; was in part
cause of all this diforder •, this Princess, Isay, seeing them in this estate, h?.d somuch gene¬
rofity, though soe loved them very tenderly, astodcpriveher stls for ever of them: Itmay
be also, that the design of taking from theKing an objed of pashon, which might trouble
his rest; from Abdelcader that which had raade him sail in this duty ; and from the Princess
Lela Mahabid another, which mighe raake her in some fore forgec ehe rank which she held,
carryed her eo this resolution.  But in conclusion, a lictle interest, and a great deal of genero¬
sity, raade her cell thera, that profit was to be made of ochers raisfortune: so that before
the King had leasure co ask for chera, soe caused chera Co be secrecly conveyed eo ehe house ot
a man, who abiolutely dep.^nded on her; and having advercised us Co repair chither, we con¬
tinued concealed there above eight days.  She in like sort caused the Mariners and Soldiers,
which we had brought to Marocco, CO be delivered; for the arabitious Aly being dead, the
Princess Mariama was as powersul in the State as the King himself
</p>
<p>The day following, Abdalla, seeing the Princess Mariama with a seigned melancholy in
her face, which yet he believed to be true, demanded of her, whether revenge, which is
said to be one of the greatest pleasures of Kings, did not give her some ? My Lord, said soe
unco him, presenc misforeunes are doubtless more sensible chen past pleasures; ehe loss ofehe
Slaves which you gave me, is cause of raore grief eo me, ehen that ot Aly hath made me seel
joy.  So strange a discourse surprized che King excrearaly; and whereas he desired co be
cleared cherein, ehe Princess Mariama cold him, chae in che consusion wherein all chings were
the day before, whether y^/; had caused chem eo bc carryed away by force, or whecher we
had concribuccd any thing chereunco, so ie was, chac rceurning in the Evening to her lodging,
she had noe found chem ehere, neicher could soe poflibly learn any news of ehera.  I will noc
repcae uneo you all thit Abdalla did inthis occasion, although the ?xincess Mariama ac¬
quainted us with it: But in conclusion, ic suffices you soould know, chac ^^^;?//^ took ehis
adventure as an amorous Prince would do ; and after he had caused fearch to be made over all
the Cicy, excepc in ehe place where we were, which by che care of ehe Princess was exempt¬
ed, soe had che goodness Co come secrecly and bid her dear Slaves farewell, eo whom also shs
gave very rich gists: And the night following, having dispofed of all things for our deparcure,
soe caused us to be imbarqucd in a Merchancs Vessel, chac see sail the same nighe; and where-
of ehe Capcain, who was of Palermo, undercook Co carry us whichersoever vve would go
in consideration of an excessive sum of money which soe gave him for ehae purpose

Lover in choller sas I conceive) is more to be feared then another; for whereas choller doth"
most commonly banish away resped from the Souls of chofe whom ic pofsesscth, onemnll
forbear as long as is poflTible from expofing ones self to the hazard of angering an amorous
Prince, who being able eo do whatsoever he will,is always in an estace Co befeartd. Youhavo

<p>This news strangely surprized all this fair Troop; but whereas the precexc, whereof M-
man mide ase, was noc withouc probabilicy, and that//&lt;»^s//&lt;« by her Letter had rendred it
more likely unto them, Co the end she might keep them from conceiving any thing to her dis-
advancage,they believed it co be as it was represented unto them,withour seeking for any other
explication thereof; comforting themselves in some sort with the hope which//"^^irZ/d gave
them of visiting them sometimes: For to make their separation the easier, though soecould
not hear from <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> as yet, she left not for all that to assure thera that he would be back

<p>This hope sailed not to work the essed w hich <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> expede-,.rora it; all this company
was more jovial and more sociable, and whereas <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'i Palace was wondersul fair, and
that they were served there by the Grand Signior's order exceeding magnificently, their exile

said Sophronia, I have noc che same curiofiey, for I am so fully informed of ehis

said Leonida to her, will needs know it, I stiall make advancage of it is you will take the
pains to relate it unto them; for as for me, I am fully resolved not to expofe my stls a second

<p>Alphonso, after hehad said this, went without attending L^onida's answer forth ofthe Qs-

His absence did not for all chat change Leonida's opinion, and whaesoever could be said unto

And whereas you know thac i^^om^^ haeh naturally a gallanr wit, and a very o^J.^Z'
Ih-otcencimes gave him ehe pleasure to hear her jeer his Rivals in his pnsence, and an ^o- \
times made her Conquests serve for his glory. Alphonso then lived in rhiv,'ore with more
content, then che extream love which he bore her seemed to permit; for, as I have heard it
said, this pashon seldom leaves any greac tranquillity in the Souls of those whom it
poflcsseth.
</p>
<p>B\it sox Alphonso, he was che most generous Lover that ever was; his inclination had not
been blind; all the world approved ot his choyce; he loved an amiable person, and was be
loved ofher ; shc cook care not Co give him any cause of jealousie; his very Rivals serv, d for
his dehghe and selicicy by ehe usage that she gave chem; his saeher did noc contradid hisas-
sedion; Leonida was of a sree condition, and mighe dispofe of her sds; yea and to keep
him from being deprived of ehe pleasure of hoping for the passcshon of aperson chat could
render him contented, Lt onida, to assure her self yet further of his love, would not sc much
as let him make use of his friends for the motioning of their marriage. In so happy an estate
methinks it is hard Co imagine whac could crouble his selicicy, especially when llball have
told you, chac Leonida used him still as favorably as before, and wichouc any change arriving
in her, yec ehere arrived a change in him. I well perceive, concinued Sophroma, atccr slie had
been a while wichouc speaking, thae you cannoc divine whac ic was which croubled Ahhoii.
so's happiness; and cercainly I cannoc chink ic strange, seeing accoiding to my I= nie this ad¬
venture is so extraordinary, as ic is impoflible Co conjedure ie. You shall understand then,
thac one day Alphonso being gone to see a kinsman of bis, whereas the person beloved is a part
ofall conversations, and a man insinitely amorous speaks withouc choyce and judgment othis
Mistress Co everyone, became tofpeiV.oi Leonida ctJ his kinsman, chough eo say truth hc
was noc worchy of chac honor j for chis man is boch malicious and blockiso; According
then to his humor and stupidiey he rudely asked of Alphonso, whether he beleeved that he had
been che first which ever had been asseded of Leonida ?
</p>
<p>Now whereas Alphonso had been a long cime in che voyage, from whence JtisUnim
broughc him back, hc had understood nothing of what had hapned to Leonida, for being fallen
in love with her presently after his return, no body had been so uncivil as to say any such thing
to him. It was noe, as you shall know by ehe sequel of ehis History, because ehae which ar¬
rived unco Leonida was noC glorious for her; bue because love is a pashon ebac renders the
spirit so sensible and delicaee, as ie is irapofllible to hear ehae the person whom one loves,
should have assedion for another, without some sense of grief. And verily Alphonso tryed
it but Coo well in this occasion; he beleeved at first notwithstanding, that this was an effect
ofehe malice ofhis kinsman, who regarding his succession, had perchance a design co do what
hecould for che rendring z:tso«tV&lt;» less amiable: but when as continuing his incivilicy he had
told him, ehae one, mmedOBavio, of ehe House of the Tallavicins, and who was dead
since, had in cimes past loved her, and chac he had been insinitely loved of her, he did not be¬
leeve ehae chis man durst have cold him chings so precisely, is ehey had noe been crue.
</p>
<p>Atkn^ih Alphonso, having made his visic, recired with some unquietness; nevertheless,
whereas he had noc yec lost his Reason, he did noc find chat he had any cause eo complain ot
Leonida, sot chae she had been loved ofO^lavio, or for that soe had loved him in a time when
as he was not known to her. For, said he, I stiould be unjust eo desire, ehae ehe ^V" of ^^a-
nida should noC have begun Co raake Conquests before chey capcivaced me; and I soould be
unrcasonable co desire also chac she should have been absolucely insensible of ehe assedion ot a
man, who ic may be was of more worch chen my seP. Now whereas Love is ingenious to
torment those which are under his Empire, Alphonso did noe complain of having a Rival, thac
had noc been haced, bue for chac Leomda had made a secrec ot ic eo him: This unquiecncis was
noc for all chat very strong, buc you soall understand by che sequel of my discourse, that ic
carried him co another, which puc him to a greac deal of pain.

<p>ixom Alphonso, she layd her hand over her eyes, and endevoring to change di'course, hewas
thereby perswaded, that th's touched her heart exceeding sensibly; augmented his curiofity;
and made him resolvc to testifie ic co her plainly.
</p>
<p>In pursuance of so precipicons a design, Alphonso,without deserring ehe execucion of ic any
surcber, said unco her, I would fain, fair Leonida, bcassured,thic after my being dead for your
service, my name soould be so happy as eo make you bluso and sigh, as ehe blessed OUavio's
haeh done. You soould do beecer, answered Leonida sighing a second cime, Co call him in-
soxtxxnueOUavio. Whofoever hath been loved of you, replyed Alphonso, could never be
unhappy, notwithstanding any thing that could arrive to him otherwise. I wiso for all thar,
si\d Leonida, that younever make tryal of the like sescity : But, continued soe with an al¬
tered countenance, why have yon spoken to me of Ofs^i^/o.' Let us leave him to enjoy that
rest which he could never finde in this life; let us not trouble ours in troubling his j and let
us, I pray you, have so much regard to him, as to leave his asoes in peace. Please you to par¬
don me, said y^i/&gt;/S)o«/o then unto her, is without lofing the resped which I owe to you, I
dare crave of you, for a raark of your assedion, that you will cake the pains Co rebec exadly
unco me, thac which Ofs^z/jo in cimes past bore unco you, that which you bore to bira, and
briesly all that besell you till the time of his death; ocherwiscyou will give me ciusc to cora-
plain of you. Leonida would not at first accord to Alphonso that which he desired of her;
for as soe knew how highly her heart had been touched for O^avio, so soe knew likewise
thac ie would be impoflible for her Co remember all chcir selicities, and all iheir misforeunes,
wichouc a greac deal of unquiecness; wherefore soe excused herself from icas much as she
could; nevercheless seeing ehae Alphonso cook ehis resusal for a wrong, she promised co grant
bim his desire, so ashe would give her some eime; and in chis fore many days past away,
Alphonso being unable co make her keep her word wich him. Bue ac length, his curiofity be¬
ing grown the stronger by Leonida's resistance, hc testified unto her one day so seriously, that
he soould hold himself disobliged by her, is she continued in the resolution which she seem¬
ed to have, as having appointed him a time to come to her for that purpose, soe resolved to
content him. Is one had then demanded of Alphonso why his curiofity was so strong, he
could not have told, at least-wise he hath acknowledged so mut^toLeonidas\nee: For
whereas he was perswaded that soe had loved oElavio, both by that which his Kinsraan had
told him, by that which he had also learned other-where concerning it, and by the marks
which he had seen of ie in her couneenance, is in her speech nevercheless soe had disguised che
truth, thatiying would have given him a great deal of unquietness j and yec hc selc In his
heare, that is contrarily soe soould avouch unto him, that soe had loved him very rauch chis
discourse would not please him. But at last, carryed by a secret raotion, which he could' noC
resist, he went with an extream impatience to the assignation which Leonida had given him
He found her more sad then ordinary; for whereas her imagination was silled wich displeasl
m^idea's, that charming and jovial ayr, which soehachusuillyin her face, was somewhat
changed. After soe had caused Abhonso to sit down, and had told him, that soe was going
to render him the greatest proof oT her assedion chac he had ever yec received, soe was readv
to impare uneo him whac her fortune had been, when is Alphonso, before he would give
her leasure soco do, conjured her once again noc Co omic any pare of all chat which bad arri
yed unto ber. But he had no need to intreat her thereunto, for Leonida had no sooner began
to speak but forgetting that soe was recounting her History to her Lover, she suffered her
self CO be charmed wich her own relation; and soewing grief or joy, according arch mar

<p>nally; that this spring-ng sovc sti dd one day be the cause of his death, and cis rrtsol
ny tears; and withouc dreaming ofany such thing, the pleafore alone of seeing one anoth i
and talking together, took up all our Souls. We knew not as yet for all that added Z
what those thoughts were which we had one for the other; neither did we peoive
them, till decency would noc permit us to see one another so often. The privation ot a eood
makes us know the greaeness of it, and the design which we had to conceal our assedion be¬
gan to make me susped that there was something in it more then good-will: I did then all
thar I could to disengage my minde stom a pashon, which I had always heard to be vry dm
gerous; but whereas it was more ancient in me then Reason, Reason was not strmg enouch
to chase it ou: of my Soul; but contrarily it was soe whxh engaged me further in it^and ihat
speaking to m-; of OUavio, drew the pidure of the worthiest man that ever was. She told
him moreover thac, which she selc in her hearr, whenas by any reason of honor, or business,
he was constriined to bc absent from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>; the sraall delight soe took in Assemblies whcti
he Wis not there; and how rauch she enforced her self to seem merry during his absence. She
acquainted him also, howexad'Ofs&lt;«z'/o wasin following her pleasure in all things; what
care he used to take from her all occasion of suspeding his fidelity; and with what discretion
he still demeaned himself towards her all che time ot his serving tier.
</p>
<p>But, said Alphonso incerrupcing her, had you never any of those petty diforders, which
augment love, rather then dirainish it? No, no, answered Leonida, OHavta re\tx gave me
cause CO complain; besides, our assedion had no need of that artifice to render it the strong¬
er ; since it is certain thac^jever any person loved more persedly ehen we. Alphonso would
fain have assured Leonida, chae he loved her yec beecer ehen OUavio had loved her, but his
minde was so unqu'ee,.as he could scarce speak. And then again, Leonida gave him not lea-.
sure Co do it; for she was soaeeencive in exadly relacing all chac had past beiwi\iOUavio
and her, as she never took heed ofall the several changes which her discourse made in his
face. She continued chen celling him, chac aseer an indisserenc long love, OElavio, having ob¬
tained permisllion ot her eo demand her of her parents, believed that his happiness was so sure,
ashe had no doubt at all of ic; for whereas his Saeher and hers had always lived as good
friends cogecher, and cheir forrunes were equal, hecould foresee no imped imene in it. But
he knew noc, said Leonida ehen looking on Alphonso, that a passion less noble then that
which raigned in his heart opposed his; and that avarice, which is lar raore powersul in the
mindes of old men, then love is in that of young solks, slbould destroy his and myhopes,and
should finish our love by his death, for to setrie a grief in my soul, which I soall conserve chere
eternally.
</p>
<p>In sequel hereof, Leonida likewise declared to Alphonso, that one named Livio, of the
Family of theSrigoz.es, a raan very rich in che goods of fortune, but very poor in thoseof
the minde, being touched with her beauty, without any thought of discovcring his affection
toher, or gBining her favor, went the very same day that he sell in love with ber, and de-..
manded her of her Father; prescribing him no other conditions, then thac ot giving him his
daughter; and thae this old man, who knew Liviu's wealth, being more mightily touched
wieh ehe love of riches, ehen Livio was with the beauty of Leonida, had promised him to
bestowed her on him, and had engaged his word to him in such sort, as nothing was able- to
make him break it. So that OElavia arriving an hour alter that Livio was gone, and making
his propofition, he was wonderfully surprized to learn from Leonida's Father, that he had
promised his daughtar, and thac ie would be in vain for him eo hope he raighc make him
change his resolucion.  Ollavio could noC apprehend, ehae Leonida could be promised to any
one, andshinocknowof ie; and on che ocher side, si\d Leonida to Alphonso, my fidelity
wasso well known cohim, ashe durst nor doubc of ir. In so deplorable an estate, con-
tinned she, he left my Father, and came and found me out at an Aunts of mine who ta-
vored our assedion, and where I had appointed him to come and acquaint me with the an¬
swer he stiould receive. But O Heaven I cryed she, I did noc foresee chac this sencence

<p>After chis cranspore of assedion, soe recounced unto him all ehe resistance^ she had made a-
gainst her Parencs pleasure; her griefand despair, whenas soe saw ehae neicher her prayers,
her rears, nor her reasons could avail; the pain soe was in not to grant OBavia the permission
to steal her away, or to rid himsds ofhis Rival; and fora conclusion, soe acquainted him,
how the tyranny of her Father, and the consideration of her honor, having forced her to a-
bandon OUavio, Co raarry Livio, soe saw her self in so deplorable an estate, as that which
would have made up the bicterest grief of another, was her onely consolation. For, said she
to Alphonso, I had no other in ehis encouncer, ehen Co know chae I raarrycd a raan whora I
could never love, no noc is cime soould cure me of che passion I was in.  Ie was noc because
I was noe resolved for my own glory Co live well wichhim, buc because I had ac least-wise
this consolacion, ehae OUavio could noc susped me of infidelity ; yea and I hop d coo, chat
the more petviso Livio soould be in his humor, and che more cankered and unpleasing he
soould be, che more he would soorten my days.  Judg chen, said she unco him, is these
were the raoft agreeable thoughts that I had, what che rest were.  .

<p>Buc in ehe end, said <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> unto her,'you raarryed Livia? %es, inswered Leonida
wich cears; and the infortunate OEiavie, unable to resolve to see me in the pofsession of an¬
other, departed from <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> to go and seek for the death which he found soon after. For
although I had done an hundred things beyond what was sitting, to oppose my self against my

him, chae seeing I could noe bc marryed wichouc mine own consenc, I soould never have
granted ic, and chae I soould rather have resolved Co dye, chen abandon him. In so reason¬
able a chought, despair seizing on his soul, he went to the Emperors Army, and arrived
there so unluckily, both for himself, and for me, and so opportunely for the design'which he
had, ehae ehe nexe day there was abaeeel soughc; buc before he enered incoic, he desired Co
kc me understand, chac hc wenc noe so rauch eo expofe his life for ehe Emperor, as for che lova

as much grief as is oaano had dyed the very same day, that which you drsired to know
me; but never sprak:o me raore of him, I besecch you; for as you perceive there is a kind
of inhumanity in renewing so sensible an asshdion in my heart, and for which I soould never

</p>
<p>Leonida, having sinished her relation, and wiped her eyes, thanked <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi> for the sad¬
ness which appeared in his countenance; imagining chat it was an essed of the compassion he
cook ot her past misfortunes. But soe knew not, that che same which soe believed to be a sense
of pity, was one of the most violent jealousics thac ever an amorous spirit was tormented
With. For he so strongly perswaded himself that Leomda could noe have the same appre¬
hensions for him, which shc had had for oaavio, as he went away from her, with an as¬
shdion che like whereof was never seen; yet he lesc her wichout giving her any notice there¬
of: but when he was come home, and had sout himselt up alone in his Chamber, he ran over
all thar, word tor word, which ZssSi«/^.« had told him, for ehey had made so powersul an
impression in his Soul, as I think there escaped noc so much as one ouc of his memory. The
more he considered the maccer, ehe more was he consirmed in his jcalousie. Hc remenibrcd,
thac she had loved 0&lt;;7^'://&lt;7, outof sympaehy, ouc of acknowledgmene, and ouc of reason;
that cheir assedion began from their insancy, and continued all their life. Now, said he to
himself, OElavio is not dead in the heart of Leonida, he lives there still in despite of me, and
in such a manner as I cannot chase him from chence. He is noc onely dead Co keep me stom
being revenged of him, buc he is also dead co raign eeernally in her soul. For, added hc,
quice cransported wich grief, infortunace Alphonso, Leonida loves chee noc neicher buc for the
love of him; chou knowest it stom her own mouth, and thou canst not doubt of thy unhap-
piness. Ah how wretched I am, continued he, and how imprudent have I been in laboring
mine own ruine my self I is I had not been curious, I had been the happiest of men, and I
have rendred my self the raoft infortunate that ever was. Thae which I have seen, that
which I have heard; the cears of Leonida, her sighs, her speeches, and the marks of love
and cenderness, which she hath rendred to the memory of OElavio, have not onely destroyed
my present pleasures, and all those which I hoped for, but also my pleasures past. I no longer
marvel, continued he, is Z.soW&lt;&lt; iil-intreats my Rivals, it is for the asoes of O^-J^"* that
she hath this resped and this fidelity, and noc forme. O b\e^ed OElavio, cryed he, how
worthy of envy is chy sate, and how unhappy is mine I This santastical jealousie got such
deep rooting in his heare, as he lost all ress, and almost hs Reason. He wisoed somecimes
thac OElavio were still living, Co ehe end he might be revenged of him; and by and by after
in another quite concrary thought he considered, thae is he had been living Leonida had never
loved him, and in chis manner he was in some fore glad chae he was dead. Fomecimes lil^e-
wise, he comforced himself for ehae Leonida had noc loved OElavio so much as to marry him
against the will of her Parents; but then when be came to remeraber che last mirks of as¬
sedion which Leonida hid received from Octavio, and whac resentment soe had testisicd tor
ic in relating it to him, he entred into despair again. What can I do, said he, that can ever
perswade her that I love her as well as Octavio ? When I soall tell her, that soe raigns in my
heart; ehae her will may dispofe of mine; chac she is absoluee Mistress of my soul; and m
conclusion, that I live noc bue for her alone; wieh one onely word, soe will see Octavioi-
boveallchatl have said; for celling me thac he dyed co eestisie his assedion co her, isco telJ
me, chac he hath incomparably done more then I; chat he raigns always in her minde; and
that I can never precend to the first place.           .u,„„s.

<p>cransporcs; and demanding of himstls whit he desired of Leonida in this occasion ? he knew
not very well what he would have; but chese good intervals lasted so lietle a while,as icmighc
have been laid thac he had no rest ac all. Ir I had a Rival, sa d hc sometimes, I stiould spend a
pare ofmy an^u so in seeking occasion ro hurc him, and co set him ac odds wieh her I loved,
and whom he soould love; I soould observe cheir adions, and knowing chem, I soould make
use ot them, t icher Co crouble cheir dcsigns, or to advance mine, or co cure me of my passion.
Buc as the case stands, I have a stcret Rival inthe heart of Leonida, whom she entertains, I
not knowing, nor being able to hinder it: She weeps, soe sighs, even as soe is talking with
me, for this blessed Phantofm, which soe loves still, and ever will love, since he is no longer
in a condition tobe able to do any thing that can displease her. As for me, said he, I am in far
other terms; for I can easily displease her, and I cannot be agreeable unto her, but because I
reserable OElavio. Who ever saw, continued he, such another thing ? I am jealous, and yec
I have no Rival; I am beloved, and yec I am noe happy; and chrough an excravagancy of my
destiny, or ofmy huraor, I soall never be; \et Leonida do whit she wiW, icis irapofsible chac
ever I should be so. For say I soould raarry her, ie would always run in my mind, thac is by
a miracle OElavio could rise again, soe would abandon me for him : Yea and I beleeve, added
he, that is soe could buy his life with my death, soe would content unto it wieh joy.
</p>
<p>This deadly ehonghe seized so strongly on Alphonso's hearr, as ehere were cercain momencs
in which he had as much hatred for Leonida, as he was capable of. For whereas ehis extra¬
ordinary jealousie agitaced all his passions, and principally hace atid anger, noc finding a nearer
objed co employ them upon, he had for her no doubc very disserent choughcs^ and wholly
rtplen socd wich violence. Love remained nevercheless stiU vidorious over all ehe rest, orco
speak more rightly, all those several passions were but esseds of thae same.
</p>
<p>But in the end, after Alphonso had spent some days in the entertainment of his anguish of
raind, without seeing Leonida, che excreara love which he bore her, carried him eo her
whecher he would or no. He haeh cold her since, ehae being gone ouc of his lodging, wieh
an incenc Co walk in some place ouC ofehe way, chae he mighe muse by himself beceer chen at
home, and exadly run over all the favors which Leonida had conserred on him, to the end
he might compare thera.with those which OElavio had received from her; he acquainted her,
Isay, that against his purpose, and without being aware of it, his steps conduded him to her
door, where he ni sooner was, but without coniulting whit he was co do, hc knocked chere,
and understanding that Leonida was wichin, he wene up diredly co her charaber wichouc ad-
vercising her of ic, though ie was noC his custom so eo do; for Leonida seldora ever saw him
ac htr houle, when soe was alone ehere; bu: at chis time Alphonso was noc in a case regulatly
to observe good manners. When as Leomda first saw him, she received him somewhat cold¬
ly ; tor whereas he had been a good while without sending to her, or enquiring after tier, she
thought it was buc just to use him so.
</p>
<p>hskox Alphonso, how difordered soever his mind was, yet durst he not make shew at the
beginning ot chat which he had in his heart; for resped and Reason had so much power over
him, as he could not resolve to discover his sofscring to a person who caused ir, until he stiould
be extream ypressd thereunto by her. After Leonida bad received him somewhat coldly,
arid had obierved the change which jealousie had made in Alphonso\ face, the anger wherein
she was in for his neglcd turned into unquiemess. She was afraid left some mishap had be¬
fallen hini; or through some adventure, which was unknown to her, Alphonso stiould accuse
herunjustlyof som. desed of assedion: so this belies soe used him more favorably; asked

<p>I do not think, answered yi//&gt;Ao»/i, with as much inguisti, as Z»sj»i^^ had gallantry that
It IS as easie for you to restore tranqu llity unto my Soul, as it was easie for you to deprive me
ofit: for, continued he, I have no Rivals, whom you can ill intreat, and yet I am ehe most
jealous chac ever was. I donor understand you. si\d Leonida tohim wich more coldness
chen before; and is you do noc explain your self becter, I soall bcleeve that either you have
lost your Reason, or chac vvich a premedieaccd design you purpose eo break oft with me:
Buc cake heed Alphonso, of leaving me long in ehis suspicion, for fear left, whereas I am
proud and disdainsul, I do not prevenc you, and it be too lace for you chtn co have recoursc
to my goodness.
</p>
<p>Alphonso, surprized boch wieh Leonida's discourse, and the manner wherewich soe spake,
resolved at lengch sreely to tell her the cause of his grief. I know very well, said he unto her,
that I am going to speak in vain for my self, and indeed it is rather out of despair then Reason
that I am carried to obey you. Know then, continued hc, that I am jealous, and that I sbill
be so eternally, since the Rival that surmounts me in your heare can never dye; for eo conceal
the truth from you no longer, the bXt^tdO^avio is eheobjedof my jealousie. The tears
which you shed for his memory are the cause of those which I ihall pour forch all my life time;
the sighs which you setch for him,sl:iall always make me sigh;and his past selicicy soall b^et the
misery of all che rest of my days. You have loved him so much,coneinued he,and yon love him
somuch still,ehat I can find no place in your Soul: Hc must raign there alone,for indeed you do
not suffer me there but only eo conserve the memory ofhim the better. Ah cruel man! cryed
Leonida hearing him speak in this sort, ts it pofilible that you have the inhumanity to open the
Tomb of OElavio to persecute me ? and in stead of weeping with me, or at leastwise of be¬
moaning and comforting ms, you are so audacious as to give ms marks of your hatred to a
person, whom I have so much loved, and whose meraory is still so dear unto me; and yet in
gratesul as you are,said she to him, you owe ehe asstdion which I bear you to that Httle resem¬
blance yon have with OElavio; bue as this inforcunace creacnre hath been the cause of ie, ^o
shall he likewise give an end co ic: for in regard of ehae which you have said eo me, I ordain
younever to speak co me,and never to see me more. Why do noe you soue your self up then
in OEiavio's Tomb, answered Alphonso,svnoe you can love none bue him ? Reply no sureher to
me, inhumane thae you are,said she to him, and take from my sighc ehe petsecutor of Leonida,
and the enemy of OUavio.
</p>
<p>Alphonso seeing Leonida in such choller, and not able to give her a good reason, either tor
the maintainir^ of his error, or for che obtaining of his pardon, went away more jealous then
before. Alas, said he to himself, how sensible she is on that side I what a powersul mark tl
her love is her choller I isshe had loved me, she would have used me after another manner;
she would have caken pity of my weakness; she would have given me some new proof ot
her assedion; but she could not disguise her heart; all her thoughts have been soxOaavio,
and all her words have been against me. In this opinion Alphonso got him home, with an
intent to obey Leonida exadly, and never to see her again. As indeed he canne no more at her,
and thac hc mighc avoyd meeting with her any where, he seigned himself s'ck. /.s&lt;)^/rs^, ic¬

wail OEiavio with ehe more libcrey.  This thought for all that was noc the most powersul in
his heare; the impofsibilicy of seeing Leonida, redoubled his desire of ic, and lovc being

But no sooner did che Phantofm of OElavio presenc ic self eo his imiginacion, no sooner did see
all the tears and sighs of Leonida to remembrance, buc he re-encred inco his former suries.
He made an hundred irapoflible wishes, which destroyed one anocher, and led a very irksom
and melancholick life.  Daring thae time he wroee divers Leccers Co Leonida, according co
the divers thoughts wherein he was; buc when as soe perceived so great an inequalicy in his
mind, and such marks of an unseded Reason, soe returned no answer chereunco; and alchough
she loved Alphonso so much, as Co be excrearaly grieved Co lose him, yec could she noe iraagine
how she might cure him ofthis saneasie: soehae finding no expcdienc for ic, and being very
much incensed against him, soe lived wich so much anguiso, thais Alphonso hidV.nowx\het

thac slbe did noc grieve more for the deach of C&gt;&lt;??4v/ss, then for che loss of his assedion.  Ic
was in ehis fore then that Leonida and Alphonso lived until thae inforcunace day, wherein we
were constrained eo forsake <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>.  And I make no doubc bue ehae Alphenjo's despair In¬

scarcely been upon ehe Sea wichouc a Tempest, wichouc fear of deach, and wichouc extream
sorrow for the loss we sustained there, they had never talked together in privace during this
troublesom Navigaeion; buc when we were ae Marocco, and ae chofe eimes, wherein we had
the libercy eo see and speak eo one another, Leonida, who desired co conceal die cerms where¬
in soe was wieh Alphonso, eneercaining him wieh indisserent things, found that his under¬
standing was as deeply wounded at Morocco, as it had been at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, with this disserence
nevertheless, thac ac the first time he spake to her he moved her eo anger, and the second cime
he moved her to pity.  What is the reason, said he to her wieh cears, ehae I can neicher con¬

ner do you think I may do ic I* is he were jealous of theSrench Marquiss, of <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, or of
any ocher, ic would noc be ditsicule for me to satishe him. The coldness which I would shew
to them, should soon see him ae rest; and is ehere were no ocher means for ir, I would de¬
prive my self absolutely of cheir company co preserve ic; bue as ehe case stands I know no
remedy for ie. Ie is from my self thac Alphottjo hach learnc the assedion which I have born
to OElavio, I cannoc unsay ic; and is I should be so base as Co swear co him chac I have noe
loved him so much as he imagines, I should cell a lye to no purpose; it being very certain that
he would give mare credic to my tears, then to my latter speeches; and then again, that is
a ching I could never do. Counsel me chen, continued she, how I soall carry my self. I
profess unco you, that I was chen very much perplexed whac counsel co give her, for I saw
no assured means chac could cure Alphonso.- Nevercheless after I had mused a little, my opi¬
nion was, thac the only thing which she could do was, eo endeavor eo perswade Alphonst,
thae she loved him as much as sh; hid loved Octavio, as indeed, I chink I did not oblige her
to tell an untruth.
</p>
<p>At first Leonida told me that this would serve to no purpose, bue finding nothing to sland
with more reason, she resolved eo follow my advice: So chac the first time soe could speak
with Alphonso in private, his melancholy still increasing, soe demanded of him, whether be
were resolved to live long in that manner ? Truly no, answered he, tor I do not doubt, bnc
from the mi'ery which I seel, deach will come stiortly and deliver me. Is it not pofsible, sud
she, thac Alphonso should make use of his Reason in this encounter ? I perceive very wtll,
answered he,that you have some pity ofthe hurt you have done me,bnt know ;hat it is not that
which I desire;in the estate wherein OElavio is I could endure that you soould havecnmpassicjij
for him, provided you would have assedion for me; but I could not endure, that you should
have love for him,&amp; have nothing but pity sox AIphotiso.Wha change,laid soe unto him.is there
come CO me, since the time chac you were conecnted with my asstdion ? have I \o\edOctAvt»
more,or have I loved you less ehen I didi» in no wise ae all,I swear uneo you.Wherforc ehen since
I am not changed for you, are you changed for me ? It I had known my unhappiness sooner,
replyed he, I stiould have been less unhappy; ie being cercain, chat I soould noc have engaged
my self so straitly in the love of a person, thac could never love so much as soe had loved, ic is
true, said she unto him, chac I have loved Octavio as much as I was able rolovc inthe i^e
wherein I was- and icis crue also ehae his meraory is dear and precious unto me: buc wno
hach cold you chac I have noe ehe fame choughts for you ? I know ic from your own moutn

<p>in divers occasions; you have many times bewailed his absence as much, as I could pretend to
be lamented by you, is I had lost mv life in your servics, and for my last unhappiness he dyed
in speaking to you of Inve. It raay be, is hr had lived lonj^er, you would have repented the
tears, which now you sofd tor him; buc as che case stands, ciureis a sh\dow of OElavio te-
maining, which is in stead of his person to you, chac pofsesses your soul, and will not suffer
you CO have such thoughts for another.
</p>
<p>How unjust you are, {i\d Leonidauntofim, to speak to me thus I howsoever, since I am
resolved ro try whether I can draw your rainde out of that diforder, whereunto this strange
jealousie bath carryed it, proraise me, that it by my discourse I can let you see, that you
have received more testiraonies of my assedion, then I have given to the infortunace Octavio,
you will then repent you of your error, restore tranquillity to your soul, and leave raine in
rest. Alphonso, after he had withstood it a while, in saying that soe propounded an irapof¬
sible thing to him, and by consequence he wasnot to answer unto it, resolved for all thac Co
hear her, and promised her ehae it soe kept her word with him, he would crave pardon for
his fault, and would live better for che sucore. Aseer ehey had raade ehis agreemene j cell me,
Alphonso, said soe unto him, is I can raake ie appear eo you, ehae since ehe day wherein I
permicced you to serve me, you never have had occasion co complain of me; and is lean
soew you, ebac ehe unhappy Octavio, is he were living, mighc wich justice accuse me of
lietle assedion; would you noe have reason ehen cobe contented? Thae will not be enough,
answcrcd Alphonso, for it may be that you have never given me just cause to complain, and
that you have given Of?&lt;ix'io occasion soto do, and yet forall that I cannot be happy: Buc
that which I desire is, you would let me know, that you have not done any ching for Octa¬
vio, which you would noc have done for me, and chac I chink will noe be easie for you co
perform.
</p>
<p>I will peradventure soew you yec raore, xepXyed Leonida, and Co begin Co cure you, is ie
not true, Alphonso, that che original of che assedion which I bear Co yoa, is far raore advan¬
tageous CO you, chen ehae which I have born Octavio ? when I began eo wish him well, con¬
tinued soe, I was in an age, wherein perchance chac which I chen called love, was none-
wherein I counted for great services petty things, which now I should not regard; and
wherein I aded without knowledg, and without judgment. I, said Alphonso interrupting
sier, but not without inclination, which is that which renders assedions the stronger and more
durable. I agree with you therein,said soe untohim,but howsoever I had this indinaeion in an
age, wherein ac h'st my reason did noe corabae with ir, for I had none at thae cime. Thac is
the cause, said Alphonso why ie is so well secled in your soul. And chac is che cause, replyed
Leomda, why I do not know whether it were any whit strong, since I did not raake resist¬
ance against it. Butasforyou////&gt;/:;.«/o, when as you began to please me, and thac ravin.
cl.nac.on carryed me to hke of your services, Iwas in an age wherein my Reason was in a
condition to oppose it self against it; as indeed, ic did resist ie as rauch as ic could. You had
eo vanquiso ,n my heart notonely that wisdora and that modesty, which permits not a wo¬
man to engage her self l.ghdv tn assedion to a raan ; buc had also che meraory of OaavTotl
formount, in forcing me, ,s one may say so, to comrait a greater infidelity against him then
when as I abandoned him to obey my Father; seeing it is cercain chac I mirryed LJ,^ wS

perceive very well Chen, said she unco him, thac in the beginning of our good-will "l eave
you more marks of a strong indination, then ever 0&lt;?i'4^;/o received of me, seeine when I
loved him, I was in an age, wherein Battery, complacency, and galLnrry, do extreamly touch
tne minde. OElavio wiS my first conquest, and the first manthat toldme I had somethii-
that vvas pleasing in me: and by this reason, ic was almost impofsible for me not to have ad^-
mitced of his assedion: But for yours, I accepted of ic in soch a manner, as would not per¬
mit you to doubt of mine, is you be reasonable. And to pass from the beginning to the
progress of it, tell me, I pray you, what is chat I have done for him as long as he lived.' All
things, answered Alphonso; and whereas raore marks of assedion are given by grief, then
by joy, wichout running over all the complacencies which you have had for him, I will only
say thae you h.ve wept an hundred times for him, and ehae all ehe love which I have bom you
hath noc coft you a cear,
</p>
<p>Ic IS not time yet to discover my weakness unto you, replyed Leonida; and to answer pre¬
cisely to thae which you say, as long as we lived well together, it is true that I have not wept,
buc it was because you were not unhappy; aud I doubc noc but is our assedion had been
chwarted a? Octavio's and mine was, I should have had the fame sorrow.  And then again
you have this advancage over that infortunate man, that I have not forsake n you, as I did him;
for indeed is I had known how to love persedly, I had not raarryed Livio, I had not aban¬
doned Octavio, I had not been the cause of his death.  Therefore it is, answered Alphonso,
that to repair that sailing, in not \ofingOctavio enough, you love his asoes and his Tomb j
you cannoc speak of him wichouc cears; you cannoc tsiink of him without sighing; and it
may be is I should lose my life, I soould not give you a minute of unquietness. Ah crutl
creature I oxyed Leonida, must I acknowledg my weakness unto you ? Yes, insensible as you
are, said she unto him, I will resolve co do ic, coche end I may cure your rainde, or haveso
just an occasion co coraplain of you, as absolucely Co cease from loving you. Ic is crue, said
she unto him, thae I have wepc for Octavio; buc ic is erue eoo, chac spite of che grief, which
your capricious humor hath pofsessed me with, I can assure you, not onely that I soould dye
with asshdion, is your death stiould happen, but that I cannot call that a life which! have
led since thus unjust passion hath troubled my rest in eroubling yours. In sine, Alphonso, I
have shed as many cears for che fear alone of lofing vour good-will, chough you were faulty
towards me, as ever I sticd for Octavio, who dytd lor my sake; so that is I ara unjust, it is
onely to him, and no way eo you. Ie is erue, ehae he hach rendred me all the testimonies of
assedion that I could attend sro.m him ; but ic is crue also, that I have not done the same; I a-
bandoned him to marry Livio, and I have been capable of a second love, which wichout
doubc must be stronger chen ehe ocher was, because ie haeh been able eo comforc me for the
loss I had sustained : For you, Alphonso, ie is noc so ; you have no occasion co complain of
me, I have done for you all chac reasonably I could do; and whenl gave you a mark of my
desire Co please you, ic iscome copass ehae oue ofan unheard of inhumanicy, youhavemade
use of the same Arms, which I gave you, to combat me; my ingenuiey hath been th: cause
of your malice; and raine innocency hath made your crime,  in conclusion, Alphonso, kti
she unto him, with a countenance wherein appeared more grief then choller, you must re¬
solve upon the choyce of two things, either to quie your error, or never co see me more.
For, concinued she, I can no longer endure eo see you in ehe dispofieion you are in; buc know,

<p>lieve chac noching in the world is so dear to me as Alphonso. Have pity of my weakness,
answered he, and is you will have me comfort my self, say nor, that nothing intheworld

my incenrion was such as you would have my words co be.

<p>I soould never have done is I soould repeac all Alphonso's questions, and all Leonida's an¬
swers ; ie soall suffice me chen co say, that ascer an hundred odd precaueions, co assure himsds
of theXove of Leonida igiin^OElavio's phancofra, whereuneo chis amiable creacure ouc of
her goodness answered seriously, he recurned co Reason, and cercain days after craved pardon
of her for his error, and absolucely proraised her never eo sall inco ic again.  I believe noc¬
wichstanding ehae he was noc so soon rid of ic, and chough he haeh noe spoken Co Leomda
since of ic, becauseic was one of cheir condicions. yec he hach noe for all chac lesc ofs having
raany eimes very odd choughcs.  This dispuee and chis peace were so secrec araongst us, ehae
I was soe alone who was acquainced wich ic; and chac was ie which perswaded Horatio and
the rest, ehae Alphonso's melancholy proceeded from che jealoulie he was in of ehe assedion
which///y seemed eo carry to Leonida; bue indeed ic was thac which I have declared un¬
to you.
</p>
<p>The Marquis seeing ehae Sophronia hdd her peace, and chaC Leonida was going Co speak,
as is soe would have excused Alphonso: Iemust be acknowledged, said he, thac there is a
marvelous diversicy amongst men; and thatwhich makes me most to wonder, is eo see by
example, ehae <hi rend="italic">Alphonso</hi>, who in all ocher cncouncers haeh a greac deal of wic and discrecion,
and would in indisserenc raaccers wichouc doubc chink che same things chac I do, should sall
inco an iraagination so far distant from all good sence. I think, answered Leonida smiling,
thac in raatter of love, it raay be said that you are both of you an objed of adrairation and
wonder the one to che ocher, hue wieh chis glorious disserence for Alphonjl, chac his san¬
tastical jealousie was noe derived bue from an excess of passion; and chac your inconstancy
proceeds noe bue from a desed of love.
</p>
<p>Is che very excess of Reason, replyed ehe Marquis, comes near to solly, I bdieve chat ehis
excess of love IS noe far from ie: and is ie be crue, chac byeheesl^cds one may judg of che
cause, acknowledg, siix Leonida, chae this inconstancy, which you call desed ot love in me
gave you noc so much unquiecness, when I abandoned you for anocher, as chis excess of pas¬
sion haeh been che cause of to you; and consess withall at least, that icwerebeccee cobe
loved of a man of my humor, then of chat of Alphonso. It would be more advantageous,
replyed z;««,^4 very roundly, because as long as one soould not beloVed hue by an incon¬
stanc man « you are. one soould noc be expofed eo ehe hazard of too rauch engaging

<p>I consess, said Sophronia laughing, as well as the rest of the Assembly, that in this ncr.si.n
I am of the Marquis his side, for / cannot but follow Reason wheresoever / meet with it  /
perceive, said Leonida then, that all the world abandons me, and cl.ac/ have need of"//
;^o«&gt;'s assistancc for the vanquistiing of so many Eoemies.  I am generous enough answ^er'
ed the Marquis, to go and setch him my self; and saying so, he went and called l^M,„r/
Who was almost sstiamed to come unto che Company again, making no queshon but tliat tbej
had condemned his jealous humor.  And whereas Leonida perceived it, Fear not, said she
untohim, as long as/am on your side, yoUwill haveno Enemies which you may'not over
come; and doubt not chat che remembrance of an error, which / have pardoned, can make
me angry with you.  / believe you to be too just, replyed he, for me to susped you of any
soch ching, onely s fear that you will be accused for using too ranch goodness towards me
and thatby this means/ should bcthe ciuse of condemning a vertue in you, which makes
one to be commended in all che world besides.
</p>
<p>Is we engage our selves in making of'Coraplements, said Sophronia interruprit^ bim, the
Marquis will noc be able Co pay me chae Co day which he ows me, and so wc should spend the
time less pleasingly chen ocherwise we mighc do is we gave him audience, for I assure my sdt
chac he cannoc cell us any thing but whac will delighc us. I do not know, answered tbc Mar¬
quis, whether this discourse be advantageous co me or no, howsoever, since I have promistd
to relate thac unco you which besell me here in Conslantinople, /will noc break my word.
And ehen again, continued he, co speak sincerely unco you, / soall have a soare in the plea¬
sure which / shall give you; it being raoft cerain, that I ara of a huraor to receive more satis-
sadion by recounting the adventures which have happened unto me, be they never so happy,
then I had ac such time as they arived uneo me. In sine, continued he, I corasort my sds soe
misbaps in celling chem to others, and I augment my good fortune in publishing it.
</p>
<p>Seeing it is so, did Leonida, haste you to satishe J'epArowia, in sacissying your self, and be
not of the number of those, who make one hope so long for an indisserent pleasiire, as one
is not obliged to them for it. All the Company having added their intreacies co Leonida's
discourse, the Marquis acquitted himself of his promise in this fore.

<p>The History ofthe coo gooi Slave.
</p>
<p>N Ever was any so happy in servitude as I, and never did happiness produce an essed like
unco chae which lam going eo recounc unco you. You remember wichouc doubr,
that when we arrived all at ConstantinopU, and landed at the Port, there was a man, who
lightly imagining by the chains we had on us, rhat we were destined tobe sold, and finding
fomething in my person chat pleased him, bought me for the price chae was demanded of
him. This raan, who was my first Master, carried me home to his house; and whereas he
was one of the raightiest men in Con sI ant inopU, Iwas comforted in my raisfortune tofee,
thac ae leastwise is I were a Slave, it should be in a place where I soould have corapanions.
I was no sooner come thither, but to testifie that he had some indination for me, he caused
the chains that I had on me to be taken ofs, to give me lighter; so that desiring to be ac¬
knowledging for this favor, and render my slavery also raore easie, by raaking my self be be¬
loved of thote, who raight ill-intreat me, I became in ewo hours ehe best Slave that was in
Consiantinople. I did not only that which was ordained me, but I also helped others Co do
that which had been commanded them. Andwhereas it is the custom of theTurkj, as I
learned ascerwards, carefully to observe all their new Slaves at their first coming, my Master
was a witness of all the services which I rendred him, and seemed Co be so sacished with m/,
that all the other Slaves began already Co hate me.
</p>
<p>The first day being past over in this sort, che next morning my Master would needs have
two wives thac he had CO see me; he coraraanded then that I soould go to their lodging, and
whereas I knew noc whither they led me, I was so surprized with their beauty, as I could
not forbear testisying a great deal of joy by my carriage at it. I found them so much the
fairer, because for four and twenty hours before I had seen none buc black Slaves; I sabted
them then very civilly, and beheld them at leastwise with as rauch aeceotion, as ehey had in
considering me: and wichouc regarding whecher my Master cook ic well or no, and wichouc
remembring chad was a Slave, I choughc of nothing buc of raaking soew with low obcy-
sances, as ofcen as I could judg by their behavior that they spoke of me, chae I was as re-
spedsul for chem, as I was serviceable and diligene for cheir husband. Bue ae lengch h^ com¬
manded me Co wichdraw, which presently I did; erue indeed ie is, ehae ie was noc wichout
turning back my look to the place where I lesc cwo fair women, and Cruly I selc some pain in
separacing my selffrom th!m.
</p>
<p>I was no sooner gone down, and had done something which had been enjoyncd me, but
I went with all speed into a back Courr, upon which the windows ofthese womens chamber
opened, out ot a hope that I might peradventure see them again : But by ill fortune my Ma¬
ster was there as well as they; so as having observed that I had nothing to do ehere, I cannot
etllyou whecher he suspeded the truth or no, howsoever without having any cause Co com¬
plain of me, he commanded me to be conduded the next morning to che Markec where
Slaves are sold, and that there they soould rid themselves of me at any price whatsojver. I
nust consess to you that this change forprized me; nevertheless whereas I comforc my scls
eMy, as you know, in all things, I resolved for patience.
</p>
<p>He that next bought me was a Merchant oiTripoli, whom I served as exadly as the ocher:
And whereas in these kind of houses the restraint is not so great, as in those of persons of qua¬
lity. I had some content to see that in serving my Mister, I soould at leastwise have ehe sa¬
tissadion to meec sometimes witha wise thac he had, andtwoGrs^ Slaves that served her,
and that certainly did not soime their Nation. I got their good-will che very first day, with¬
out being able to tell you how I d^d ic. Is they saw that I hid a purpose to go forth, they
went in all haste to open me the door; is I carried anything, they presently ofsered co help
me; in condusion I won theit inclination in soch fore, as my Mister hated me for it. For
when he was withdrawn to his chamber, his Wise and the Slaves praised me so rauch, as out
ot jealousie and covetouinels he resolved to be rid ofme. He feared left his wise would love
me too wdl, and that his Slaves would agree together with me to rob him
</p>
<p>In this thought, he conduded m.'himlUs tothe Market; buc whereas he was known to

lo forward to sell him.                ^
</p>
<p>In this opinion no body bought me the first day, nor on the scond neither. Howbeit mi;
Master, having observed that his Wise and Slaves were very gbd tofee me brouRbthome
again, he purposed to part wieh me for less ehen he had incended. hoping ehereby to be the
sooner nd of me. Bur I.e considered nor, that ouc of ehe opinion tbe world had of him the
less he should ask tor me, che more he would be croubled to sell me. And verily there was ne.
ver any pleasantcr thing, then th^ choller of this covetous wretch when as he could noe resolve
to lofo his money, and was constrained in the evening to carry back to his house a man, whom
he beheld as his Rival, and yec had no cause to complain of him. For whereas I was noc
Ignorane, thac Slaves in this Country are at cheir Mssters mercy, the starof some crofs ad.
venture made me very prudent, so chac as long as my Master could see me I did noe answer
che complacencies of his Slaves. Wherefore noc being able either to sdl me, to complain of
me, or to resolve so give me my liberty, because he would noe lose bue a parr of rhe
money he had given for me, he was in an unquietness which I im noe able co represent unto
you.
</p>
<p>Bue ae last on che third day a Boluchbajsi, who had cheapened me when sitst he would have
sold me, and who imagined that I could have no other desed ehen of being uofaithsul,
tempted by ehe good peni worch, resolved to take me into his service. And to securc himsds
from the vice whereof be suspeded me, he purposed to employ me in his Garden, untill such
time as he had made tryal of my siddicy. I was then conduded home Co his house, where I
no sooner was, bue having given me wherewich to labor the ground I found mysclsatsiist
somewhat troubled. Nevertheless whereas I had whil'st I was in the Wars helped many
timesoutof a bravery Co ast up Trenches, and raise Fores, I became in cwo hours so good
a Gardiner, as I levelled an Alley betcer then all they of Conslantinople could have
done.
</p>
<p>My address having pleased my Mister, he broughc three Wives thae he had, followed by
all cheir Slaves, Co see my work, which ehey admired; and passing from tbe commendation
ofmy work Co chat of my person, chey said eoo much for ei.emsclves, is ehey took any plea¬
sure in seeing me. Nevertheless ic was noc chac alone which made me change my dwelling,
buc ic was for chac, my Master being gone a lictle way ofs, and ehae I saw all ehese women

ver heard of In sine, this mutmuring and this revolt went so far, that this man to be at rest
resolved to sell me away, which he did the next day witha great deal of rsgcec, becanse I
pleased him excrearaly.
</p>
<p>Itwas my destiny to be bought by an/^r«?^/^«Physidan; for whereas he had asked co
whac eraployment I had been put in my Masters hou'"e, and bad been answered that I was an
excellent Gardiner, be iraagined that I knew some Simples, and consequently might be nse¬
sul to him, by reason the Physick of this Country consisU much thert^n. In essed, he ac¬
knowledged that be bad n§ver been served more diligently ; and ajb-it I was very ignorant in
all the things that he made me do, yet my address and considence supplyed thae desed. This
Physician had ewo daughters, who having lost their rapther lived alone wieh him; sothat
whil'st he was in bis visits, I had sometimes tbe pleasure to see thero. For whereas the wo¬
men ofC&lt;"»/?'««/'«&lt;'/'/^ are very curioas oftheir beauty, thedssisetseey hadtogainme, to ike
end I might give them catain waters for the face, which thsirsatkr would not let them
have, mide them use me veiy civilly j and for sejir I soould be put away, tsis y caught me ali
thac I had to do cbe best tl»ey couW.
</p>
<p>I had no sooner made an end of whatsoever the Arabian Physician hsid commanded me to
do at his going forth, but I went to entertain his daughters at a lattice window that was very
low, and teach them new means to become s«is, whkhl sakd I had learnt in <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> ; sothat
when my Master came home, he never found me araongst his essences: yet he could not cora¬
plain of me, beause whatsoever he had ord*ined me eg dp, was always performed. He iraa¬
gined then, that since I wasso diligent, he wu to give me more employment, for fear left
ouc ofidlencss I soould have coo much conversaition wirh his daughcers; bue whereas chey
were dextrou«, they percdved his design, so as finding that tobulie me, besides necessary
things he had left nie great store of Grite roots to prepare for the Bacbs, which are so srequent
in th« Country, they made me give them part of item; so chat all three vvorking,the business
was quickly dirpatched,and we had time enough bdides for conversation: Inso rauch thae my
Master coming home in tbe evening, wich an opinion chac he should find me very busie, and
a belies tbat he had wee wich an excellenc cxped;&lt;nt to keep me from eneercaining his daugh¬
ters, he wa» strangdy surprized to stc me Isbor ao more then I was wont to do. Neyetchdess
hs could not resolve to quarrel with me , having never been so well served as
by me.
</p>
<p>In this unqaietnesjs he itootk a new resolution, which was to en/oyn mt to wait upon him
in the streees, and toiegve himin my place who was usually to accompany him. Buc ehese
maids were no kss witey in this occasion thtn the other; they won this Slave with money
and dealc in siich fori, as wben we came home, there was nothing done of all that had beeri
ordained him ; and this out of the hope that their father would alter his mind, and not carry
me any more abroad wirh bim. This shght nocwichstanding wrou^t that which they ex¬
peded tiot; for the Physician, seeing that when he carried me abroad with him, none of his
worli was done; and that when I stayed at hc«ne, hisdaughtersalwayssentforme, resolved
to sell ,me. And truiy I was not forry for it, in regard I bad bat litde knowledg in the min¬

It like a man that was nat ignorant thereof; I knew of what temper it was and bv m, h.
havior they judg d, that War without doubt hid been my Trade.   '  ^ ^
</p>
<p>Now you must understand, chac ehese cwo JanizarUs had each of them a fair Slave • and
that as long as I was wich them, though they were both of one company, yet were thev ofa
disserent Squadron, so chae ehey were noe boch upon che Guard at one and rhe same day bv
vvhich means one of them always remained ae home, as it were the Guardian of the tw^
Slaves. In the mean cime I acquieced my sds admirably of the employment had been con-
s.irdnnm.-; and never had their Arms beenso wdl ktpr, as since the time that Ihadbecn
in their s rvic ■. But is they were contented with me, no less were the two Slaves though I
contribured nothing rhertunto: For by reason of that which I told you in the beginning I
was never kss above , then inallthtse several encounters, albeit I was never so much^be-
lovs d. These fair Slaves did not for all that testifie unto me both at once the good- will thev
bore me; and out of a particular address they chofe thediy whexeinthefar^iz,aryth;ii\\i
their M.'st'.r was upon the Guard, so chac he which stayed ac home very well perceived the
care and coraplacency which his friends Slave had for me ; but whereas he was contented with
my service, andsiw that i contributed nothing thereunto, be did not advertise him of it.
I he same roason which this Soldier had, tbe other had also; and by this means I was for some
time equally beloved of both the two sanizaries, and ofthe two Slaves. It hapned at
I-ngth, that by order of War these two sanizaries were put into cne and the same Squadron,
and thereby would have been constrained to leave me alone with their Slaves, being obliged
to go upon the Guard the fame day, had they not bethought themselves of telling one ano¬
ther that which they knew concerning the good-will these Wenches bore me. Wherefore con-
sidering how they were equally interessed in the business, they disputed a good while betwixt
themselves what they were to do. At last,though they loved me exceedingly,they sdd me that
very day, not being able to resolve to leave me alone with their Slaves.
</p>
<p>The santasticalness ofmy fortune so wrought, that a Musician ofthis Country, who tacght
to play on the only Instrumenc which they have at Consiantinople, and that holds somewhat
of the form ofthe Lutes of/^-j/y, took me into his service, and carried me home with him.
The next day after my coming chicher, when he was gone abroad, I rook one of thoseTari^i/J
Luces sfor he had many of them,) and whereas this Instrumenc hath buc one string.I thought,
thac is Icould put more toir, ehis Harmony icmay bc would please my Master, and might
obcain my liberty. I cook one of chofe Lutes then secretly, and going toone ot those that
makes them, who dwelt hard by rhis Musicians house, and whom! bad by chance taken
notice of as I came thither, I direded him how I would have it done.  At length I made him
sie this Luce for seven ranks ot strings; and whereas I bad still one of those enamelled Gold
rings left, which are worn rather out ot galliniry. then for their value, I gave it him tor pay-
men: ofhis pains.  Being returned home, I put strings to this Lute, and beginning to touch
it, I drew to me with my harmony my Masters wise, two sisters that he had. and three
Slaves.  So thae when he returned, he found me in the midst ofall these women, who barken¬
ed to me wieh a greac dealof delight and attention.  Ac first he was angry,both with them.and
with me; but coming to hear me himsds, he pardoned thera their curiofity, and hoping to
gain good store of money by my means, he caressed me extraordinarily. He undertook not¬
withstanding to maintain against me, that in something thdr Lutes were more persed then
ours; because, saidhe, having but one string they can never be outof tune.  This pleasant
reason being noching hard eo be destroyed, I raade bira easily comprehend, thac my Mulick
was beecer then his; and che very nexe day he carried me coall cbe houses, whither he used
to go; where they had no sooner heard me, but chey would hear him no more.  This man
being as proud as he was covetous, although I raight have got him a great deal of money, yec
could he noe resolve Co carry me any more along wieh him ; so ehae purpofing eo learn eo play
as I did, he lesc me ae home; and mornings and evenings only I took him out Ldlons. But
I was noc long boch h'S Master and his Slave ; for whertas' hc was \o less jealous then proijl,
knowing thac his Wise, hisSistets, and his Slaves, did nochir:g buc barken to me, ouc of a
capticiousness worchy of him, he resolved Co sell me. Nevcrchdess ic was nor wichouc a

<p>This last passion bdng the stronger, he soughc to rid himstls m-; and had so niuch malice,
that to keep me from teaching some other that which he would not learn of me himsds, he
went to sdl me at the Port, where I was presently bought by theCapcam of a Galley, who
wasupongoingforth to scour the Seas. Iconssss. that this adventure vexed mej for consi¬
dering that I kityoUi\\itConslanti»opU, without kno wing whither I went, I wasoutof
quiet above an hour at least; howbeit I hoped to meet with soms good fortune which I did
not foresee; and in this thought I served my new Master with as much care as I could, yec;
was I not long wich him, for whereas he was avaricbus, and had no need hut of one Slave,
that could row, he was perswaded that he might sdl me for somuch, as he raight therewith
get two in stead of one ; so that all the endevor which I had used for cwo days space, Co
soew him ehe greacest address I could poflibly express, served noe buc Co raake me be sold a-
way ehe sooner, and to give me a Master of an higher condition then those last I had had ; for
whereas the price which he asked lor me was great enough. I was no longer cheapned but by
persons of quality. The Cadilesquer then of Natolia became my Master, and to his house I
was carried; but from him I parted a little after for the like reasons; ehen was I encercained
by ehe Muphti; and ehe next day after I past into the service of the Aga of the sanizaries,
where they chat sought tor me by the Grand Signior's coraraand found me. Indeedie iscrue,
that I lliould not have been long ehere, for / was Co have been sold away again the very
same day.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, after I had had for my Master a great man of ehe Pore, a Merchant of Tri-
poU, an Arabian Physician, two sanizaries, a Piaycr upon the Luce, an Asrican Captain of
a Galley, the CadtU I attcroi Natolia, the Muphti,ind the y^^^i of the sanizaries; after,
I say, I had eqjally satished them all, Forcune ac last restored ms eo libercy. And cruly I was
noc a little obliged to het for so far complying wich my humor, as not to lee me wear cha same
chains long; ic being raoft cercain chae I soould have been dead wich grief, is she had used
the raaecer ocherwise. For is ic credible, coneincd the Marquis, chac a raan, who could not
live long under ehe Empire of one onely Mistress, whose dominion is incomparably more
gentle ehen a Merchane of Tripoli's, could have lived long under chae of an imperious Ma¬
ster? And CO say all in a word, icis easie Co be iraagined, chae is I had still worn but one
chain, ic would have seemed very heavy eo me, seeing even bracelets of hair would incommo¬
date me is I soould wear them long. Change is the charra ofall pleasures, and the ease of all
sorrows. There is not an evil, how lictle soever ic be, chae would noe become insupportable
tome, is I soould always endure ic ascer the fame manner; nor is chere any which I should
noe bear wich pacienc-, is it were noc always ehe same. For in sine, whecher it be for the
pains of che body, or for the pains of the minde, one cannot pass from one evil Co another,
without some moments c s rest. Change hath this marvellous in it, that in pain ic sds, mau¬
ger tbac which we hei, it diverts, ic eases, and sortisies us. And of what humor soever we
be, wc chink not so much of the evil that is arrived to us, but thac we have some joy for
that which hath left us.
</p>
<p>You are Ceo dcquent on this subjed, said Leonida interrupting che Marquis, and is I might
be credited herein, both for the interest of publique society, and good manners, you should
be prohibited from ever speaking in the behalf of inconstancy: For whereas you have a great
of wit; whereas also you speak as a man interessed; and as a man thac maintains his own
cause, you may ac leneth p rvert the good thoughts of some. Is it be true, added Sophro-
nia,thu one easily perlwades others.when as ont is raightily perswaded himself, I acknowledg
thac by this reason, rhe Marquis soould be tbe raoft dangerous Orator in the world. Is I had
establisoed my dodrine well, answered he, you soould be constrained Co acknowledg, chac it
isnoc contrary either CO common socicey, or ehepubliqac good. For never haeh any incon¬
stanc man precipitated himself; never hath any inconstanc raan killed his Rivals, nor ill-in-
treaced bisMiltress; and sire, sword, and poyson, are chings of no use in nature to him • but
heleavesrhciiuo the dispofing ot all those obstinate Lovers, who always render theraselves
unhappy, m following this constancy, which you cerm che Queen of all Vertues. We are noc
ro judg always of things replyed Don^, by the event; and then in this occasion it isnot
Constancy that makes Lovers unhappy, but Fortune, that delights to persecute Vertue • and
III rhis surr, even unhappiness, serves tor the glory of which are constant.     '

ed the Marquis, thac I am noc unhappy buc for your sakes; for do not you see how Fortune

work a prodigy in favor of me, she hath caused them all eo cum me away without hating me.

not a little strange to imagine, thac ehae which soould have raade you use but one chain, hath

<p>The Third Boo\,
</p>
<p>WHil'st this agreeable Corapany endeavored to forget their present misfortunes, by
remerabring chofe which ehey had avoyded; <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was in an extraordmiry melan¬
choly, although soe was as yet but in the apprchension of an evil thac was co arrive uneo her.
Every cime that soe heard her charaber door open, shc always bdieved that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> was
come to discover his unjust palTion to her; and every cime chac ehe Sultana cAfteria wenc
from her, ic seemed to her that soe abandoned her to che Sultan's violence. There were yec
some eimes wherein soe conderaned her own thoughts; and wherein Emilias speeches gave
her some consoladon. These good intervals for all that lasted not long; and how constant so¬
ever <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was, she was always nearer to despair then to tranquillity. On the other side,
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> Wis in no less pain; his love, his vertue, and his irresolution upon chae which he
was Co do, put his Soul into so great a diforder, as he then meritcd to be as rauch lamented,
as blamed.
</p>
<p>But at length, whereas it is hard to consenc to the rendring of ones self unhappy for ano¬
thers seiidty, and to renounce things out of generofity which one ardently asseds, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s
Reason being combated by his own desires, by a violent pashon, and by ehe Artifices of Rox¬
elana, it found it sds in the end so weak, as he absolucely resolved ro speak eo <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> of his
pashon. I know very well, said he Co himself, chat chis is Co becmy the friendship which I
have promised Co <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>; bue I know wiehall, that ic would be ehe beemying of my sds,
and che cause ofmy deach,is I soould bereave my self of che hope which I have of prevaiSng
one day wieh <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>.
</p>
<p>In ehis resolucion, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> wene Co the Princesses charaber on a time when as the Sultana
Afteria was Come from her, and ehae none buc Emilia was wich her. When as first che Prin¬
cess saw him, she changed colour j and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> on his pare, who very ranch respeded her,
and thac still loved <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, thought Co alter his resolution; and in chis fore, fear eroubling
IsabeUa, and resped silencing <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, they were a while unable to speak to one anocher.
The SnUan was he ac last ehae began ehe Conversation, in craving pardon of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> for che
constraine wherein she lived. My Lord, said soe unco him, since ic concerns the quiet of thy
State, I dare not murraur at it; and though the privation of my friends be a displeasnre sen-
sible enough, I do endure it without coraplaining of thy Highness; I do accuse Fortune, and
do justisie <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who without doubt will never be bue equieable. Would Co Heaven, said
he unco her, I raighc be sure chac you would speak chus always I My Lord, replyed sbe, chis
is a ching which will absolucely depend on chy Highness; ie being most cercain chae I shall ever
be reasonable, and not be so inconsidetate as to think ought to ehe disadvancage of ehy Majestyj
is I be noc constrained chereunco by chy self. I could have wisoed, xep\yid <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, chat
wichouc excepcion you had promised me never co chink araiss of me; for it may be you will
learn from mine own raouch ehae I ara saulcy.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> blusot at thisdiscourse, and casting down her eyes without daring Co look any
more on <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and being unable Co answer him, soe was a pretey while in this incertainty s
but on a sudden, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, carried away by his pashon, resolved to discover it nnto ber. I
know full well, said he unto her, chat I ara going to destro/my self; that in acquainting you
w-ith my thoughts, I am going to raake you hate me; but I would fain have you edl me.
added he, before Icontets my crime unto you, whether an error, which is not voluntary,
merits as rauch chastisemenc, as a preradicaced malice i» My Lord, inswexed <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> all
persons that hive great Souls like thy Highness can never commit faults but voluntarily There
IS nothing that cm force Reason whenone willmikeuseof it; andthe raoft violent passions

<p>Great Prinof, replyed//^^.//^, ou.,hc to be sensible of piry, but they never ought to put
theraklvcs into a condition of being the objed of it to others: Neither will I be drawn to
beleeve that Solimm hath a thought so unworthy of himself. For, my Lord, how can I
think that thy Hig'm \ will stab a Poignard into the heart of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, after thou hast saved
his htr s* is -t soould be so, ic hi- better, both for him, for me, and for thy Highness, that
he ha \ bee n left to languiOi in his irons, or to dye of melancholy, then to save him for to kill
hm the more cradly. Lee thv Mai'esty consute wdl with thy sds, and thou wilt find without
doubc, thac thy hea. t agrees noc with thy m-utn; that thy words betray thy thoughts; and
that/^r.ii!;/w is yet mire powersul imhySoul, then the satal beauty of Ijabella. No, said
Jo/iW4« interrupting her, do not justisie me in this sort; since in rhe terms wherein I ara, I
have no other design, then to lee you know, that I am the raoft faulty of all men, in perswa¬
ding you, that I am the most amorous. Ah, my Lord, said soe to him weeping, doth not
thy Highness consider, that at this very time ic may be, wherdn chy Highness useth so strange
a discourse unto me, //^r^/;/&gt;w is sisghing with thine enemit^s, is hazarding his life for thy ser¬
vice, and socddiog his blood tor a Prince, who mikes me soed tears, and who widiout doubc

</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> being moved with so preshng a dilcourse, stood a while without answering ihert-
unto; but at length his passion still surmounting his vertue in this occasion; I know, said he
unto her, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s life oughc to bc dear unto me; but I know wiehall chat mine oughc
to be considerable co me: and I am certain, chac whae exploits soever he can do in Persta, I
have done more yet in consideration of him. I have soughc for him against my self; I have
selc my self in che slame withouc daring eo coraplaipi; love and friendship have corn my heare;
and I know no corments so terrible which I have not endured since the first instant that I saw
you, rather then to do any thing against the assedion which I bear him. But being come to
the terms, either of dying, or speaking, I chofe the last; and so rauch the rather, because I
do not think but a man, who could abandon you at Monacc, to come uneo me Co Constan"
tinople. Will easily enough resolve co quie you, for che saving of a Princes life, co whom he is
indebced tor his own. Ah, my Lord ! cryed Ijabella, is <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> be saulcy in ehis occasion,
ic is against me, and nor against chy Highness, who by ehis very saulc arc yec ehe more straicly
obliged noc to comrait one against him. For what doch noc a raan deserve, who racher ehen he
would sail in his word which he had given thee, resolved to abandon,noC only his Country, not
only his Friends; but tbe only person whora he could love; who was in stead to him ofall the
world; and without whora his life had been irkfora, and death the terra of his desires? No,
my Lord.continued soe,slatter not thy self in this occasion; think better.both of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> and of
isabella, and be raoft assured, that as I am certain he would dye a ehousand eimes rather chen
abandon me, so soould I do che like, rather chen be unsaichsul eo him. And is by some pro¬
digy, which I cannoc fear soould happen, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> soould consenc Co chy pashon; is he him¬
selt soould speak co me of chy love, yec lee ehy Highness know, chac I ara noC capable of sail¬
ing by exaraple. I soould cease co love <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, is he ceased Co be generous, but I should
love chee never a whic che more; concrarily, I soould regard thee then, both as having out¬
raged me, and as having bereaved me ot a vertuous Lover.

<p>It was m vaieibr them to seek for some remedy to their misery; it was to'o greac to find one

this advice was but a weak consolation to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. Howbeit soe desired the Sultana Ajl^nl

mised her to do ; upon condition that she might obtain of her generofity, that he soould be

to be lamented; bue I am well assured, continued she, that he punisoes himself in ofs.nding

unquietnes; that constancy which he had noted in//^^s^&lt;»'s rainde extreamly asshded him,
by making him see an irapofllibility in his design; yet out of an altogether extraordinary per¬

<p>had always made him retain some fear of displeasing//^^^//^, being almost quite banished
from his soul, he resolved to speak co her once for all, co see is he could gam her. Thatwhich
carryed him the racher to this extreara resolution, was the thought hc had that it would not
peradventure be long before <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> returned; and that a conqueror or conquered, the love
which he bare Co <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would raake him soon siniso this war: for when as <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> went
away wieh an absolute power to treat ofall things, without having new order from Salman
he had assured him, that he would come and render him an account of his voyage hitnsds,
without ever sending to him before.          h r  r •
</p>
<p>Ihe Sultan, not knowing then aC whae Cime/^r^^/w would return, and well foreseeing
that his voyage would not be long, is by ill fortune he had not received his last order, as hc
began CO doubt, racanttotryis he could obtain thatby fear, which hecould not obtain by
love. In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> lived in so greac a mdancholy, that all her vertue and con¬
stancy were not strong enough to keep her trom wisoing, that deach would speedily deliver
her oue of che deplorable estace wherein soe was. She saw her sds far stom <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, wich¬
ouc means Co hear from him, che place of her resuge become her prison, Che sighc of her
shends forbidden her, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s persecucion dayly redoubling ; in ^w^, she was expofed eo
most scnsiblemiseries wiehoue ocher consolacion, chen chac of the Sultana Asieria's, and her
dear Kinsworaans cears. Her friends on ehe ocher side, were noC wiehoue unquiecness; so
long an abode at ConslantinapU pofsessed them with a great dealof grief; and the privation
of the fight of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> very much troubled them; but at length, nothing resting for them but
patience to mitigate their displcasure, they comforted cheratelves as well as chey could with
the hope of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s recurn, wherewich they were still entertained from <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>; who
not able to dirainiso her own misfortunes, endevored at leastwise Co slaccer those of others
with ehis hope chac soe gave thera: for che Grand Sigmor had still permitted her to send un¬
to thera by a Capigibasii, in whora he absolucely consided.

<p>All chese illustrious persons being in chis deplorable estace, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, chrust on by despair
and his love, wenc one day co <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s lodging, having first sene a Coramand co che Sul¬
tana Asieria Co go to that of Roxelana, for she had for a pretty while before been sddom ab¬
sent from the Princess. This command exceedingly disquieted the Sultana; but noc able co
do any other then voluntarily obey a Prince, who had power and right eo constrain her
chereunco; soe lesc <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> wieh Emilia, wichouc leccing her know any ching of tbe fear
soe was in, chac <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had a purpose co use some displeasing discourse Co her, seeing he re¬
moved her from her. Scarcely was soe gone oue of her chamber, when as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> came In
CO ic; and whereas ic seemed eo her chac he had less civilicy for her chen he was wone; and
chac his looks gave more signs of choller, ehen of love; soe was in some joy, hoping chat it
may be her constancy had so far provoked him, as Co oblige him to turn her oiit of the Serra¬
glio ; but soe soon understood, thac this incivility, and this choller was an essed of his love. I
lee very well, said he unto her, chat my visits do importune you; chaC my presencc displea¬
ses you; chac my passion begees your hacred; chac my respeds augmenc your pride; thac my
prayers render yon inexorable; and chac Cears do harden your heare; Wherefore, concinued
he, I am resolved Co cake another course. I have ereaced you coo long as a Mistress, ic is just

<p>, cue eoo well; and ic is as equally impofsible for cheeeo pofsess me wieh fear, aswich love;
thou mayst have unjust desires, bnc I hold thee uncapable of a wicked adion. Thou raayst, I
say, have weakness, hue noe crudcy; and love cannoc produce in chee ehe esseds of hacred.
Ic is noe, added soe, because I do noc wish with all my heart, both for thy glory, and my con¬
tent, that either out ot choller or hatred thou couldst resolve to chase me stom thy presence

<p>The opinion wherein you are, replyed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, that the same passion, which carries me to
persecute you, will keep me from hurting you, is that wichout doubt which makes you speak
with so much considence; but know, that a Prince, who sees nothing in his choyce, but death

<p>preserred before all other chings. I have shendstiip for <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>; I have veneration for ynu ■
bu' I have also some interest in my life. I have done what I could to procijre my content with-'
ouc troubling yours; but at length, seeing I cannot do it, and thae there is a late v.hich vvi'l
not let me live wichouc you, I must seek ouc the means for is. Remember chen, thac he which
cnves your assedion, can command you; chac he which ofsers you his heare, is no: unworthy
your love; chac <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> owing his life co me.ougc Co render ic me in this occa Jon; that li ctr
so many services, submissions, respeds, sighs, and tears, the anger and spite of being Jdp Ad
may seiz? upon my Soul: and for a conclusion remember, that revenge is the d li^ht of in*
censed Kings; chae <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> is in my Armies; ebac you have in Consiantinople persons which
are dear co you ; and chae you are in che Serraglio.
</p>
<p>Ic is true, my Lord, replyed <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, that I cannot be ignorant of all these things; but I
know wiehall, chac thy Highness commands, both in thy Aimics, in Constantinople, vai^ in
the Serraglto; and that Cons quenrly I have nociuse to fear any thng; but contrarily I
think that ibrahim, my friends, and I, are in more safety in thy Estaces, then inonrown
Country. And then ac^ain, my Lord, I cannot imagine thac the remerabrance of Ibrahm is
uccerly defaced ouc of thy memory; that a man whom thy Higness harh so much loved, and
so much obliged, can be ill- intreated by chee ; nor can I believe that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> can inspire thee
with such unjust thoughcs; no, my Lord, I cannoc think it.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, replyed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, hath not pofl'est me with unrcasonable thoughts, I have nothing
buclovefor her; howbeie I must conress, chac her cruelcy pofsesses me wich sury; and that
she may carry me eo destroy all chac I soall chink can raviso her from me; and consequently to
do all chae I shall believe can serve my turn concerning her. This being so, answered IsabelU,
I need not be chreatened in the person of my friends, nor in that ot <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, since on my
onely will that absolutely depends which thy Highness calls rigor, and which I term an essed:
of Reason and Vertue. For, my Lord, continued soe,, were not my heart, nor my word en¬
gaged to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>; nay,had I as rauch ass^ dion for thy Highness as I am capable of, yet soould
I not give thee more ceshraonies of it chen I have done. Were noc my Religion, I say, dis-
serenc from chine, yec in thae I could noe beihy wise, I soould noe be ehy Slave, since che heart
of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> can never have choughcs contrary to her honor and her glory. The Slaves of Soli.
man, replyed he, are more then Queens of other Nations; and then again, to say the tmeb,
to have you command absolutdy in my heart and soul, is not to treat you as a Slave.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, chinking she was to speak more chroughly co ehe Grand Signior, then as yet she
had done, and believing, that when he had no raore hope, he would have no mere love, said
to him with a more consident voyce then before: Sinally, my Lord, all that I can say to thy
Highness, is, that is, forgeecing chy ususl mildness and generofity, thou couldst resolve to carry
me by fear ro char, which chou couldst noe get by love; and for chac essed wouldst persecute
me in ehe person of I brahim,who is dearer then my self,to me I would see him dye rather then
change my resolucion. Let thy Highness judg after this,whether death can sright me,and whe¬
ther tear hath any power over my Soul. Consider then that though thou hast no hope left thee,

thae all ehe Troops, which had been senc for cheforcisyingot cheArmy, were ehe bravest in

<p>Out of the fear I am m ksl the day of Battel proving satal unto you I jhall not

</p>
<p>After this Challenge was sinished, and that Vlama,io render the dvility to /^r&lt;«Ai&gt;w which
he had used tqwards him, had shewed ic unco him, hc gave ic Co a Trurapet, who was to
condud a Boluchbasst, unto whom <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had committed che Letcer which he wroee to
the Sophy; and having dismissed them with order carefully to observe all that soould be said
to them, and all that they should see, chey parted inshncly away, and ehe nexe day arrived at
che Enemies Camp. As soon as ehey were ehere, ehey were conduded Co ehe Sophy'ssm^
whom chey found invironed with che most pare ot che Commanders of his Army. Aseer that
the Boluchbasst had made a low obeysance to the Sophy, and told him from whom he came,
he presented him with <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s Letter, which the Sophy read softly with some change of
countenance; Then listing up his voyce after he had read ie over, I ara coo rauch obliged to
Jbrahim, said he with boch an obliging and generous smile, for che care he cakes Co preserve

of che Baccel, or co say beceer, I will go and presenc it eo him; and within cbis hour you sojH
carry him the news of ij.

then, replyed the Trumpet, I present you here with a Challenge from Vlama. Vlam,
cryed the Sophy then: Yes, my Lord, said Deliment; and is your Majesty will give me leave,
I will see that which he hath sene me. The Sophy having permicced him so co dw, he opened
the Challenge, and read ie aloud, bue wich so much choller when he came to ehe cwo last lines,

those Ensigns, which are never displayed but in his presence, should be set up ; that ihtSs&amp;.

tolodgallthe Soldiers in Tents, andthat ordinarily they are all very sumptuous, these two
Camps shewed the goodliest objed that cm sall under the eye of man.  There was noriiii^
buc Cloch of Gold and Tinsd in all <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s Pavillions, with Silver Cressents, Peoons,

of the very Slaves were of Cotton Cloth of lively colours, and woven Chccquerwise.

might bc said, that one spirit made it raove.

qually came wichin sive hundred pices one of anocher ; and by the manner of their march¬
ing, it had been a very dissicult raatter to discern to which side che vidory would lead.
</p>
<p>When as chey were at this distance, Vlama, after he had obtained perraission of I ibrahim
for it, severed himself from the Army, and went diredly towards the Enemies with his
Scyraitar in his hand; buc scarcely was he advanced sisteen paces, when as Deliment, having

brave Cavaliers joyned cogecher just in che middle of the place of batcel. The two Armies
raade a stand to see ehis corabae, which was beheld by boch pares almost as an insallible pre¬

ed, made ie nevertheless sussiciently appear by che manner of his c jrriage, chat he was resolved
eieher eo vanqu so or co dye. Signs of sury were seen in the one, and proofs of an invincible
courage in the other; the sir st struck wtrh violence, and inconsiderately; and thelast, expo¬
sing himself valiantly some cimes eo his Enemies blows, assaulced him wich judgment, and
warded with addreGs: Bac ac length after they had made an hundred passades to no purpose,
had tryed in vain to gain the crupper, and had been a long time without hurting one another;
'L'/&lt;«»i»4 seeming to be vexc for staying so long from vanquisoing or dying, redoubled his en¬

his chigh. This first advantage more augmenced Vlama's courage, and redoubled Deliment's
rage; for ascer chae ie was irapofsible eo discern rhe blows chey gave each anocher: Deliment

thereunto, onely catiled his arm to be bound up witha piece of linnen cloth of a Turbant
and placing himse s by <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and all the Trumpets, Drums, and AttabalUs having found
ed a charge, they began to march with those great cries, which all the Oriental Nations make
at tilt beginning of battels; but yet with this disserence, ih^t <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'% Soldiers seemed to
be almost allured of the vidory, whereas the others on the contrary seemed to have no other
deiign in fighting, then to revenge the death of Deliment: It was not for that he was be-
loved, but because the %/?; shewed so much resentment for it, asit passd even into the
hearcs of his men.  In rhe end ehese ewo Armies bdng provoked, tbe one by the deiire of
glory, and the other by that of revenge, chey encouncred cogecher.  And togive yet a further
courage to/^r^^iVs forces, it happened chae T'^t^/^w^, bdng arrived first in ehe sield, had
stized on an high piece of ground, upon the which he had planted his Ordnance; but that
which hc conceived would have been advantageous, proved unprofitable unto hrm; tor
when as the two Armies caused their Cannon eo play on eieher pare, thae of ehe Per sum did
no hurc so ehe <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi>, because all ehe shoc passed over cheir heads in regard ic was planted too
high.  IbrMm's Ordnance wrought another essed, and bis first discharge lighting just in the
midst of that Sq -ladron, where the Sophy was in person, cleared all the ranks, wich che shugh-
ter of a world of men.  But when as the Sophy, who lost not his judgment in this occasion,
had commanded those behinde to take the place of them before, /^r^/[)/?wonhi$side,caustd
two battalions, behinde tbe which were ehe rest of his Ordnance, eoopen, and the Soldiers
having accord ngly divided themselves to the right hand and ro ehe lesc, ehe remainder of his
Ordnance discharged all together through the voyd space that was between the ranks, and put
his Enemies into so strange a diforder,as the like was never heard of. And truly it was zi^yixwA-
geous to ihtTcrsians, chac the thickness of the sraoke and dust, which enveloped thesetwo
Armies, kept chem from seeiog the horridness of chis execution, for ocherwise peradventure
they would not have had so much heart to sighr, as they cestisied afterwards.
</p>
<p>Ac length, <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> having formed hisbaecalions anew, for repairing of che diforder which
the greac Ordnance had made, and <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s Soldiers having re- assumed cheir stations, thete
two Armies came to cope with one another.  <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, followed h'j Vlama, gave first in¬
to the batealion, behinde ehe which was ehae broken squadron, where the Sophy and Ismud
were in person.  And itwas there, where out of a prodigious valor hedid things, which
would not finde belies with pofterity, is they were written.  He made way through all op¬
pofition, and not contented with carrying fear and terror wheresoever he went; with desend¬
ing his own life,and giving death co his Enevmies; but took care also for the conservation of his
own party.  He saved the Ba^a Sinan from being killed, by discharging a greac blo\y with
his Scymiear upon him chac was striking him : now though he performed the Soldier in this
encounter, yet left he noc for all that co behave himsds like the General of the Army, and to
have an eye to all things.  Somecimes hc senc eo succor chofe chae stood in rieed; somecimes

ons to every pare, as ie mighc also bc assirmed, that he was in all the fights that were in the
sield, and that he might with reason be lamd the soul of his Army. Vlama in hke manner
worthily seconded his valor; and all the samzaries, seeing in che head of chem so couragious
a Chi'train, performed cheir pares so well in this encounter, that they pierced q^'^e througn
this battalion, and so absolucely defeated it, as all that the squadron which was behinde ic

<p>WHereas it is not enough to have vanquisoed, isone does not know how to use
thevidory, the Illustrious Baila knew too well how tO make use of
the advantages of fortune, for to negled his enemy after he had surmounted hini.
He was not ignorant that the chance of war is inconstant; that Conquerors may
oftentimes bc Slaves to those whom they have put in chains; andthat the Crowns
which Victory hath set on the head of those whom soe favours, are not so Wc il set¬
led, but that they may bc plucked from thence. Out of so just a reasoning, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>
took as much care to have good order observed in his Army, as is that of Tach¬
mas hzdhccn^WWn the hdA^ and had not been defeated.  He discamped then the
next day, and still advancing into the Enemies Countrey, without incountring any
obstacle, he carried terror over all the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> Empire.  For whereas the Sophies
/jniy had been utterly routed, they which had not followed hini to Sultania , and
that iiad cscaped killing in the battell, sled to thenext adjoyning Provinces, and by
their report wrought that in the mindes of those that heard them, which the Arms
oi <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had wrought in them, pofseshng their hearts with fear and terror.  And
whereas it is naturall enough for a man to seek to* excuse himself, they made the
Army of the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi> far greater than it was, for the justisying of their shght; they
commended the valour of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to cover their own cowardice, and fighting for
him in this occasion, they induced many Towns to render themselves, who other-
wise had at leastwise attended the Canon,  and the fight of their Enemy.  But
whereas the most part of the Palaces inthis Empire arc not much sortisied, and
are commonly his th.it keeps the sield,/^r&lt;t/'/&gt;» being become so absolutely Master
of it, as there was not an enemy appearing, hc had no other imploymenr after the
battell of Niphatesj than to receive the Deputies of Towns which came to bring
him the keyes thereof,and one would have said, considering in what manner things
past, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was rather a lawfull King, that rode in progress about his King¬
dom to raake himself known to his Subjects, than a Conqueror, which received the
submissions of the people whom he had subdued.  In sine, the matter went in that
sort, as in two moneths space the Grand Visier restored unto <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s obedience all
the places which he had formedy conquered, andthat had revoked after Ulamaes
defear,anddunng the time of his sickness.  In the mean while he had sent to
VnncG Mahamed znA to jixiamira,to &amp;i!iuTc them that he did not conquer their
Countrey but cnly to oblige the Sophy to demand peace ; and is it soould bc long
before he heard from him, he would send to propound it unto him, with such just
condidons, as hc could not resuse it. Ulama likewise on his part had written to the
Princess and Seltxana, who had not sailed to testifie unto him by their Letters a
great deal of acknowledgement for the victory which hc had obtained of Deliment.
<hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> was nevertheless m.uch disquieted, to understand by all them which came
from the Camp to Bitilisa^ thuhncc <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> cnttcAinto Stiltania ^ there had been
no news of him: For albdt the Sophy had intre.ited her very ill, yet still he was
her S.uher, and the apprehensions of Nature were yet stronger in her heart  than
the remembrance of injunes was sensible unto her.  This unquietness was not par-
ticular to her, and though it was after a diss-erent sasoion, yet certain it is, that
the Grand Viher was troubled for that he could learn nothing of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>; not
being able to imagine what design he soould have in soutdn^ himself up in Stdta-
ma, and never appearing since, nor giving any order for setting some forces on sooc
again. One morning as he was talking with ?^/^;«^ about it, andthat neither of

<p>Bassa of the Sea to beg a grace of him in favour oi Arsalon. This name equally for-
prued both <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> and Ulama ; for the Grand Visier rcmembred very well that
this Arsalon was hc who had taken <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> ncer to Naples; that he was Father to AU-
bechy whom <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> the BaslTa of the Seas son had maried; but he could not conipi c-
hcnd how they soould meet together, and be made friends: UUma knew too, by
report, that the Satrap Arsalon was become the famousest Pirate of all the Seas of
the Levant', so thatboth of them provoked by curiofity, prcslcd^Wbr^sA to explain
himself more clearly. My Lord, said he to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, before I tell you what Arsalon
desires, may you be pleased to let me relate unto you the scqudc of an History
the beginning whereof you are acquainted with, co che end thac by the knowledge
you soall have thereof, you may be the more easilier carried to grant the favour
which is desired of your generofity. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> having consented thereunto, caused

<p>I Make no doubt, my Lord, butis the generofity of <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> mowed you at such
time, as by your goodness you got the Grand Signior to judge her cause to her
advantage, I make no doubt, I say, but that which I am going to impart unto you
will carry you to scrve her. I will not stand to run over her first advcntures,thcrc-
by to make you understand the rest, since I hold it impoflible that you stiould not
still remember, that she is the daughter of Arsalcu the Pirate, or to say better, of a
Satrap of Persia, whom ill fortune hath made a Pirate. And I do not think you
have forgot that this Pirate took <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> prisoner, who in a few dayes became despe¬
rately in lovc with the veituous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, and that she delivering him, saved hersds
with him, upon condition that he should marry her when he came to Conslantinople:
No more can you be ignorant, that the Baslla of the Sea would never have permit¬
ted his son to have kept his word with her, had not the Grand Signior by his
commandment, and by his liberality, forced him to receive this fair iVlaid, in whom
hefound no other desest but poverty. Now sincc that, my Lord, I canaslTurc you,
thztAUbechh^th not rendred her self unworthy ofthe grace you did her , nor
of that which yet shc attends from your goodness. She hath lived with the Bassa of
the Sea in as much obedience to him, as is she had been his own daughter; and
with her subniiinons and respests hath in such sort acquired his aslcstioivs he loves
not his son with more tenderness. As for 0/»»^, there hath never been heard speak
ofa more violent, or more durable lovc than his, and every day too he sees some
new grace in his dear v^/*itssJ&amp;} for whereas the beauty of her soul is ser greater
than that of her face, she hath given him so many new marks of her vertue, of her
courage, ofher love, and ofher generofity, as he stiould be the ingratefulleft of men,
isthe affection which he bears hcr,could enter into comparison with any ottier.
This person then, being so straightly linked in good will to her Father.in-Law,aiid

more than^of chooling a place where they might make a delcent, according to
the order they had for it: but a horrible tempest that arofe, destroyed all then de¬
signs. It was sb great, sb long, and sb extraordinary , that the whole Sleet was
dispersed- so that when it t^rew to be calm again, three Vesl-ells were scarce found
together: Howbdt so great was our good fortune, as in four or hve c^ayes tlie
whole Rivyreioyned, aBdalbdtmost of the stiips had something o^' odier broj
ken,yctwe rcioycedtofeethcmallstiatteredas they were, after we had believed

ly vvandng to the Sleet; but at length that of 0/?»^« comming m, made us hope
thatthe Basla would return in like manner. After he had been attended some
dayeswithan impatience, which well domonstrated the love which QsmanyZndtht
generofity which Altbechhiidiiovhim ; and after that many Vessells had been sent
out to crofs up and down the Seaj for to try is they could meet with him, one
day as 0/w/t« was looking forth himself to see is he could descry any thing, he
discovered a Veslell: and though it was so far ofs as he could not discern of what
Nation she was, yet the extreme desire which he had that it might be his fathers,
perswaded him that it was he. In this belies he caused his dear <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> to come
upon the deck to kt her see that which all the rest of his Veslell saw as well as hc ;
they continued a pretty while in this sort, between hope and fear , but at length
this Vessell approachint:; by lirtle and little, destroyed the first, and increased the
other; for 0/?w*jw certainly knew that this Vessell was a Brigantine, and not that
of his father, whose fortune had b cen very disserent from his. The tempcst having
severed him from his Sleet, aud the storm having raightily bruised his Vessell, he
had beenso unhappy as to encounter witha Pirate-, who having found him in
so deplorable an estate, had set upon him, or to say better, had taken him, he not
being able to make .my resistance. The Bassa ofthe Sea afterthis misfortune,
was perswaded^ that tobe the more gently used, and to get the sooner out of his
enemies hands, hc was to tell who he was, to theend that ofsering a great ransom
he might be restored to his liberty ; the rather, for that in this occasion the affairs
of the Empire being much concerned , he should have committed a crime , ishe
had concealed his name for the saving of money. But that which he thoughc
would conduce mols to the getting himself out of trouble , gave him the more;
for be pleased to know, that by an encounter altogether prodigious, he that had ta¬
ken him was the Pirate Arsalm, father tothe vertuous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> ; who no sooner
understood that this prisoner was the Bassa of the Sea, but he appeared to be migh¬
tily incensed with anger. W^hat, said he unto him, are you the father then of the
Traytor Ofnian^ or to say better, of the Ravisher ofmy daughter ? and hath for¬
tune, who hath alwayes persecuted me so cruelly, at last surnilhed me with meant,
to be revenged &gt; Speak, said he unto bim, but disguise not the truthjleft I bc drawn
to make you tell it by force. The Bassa of the Sea surprised with this
discourse, and perceiving very wdl that this Pirate vvas Arsalon, thought
nevertheless, since he had said so much alreadyj that the best would be not
to disl^cmble , and to indeavour by the asllirance which he would give hin;
that <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> vj-a.i <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>swik, andthat he had alwayes used her as ss she had
been his own daughtei, to induce him to use him also with the more humanity. In

unto ;_ nevertheless, whereas he isgenerouj, and that the vertue of y4/zi/c/j hath
won his heart, he could by no means agree to what was required of him.  No,
sayd he to Arsalon, I will never be ingratefull to your daughter ; fire restored mv
sonne to his liberty, and J will lose mine to preserve her thatwhich she en joyes.
And then again, said he unto him, I am not mafter ofher, she is <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>s, who
commanding the Navy in my absence, is in an estate to resuse hci unto me, isl
should be so base as to demand her, whichi will never do. We shal I see, laid .or-
salon then to him, whether you will not change your mind; and after theyhad
disputed yet a while, he commanded him to be loaden with chains, and told him
once again, that he stiould never have his liberty,, and that every day he would
make him try new torments, is he did not write to his sonne to uLlige him to de¬
liver <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> into the hands ofthose whom he would send to him Cr that pur¬
pofe ; promising hini, that she should be no sooner in his power, but hc would re¬
store hini to his liberty.  The Bassa insocrofs a conjunrruic, knew not what ro
think, or what ♦to resolve on.  He knew by the report of his Ibnne, and of .i^'&gt;
bech too, that Arsalon was sirm in his resolutions, and of a severe and crucll in¬
clination. Heknew that his absence would prejudice the affairs of the Empire;
yeaand he was perswaded, that his sonne, loving <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> me.z thr.n hishfe,
would never resolve to lose her for the saving of him ; he selt a strange repugnan¬
cy inhis heart too against the making of this request untohim ; and not know¬
ing what to do inso deplorable a case, he lamented his misfortune, accused Jr-
salens cruelty, and without sraming any design, indured the sharpest grief that
any soul can be capable of. In the mean time Arsalon, fearing left the Balsa of the
Seas Sleet should remove further from him, andthat t icn he stiould not h-xst A-

my Lord, the very same velsell whkh Ofmm dircovcied at sea, which a far ofs
oave him somuch hope, and which approaching sb mightily redoubled his grief,
w feethatitwasaBngantine, thit the spight to b. i&lt;j deceived, mad; him re¬

perceiving the intention of them that were making towards him, struck sayl, hung
out a slag of truce, and putting himself into the skiss, wich three of his compa¬
nions, to testifie the more considence, hc went in this sort to encounter those
which were advanced towards him. When he was so near them a&gt; he mightbe
heard, the Psr/&lt;t«, to have audience the sooner, required to speak wich Ofmm
from the Bassa of the Sea his father. This name made them all to stiout for joy
that heard it; and the word pashng strait from Veslell to Vcliell, and from Gaily
to Gaily, the;e was a generall rcioyciiig over all the whole Sleet. In the
mean time 0/w.r« having been advercised otit, attended with as much joy as im¬
patience, him, that brought him news of his father. And whereas he Ihared all his
bad, and all his hood haps with his dear wise, she was with him at such time as
the P&lt;sr/i2« was conducted unco him. Thefightof thisnian nude the vertuous ^-
libech change colour, for she presently knew him, as having seen him with her sa¬
ther, all the time that she lived at sea. This first motion was quickly seconded with
an extreme grief; for when as O/Jw^w, outof an impatience derived from his as¬
sestion, had demanded of this man where his father was; My Lord, said heunto
him, witha great deal of boldness, he is in a place from whence you ma^ easily
draw him, and to clear the matter unto you, know, that the chance of War, or
rather the equity ofHeaven , hath made him sall into the power of the invincible
Arsalon. Alas, suid <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>y looking on <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, what have I heard ! and what a
destiny is ours like to be ! What, said <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, interrupting her, and all amazed,
is my sadier in the hands of Arsalon &gt; Yes, my Lord, replyed the Perstan, and it is
from hini that I come to tell you, that you shall never see the Bassa your father
more, isyou do not render him his daughter : This is the price he hath see for his
liberty, and it is that which you ought to pay him. I know that I speak boldly,
and that in some sort I endanger my self; but be-think you that you have a per¬
son in the power oi Arsalon, which ought to keep you from entreating ms ilL I'
leave you to judge, generous <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, what this propofition effectcd in the minds
of <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, and what a combat that Was, where one must resolve to a-
bandon a father, or lose a wise; yea a wise, to whom <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> owed his life and li¬
berty : which made up all his felicity; and which was both his wise and his mi¬
stris. Nature and Love could not be satished in this occasion : <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> could not be
acknowledging without bdng ingratefull; and finding cradty in both the pardes,
he knew not what resolution to take. <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> never reasoned at first for all that on
this adventure, but withoutsticking a whit atit, hc told him that had spoken to
hini, how he could not render his wise, ndther could hc abandon his father , buc
he knew well enough how to destroy Arsulon. Ah, my Lord, cryed <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> then ,

generous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, said he unto her, what the choice is which I can make in Co crofs
an adventure. My Lord, said she unto him, wholly disiTolved into tears, vou re
quire a counsell of me which is very hard to be given ; it is not because I fear the'
rigor ofmy father somuch, as I cannot resolve without pain to indure it to del
ver yours; but, my Lord, it is because I cannot do it without abandoning you Yet
I must, continued she ; for whereas I am the daughter of Arsalon, it is for me
to receive the chastisement of her fault; and wheieas I am in part the cause of his
captivity, it is for me also to ddiver him ; and it is for me also to dry up the tears
■which you shed for him : Suffer me then to go and undo his chains, and wear his
irons. Ah / too generous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, answered <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, do not ofser me a reniedv
worse than the disease, and which I cannot accept ot: My father is too generous
too, continued he, to indure it; and he would disavow me for his sonne is I were
capable of such a baseiiess. To have such thoughts vvould be a thing worthy of
his great heart, replyed v4//^scA, but it would also be a thing unworthy both of
you, and ofme, is I could suslper you to be crudl to the Bassa your father, and that
he should lose his life by my means. No, <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, it is that vvhich I can never indurc
and since we cannot live happy together, let us at leastwise die innocent.  Do what
you ought for your father; owing him your life, you ow him all things; sacrisise
your wise to deliver him, it is just, and she desires it.  I must, added she, for the
love of you, deprive my self of you ; and fear not that I will accuCc you of want
of affection, whenas you shall consent thereunto ; no, <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>, I stiould not be glad
that your love to me should stisle the motions of nature in you.  Reason must bc
stronger than all other things; and hc that could .abandon his father, niight also in
some other occasion abandon his wise. Permit me to do what I ought, and leave
the rest to the conduct of fortune. That would not be just, answered <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>. What
will you do then, replyed ^/'^sc^? I do not know, answered he; onely I know
that the estate wherein my sotil is, I can neither be wanting to my father, nor to
you ; and yet being unable to save you both, I see that nothing but death can suc¬
cour me.  After this, <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> sell a niusing, then suddenly comming to himsds a-
gain, he seemed to take the resolution to go and seek out Arsalon for to fight with
him.  But ^//^&lt;?sA having apprehended his design. What, my Lord, said siie unto
him, casting her sclsat his feet, could you command your men to stioot at a Vcssell
where your father orminc might be killed, and it m.iy be both of them &gt; Could
thatsogcnerousheartof yours permit you to dip your hands in my blood or in
yours ? Think well, my Lord, of that which you say; and know that I am capable
of taking away mine own life , rather than see you blemish your glory with so
strange an action;  whereas then you would not be carried thereunto, but only to
savlemylife, whenas I stiould bc dcpnved ofit, you would deal in anofster man¬
ner.  It is true, my Lord, that my father is cruell, and inhuman; but remember,
that when the si'asla your father would have banished us from his house, I left not
respcstiiig him ; have the same thought for Arsalon : Regard him rather a, a

<p>sa y all, consider him as my father.  I do not resuse to deliver oyurs, but contra¬

Heaven can witness, answcrcd <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>,  after hc had raised her up, whether S

der wherein my soul is, I say whatsoever my grief suggests unto me, vvithout giving
my reason Icasurc to examine whether the thing be just, or whether it be not.  lit

ther tod.liver his sacher, or deprive himsds of his wise, or fight with Arsalo/t,
resolved at least, and made <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> resolvc so too, to go with all his Sleet, and
set himself in the fight of that of ArsaUn; iot ill the Pirates ofthe scas ofthe Levant
had a little before betaken themsclvei to him, and acknowledged him for their
Chieftain.  It was nevertheless after he had promised Altbech, that hc would not
fight with him ; and that it stiould bc only to endeavour to make him do thatby
fear vvhich he could not make him do by reason. All the dillicultic of the matter
was but to know precisely where hc was; but this obstacle lasted not long: for Of-
muM having sent for the ?*r/;4» to come again to him, he talked to him with so
much address, that he learnt the place ofhis retreat; asccr which he told this man
in a gentle manncr,for fear his father should be ill intreated,that before he answcr¬
cd direstly to the propofition which had been made to him, he would willingljs
have aLettcr from his sathcr,to the end thac being sure he was Iiving,he might deal
with the more certainty. The P^r^** finding some justicc in <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>s dem^iTid, pre¬
sently lesc him, wich a promise to return him an answer of ic wichin a few days ;
but take  heed, sayd hc unto him, that you go not away, for fear left Arjaloh
should revenge himself on your father, is you stiould deceive him.  So <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> ha¬
ving assured him that hc vvould not stir; and this iPrr/Mw having set say], he made
his whole Sleet to steer the same course ; so that two dayes after, at the break of
day, the Pirate Arsalon, who could not oblige the Bassa to write to his sortne, saw
his whole Navy appear.  At first his ddign was to fight with it, andto that es¬
sest, he caused also his Sleet to bc made ready; but when as that oi<hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> appro¬
ched, and that enlarging it scls, he could distinstly count all the vcslcls, whereof
it was compofed, he found it so great, and his so small in comparison of it, as see¬
ing that it would have been temerity and solly in him, to hope for the Victory
with so unequall a number, hc took another resolution t And after he had instrust¬
ed the same <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> wsiom hc had formerly imployed, with his intendons, he sene
him back to <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>; who seeing a vcssell loofe from Arsalons Sleet, and comming
towards him, hoped that it might be his design had succcedcd. Alibeeh was not of
this opinion; and fear so absolutely oppressed her soul, as there was no place left
for hope: And truly she had reason; for this man was no sooner brought before

<p>man then, is to put me in remembrance ofthe obligations wherdn I siand encage I
to you •, and it is to say to me also. Do not abandon me.  Do not you abandon L
answered she, but suffer me to abandon you. I cannot, replyed 0/w^». Bot could
you indeed, sayd <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> to him, see a dagger in my fathers hand to stab the heart
of yours? For my part, continued she, I would rather dye. Let us die then, said
<hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> to her; for I tell yon once again, that it is as equally impollible for inc to
resolve to lose my father, as to abandon you.  In pursuance ofthis discourse, ./-
libech did yet what she could to obtain her husbands permission that she might &lt;'o
to herfather: She joyned tears toher prayers, and albeit that which she desired
would destroy her felicity, bereave her ofher liberty, expofe her to the sury of
her father, and deprive her of her husband , yet was siie so generous, as to omit
nothing of whatsoever she thought was capable of perswading him not to resuse
her that she  demanded. But seeing at last that she entreated in vain, and that Of
man unable to resolve on anything, yet seemed to be resolved not to render her,
she purposed to make use of a kinsman of the Bassa ofthe sea, whom she had won
after the first time that Arsalons Messenger came thither: And that she might talk
■ivith him at liberty, and without suspition, I see very well, sayd she to <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>,
that the tears which I shed to move your heart, do but harden it the more, and
that as long as you see me, you can resolve of nothing, wherefore suffer me to
•withdraw my Cdi, and remember, sayd she unto him, that the life of your father
is in question. Afterthis, she retired into the Captains cabbin, whither having
sent for the Bassa of the Seas kinsman, who she knew was very much assested, and
greatly obliged to him, as holding his fortune of him;  When hc was come, and
that she cOuid speak to him without witnesses, she summoned him tothe perfor¬
mance of the promise he had made her two dayes before, to doany thing forthe
deliverance ofthe Bassa of the sea, when she should suriiish him with means for it.
For rightly foreseeing that <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>would never resolve to remit her int., the hands
of Arsalon, though he was very generous, and that he loved his father exceeding¬
ly ,  this courageous woman had forecast a way hovv to beguile him.  As'rcr then
tha't she had asked of him, who was to serve her in her design, whether he was re¬
solved for it or no ? and that she had told him how all that she vVould have of hini
•was  that he would give her the opportunity the night following to go to Arsi-
/o« in the veslTel which he commanded.  This man, albeit very much obliged to
the Bassa of the Sea , was notwithstanding somewhat unwilling ro consent there¬
unto.  But lr4//^&lt;?sr/:'adding art to her entreaties, undertook to peiswadc that to
him,'which she did not bcleeve her self.  She told him that her father would let
himself be moved with her tears; that without doubt this generous action would
touch him; and thatso without expofing her to any great danger, she stiould de¬
liver the Bassa of the Sea.  This man then suffering himself to be carried to what

<p>to ddiver his father, without lofing his wise ; no, no, said he to himselfe, lean-
not lose <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, but I must lose my self too.  Let us resolve upon it then, and
make the Bassa our Father see, that we doe for him all that we can.  He hath given
me life, I am ready to render it to him .igain ; and  I cannot think that Heaven
would approve ofthe ddivering ofan innocent tothe crueltic of ^r/^j/&lt;7«; neither
doc I think too, added he, but his revenge would be more satissicd with having me
in his hands, than with having/^///^scA.  And albeit he hath not demanded meas-
well as she, it vvas doubclds because he bdeeved, that I would render him my wise,
rather than render him my self But alas cryed he, how was hc ill informed of my
thoughts! As for my Father, saidhe,I may not beleeve that he can complain of me,
siuce I indanger my self for the love ofhim. And as iov Arsalon,hQV]i\\ in my
person find an objest worthy ofhis wrath ; it is I that stoleaway his daughter from
him ; it is I that was the cause ofthe shght of that generous Slave, from whom hee
expested sb many things; in sine, I alone am culpable ; and is there bc any justicc
in his cruelty, I alone too shall be punished. He shall deliver my Sadier, or at least¬
wise I shall wear yrons with him ; and is rage carries him to take away my life,
I shall howsoever have the satissaction to dye , without having abandoned, either
my Father, or my wise.  I owe my life to my Father, and i shall render it to hini
again, in lofing it for his sake. I owe my liberty to the generous Altbech,znd char¬
ing my sds with the same chaines wnich are prepared for her , I shall have done for
her all that the unhappiness ofmy destiny permits me to do.Let us goe then, added
he, let us goe to Arsalon sincc it is as equally impoftible for me, to abandon my Sa¬
ther, as to lose-^//^ss/;.  This designc being strongly imprinted in his heart, hee
drew the <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> aside, and told him softly, that as soon as night was come bee
should have satissaction ofhim, and assured him besides, that is hedid not render
<hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> to him, he would at leastwise goe along with him in his vessell, and carry
hisanswer himself to Arsalon.  Thisnian, being able to doe nothing else, resol¬
ved to wait the time he had appointed; in the mean space <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> sent for one,
named Alahomet, a man of command, and one that you know hath courage and ex¬
perience; and having told him thathe was going the iicxs night to try is hee
could deliver his father, by meanes ofan intelligence which hee'had with Arsalons
messenger, he willed him, itby misfortune his deiigne stiould not succeed, to com¬
mand ihesleei in his absence, and not to sail in taking speciall heed to <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>,
and to send her back to Conjlamimple in a vcssell; but not before hee had tarried
some dayes in the view of Arsalons sleet; and whatsoever shoidd happen not to fight
with him.  This man, vvho vvas prudent, would faine have been a little better clea¬
red of <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>s dehgne; but whatsoCver hecould do, he could not obligchim un¬
to it ; and <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> making use of his absolute power,  hee could doe no other
but obey.  Alter this , <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> went to <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, but whereas both of them had
eadi their dehgne, dthough they had an hundred things tofay to one another, out
of the opinion wherein they were, that they should never meet again , the desire

Ottlie Commanders of hisSleet after him to retain him ; buthe vvas much amazed
whenas these veslcils comming neer to one another, hee saw <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> standing on
the deck. Whereupon he gave a great skreek, and litle lacked but through a trans¬
port for which hecould give no reason he had not cast himself into the Sea to m
to her. How unhappy am I cryed he II parted from my sleet to save <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>.und my
departure alone delivers her into the hands ofher father ; and so I came not with¬
out doubt but to be a spestator of her punistiment.But is <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> was amazed, no less
Wis <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>; for some ofher vessell having known <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>,;Lnd having told it to her,
she was insinitely asshsted, &amp; beleeved the same of <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> which hc had bdeeved of
her.In the mean time v^r/^/o»,having sent to discover this vessell, was much surpn-
led to understand,that Alibecb came in that,and not in his Brigantine;which still ap¬
proaching aswell as the othcr,niade him see <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> on the poop.Now albeit he could
not comprehend that which he saw,yet was he glad to see more in his hands than he
bad hopedfor; and causing the Bassa ofthe Sea,ladcn vsith chaines, to mount upon
the deckjCome said he unto him,give your yrons to this Slave that betrayed me,and
to this ingratefull daughter that abandoned me.The Bassa discerning his Son, was
extremely asshsted; and <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> seeing his Father in that estate,was sensibly touched
therewith. At length these two vesself being come up to Arsalons, and <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> &amp; Of
sw&lt;«« being brought before him. Behold, said he as they were approaching tohim,
these worthy objests ofmy hatred &amp; wrath, whora their treachery had drawn out of
my po"Wcr,and whom fortune hath restored unto me.We are rather an objest of youi*
pitty, answered <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>,who was forraoft,&amp;: fallen on her knee when shee came ncer
to"Arsalon; but,continued she,l came not hither to nioove you to compassion; I bc¬
leeve that your wrath is cquitable,&amp; your hatred just.And seeing I hold it impoflible
to reenter into your favor, I come to break his chaines who hath been in stead ofa
father to me, ever since I abandoned yen ; doe not think that <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> hath consented
to that which I doe;, it is a pure effect of mine own will. Alas! cryed Ofma» then,
beholding the Bassa of the Sea, pardon me dear father, isl could not resolvc to give
my wise for to save you; but to testifie unto you, that I doe whatsoever I can, I am
come hither to take your chaines upon me, and to obtain your liberty with the loss
ofmy life. Wherefore, said he to ^r/^/ow, deliver my Father, and put the chaines
OJi me that he wcarcs.  I alone am faulty, and I alone am to bc punished; for asfor
<hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, all her cnme is nothing else but having compassion of others misfortunes.
^r/i«/a»,sceing two persons so neer him, by whom he thought he had been much a-
buscd, could not contain his former sury, and commanded that the Bassa of the Sea
should be loofed, and his chaines divided betwixt <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>: but the Bas¬

caused the Slave whom ^rp?/o» loved somuch to sly away; in sine, itwas I  that
have done all these things: so that my father being innocent as vvell as you, I am,
to demand justice for you both ; render it unto them then in this occasion, saidhe
to Arsalon, and let me suffer all imaginable torments; for provided I may see these
two persons set at liberty, I shall dye willingly, and without grief  We will not
have it with the price of your blood, cried then both the Bassa of the Sea, and the
generous <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, and to save you we arc even ready to shed ours. Why will you
not have me ddiver my Father, said <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> to her tlicn ? For that answered Ali--
bech, as I am the cause of his misfortune, it is just I should be so too of his liber¬
ty.  But said she to Arsalou, consult no further hereupon, <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi>loves me tothat
height, as he will never yeeld but by violence. And fear not, tny Lord,said she unto
him, to give him his liberty, you will punisti him enough in punishing me; and
the irons which I shall wear, will be more heavy to him without doubt than to me.
Arsalon not able to forbear from bdng moved with so much generofity, and <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>
having incountred his eyes, where she saw sas she thought) some marks of tcnder¬
ness, continued her discourse, and redoubled her prayers.  My Lord, said she un¬
to him, I believe that i my self labour mine own ruin, and that consclTing my self
guilty, vvithout seeking excuses for my crime, I render my self unworthy to ob¬
tain that which I desire of you : Wherefore , continued she , permit me for the
lessening of my fault to put you in remembrance of that blessed time, when as the
Pirate vsr/i?/i;« was aSatrapeof Persia; you know, my Lord, that my Mother a-
bandoned her Parents to follow you, and that then you called that excess of love
andgenerofity in her, which now you term an horrible crime in me.  Ic is true,
thatlhavefollowed0y7»/r»,butit was not as a slave, it was as my husband; and
let heaven be my witncsj, whether in abandoning you, I do not quit a part of my
self; and whether I have not ever since made vowes for your preservation.  This
mighty Sleet which is ready to set upon me ssaid Arsalen to her, who yet did
not yecld) is without doubt an effect ofyour prayers and affection. Alas I answc^
red <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> would have sought with you, he would not have come and
put himsclsinto your hands without Arms. Considerthen, my Lord, is there be
any sense of pity resting in you, whether you can with justicc resplve the destru¬
stion of a man, who seeing his father in captivity, hath notwithstanding had that
respest for you, as not to fight with you because you were mine; you see too that
he is not an unnaturall sonne, since he comes himself to ofser you his liberty and
hishfe to ddiver his father. Iconjurcyou then by the memory of the onely person
of the world whom you have mostdeady loved, and who gave me life, to sur¬

of, my Lord, it is easie to imagine what these three persons and Arsalen said, who
sCertainly for his part shewed sUch marks of his repentance, and spake so many ge-
alerous, and obliging things, as itwas easie to perceive that he had not alwayes
been a Pirate.  Now, my Lord, that I may not prolong this relation any further,
you shalf understand, that Arsalon notonly pardoned his daughter, promised an in¬
violable affection to the Bassa of the sea and his sonne, but also took the resoluti¬
on to cease from being a Pirate : For which effect he obtained the Bassa of the
seas permission to dism iss all them thathad ranged themselves under his obedi¬
ence; who although they were forry to lose so courageous a Chieftain, yet vvere
they comforted with the greatness of the booty which he left them; and cmbar-
quing himself inthe same vessell which had brought <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> thither, vvithout re¬
serving any part ofthe riches which he had gotten ; You see, said he, smiling to
the Basla of the sea and his sonne, how I render my self at discretion, and how I
conside in your generofity. After this, my Lord, they went to the Sleet, where was
so universall a rejoycing, as the like hath never been heard spoken of.  Inthe

<p>till their vertue were worthily acknowledged.  And verily it might be sayd, that
Ihrahtm knew what would happen s sur le.nvcly was Mjrath z diyes jour ley from
the Camp, when ashe was advertised that there were Deputies icom Sultama thac
desired to speak with him ; he was told alto that these deputies wereall in mourn¬
ing, and seemed to be extremely asshsted. This novelty sui prised bim, and where¬
as UlamavTHsnot present at such time as this message Was delivered unto him, he
sent for him in all hast, and when he was come to his Tent, and the Deputies
likewise, one amongst them, afterhehad begun his discourse withanElogitim of
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, the better to prepare him not to resuse them that which they purposed to
crave of him, acquainted him with all tbathad past at Sitltani.t, 'iince the battell ot
Niphates, wherewith ULim.i and hc were strangely surprised :  And truly this rela¬
tion was extraordinary enough, to beget no mean amazement. For it hud fallen
out, that after that day which had proved so glorious to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and so satall co
the Sophy, the death of r&gt;ts//&gt;Ws«^, and the di^leasure for having been vim^nilhed,
pofsesscd him with somuch grief, as he sell sick at the very same instant, Asfor
the ambitious-P^rc^, she reioyced in her heart at the death oi Detirh'ent, as a thing
which she had long wished for; the sicknest of Tachnas did not disquiet her, but
contrarily she beleeved, that the less able he should be to direst, the more power
the should have. As sbr the stupid Ismofel, Ihe did not regard him as any great ob¬
stacle to her design; she was notwithstanding very much vexed, when she Under¬
stood of him, after the loss of the battel!, that in the heat of the fight Ulama had
given him his life and his liberty, in drawing him out ofthe hands of agreat
many souldiers, who would have either taken or killed him : For albeit shfe for¬
bad him to publish this action, yet was he so silled with joy iO\' his escape out ot
thac perill, as it was impofsible for her to keep him from telling it to divers per¬
sons, though it was not out of any acknowledgement.  Perca was not ignorant,
th^tUlama had a number of secret friends, who watched but sot" an occasion to
declare themselves for his advantage. She knew likewise, thit all which Were of
Mahxmedes znd Axiamimes party, sought but for a pretext to stir ; so as she
si:ared that this action comming tobeknoWn, in the estate wherein things were,
use mightbe raade of it forthe making of some propofitions to <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, vvhith
might be prejudiciall unto her, inthe design which sht had to reign. But this in¬
forcunace Prince was not long in a  condition to think of the affaires of
his Empire ; for albeic his Physicians had imployed all their skill for the pre*
servation of his life, yet could they not pofsibly save hiirt ; and the fourth day after
the lossof the battell, death stisled that passion in his heart, which had made him
do so much injustice. As soon as he had given up his last breath, PeH'a, Without
amusing her self in unprofitable tears, took great cate to conceal it, Uhtill sush
time as she was assured of the minds of the principal! persons of Sultnkin ; for as
forthe men of command, so great a number were slain in the day 6s battell, as
there scarcely rested any conlidcrable enough, tsrongly to oppose what sile m64nt
to undertake.  She caused the Courtcill then to be assembled in the name ofthe So¬
phy, where she and//w^?/appeared in nioatning ; and whetcas she had Wit and
subtilty, after shc had with seigned tears made the hearts of those that heard her
pliant, she acquainted them with che death of the Sophy, craved their assistance for
the direstion of Ismael, and in conclusion sheWed thcni a paper, vrhich indeed she
hzd^zde<hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> to sign, without knowing What he die!, vvhereby hi declared
that in case Ismael should prove incapable of reigning, his intent then was that
the Empire should devolve to Ptrc/j, not holding them forhis lawfull shcceslbrs
which hadcast themselves into the armesof his enemy. All these things exceed*
ingly astonlshed those which heard them; the death of TachMax asshsted thertt •
the order which he had left did not please; Ism.ids Sovcralgnty Was a thing thdy
could not resolve for; and that oiPiYca seemed yet worse tn them.  Thiy ^ulJ

<p>them; and that consequently, they werenottogo tiimultuously andacquaintl^
enemy with the death of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi>, for fear left he should make use of this ad
vantage to ruin them; yea,and those persons too whom he had in his hands  and
■which were so insinitely dear unto them.  The most of them then resolved, with
out making any shew thereof, to deser the manisestation of thdr hatred to ' Perca
of thdr contempt oi Ismael, and of their affection to Mnhamed, <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, ind Hal
ma, untill such time as they had recovered new forces, to the end they might oppose
Terca,znd to the end also that in making some propofitions of peacejthey might yet
be in a condition to desend theniselve?,is"it were resused.Concealing then their true
meaning, after they had lamented the death of <hi rend="italic">Tachmas</hi> , they acknowledged
Ismael for their lawfull Prince ; saying nevertheless to Perca, thac shee was to
assils him with her counsell, and that she should raign under the name of//;w&lt;?s/.
This Princess, who thought that the most faithfull might be corrupted , and that
particular interest was alwaies preserred before honor and glory,because such were
her true thoughts, beleeved, that is shee inriched all these which were in thiscuim*
sell, she should absolutely gain them to her selfe, and oblige them to set the crown
on her head.  To which effect, whcnas the Assembly was ready to break up, ihee
said further, that the Sophy her Father having given all his treasure unto her, by a
testament which he had made in her favor s as indeed it was true) she did not think
that shecould better dispofe of it,than in distribudng it amongst thofc,that were ca¬
pable of aiding Ismael to CnHain the Scepter which hewas going to bear. Afterthis,
Ihe made them pass, though they were unwilling to it, into a great room, where
she had caused all the Sophyes riches,and treasure,to be laid ; to the end that by the
light of so tempting an objest, their hearts might be overcome with the desire of
snaking themselves mafters ofit.  They proved notwithstanding more generous
than she imagined ; for although they tessisied a great deal of acknowledgement
to herfor her liberality,yet would they not accept of it.ln the mean time they resol¬
ved to let no body go out ofthe Citty, which might acquaint the enemy with the
death oiTaehmas; for being so powerfull as he was, it m ight give him a minde to
come and asfault them in Sultania, which otherwise it may bee hee would not doe.
Durin&lt;^ all these things, every one had their designes; Perca thought of nothing but
oi mzkin^ Ismael to be hated; the iviend^oi Mahamed, Axiamtra, and Vlama, at¬
tended with impatience the troopes which were to come unto them from the re¬
mote Provinces, to the end they might doe thatwhich they thought would bee
most requisite; Ismael sought how hemight sree himself from the care of affaire?.
Things having'continued some dme inthis sort, it hapned in the end that thesame
sacility, which she had so much liked in//w^s//dispofition, gave her agreat deal
of unquietness, for even in the like manner as she had made her sds mistress of ir,
so did others • he was no sooner out of his fight, but this Prince altered his mind
according to the humor ofthose that talked with him; and ui.ercas every one was
enemy to Perca, as often as she returned to him,stic found him changed; and thought
;t was not dissicult for her to bring him to her bowagain, yet shee feared thatat
some time or other use would be made of his name to undoe her. They,unto vvhom
Zael had told that Vlama had saved his life, having reported it to others, ad the

yielding up a Crown, is not worthy to live / In the mean season, the first gates of
the Palace were forced, there wanted no more but breaking up the rest for to get in,
they which garded them having abandoned them.  In this drcadfull estate, Perca
taking a dagger, which had been brought to Ismael out of a beleesthat he would
have armed himself, and seeing that shc could not avoyd salling into the power ot
a people silled vvith sury, did yet what she could to get him to shew himself.  Shec
joyned threatnings to intreatics, and perceiving at last rhat all which shee sa id vvas
in vaiiijSs that in an inss ant she the uld no longer be mistrd^s ofher self,rage so seiaed
on her soul,as presenting the dagger unto him with an extreme transport;Chuse,said
she unto him, either to pierce my heart, or to doe what I would have you.  And
when as Ismael had told her, that he would not doc either the one orthe other, and
that she heard a great noyse, whereby she knew that the last door was broken open;
since thou knowest not, said she unto him, cither how to reign, or how to obey, I
will keep thee at leastwise from dying a Ihamefull death; saying so shcc stabbed
the dagger into Ismaels heart, who presently sell down dead, and without surthei
delay struck it into her own bofoni, and salling down upon her brothers body, she
ceased to be ambitious in ceasing to live.  These conspirators being entred into the
Palace, and having learned from some ofthe Princess women the cause of IsmaeU
death, and likewise that of Ssrc/j, they redoubled their cryes, and testified asmuch
joy, as is all their enemies had been defeated.  In the mean time the Wisest and
the most considerable of Sultania had begun to oppose the people, although they
loved not Percn ; but comming to understand the success ofthe business, they held
it not sit to incense them, but rather in so strange an accident to make use of theit
zeal in favor of Mahamed and Axtamira. After then that they had let them know,
how there was no further uced of taking up armes, sihce the objest oftheir hate Was
no longer in an estate to hurt them ; after that for the calming of their shry, they
had removed the bodies oi Ismael and Perca out ofthe Way; audi after that they had
promised speedily to settle a peace for them, and call home their exiled PrinGes,e".
very one retyred to his own house : and the CoUiiccll being set, it wag advised

his grief was, he could not keep Mahamed and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> from receiving this pea e
with tears, since they had so lamentable an occasion for it; but whereas this as¬
fair direstly concerned them, they were to treat with them about it; that in the
mean time hc hdd it requisite, that one of them stiould return to Sultama, to assure
the people that ere long they stiould see their lawfull Princes again ; and that the¬
rest stiould go to Bit ilisa, to do their duty to Mabamed and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>; that to
comfort thcni forthe grief which so dolefull an accident would bring thcni Hi..-
ma should take rhe pains both to conduct them thither, and also to accompany the
Prince, Princess, and <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi> back vA'hen they returned.  Ulama perccivinj; that
/^r4^;&gt;w in turning himself towards him, seemed to demand his consent for that
■which he had spoken, aslured him that hc vvas very ready to do it.  And whereas
he was generous, I doubt not, said he, but the Prince and <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi> will be senii-
bly touched with this loss, smee I that am not obliged thereunto by so strist bondr
and that have seen my self the objest of the hatred and persecution of those whom
Ibcwail, cannot choofe but be grieved ac the accident which is betallen thcrn.
After that ^/^wrs had given sussicient proof of his generofity by his sorrow, and
that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had commended him for so noble a resentment, he gave him coniniis-
sion totake care of the Deputies of ;«/s&lt;i«/^ till rhe next day, when bethought it
sit they should depart for to go and setch Mahamed, which accordingly was exe¬
cuted. Ulama parted with those that were to accompany him, carrying Letters
from Ibrahtm to the PrinceG i one ofthe Deputies went to Sultama, and. the
Grand Visier remained with a joy that cannot be exprest; for whereas he was per¬
swaded thatthe beginning of his felicity depended on the happy end of this war,
seeing the favourable means which fortune presented him with to terminate it
speedily and with glory, he could not render thanks enough to heaven for soad¬
vantagious a success.  And whereas hc knew that the people generally delircd
peace, he was assured that the treaty of it would be agreeable to every body; not
knowing that Soltman had any other interest in this war, than that of the glory of
his Arms. In ibis thought it niight be said, that never any Lover absdit from his
Mistress was so happy as he, whilst hc entertained himself with so sweet a hope.
In the mean time Ulama arrived at BitiUsa, presented the Deputies to Prince Maha¬
med andthe Vrinceh <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>., and delivering <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s letter to her, and ac¬
quainting them with the loss they had sustained, they being generous instandy for-

that r^s/:'w4&lt; was their father,//w/Js/was thdr brodicr, and Perca thdr lister; in

tllama having imparted to them the generous designs of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and how necessa¬
ry their presence was to their people for their consolation against so many iiiite-
rics as they had indured, they set forth on their way. As for ^W, the fight of his
dear S.///^«^'comforted him for the loss ofhis enemies,  and the Princes and
Princesses sorrow was to both of them their greatest displeasure. In theend after

ruptinghiui, as tu speak in this tort tothem which ow their lives and libertie to
bim, ought alune to make it such as he pleaseth, since it is certain that he cm doe
nothing that is unjust. After that these illustrious persons had rendred all the civi¬
lities to one another which their generofity obliged them unto, they sell to accord
upon the Articles of this peace, vvhich were so advantageous for the two Lmpire?,
and so glorious for <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, as the people and the souldiers, who will meddle with
judging of all things vvithout knowledge, and outof interest, could finde nothing
to murmure at.  This Treaty, having been signed by <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, for the supply¬
ing of ^^^^ws^-s desest, was also signed by/^mA«»?, by Ulama, by the Deputies
of Sultania, and by the chiefest of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>s Army.  After this, Mahamed, who bad
alwayes loved ^.v/Vzw/r/j exceedingly, desired her that she would Ihare in his pow¬
er, and having requested her that ihe would be his guide, she promised him, that
as she had never had a deiign to marry, so she vvould neither think of it, nor aban¬
don him.  And in this manner she satished that which shc owed toher own incli¬
nation, that \A\:\&lt;ih Mahamed dtiued of her, and thatwhich the memory of Prince
GMw^sriequired of her generofity.  Mahamed then 2i%]ked oi Ulama, whether he
vvould not injoy the felicity of his reign? And think not, said  he  unto  him,
thatsucceedingtotheSophy, I will succeed to his pasiions ; I shall be your Prince,
and your Friend, but i shall never bc your Rivall. Ulama answered to this discourse
with a great deal of generofity ; and whereas the love to ones  Countrey is ssrong
enough in every mans soul; and whereas there was a very straght union between
all these illustrious persons; though Ulama was exceedingly obliged to the Sultan,
and that he loved <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> as much as himself, yet he resolved to abandon his pro¬
testor for to follow his lawfull Prince.  Things being in this estate, Arsalon arri¬
ved luckily for himself, accompanied with <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alibech</hi> ; and whereas
/^r^t/j/w was presently advertised thereof, he went and received them, and condu¬
sted them to Axuimimes Tent, where Mahamed was: and after he had recounted
unto them the history of Arsalon, whereof the beginning was not unknown to
them; after hc had commended the generofity of 0/ilw/«« and ^//i'ei-/?, and excu¬
sed the violence of her father, he obtained this grace of the new Sophy, who in¬
gaged his word to him to restore him to his former dignity.  In the mean time the
Articles of the Peace had been published^ both in the Army, and in Sultania, with
great ligns of rejoycing on either side; andthe hour of separation being come,
the Sophy said to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that owing his Life, his Libcrty,andthe Crown which
he was going to wear, unto him, he selt himself obliged to tell him, that he should
alwayes siiide him ready tohazzard them forhis service : In sine, said he unto him,
generous Ibr.xhim, I ow unto you not onely that which you have done for me, not
ondy the good vvhich my Empire receives from you, but also that which you have
done for the Princess <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, for <hi rend="italic">Felixana</hi>, and for Ulama.  judge after this, is
without being ingratefull I can be meanly acknowledging.  And I profess unto
you, added he, in taking his last farewell of him, that rhe most sensible sorrow
which ever my blindness gave me, is that vvhich I now sed, for that I cannot see my
Protestor.  y^ra^/wgoing to answer him, was hindred from it hy <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>;
Desend not your sds, said sbe untohim, with an unjust modesty, and permit, that
iiowatparting, we may testifie unto you, how not finding means to  oblige you,
we are not unworthy to be obliged, since we know hovv to prize your vertue, and
dkcm of the rare qualities that are in you.  And for my particular , added she,
I hold ;o//w^«to be gieater, more mighty, and more happy in having you for his
Subject, than in being Master of so great a number of Provinces, which make him
to be redoubted over all the earth.  You so confound me, Madam, answered Ibra-
/vw, with an high respest, asl cannot answer you ; but know, said he , that into
what part of^ the wodd soever fortune cardes me, you shall ever have ofme a
faithfull and pashonate servant.  Is one might be a Subject out of choice  vou
vvould have too many, said he unto them, your vertue would make deserts of all

Visier having promised Arsalon to take care of them , and to protest them as much
as he could,this generous Pirate comforting his daughter,told her,that owing more
to her husband than to him, it was just that she should follow his fortune; and that
she had done enough in getting him the honour and liberty to go &amp; die in his coun-
try,to make it appear she had quitted her self toward shim forthe life he had given
her.At last all these generous persons being scparated,0/ss»^« and Alibeckhe^zn thdr

nothing but of withdrawing his troups out of the enemyes country ;  to the end
that being upon the srondre, he might quit the Army, and go to carry the news
himself ofhis Victory, and ofthe Peace to Soltmen.  He discamped then the next
day with a great deal of order and diligence ; howbeit he had the satissaction
before his going out of ^trsia to understand, that Mahamed had been received in¬
to the throne of his Fathers with joy; that Ulama had maried Seli.xana ; that v^r-
salonwzs received to his dignity; and that after somany misfortunes those Illu¬

<p>r-rHe Illustrious Bassa having past the whole night without sleeping, somuch
I had the hope of seeing//^W/^ pleasingly entertained hmi, ^nt .is soon as the
Sun appeared to know whether Soltmau would be pleasedth.it he stiould come wait
upon him, and render him an account of his voyage. The Sultan surprised with
athinti which hehad not much apprehended, in regard he thought it not so
near, gave not his answer so speedily. He marvelled ac the grand Vihers return,
considenng the order which he had sent him, not to come back before he heard
fromhim, what profperous success soever he snoiild happen to have; but in Hne,
it bdng no longer time to reason on things past, and being constrained to answer
precisely to that which vvas demanded of him, his mind was in agrcat diforder.
The name of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, vvho vvas so near, pofsessed him with some remorse of his
fault , but the thought then of lofing the Princess, madehim instantly repent him
ofso good amotion, and with never to see <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> more, that he niight still re¬
tain IsabelU, whom he had not seen since that crudl instant, wherein out of his
fear of the Bassaes return he had joyned threatnings to entreaties, and given her
but only eight dayes time to resolve once for all, whereof six were already past
when as the Bassa came back to C&lt;'w/?'&lt;«^'w/'/s ; and he had been three moneths a-
•way without any news at all of him, so exactly had the resolution which he had
taken for it been executed. But in sine, how violent soever Soltmans love was,
yet could he not resolve to see <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and keep <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> from hini: For wherc-
.is he had alwaies a strong dispofition inhis heart to gCKid , and some thoughts
of friendlhip for the Grand Visier, the shame of his crime, the small hope he had
of vanquishing <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and the short time he had to resolve in, made him send
Ihrahimviovd that he might come presently; and thatat his arrivall he should
find <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> at his Palace, whither he was going to return her : This Prince cer¬
tainly would never have yeelded to this, had he had any hope lesc of gaining the
Princesses heart; but since the day that hc had last spoken with her, and that hc
had taken great care to have her narrowly observed, hehad learnt, that she was
in so great an astlistion, as he was afraid the extremity ofher grief would kill
her: So that considering he should commit a crime to no purpose, is he should
retain JsabelU, he was the more easily induced to let her go forth ofthe Seraglio.
In this thought he would not see her, but sent for the Sultana Asl-eria, who vvas
no sooner come to him^ but he commanded her to go and tell Jsabella, that Ibra¬
him vvas returned, and that out of an excess of bounty he permitted her to go out
of the Seraglio ; but that she should beware of acquainting theGrand Visier with
oughtthat he hadsaid unto her, because an extrenie mischief might thereby ar¬
rive both to him, and to her. Asieria went and executed her commishon
with a great deal of pleasure ; for albeit she loved IsabeUa very dearly, yet
the desire of her conservation was stronger in her soul, tiian her own con¬
tent. The Princess received this news with so excessive a joy, as her heart
was not capable of resenting it siissiciently ; Emilia likewise was insinitely glad
ofit: At first Jsabella could not beleeve it ; after shc had beleeved it the gain-
sayd herself; and she wasso accustomed to misfortune, as she could not think
sogrcat a good hap was befallen her. In the mean time the Chariot, which
was to carry her to Jbrahims Palace, being come, she embraced the Sulta¬
na Asieria i promised her that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> should have no cause to complain of
her; gave her thanks for her goodness in protesting her; assured her that shee
would never lose the memory of it ; and then she got into the Ch.inot
vvith Emilia , and went to Jbrahims Palace to meet with her friends to
whom shee gave a greater and a purer joy, than that which shee sdt her Vds

ted; nevertheless in regard the thing was done, andthat Ibrahir^^Z^ldd^,
to arrive, he changed nc.t his order.  In the mean time the grand Visier hiv  J
madenodoubt butthatheshouldeasily obtain thcpermission^^^
of ;.W, caused a stately Galliot, which he knew was in the Arsenal at Pera to I-
launched into the water; and it was for this purpose that hee had sent one of hVs
servants certain dayes before, to the end he stiould give order secredy for the ha
ving of It in a rcadiiiess against became. As soon then as he understood the SukaiK
pleasure hee irabarqued himsds, attended by all the Commaiuicrs which had acl
companied hini: and truely there was never a more magnificent or more .'.prccabL-
objest: seen than this Galliot, especially when Ibrahm was abord it.  All that was
looked upon was painted and gilt; the whole Poop was hung with <hi rend="italic">Persian</hi> Tape¬
stry, whose ground was gold ; it was covered all over with is aggs and streamersof
divers colours; all the slaves that rowed were sastned with silver chaines, and all
of them had garments of cloth of gold; twelve Trumpeters were on the Coursey
cloathcd in velvet, whofc ground was gold; all the Commanders appardl was
imbroidered vvith pearles and diamonds; and in the midst ofthis stately troup
stood/^r^^&lt;»» alone, though be had sixgreatcushionsof cloth of gold at his feet;
He held in his hand a battoun of command, and was so superbly apparelled, as it
■was easie to perceive that this petty triumph was an effect of peace, since richcsand
abundance were every where seen, and very few marks of war.  Jbrahim hid thar
day on a robe of cloth of silver, imbroidered with gola and diamonds, intermixed
with certain carnation silk twist, which added very much to the beauty of that ha¬
bit ; His turbant was covered all over with carnation and white plumes of feathers,
set up with jewels of diamonds of an inestimable value ; His Scymitar, and the
golden  chaines whereunto  it was sastned, were answerable to the gorgeous-
;iess ofhis garment: now akhough silk , iilver, gold, pearl, and diamonds richly
appeared there, yet might itbc said with truth,that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> gave rather a new luster
to all those things, than that he recivcd any from thera. His shapc was goodly, well
made, and advantageous ; his cariage sree and noble; his face ovall; his eyes black,
and full of fire and sweetness; his mouth agreeable; his complexion neither too de¬
licate, nor too grofs, neither too pale, nor too rcdj but such as M.in is painted,
■when ashc is amorously represented unto us; His hayr wasofchcsnut color; and
his nofe somwhat aquilin, yet so as it served to give him the better aspest; His phy¬
siognomy was promising and sprightfull; his soul was seen in his eyes, his courage
and his assabilitic appeared equally in them; and without having ought of the
beauty ofa woman, hc was the goodliest man that ever was beheld. In tine there
■was seen in his whole person, a losty ayr without pride, a gallanterie without as¬
sestation, a iieglcstfull handsomness, a srceness without artitice, a civility without
constraint, and somthing so great and so high therein, as one could not behold him
without judging him worthy to wear a crown. All these naturall graces had a new
lustre the day wherein <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> entred into Conslavtmeople, and the hope of seeing
/s^^s//4 had painted such a joy in his face, as gave him a certain cxtiaordinarya-
sireeableness. This petty triumph was not without spcstators; for IbrahmsretMrn
bdng known, whereas he was universally bdoved, all the Grandees of the Port,
and III the people oi Consiantinople, repairedtothc Haven, andby the shouts which
they gave as soon as the Galliot approached, they testisyed their zeal and affection

also placed hiniiels upon a Terrace  with a B.illustrade  of Jasper ,  vvhich

who was leaning on the Balustrade, he saluted him vv/ith a profound relpest, auel
being landed, all the people redoubled their sbouts.  The most considerable ap¬
proached to salute him, and they that could not do so, did at the least: what they
could tobe seen of hini.  After that  this multitude had shshcieiitly cunsidercd
him, vvhom they acknowledged for their Protestor, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, followed by all the
Grandees, and all thepeople, went to the Seraglio, where he entred alone ; for
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> iteXin^ the diforder of his soul, vvould not give hini any but a private:
Audience. Whcnas he was come into the Sultans chamber, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> could not
chuse but be somewhat glad, yet was he pofsdsed with consusion at the very same
instant, and received not the Bassa with ;^hat sreeness, wherewith hc was wont to
testifie the aisestiun which he bore him.  Before time, he would rather haye spoken
to him ofthe grief his absencc had been the cause of to him; of the fear he was i»
for him ; of the health of IsabelU; and of the  joy he had for his return ;  than
of affairs of State: but in this encounter, he would needs have him at the very
first render him an accompt of the War;  and although hc had resolved to give I-
brahim no marks of the diforder of his soul, yet could he not forbear it.  In the
midst of his relation hc asked ofhim, whether he hadnot received a new order
which hehad lent him?  AndvAiems Ibrahint had assured him that he hadnot
he scemed to be vexed at ir, without telling hini what it was :  And at such time
as the Grand Vilicr had informed him, how advantageous the peace which he had
made in Persia was for him, he CQuld not chuse but tdl him things, which might
make him judge, that hc would have been glad he had not terminated the War as
yet. Howbeit /Z-r/s/w; suspested nothing else of it, but that during his absence
Roxlana and Rnsi-an had periwaded him from making a Peace so sbon.This thoui?ht
gave him some unquietness, nevertheless ic presently diminished ; for <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> per¬

As they were standing there, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> chancing to cast up his cjes wa y et Z ''
mazed, when as he dpyed on the foot-pace of the Ballustrade that divided s,:
Court, IsabelU commn^?, towards him, accompanied with Sophronia, Hipolii
Emilia, and Leonida.  What inchantment, cryed he in advancing towards Isal^elU

You see. Madam, said he unto her, in killing her hand which she had given him
that they have not been in vain, since I can assure you, that my voyagehath been
profperous, and that I am still absolutely yours.  After this, Ibrahm saluted these
tourbeautifull companions of the infortunate <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, who each of them in their
pardcularniadehinia complement; and then <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> having lent the Pnncess
his hand, this fair troop entred into the Palace, and went to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>es chzmhzr
It was there where these illustrious friends testiiied the true thoughts which they
had for one another; <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> nevertheless marvelled to see fewer marks of joy
in//^^s//&lt;^ss J face, than in that of all the rest, which had not so much interest in
his person: Notwithstanding whereas he saw that her complexion was a little
pale, he believed that it was an effect of some sickness which she had had; and in
this thought he went on in entertaining his friends with liberty enough of spirit.
He understood consusedly, and in few words, that which had Lrought them to
Consiantinople, but not without grief was heacquainted with the Count of L.t-
VAgnaes zndLeommes de^loT^le de^th.  You see, said IsabelU tohim then iioh-
ing, that there is never anyjoyso pureforus, but it is mixed vvith some bitt^r-
ness.She said this in suth a sashion,as gave him cause to think that IsabelU had some
thing which was  displeasing in her niinde ;  so that hc rdblvcd as soon
as  in  civility  he could  speak to her without being  heard, not to  lose
the occasion  for  it,  which  instantly presented it self.  For all those per¬
sons were too intelligent , and knew too well how to love, to be ignorant,
that after a long absence it would have been some inhumanity to keep two
hearts that loved one another so persestly, from communicating their thoughts
in private; so that presently after they were risen from meat, some went into
the Cabinet, some into the Gallery, and ?..4^w/7/V« alone remained in a corner of
the chamber with the Srench Marquis.  In the mean time IsubclU was not with¬
out unquietness, the remembrance of what <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had said to her pofsessed all
her soul, andthe incertainty wherein she was, whether she should impart it to
J^M^/w, or whether she should not speak to him of it, put her minde upon the
■wrack.  What shall I doc, said she toher self, in so crofs an incounter? Isl con¬
ceal the truth of that which hath befallen me from him, I trespass against our asse¬
stion, andit may be put his life and my honor in jeopardy : Butis I tell it tohim,
continued she, and he cannot forbear testisying somewhat of it, when as the Sul¬
tan hath injoyned me not to speak of it, we are undone, and nothing can save us.
Is I stay too, added she, till Solimtniends, to me forthe answer, which hc will have
nie give him within eight days, what stiall I doe then ? and what shall I say to
Jbrahim ? And is I come to the point to be constrained to acquaint him vvith his
unhappiness and mine, what may he think of my silence ? and what lawfull excuse
can I make to him for it ? But is it should happen too, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> hath repented
him, and that he sent not the slave to me, but ondy to try my discretion, I should
be euilty of all the mischiefs that raight follow thereupon, is by my imprudence

<p>j/;,M^/&gt;» remained alone with her; and whereas this thought made her extreniely
musing' May I, said he unto her. Madam, without lofing the respest which I owe
unto you, coraplain to you of your self, in reproaching you for thac you have
notasrauch joy for my return, as yoa had grief for niy departure?  Is this be a
crime, said the Princess, it is true that I am guilty of it; yet can I assure you, ad¬
ded shc, that it is not occasioned by any desest of affection, but by an habit which I
have gotten of mdancholy, I am asshsted more easily than I am comforted ; I am
raore sensible of grief, than of joy; and in the estate wherein I finde my icM,
there needs more things by far to content me , than there needs to render me insi¬
nitely unhappy. It is iiot,continued she, becaust your return doth not give me all
the joy thac I aai capable of, and even to that height, as without this remedy I an\
perswaded I should not have lived long ; but in conclusion wc are at Consiantinople,
and that is no litde evill. Jbrahim hearing IsabelU speak in this sort,and observing
her eyes and her face, hc contirnicd himself yet more in the opinion which he had ;
so that to be the betcer cleared therein, I consess, said he unto her, that we arc al¬
wayes neerer to bad fortune, than to good; but you raust consess unto me withall,
that untill such dme as .bV;»;/i« hath resused us the liberty which I ara to ask of
him, you havenot soniuch cause to be melancholick, as you had whenl parted
for Persia.  The event of the war was doubtfull; it might have been long; I mighc
have been beaten ; I might have dyed there; and slncc none of thcsc hath hapned,
and that I may justly demand my liberty for a recompence, why do I, Madam, see
mor: signs of grief in your rainde, than when we had all to fear, and noching to
hope for?  The Princess not answering precisely to Jbrahim, began to make him
partake her unquietness. He believed then that he was raore unhappy than he
thoughc hc was; and suddenly calling to rainde the change which he had noted in
;o//w4«x face, he no longer doubted but that there was fomething which <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
did not tdl him.  What accident, said he unto her, Madara, is befallen us ? Hath
fortune invented some new torment to persecute us withall? Speak I earnestly
besecch you, and whatsoever itmay be, be pleased to let me know it.  Jsabella
would then have put him ofs, with assuring him that she had no new matter to ac¬
quaint him vvith ; but the more she stood ofs, the more unquietness she gave him :
Wherefore he began to cast in his minde what the mischiefmight be, which would
not bc told him; Hath any one, said he unto her, wronged you during my absence^
hath any body conspired against your li'c ? hath the hate which Ro.xeUnahe^iV^ me,
carried her to seek the means to hurt you ? would she have sacdsiscdyou to her
revenge, as shc hath sacrisiscd Pdnce Musiapha to her rage ? would they have for¬
ced you to change your Rdigion ? hath Ruslan plotted any thing against me ? and
sthat which would be my last misery, and which I think cannot pofsibly be) is Sdli^
man become my Rivall, or mine Enemy &gt; The Princess thereupon not able to retaiti
her tears, put her hand before her eyes to conceal them from <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>.  Ah ' Ma¬
dam, said hc unto her then, gently pulling doWn her arra, do you answer me with
tears? can it be poflible, that this Pdnce stiould hate me, or loVe you too much?
leave me not long in pain, and I beseech you, Madara, express your self more clear-
ly. I would I could draw you out of it, answered the Pnncess still weeping, but

too blame my sds, and I am the cause of your misery : for why should not'l se

just love ? he that had been capable of sb cruell a thought, might easily forget thT
respest which he owed to your vertue; &amp; I am not excusable for abandoning-you It
IS no time to speak of that which is past, said the Pnncess unto him, but to think of
thatwhich is to come. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> wz&amp; not for allthat in an estate to give counsaile
for his minde was silled with so many severall thoughts, as hee scaicdy understood
what <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> said unto bim.  He vvas pofsessed with grief, anger, and repentance •
hatred and jeloulie had also some place in his soul; ncverthdess in the midst ofhis
transports, and although the interedoi Ijabella prevailed over all others, yet had
he loved <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>io much, that there were tome instants, wherein without conside¬
ring <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, and without considering himsds, he was asshsted for that this Prince
had given this blemish to his life. But when as he surprised himself in this thought
hc repented ofit, as ofa crime, and recntrcd into his former sury.  At length after
that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> and he had said all that their griefand affection could suggestrand that
the Princess had related to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> all that she beleeved vvas necessary hee should
know, the better to advise on that which they h.id to doe,they found that their rea¬
son was too much troubled, and they themselves too much intcressed in the busi¬
ness in question, for to judge sbtindly thereof  They rdolved then to call unto
this counsell, both their he and she friends; to the end that all ofthcra together
might seek out the meanes to avoyd the mischief that menaced them.  IsabelU iox:
that effect willed Emilia to czW them, and the Srench Marquis taking this imploy-
mentuponhini, brought this fair troup alittle after into the Princess chamber,
ivho with teares in her eyes craved pardon of her deer friends, for having made .i
secret to them of a thing, which shc would fain have concealed from herself; and
then, having recounted the estate wherein shee was with .<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, she silled thdr
hearts with grief, both for the interest which they had in her fortune, and for thdr
own ; knowing very well that their liberty depended on <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, vvho
being at odds themselves vvith <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>,'were not like to obtain that for others,vvhich
they could not obtain for theraselves.  This misery rhen being common, they all
sell to think ofwhat niight bcdoiie.  Some would have <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, without testisy¬
ing any knowledge of this unjust love, pursue his first designc, and demand his
lihcnyoi <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, because, said they, it may be that this Prince bdng ashamed of
his fault, and incensed with <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>s constancie, will grant him his rcquest, and re¬
solvc to deprive himself ofthe fight of a man whom he can no longer look upon
but with consusion, and of a person, whom it is impoflible for him to conquer. But
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> opposed this opinion; for whereas he knew Salman full wdl, he vvas sure
that love being saicc entred into his heart, would never goe out ofit again but with
violence; andthat hecould not be capable of repenting, but v/henas the cnmes
Tvbich love made him commit, were far greater than his pashon. Then it was pro¬
pounded, that no resoludon stiould be taken, till the dght daye.s which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>
had given IsabelU to make her answer in, were expired; because the fight oUh-a-
him it iiiicht be had revived the snendstiip which he bore him, and had banishcd,or
dimisticd the lovc which he carried to her.  But is <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was oppoute to the hrlt
advice that was given, the Princess said that she would never consent to this second:

<p>but two reniidies to be chofen, cithcrdeath or shght, The last is the belt, replyed
the Marquis, .and isl raay bc beleeved , it IhiU be the only thing we will think of.
This advise having been found the surest and the ealicst, there was nothing m^ore
thought of, than of seeking out the meanes to extent; it.  It was not because Ibra¬
him did not upon the first apprehension of it follow this opinion with repugnancy,
but because he was perswaded, that a Prince, who coram iticd sogrcat an infidelity
against him,could not coraplain of him with reason for his going out of his Erapire
vvithout his consent.  In this thought hcconsidcred with the rest, which way they
might draw theraselves out of captivity; in theend the resolution was, that Ibra¬
him, being able to doe what he would, stiould secretly assure himsds of a vessell;
and that untill it was ready to part, he Ihould see Salman as often as poflible hee
could, and take great care to keep him from suspesting that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had spoken to
him ofhis lovc to her.  The rest ofthe day being spent in this sort, the nexe mpr-
ning the Grand Visier having understood that there was a Christian Vcssell which
was to set sail theday ensuing, wrought in such manner as hc absolutely assured
himself of her ; and without any bodies being aware of it, he caused a great raa¬
ny Christian slaves, which were newly delivered, to enter into her.  After hc had
taken this order, he went tofee Soltman again, but it was with so rauch repugnan-
c^ie, as it sdl out well for him that he did not see him ; it being raoft certain, that
•w)hcreas hewas not accustomed to disguise his thoughts, it would have been
impofsible for him not to have testified somewhat of that vvhich he had in his
heart. When hc arrived at the Seraglio, he was told thac the Grand Signior vvas
at the Sultana Queens lodging ; andwhereas it was the onely place in the outward
Seraglio, where <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> entred not, he returned to his Palacc; and there as long
as the day lasted, he received the visits of all the Bassaes, Beglerbei s, and Sangiacs,
that were at Consiantinople.  Inthe mean time .S&lt;7/;&gt;»4« wasnot vvithout unquiet¬
ness, he would willingly have had <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> alwaies with him, to keep him from
being viith Jsabella, and would willingly withall never have seen him, since he
could not do so without being ashamed ofhis fault; and indeed it was out of this
consideration that hewas gone to the Sultanaes lodging, that he might decline
the fight of him.  It was not because his mind was quieter in that place than in
another; for he carryed his torment in his heart.  His love, Jsabellaes constancy,
and J^M^/w/return, pofsesscd him with strange thoughts; and in the diforder
wherein his soul was, hc made wishes against his own glory, and would that Jbra¬
him had been beaten in Persia ; that his Army had been defeated ; and that with a
^vvafull pretext he could banisti him from the Port,and retain Jsabella.lt yvis not
because he knew not rhat his designs were unjust, but it was because his passion
was instead of reason to him, and made him deal inthis sort.  <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> on her
side was not in a little pain; she snw JsabeU.t out oi the Seraglio j and albeit the
Slave, her consident, had assured her, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had not changed his mind for
this Princess, yet shc feared that seeing her no longer,' and seeing Jbrahim, the love
which hc bare to Jsabella would diminish, and that his good will to the Bassa
would reassume new forces. Howbeit shc hoped that Jsabella would acquaint the
Grand Visier with the love diat the Sultan bore her; and that thereupon sie would
do something which might give him opportunity to ruin him. In this belies an
hour after JsabelU was gone oue of the Seraglio shc senc to Will Rusian that he
should carefully observe all Jbrahims astibns by the fame Slave which before dmes
had informed him ofthe Love that he carried to Jsabella.  Rusian obeyed her so
cxastly, that what care socvcr theGrand Visier took to conceal his desissri  vet
did he suspest it.  First hc understood that the Bassa had enquired, whether

^oxelanah^d no sooner received it, but she went her self without further consl.lt-
ing to acquaint <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> with what Rusian had ceaisied ; and whereas this Pnnce,
blinded by his passion,sbught but for a pretext to complain oijhahm, he hearkned
to her with a great deal of impatience, which Ro.xelana having observed, she made
use of the occasion, and told him, how she had a long time known that Jbrahim sa¬
voured the Chnstians; that without doubt he had some hidden design,which could
not be comprehended ; and adding yet more to that which Rusian had wntten, sre
so wrought, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, to bc cleared in the business, rdolved to send to Jbrahms
Palacc for him. And whereas there vvas no body about him whom hc judged tit for
it, <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> having propounded Rusian unto him, who she said was at the gate of
the Seraglio, he consented thereunto ; and having caused him to enter, the Sultan
commanded him to go to Jbrahims Palace, and will him to come presently to him.
For <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> doubted not, is it were true that he had caused a vessell to be made
ready, but that it was iox Jsabella,  or for his friends; and that so, which soever ic
■were, he should have s^according to the mind he was in^a just occasion to ruin Jhra-
him. But Rusian was not like to find him at home ; for as soon as it was night, he
had caused Jsabella, Sophronia, Hipolita, Leonida, Emilia, with the rest oftheir troup
to go secretly out ofhis Palace ; and he hiniself had got out after thera thorough a
door of his Garden, which was towards the Port, to erabarquc himself in that
veslTell which he had made to be prepared, and whereof the Cuptain and the Pilot
■were absoliitely his, by means ofthe raony which he had caused to be given to thcni.
Before his departure he had written a Letter to ^c^/iw^^, and had left it with one
ofhis servants, with order, that is any one came to ask for him from the Grand Sig¬
nior, to deliver it unto him; sothat ^«/?^« arriving at his house, found him not.
It was in vain that he enquired after him , and what care socvcr hc took for it, he
could learn no other, than that hc was not in his Palacc , that JsabelU, his friends,
and her friends, were not there neither; and that he had left a Letter for the Grand
Signior. Rusian having taken it, sent to the Port to learn whether any vessell had
set sail, and then went in all hast to the Sultan,to acquaint him with Jbrahims shght,
and present him with the Letter which he had written to him ; for hc durst not
conceal it, though gladly he would, because ra.iny had seen it delivered tohim.
My Lord,said he when he was come unco him,Jbrahim is no longer at Consiantinople.
This speech amazed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; but when he knew thzt Jsabella vvas out ofhis power
he seha redoubling of love, jealousie, anger, hatred, dispair, and sury. And when
as Rusian had given him Jbrahims Letter, he broke up the seal with violcnce,and not
knowing whether he stiould read or tear it, hc stood a pretty while without speak¬
ing; but at length carded by his curiofity, or rather by his pashon, he opened it
lighing, and found that it was thus.

ted his sury the raore. Let this ingratefull wretch, said hc to Rusian, be pursued ,
and let all that is poflible bc done to return him into my power.  <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> entring
hereupon into Solim.ins chamber, from whence shc had gone a little after Rusians
departure, and perceiving his mind to be in the tcarms wherein &lt;she had long de¬
sired to have it, provoked his anger yet more; and propounded untohim the im¬
ploying of Rusian in the pursuit of Jbrahim : But that which she thought cunning¬
ly to do succeeded not with her ; her intention was so to use the raatter, as Rusian
should nothnd Jlirahim : For whereas her interest was, that be should no longer
have power, nor be longer at the Port, she feared is he should be brought back a-
gain, that she should not oblige ^o/w^« to ruin hini uttetly ; andso hemight re¬
turn into grace again.  Howbeit this design was not executed; for besides that she
could not speak with Rusian in private, the Grand Signiorso absolutdy comman¬
ded him to bring him back <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>und JsabelU, or never to return, as she vvas
constrained to let hini go without saying any thing tohim.  He wenc then in all
hast to take a Galley to pursue him, because hc had understood from him whom
he had sent to the Port, that a Christian vessell had set sayl by the Grand Visiers
order a little before. He imbarqucd himself then with all the speed that pofsibly
he could; and not doubting but that he took the way of the Archipelago, he made
his Pilot hold the same course.  In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> wasnot without un¬
quietness; the privation of a good whichhe ardently desired, made him regard
it as a thing yet more precious; IsabelU appeared to him more amiable than ever
hehad seen her; yea he beleeved thatit may be he might one day have won her
heart; and in this belies hc was insinitely asshsted. He looked upon Jbrahim with
hatred, and this Prince was so unjust, as no longer to remember cither his merit,
his courage, or the friendship he had born him ; nor to consider him inthis oc¬
casion but as his Rivall, and as a man who had stollen a person from him, of whom
he was insinitely amorous.  In this unjust thought he termed him ingratefull, he
called him ravilher, unfaithfull, and persideous; and thinking of nothing but how
to find out means to ruin him, outof a sense of jealoulie hesaid, Were I sure that
I should never touch the heart oi Jsabella, yet I shall alwaies have this advantage,
is they be brought back to me again, thatl can separate them for ever ; and I stiall
at leastwise have this satissaction, that is 7y4^&lt;r//«be not mine, she stiall never be

for, andfearing that the Christian slaves which were in his Galley would n»t

wereTurkforChristians, they rowed with somuch vigor, as in a litde time his
Galley was within Cannon shot of/^r&lt;«^/;wx Vessell. And to keep him from sly¬

in the Castles of Sesiof and Abidus, that enemies vessells were in that place. This
device sailed not to work the expested effect; for <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> knowing that there
were on both sides of this straight sorty pieces of Ordnance planted even wit h the

them expofe themselves rather to the sury of the Cannon, than to fight with Ru¬

still indeavouring to doe their uttermost ; but Jbrahim fearing left some out-ragc
stiouldbedonc toJp^s/Z.'s, cryedto thera to render themselves, which they were
constrained to doe; sbr Jbrahim fighting no longer, and being loaden with chains
by Rttsians comniandment, they had all the enemies upon them ; so that fight how
they could, number prevailed over valour, and Rusian made hitnself Masser of the
Vessell, and of the persons whom he sought for ; and having forced them to pass
into his Galley he returned to Consiantinople.  These infortunate ones had yet the
contblation to make this voyage together without being separated; for Rusian,
busied about stopping theblood which he lost at the wound hc had rcceived,had not
the inhumanity to keep them from talking together.  Jbrahim was likewise as well
as Horatio, Alphonso, <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, and the Srench Marquis, loaden with chains,  which
had been knocked ofs from some of those slaves, who had been the cause of their
taking by rowing with such speed. JsabelU and her friend?, being with thera, and
not able to succour them, augmented their torments yec more with the extreme as¬
shstion that appeared in thera.  Alas! said JsabelU to Jbrahim, is I were sure that:
death would be the greatest misery that can arrive unto me in the place whither wc
are going, I should easily corasort my self; yea and I should regard it as an happi¬
ness rather than a misfortune : but the crueltic of our enemies will not stay there;
for whereas ;o//&gt;w4» knowes that I fear neither torments nor death, he will make
me suffer in your person, and that makes up all my grief  Fearnot for me, said
J^m/j/w unto her, but onely think of preserving your self: ;'^//&gt;»,s» loves you, la¬
bour then to raove his heart rather than to incense it, and be considenc that death
cannot be grievous to me, is I were assured of your life.  No, no, answered Jsa¬
belU, this is not the way I mean to hold, and you would blame me without doubt
is I should follow your counsell : I will die as vvell as you, and is my prayers Cari
obtain any thing of Solitnan, it shall be that we may die together.  Augment not
my torments, replyed the Illustrious Bassa, and speak not ofyour death,is you will
not have me advance mine;live,my dear JsabelU,And let me alone perish.I live,cried
Jsabella?Ah\no,no,JsabelU knows not how to survive her glory,and J«/?/«/4w,which
arc the only things that can raake her life agreeable,&amp; without the which she wil not
preserve it.l niay,added she,rive unhappy,infortunate,laden with chains,exiled from

and vvithout Jusimiana ; so that is <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> will ravish me of my glory, and bereave
me ofthe onely person that I lovc, I Qiall not waver between death and life ; and I
know what coarse I am to take.  Ah ! too generous <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, cryed <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> then -
why have I loved you, to cause you to sall into so many miseries &gt; Why have I not
alwaies been your enemy, to keep you from having such cruell ones? But what say
I, sensless raan, continued hc, I ment the torments which I suffer, is I can repent
me of having loved you : No, Madam, I cannot doe it; I vvould that my death
raight hinderyours, I would that I might indure all things for you, but I cannot
wish that I could not adore you. That wish would be unjuts, replyed she, and would
questionlessdoe great wrong to our affection; which is not the cause ofour mis

for most assured, that//.iM^ will dye a thousand times, rather than doanvrhinl

the malice of our persecutors stiall make you beleeve nothing to my prejudice' Ah '
Madam, ci yed <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, it is for me to demand this favour of you; for whereas I
have not rendred you so many markes of niy affection, as I have received from
your vertue, you may the mere easily doubt ofit.  But beleeve. Madam, that I will
dye adoring you ; and isthe loss ofmy life may oblige <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> to restore you to
your liberty, as I purpose to beseech it ofhim, I shall dye even with pleasiire.  Let
us not separate our destinies, answered the Pnncess; either let us live toaether, or
let us dye together.  After sofad a discourse, the excess of thdr affection forced
them to hold their peace; and their displeasure being shut up in thdr heart, they
seltic more vively than they did, whom as they eased themselves with their com¬
plaints.  The unhappiness ofthe persons which were ingaged in their misfortune
asshsted them the niore;aiid they saw all about them so many occasions ofdispair,as
it niight be said, that never was the vertue ofa person put to so hard a triall.  Hi¬
polita, Sophronia, Emilia, and Leonida, were wholy dissolved into teares; Alphonso
<hi rend="italic">Doria</hi>, Horatio, and the Srench Marquis, were also intinitdy asshsted : and is Rustan
could have been touched with any compashon,  hee had been doubtless with
so lamentable  an objest.  But far from having any  humanity for another,
he was cruell to himself} for though he were wounded, yet the desire which
he had to destroy <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, and to sinish a thing which he had so well begun,
made him in stead of repayring to his house to look to his wound, to goe di¬
restly to the Serraglio assoon as hc arrived  at Constantinople,  and to  behave
himself so as ishe had not been hurt at all. Presently upon his landing, hee sent to
advertise <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> ofhis return, and ofthe sacccss ofhis voyage. And whereas this
Prince had increased his sury with his solitariness, he instantly commanded, that
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> should be brought into the Seraglio , and put into severall pla¬
ces with a sure guard; and that all those which had sollcwved them should bee put
likewise into another place.  Never was so deplorable a thing seen,as theexecution
ofthis commandment; <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would not quit <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, he too would not abandon
her; and though they had well enough foreseen that they should be separated, yet
could they not for all that consent thereunto.  Their srends likewise would not
leave them, and ii <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> could have been a spcstator.ofsb sad a conversation, hee
might peradventure have been moved to piety.  But at length/s^/-/e/i/w znd Ija¬
bella, being constrained to resolve for that which they could not avOyd, took their
farwell of each other, as persons that were never to see one another again ; and sol¬
lowing each other with their eyes as far as they could, they sware unto themsdves
to dye loving one another as faithfully as they had mutually proraised.  After
<hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had conducted <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to one quarter ot the Seraglio, caused IsabelU to bee
carried to another, and theirsnends toa third, he wenc to ;»//wrs», whofc minde
had never been quiet, sincc he knew the success ofhis voyage. For seeing Jbrahm
and 'isabeUa in his hands, hc scarcely knew what resolution to take; for in the c-
stateviherein things were, he must destroy the Bassa, or render him his Mistress.Rc-
^ardine him as thel^oyevoi Jsabella,he desired his death; considering him as asu-

And chen, continued he,is h t could perswade m: to it,that would be yec a further rea¬

Is Iregard himas a Chdstian, I cannot hate him enough; andis I consider him as an
Eueiiiy-Prince,ic behoves he should die,that the end of his life may make an end of sci"
ling my Throne to my succesfors. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> having,as it seemed to him, seded his reso¬
lution sirmly enougli,sdc some rest in his minde.Howbeit suddenly some beam of light
coming to him again, he was astiamed ofhis own thoughts; yet would he not oppose
them, but rather sought how he might fordsie them ; nevertheless there was one thing
that retained his sury for a while: Suppose,said he, that I resolve to destroy Jbrahim;
thathe be already punished forhis ingratitude and persidiousness-, that the end ofhis
life hath ended the lovc which he bears to Jsabella ; let us see afterthis, whether
in thinking to do our self service, wc do not hurt our self: For can she love a Prince,
who bereaves her ofthe person that is dearest to her in the world ? But can she, con¬
tinued he, love any other thai^ <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, as long as he is living? No, no, sayd
he raising  his voyce , it behoves hee should dye ; and  I shall alwayes have
this consolation ,  that is shee love noc mee,  shee shall at leastwise love no¬
thing in the world.  But Ccricd he again, after he had continued a while without
speakingj hc whom I will destroy, is the same Jbrahim who hath done me such impor¬
tant service, and whora I have so rauch loved; howbeit, continued he, it is Jsabellaes
Lover; it is a sugitive slavc;it is a revolted subject; it is a Prince my enemy; or itmay be
an irapoftor.In such like thoughts as these was the Grand Signior,when as <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> came
to him, who ou.t ofhis raalice carried him to further violence against Jbrahim, by for¬
ging matters,vvhich he assimied hc had heard him speak against him. Presently therup-
on <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> entred, who, raaking as isshe did not know, that there was any interest of
love in the hatred which <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> bore to Jbrahim , spake not but of the good ofthe
Scate,and ofthe glory ofthe Erapire. She represented to <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, how mightily hehad
alwaies protested the Christians in all occasions that had been presented; as indeed she
lyed not. But although the most part ofthose things were done by <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>s consent in
the favor oijbr.thim, yet was this Prince so unjust, as to hearken to this accusation, a&amp;
is hehad been acquainted with new crimes.  After then that this wicked Woraan had
made him resolve to put Jbrahim to death, she told him moreover,that is hast were not
made to take away his life,the people undoubtedly would rise to save him;for,said she,
ouc ofthe design w.iich hc hith had to usurp the Empire, he hath alwaies taken great
care to make himself to be beloved oi them. Selimanieeing hiniself upon the poinc of
absolutdy resolving the raatter,sdt a new corabat in his heart; lovc, hatred, jcalousie ,
srieiidship,shame,andglory,did their last and uttcrnic st endeavor to vanquish one ano¬
ther; but at length vertue was surmounted in this occasion by the wickedness of Roxe¬
lana and Rusian : And <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> consented that without further delay he stiould go and
execute this satall scntence, which their hatred,rather than hc, pronounced against the
illustdous J^r^W. Away hcwcnt with agreat deal of speed, for fear left the Sultan
should alter his mind.  Nevertheless not dadng wholly to sail in the usuall form  he
sent iot Jbrahim to conic to supper; and this persidious wretch, who feared a revolt
kept all that were in the Seraglio from going forth. In the mean time Jbrahm bdns set
at table as the rest, Rusian in the midst of the meal presented him with a robe of black
velvet, which was an undoubted mark, that the end of diis satal seast should be the end
ofhis life : For after thismanner is the news ofdeath denounced to persons ofquali
ty, that are to lose their lives in the Seraglio. Jbrahim seeing his ruin cercain, received
this robe for all that with a great deal of constancie.  And whereas dt  was Drcsenrp.s

Fournuites,which were toftranglehim,stood before him,with each of them a black silk
bow-stnng in his hand,which was to serve for that ds?adly ofsice. Now though this ob¬
jest pofsest all those that considered it, with te-rorand pi tic,//^r^W seemed no more
sensible of fear, than Rusian was of compashon. This Illustrious Bassa was seen vvith an
aclmirable tranquillity,and with a constancy without assestation;he indured hii misery
■without raurniuring;hc beheld the tears of others,vvithout shedding any;and isanylign
of sadness appeared in his face,the intcrcstof//^^sr//^ alone was the cause of it;&amp; indeed
this thought made him suffer very much. The regret of being separated from her; the
uncertainty of what shonld become ofher after his death, which was scarcdy irksom
unto him,butfor the grief which <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> would take at it, rcplcnished him with heavy
thoughts. Whilst he was in this estate;whilst he attended the time ofhis execution; and
whilst he was preparing to intreat some of thera that were about him,to say something
to ;'s?//&gt;w4« for the preservation of//rs^s/'^, the Sultan was not without unquietness:;
J?#Ars/&lt;&lt;»4,who had still remained with hini,h;d notonly kept his mind from inclining

sooner had such a like thought, but straightway he vvas of another opinion: He would
have athing,and he would not have it; and in this incertainty his imagination repre¬
sented unto him all J^r&lt;tA/wj whole life.  Hesouch.t not forall that to remember the
friendship which hehad born him,rind the marks vvhich he had given him ofir,but to
hate him the niore.This ingratefull man, said he, could net resolve to comply with a

<p>The Sultana, who was not so scrupulous as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, nor made so exact a profession of

I may not sail in it ; and had I promised my Empire and my Liberty, I should descend from

But he was not long in fearching out that which he did not think to find; My Lord, said he to
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, the Prophet, whom we worship, hath no^doubt inspired me with that which I
am going to tell thy Highness, that thou mayst be able to punish him whom thou wouldsi:
destroy. And when as SeUman had asked him how he thought to perform that which he said,
he obliged him to repeat once more unto him the promisc which h« had made to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>. I re¬
member it but too wdl, answered the Sultan, and lo the very words which I spake. Re¬
member ssaid I unto him) hare I swear unto thee by kLL h., that as long as <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> lives^
tkott siialt not dye a violent death. This susticeth, replyed the Muphti, for, my Lord, to
express my thought to thy Highness; is it not true, that the promise, which thou hast raade
to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, is a thing which cannot secure him but only during thy life ? and is it not cer¬
tain, that thy Succesfors should not be obliged to preserve him i* It being so, my Lord, said
he unto him, it will not be hard for me to content thee. For thy Highness having promised
<hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, that he shall not dye a violent death, as longas <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> lives ^ iss Can make it ap¬
pear to thee, that there are every day some hours, wherein <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> doth not live, it will ap¬
pear to thee by the same reason, that during the said time <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> may dye,without breaking
of thy Highness word.
</p>
<p>The J'w/s^jw hearing him speak thus, beleeved that this man knew not very wdl what he
would say; but the ocher noching daunted, and speaking to him with as much considence,
as ishe had been inspired from Heaven; My Lord, said he unto him, it is a matter whereof
nobody is ignorant, that Sleep is called the brother of Death by all Nations, and in all Lan¬
guages; and truly it is not without caiise thathe is termed so, it being certain, that a man
which is asleep cannot with reason be said to be living, since we see thathe is deprived ofall
ths sunstions of a reasonable lite, which alone is thelife ofman: I consess indeed how in
that estate he still enjoys the life of plants, but not that of man, which consists not but in the
use of Reason, whereof he is wholly berest in that estate. Sleep equals Kings and Shepherds
as well as Death, the stupid and the witty, thehappy and the unhappy, good men and bad ;
and there IS no disserence seen between them, buc chacsl;epis aihoct death, and death an
eternal sl;ep. Wherefore it being evident, that a m^n asleep cannpt sto speak reasonably)
be said to be living, I conclude from thence, that thy Highness, without breaking thy word
may take away <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'^ life when as sleep hach throughly benummed thy sense and Reason!
^».rs/4«4 sailed not to approve of this advice, and maintained thac he had spoken judiciously]
mioxSoltmrn, he yielded notwith so much sacility; he made many objestions to the
Mnphti, whereunto he still answered, with as much cunning as wickedness.

<p>Thas, although this Prince hid a very piercing wit in all other things, yet the desire which
he had to mtke^my <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, perswaded him that the yl/a;)!;^* had Reason; and that he
might put the grand Visier to death when he was asleep. For, this wicked man said to him
thy Highness hath not absolutely promised him, not to put him to death, but only, that he
Jhould not dye a violent death, as long as Soltman lives, and <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> shall not lire,' when as
the Bassa shall dye. This design being conduded, it was resolved, that they stiould tarry till
night was come for the executing of it. For whereas sleep is not a voluntary ast, they thoueht
it requisite to attend till the time of sleep was come.
</p>
<p>In the mean season <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had been broughc back to the place which served him for a
prison, not knowing whether grace would bc shewed him, or whethei bis execution was but
deserred. This incertainty was almost: as displeasing, as the assurance ofan approaching death
had been grievous to him; yet did he not ask any thkig that regarded himsds direstly, but only
enquired after <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, who on her part was not without a wodd of grief, siie had under¬
stood, thn <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had been lead to a place, where oftentimes thegrandSisiers hiibtm
deprived of their lives, and that made her to be as much asshsted, as is slbe had already seen
him breathe out hts last. It may be, said she, that now whil'st I am speaking su/iiniano is
desending himsds against his Executioners; it maybe he is yielding up his last breath, and is
thinking of me once for all. Ah I is it be so, ayed she, I beseech Heaven at leastwise to spare
me the asshdion that I may not hear of his loss, and by my death to keep me from the grief
of limeating his. Howbeit I fear, said she, that my prayers will not be heard, and that So¬
liman's Csuelty will let me live to persecute me: But let him arm his Executioners, let hiin
invent torments, I will complain no more after this sorrow; he that shall acquaint me with
the loss oi <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, shall render me insensible to all others. Alas I what say I ? added she,
it seems in hearing me speak, that I will conserve my life after he shall be deprived of his; no,
no, <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> ^'^notiwiKVii'iustinianox; and that which the rage oi <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> will not do,
gties jdonc shall execute: Let this unjust Prince do what he will, I hope, that I shall get out
ofhis power, by getting out ofmy life; Heaven is interessed in the prayer which I make unto
it; I beg this grace of it to preserve mine innocence j and is my despair be a fault, I hopeic
will pardon it in regard of the greatness of my missortane, of the parity of my assedion, and of
mine own weakness.
</p>
<p>In this deplorable estate, <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> having understood, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had been brought back
to his quarter, hope began again to find some place in het Soul; and she beleeved that.yo-
liman having desired to see him, had peradventure been moved to compashon: Sophronia,
mpalita, Leonida, Emilia, and the rest of their Troop, which were in another place, had
the same hope, hearing what had past: But the matter went otherwise; for as soon as nighc '
was come, Rusian, who wholly governed this deadly ceremony, went himself a second time
to ietch <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> by ±z Grand Signior's Command. He led him then into thesame HaU,
where formerly he had been; and having left him in the company of four mutes, which were
to strangle him, as soon as ^s'//w-iw was asleep, he returned to this Prince, whohadatthat
time no greater a longing then to make away <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>. As for him, although he did not seat
death, and was exceeding peaceable, yet had his Soul g'^e^ag.tanons. Ah saidhe o h.m.

I stiould be happy, and I should think my fortune worthy of envy. But I dye to leave her
in the power ofher enemy; I dye without serving her, and without ddivering her; nay I dye
without bidding her farewell.
</p>
<p>Hereat <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> redoubkd his grief, and his mind seeking for new occasions to torment him,
he was taken wich a remorse ot Conscience for having solong a time worn a Twr^jTZ-habir.
He was perswaded that the misery whereinto he was talkn was a punishment for this disscm-
bling. He thought he had been ill counselled, and though his intention had been pure, and
that he had not done it but out of a design to setve Christendom, to whom it had been very
proficable, and that his faith had never been shaken, yet he beleeved notwithstanding thathe
was faulty. This reslexion made him list up his spirit to Heaven; crave pardon for his levity j
repent him of his misdeeds; and then pray that <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s innocency might not be involved in
the chastisement of his crime.
</p>
<p>The list thing that yet asshded <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was, that in his misfortune he could not find any
that would tell the Sultan that which he had resolved to request of him in the favor oilsa¬
bella, iot Rusian had taken order to the contrary. He had also by the power of Roxelana
kept every body from going ouc ot the Serraglio, ascer/^r^^/Vw was enered inco it; sothat
akhough it was known in Consiantinople, that there was some great diforder between Soli¬
man and <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, yet the people did not susped, that the Sultan could hate him with so
much violence -, for it they had been of that opinion, loving <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> as they did, they would
withouc doubt have set fire on the Serraglio, rather then not have succored him.
</p>
<p>In the mean time Ruslun being returned to SoLman, whose mind was ^ull of nothing but
deadly thought?, this Prince, to satishe that santastick scruple, which obliged him not to be¬
leeve the death of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to be unjust, but becanse he had promised him, that he should not
dye as long as he lived, commanded him to keep at his beds head, and to be sure not to go to
put <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to death, till he was sast asleep. Alter tliis order given, <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> layd him down
with an intention sisone may be permitted to speak so) as it were to summon sleep with si¬
lence and'quietness. He did what he could to divert his raind from all kind of objeds j to
the end that ceasing to think, hc might the more easily let himsds be vanquished by this invi-
sibk Enemy, who-always surmounts those more easily which resist him, then those which
setk him.
</p>
<p>The Sultan, being thus recolleded within himself, remained a while with so much tran¬
quillity in appearance, as RaSlan beleeved that he was asleep, and that he might go and put
Jbrahim to death j But he had scarcely made one step, when as this Prince rising up in his bed.
Stay, siid he unto him, I am noc asleep; and I will not have thee part from hence, till thou
art certain I am so. Rusian, not daring to contradid the GrandSignior, and fearing to
make him more awake then be was, ishe talked longer to him, only promised him not to ofser
any more to go ouc ot his chamber, till he was wtll assured that he could hear nothing. After
this <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> did yet all that he could to sleep j howbeit he had no sooner closed his eyes, but
his unquietness augmented; he was vexed that he could not be mafter o s his thoughts, and
thac chat which he did to provoke sleep, was that which awakened him the more. He turned
him on one side, and then on the other, and yet was not able to find any rest. One might
have said that hc met with chorns every where; that the change of place redoubled his un¬
quietness; and whtn of purpose he forbore from speaking, and complaining aloud, his sighs
gave <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> but too many signs thac he was not asleep. <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'^ impatience growing
stronger, he thought is he walked a white, chat it may be he should become drowzy wittt
weariness: He got ouc ofhis bed chen, and walking somecimes wich violence, and sometimes
with less precipicanon, it might have been said, that he was the cause of as much unquietness
to Rustan, as he s U himsds, to see that he gave him not the means to execute the desires of
the cruel Roxelana. He stood still many timej, and then began again to walk safter then he
had done. Afterwards he leaned down in one place, and then in another, scarcdy knowing
what he did, nor what he would do. When as he had walked a long time, and that through
weariness he had layd himsds down again upon his bed, he found yet less dispofition to sleep
then before; forhis agitation having disljpated some vapors, which peradventure might have
lulled his Reason, and charmed his displeasure, he no sooner had a mind to close his eyes, but
t'.is imagination represented things yet more lively unto him j And whereas a long time before

<p>he had had none but violent pashons, such then too were all his thoughts. How unhappy am
I, saidhe to himsdtl I find an impofsibility in all that I desire; the least things are forbidden
me; evensl-ep, which asl my Subjeds enjoy, is to me a prohibited good; that which I do
to get it, IS that which deprives me ofit; and though I change place, yet still is it all one with
me ; surs ly I must be separated from my sds, is I will find the rest which I seek for. h Le
I am more an enemy to my sds, then <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> is, yea and I am more unhappy then he.
</p>
<p>After his onqaietness had made him change pbce an hundred times, Ruilan, seeing day ap¬
proach, would have persvvaded him not to amuse himsds about this scruple, and to permit
him to go and strangle <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> with his own hands, to punish him,said he,for the unquietness
which he givrs thy Highness: But SoHmart spake unto him with so much sury, as he was con.
strained to hold his peace.  This crud motion oi Rustan's, struck this Prince wich horror, and
whereas ic is a way co compassion, leaning on a table, which was near to his bed, his imagi¬
nation insensibly presented him with other objeds.  He saw <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> all in tears for the death
oi Ibrahm; yea it represented to him thedeplorableestate wherein he was; he remembred
the time when he was his Slave; and that glorious day, wherein loaden with chains hehad
saved hitn his Empire and hishfe: And comparing ic with that wherein he was then, he could
not chuse but be moved at it.  After this, tne fight of <hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> brought to his memory all the
miseries of his house, and all the violences which he had done by his, and Roxe Una's counsel.
The deith of Musiapha, that oi Farraida, oi het son, oi Gianger, the forcible carrying
zw^y oi <hi rend="italic">Axiamira</hi>, her imprisonment, theWitoi Persia, the things vihich <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> hid
performed therein, the denhoi Zele bta, and many other such like things, which silled his
mind with so many deadly ideas, as the love which he bore to <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> began to be too weak
to dissipate them.  He sdt some repugnancy in his heart for that which he did; and his Reason
being suddenly untangled, What do I, said he to himsds, sensless that I am, not to consider,
that the impofsibility which I find to destroy a difarmed man, whom I hold in my bands,
who is loaden with irons, and who is without desence in the midst of his Executioners, is
wichoat doubt a sign that Heaven proteds him. For is it were not so, I had destroyed him
ere this; I had not promised him so long ago that I would not put him to death; I had not
remembred it so precisdy ; this Artifice, which they have found out for me to be revenged,
had succeeded ; I had slept, and <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> had been dead.  But I see plainly, as I have said,
that Heaven guards him, and that it will not let me bc revenged. But ahs! said he still to
himself, sot whit crime, for what in/ury, for what outrage will I be revenged ? No, no,
continued he, i^r^^iw is not guilty, and I alone am the ofsender; for I owe all things to
him, and he owes nothing to me.  It is true, that he would have gone out of my Empire
without my leave, but it was to save his Mistress; and this generous man, who might have
overthrown all my State, to secure himself, and to be revenged of the infidelity which I have
used to him, was contented to sly away like a simple Slave. Let us harken to Reason which
speaks to us; let us barken to the voyce of the Prophet who holds our hand; and let us barken
no longer to this un/'ust love that pofsesscth us.
</p>
<p>Here <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> could not retain his tears, and the love which he bore to IsdelU made him,
that he still found some dissiculty in resolving to be deprived of her: But is«/?rs»'s endevoring
once more to carry him to violence, made him indine wholly to Vertues side. No, no, laid
he unto him, base as thou art, Iwill commit no more crimes by th; ^unsd ; the Prophet,
who guards me, will keep me from dipping my hands inthebloodof/^r^scw; and it lam

Jbrahim be destroyed ? then sudd-^nly checking himsds; but also,said he, can I resolve to lose
JsabelU! After this, he sat him down on four Cushions, and hiding his face with both his
hands, leaning on a table, as it were the better to think of that which he would resolve of,
Rusian reraained in strange pain.
</p>
<p>In the mean time <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> could not comprehend, for what reason they made him attend
solong for his death. He feared kst some vic^ence should be done to IsabelU; he doubted
left they stiould be so cruel as to put her to death before his eyes; and in this pain, death no
doubt would have been a remedy unto him, had not the thought of never seeing IsabeUa again
rendred it raore grievous to him, for that consideration, then for the loss ofhis life. The dis¬
orders ofhis Soul for all that appeared not in his face; and one would hardly have bdeeved in
looking on him, that he did think he should dye every rainutsi. <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, on het part, was
not without trouble; tor having understood, that they came to setch <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, slbe certainly
beleeved that he was lost, and was already preparing to follow him, when as they, who had
order togo for her, entred all into her chamber. As soon as she saw them, and that they had
told her how they had order to carry her before <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>; is it be to put me to death in his
presence, answered she, I will give him thanks: But acquaint me at leastwise, whether /-
trahim be living, and whether we shall dye together or no. These men, not knowing So¬
liman's inrenrions, durst scarce answer her; only they assured her that she should see the
^rattd Sister very suddenly, as indeed they led her into the Hall where he was, attending the
time ot his execution. There were seen about him his Guards weeping, and four Mutes that
were to strangle him, and that having in their hands Bow strings of black silk for that purpose,
seemed also to haue some compassion ofhim.
</p>
<p>This dolesul objed having touch'd the heart of <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, she could not forbear giving a
great skriek: Alass, sakl she, how do I repent me of my wish I and how much more support¬
ablc had it been for me to dye alone, then to dye with you ? <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> leeing and hearkig her
speak thus; What, Madam, said he unto her, will they attempt upon your Ise? Abl no,no,
continued he, turning him to those that invironed him, it is a thii^ I shall never endure:
when they stiall meddle with none but me, I will tender my neck to them without resistance;
but is they attempt any thing on this Princess, I prc^est that I will strangle him with mine
own hands that shall ofser any outrage to her. This is not that which I will have, answered
she; desend not my life, is they attempt upon yours, since they are to be inseparable. I
have not wiOi'd to live, but onely that I may not see you dye. As they would have continued
speaking, they thac came for them told them, that they had nothing else in charge but to car¬
ry them before the C^r^iw^ Signior. Let US go then, said the Princess to him, let us go my
dear <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>; I repent me of my weakness, and since I must dye, provided that I dye in
your presence, I shall be glad that we may dye together: Let us go then and beg for death of
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> as a grace. Ah ! Madam, cryed the illustrious Bajsa, speak not of your death, is
you will not have me dye in despair. Let us go, Madam, let us go rather to beg your liber¬
ty of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and obtain of him that the loss of my life may be the price of it. I will not
have it without you, answered sbe, wherefore persist not in wishing to save me.
</p>
<p>In the mean rime||)ey an-ived it <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s Chamber, whom they sounci still leaning on a
Table, and in a poftuVe, that they could not see his face. As soon as they were there, Ibra-
/i/w and//4^s//«j cast themselves at his feet; My Lord, said thePrincess, is I may obtain the
grace of thee, that I may dye with <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, I will not complain of thy Highness; but
contrarily I will praise thy justice. I am guilty, my Lord, and of an horrible crime against
thee. I have made thee despise the friendship which thou barest to Jushniano; I have made
thee abandon Reason ; I have put a stam on thy life; I have blemished thy glory; I have
troubled thy rest; and I have constrained the greatest Prince of the Earth to oppose all his in-
dinations, which carry him to vertue, for to solbw an unjust passion. Thou plainly seest, my
ford, that wrath ought to have a more just foundation in thy soul, then this Love, which as-
shdsthee, and persecutes me. Change thy passion in my favor, but in such sort, that as I
have been the objed of thy love, so I may be likewise of thy hate. Think of revenging thy
self on the true cause of thy unquietness; think of destroying, and not of gaining me • the
last IS impofsible, and ttie other is very easie for thee. It isnot because, is my tears could
move thee, I can yet assure thee that hate should have a place in my soul: For know, my Lord,

<p>that tNenJushniano, from whom thou wilt takeaway, both his honor, his life and mv
personwhich is as dear to him as both the other,yet cannot hate thee. I have seen it m his eve?
I have known .t by his discourse; he complains of fortune; he accuses that which thv Hieb^
ness calls beauty in me; he names that weakness, which another would name injustice •!«
pne, my Lord, being ready to dye innocently by thy diredions and command, yet am I well

<p>My Lord, said <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> interrupting her, barken not to tbe vertuous IsabelU, but to ad¬
mire the greatness of her courage, and suffernotthy sess to be perswaded to tha: which she
desires of thee. I will not stand to examine whether I am culpable, or whecher I am not
sincc to be hated of thee, is tobe so j but, my lord, I will onely tdl thee, that is the
sentence of my death shaU be pronounced by thy mouth, I will not murmur at it. I
consess my weakness to thee, my Lord; I cannot yet believe, but that all that which
I have seen since my return, is an inchantment, and noc a truth. For bow can it be
imagined, that great <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, who hath loved me so tenderly, and given me so glori¬
ous marks thereof, can be carryed at this present to such unjust designs? That with the
same hand, wherewich he broke my chains, and put the reyns ot his Empire inco mine, he
can puc about my neck the string which is to strangle me. Doth thy Highness no longer re-
member tbe thoughts which thou hadst, at such time as, seeing me ready to enter into the
grave, rather then displease thee with craving my liberty of thee, thou resolvedst to have the
incomparable <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> be brought away by force. Was it then, my Lord, out of a design to
ravish her from me, to persecute her, to blemish thy glory, and to take away my life, in ha¬
ving unjust thoughts sot her ? Think not, my Lord, of, the services I have done thee, but of
those which I purposed to do thee; yet think noc of them, my Lord, for to pardon me, bat
think of them ro i^ve <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>. Restore herto her liberty, make not me ihe cause of het
undoing, send her back into her Country, and after that put me to death here. But grant me
at leastwise the grace to pronounce my sentence unto me; for I conless to thee once more,
that I doubt whether it be pofsible, that thou shouldst be the same <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> which hath so
dearly loved me.
</p>
<p>It is in vain for you to desire, did <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>, that we should be separated; that thought is
unjust, and does wrong to our assedion; ic is a motion whereof I repent me, and whereof
you ought to repent you. Beg then of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, that we may dye, or that we may live toge¬
ther ; for provided he will grant of this, I will attend bis sentence, without grief, and
wishout unquietness. You shall live, said i'o/j&gt;w&lt;i» then to ber, discovcring his face, which
he had all bathed with tears; yon shall live, generous Princess, <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>'s vertue bath sur¬
mounted me. Approach, said he unto him, and is it be so that thou doft not bate me still,
believe for a certain, that the good-wiH which I have born thee is recovering its place in my
Soul: Repentance, which was a motion unknown tome, chases the love of IsabelU hom
it, therein to rcestablish my friendship to <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> ; I sed it coming, my Reason re-assumes
its use; I see my injustice and my violence with consusion; I see tbe vertue of IsabelU, and
no longer see her beauty; she strikes me with admiration, and no longer strikes me wuh
love; Iwishlcould imitate her generofity, and no longer desire the pofsession of her. /«
sine, said he to Jbrahim, know, that of all the maiks of assedion, that which thou reccivcst
from me at this present, is without doubt the greatest ; and to give no bounds to it, and

<p>Book;.   The sUuUrious 'BASSA.  2;j
</p>
<p>Doubt not of that which I say, replyed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, and the better to assure you thereof, I
permit you, said he unto her with a voyce interrupted wich sighs, to go out of my Empire
when you please: I should also be generous enough to share it with <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, to whom it
appertains more justly then to me, is I could insase into the hearts of my subjeds the thoughts
which are in mine.
</p>
<p>During this di'course/?«/is&lt;e» was in a strange unquietnese; and when as he believed that
<hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had bib minde busied, and did not think ot him, he would have shpt out of the
Chamber, to go and advertise <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> of that which was doing: But <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> perceiving it,
Stay, said he unto him, infamous wretch ; and then he commanded him to be turned out oi
the Serraglio, without permitting him to speak to any body; and charged him with a great
deal of sury never to shew himsds more before him. After this, he sent for the vertuous
Achmat, vnd ths Sultana Afteria. It isby these two persons,'said he to Jbrahim, thatl
will be counselled, to know what way we may take, that Jushniano may cease to be Ibra¬
him, without making a noise amongst thepeople, which mighc prejudice my State: For as
for my self, continued he sighing, it isso little a while since my Reason hath recovered its
place, as I dare not yet rely upon ic. <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, whom we will call most commonly hereas¬
ter <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>, answered the Grand Signior with as much generofity as joy; for wheras he
had exceedingly loved this Prince, how great soever that was which he sdr, to see <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>
escaped from so great a danger, yet was he not a little glad also to see in <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> the marks
of his ancient vertue again.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, after thst the Sultan had acquainted the sage Achmat, and the generous
Alleria with the business in question, in such terms, as well declared the repentance of his
soul; and after they had commended the resolution he was in, and mightily consirmed him in
the design which he had to restore Jttshniano and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> to their liberty ; Achmat, who ne¬
ver knew of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>'s disguising till then, counselled^ since the matter was so far advanced,
that the people should be made to believe, how the Grand Signior had put <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to death,
upon some discovcry that he had held intelligence with the Emperor Charts, and favored
the Christians in all things; yea and that some leccers too should be forged, which should be
said he had been made to consess, by which means the matter would easily be credited, be¬
cause it was true that every one knew, how the illustrious 'Bassa had always proteded ihe
Christians. He said moreover, that is the business was not carryed in that lore, it would be
impofsible to finde out a plausible pretext to keep the people from suspeding some trick in the
:^{enceoi <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, which might produce dangerous consequences.
</p>
<p>This advice being approved of, yet because <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> could not be sent a-
way towards <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> presently, it was thought requisite to have them secretly conveyed to
Pera, and there to remain concealed with those Greel^ Pnests, whom Jushniano had so much
favored, until such time as a vessel could be made ready for them. This farewell could not
be taken without shedding ofa world of tears; Solimatt craved pardon oi <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and Isa¬
bella, who after they had answered him with tenderness and submission, and assured him that
they would forget what was past, desired him he would be pleased to give their friends theic
liberty, which the Sultan having granted them, they were sent for and conduded along with
them to Tera. The Sultana Asieria and Isabtlla said to one another all that a most slrid
friendstiip could make two generous persons say in such like encounters. And the ptudentyscA-
)w&lt;«/,charging himself with the condud oi <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and his Misiress, conveyed them with all
dieir Troop aboard a Barque, whrch arryed them to Pera. Soltman could not for all that lee
<hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> part, without soHowing her with his eyes, nor could he see Jbrahim go away with¬
out forgetting//&lt;«^s//&lt;i; it being most certain, that never was there a truer repentance, then
that of this great Prince.
</p>
<p>In the mean time to make it be beleeved that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was dead, a black Standart was set up
before the gate ofhis Palace: Achmat, fearing a sedition, put all the ^&lt;j»&lt;i«ri« into arms,
and gare them to understand, that <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was a Traytor, that he bad gone about to over¬
throw the Empire, and that his death had been absolutdy necessary for the preservation of the
StA\e. He shewed them also certain forged Letters, to give the mote credit to that which he
said But whatsoever he could say, no sooner was the black Standart seen before the gate of
bis Pilace, but all the people began to murmur; There was nothing but weeping and crying

</p>
<p>Those Janizaries that had been the best perswaded, left not for all that tobe exceedingly
asshded; for he was so universally beloved, as there was not any body which did not lament
and commend him. Some said, that <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> wichout doubt was the cause of this mischief
and that she still remembred, how he had been the Protedor of Prince Mustapha. Somt
cryed out to have at leastwise the body of their Desender given unto them; others, that his
Executioners might be delivered into their hinds; and all of them together agreed in thebe^
lies, that <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> had lost the force of his Empire, and tbe support ot his State.
</p>
<p>During this tumult, /?»/?&lt;!» passing through a street, thepeople, who bad understood bv
some thathad been in the Serraglio, how it was be which bad been made use of for this
deadly Ceremony, and that he had put <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> to death, sell upon him with so many impre¬
cations, and with soch sury^ as they tore him in a thousand pieces. Sroni thence they went
to his Palace, to set it on sire; but at length the prudent Achmat, having appeased this sedi.
tion, tetatnedto ihe Serraglio, where hefound that Heaven had made an tnd of revenging
Jusiiniano on his enemies. For <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> having understood that he was not dead, and that
<hi rend="italic">Rustan</hi> had been torn in pieces by the people, this sierce and proud spirit, was so sensibly
touched with sp'ght for that she could not exercise all her whole sury, that after she bad con.
tinued three hours together without speaking aword, she dyed for very rage and tnadness;
and <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had the satissadion to know, that he was lamented of all the world, and th«
the only persons which could rej&gt;yce ac his death had been punished for their in-
just.'ccs.               -.y,
</p>
<p>In the mean t\mt Achmat hy <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>'s Commmdczuied the same Christian Vessel tobe
made rr;dy,which <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> had formerly used to get from Constantinople; and in one night
l^esent aboard her all the riches of/^r&lt;»scj»»'s Palace, and agreat dea\moj:e, which hewa
constrained to accept of against his inclination. The Sultan Wrote also with his own hand
to tbe illustrious Bassa, and again assured him of his repentance and assedion, whereunto Ju-
stiniano and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> answered with a great deal of generofity. The dtzihoi <hi rend="italic">Roxelana</hi> touch,
ed <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi> less, then it would have done at any other time. For as he could not but remera¬
ber that she had been rhe objed of his assedion; so could he not but much more remember,
that she hsd been the cause of all bis misfortunes, and ofall his crimes, and that she would have
carried him to put to death the only man of the world whom most he loved.
</p>
<p>This sdgned death of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi> was carried with so much address by the prudent Achmat,
that every body bdeeved it tobe so; and that is it which hath made Taulm Joviw, and alt
those which have spoken of the raign of <hi rend="italic">Soliman</hi>, to lay, that the grand Sister ^etxiiiedh
that sort; but indeed the matter past as I have delivered it: For a Greek^Caloyer, who had
this Hillory from <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi>'s and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi>'s own mouth, left a relation thereof,which is come
even unto us.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, three days after the seigned death of <hi rend="italic">Ibrahim</hi>, the true Jushniano, Jsa¬
belU, Sophronia , Hipolita , Emilia, Leonida , Horatio, Alphonso , <hi rend="italic">Doria</hi> , the Srench
Marquess, and a number of Christian Slaves, whose hhexty Justtniano had obtained, im-
barqued themsdves one night, and set izxMot <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi>, without fear of other enemies, then
the winds and the Seas; but Fortune had made too much tryal of their vertue, for to insld
new disafters on them; and indeed she was so favorable unto them, that never was there a
more profperous Navigation heard of.            ti  r l

<p>Daring this Voyage, these illustrious persons had no other entertainment, then to talk ot ttie
dangers which theyhad avoyded. And whereas <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> had promised that
they would be inseparable In their sdicity as they had been in their unhappiness; that Boratit
and Hipolita had done the like; that Sophronia and DorU had sworn never to quit one ano-

<p>secret, which I have never told to any body; know, that the true cause of my inconstancy
hath been the fear of marriage: I have always been so afraid of engaging my sds therein, as to
avoyd the occasions ofit, I have used to change Mistress often. But is I can obtain of Emilia,
that she will not oblige me to be her husband, I will be eternally her Slave. All tbe company
then burst oat a laaghing, and beleeving thac their discourse was nothing but sport, every
one tell to pressing of £k«7/^, that she would make him become constant, in not marrying
him. Whereupon the Mirqacss and shc made a Satyre against marriage, wherein on either
part they said very pleasant things. And for a conclusion, that which was beleeved to be but
jelling, proved to be their true thoughts; and they took as much care to promise one ano-
ilier that they would never marry,as the others took to obtain oftheir Mistresses, that as soon
as they should come to genoua, they would render their fortunes inseparable, as indeed
they did. The wind having been extreamly favorable to them, they arrived'in a few days at
<hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>; where the Princess was received of her Subjeds with as much astonishment as joy.
The brute of their return being presently got to Gs«e«^, the chief of the Senate came thither
to vilit them.
</p>
<p>Ttiesc illustrious persons concealed so much of their adventures, as they thought was not
sit to be spoken of; and having been intreated by their friends, that they would after so ma¬
ny misfortunes celebrate the cereraony of thdr nuptials at <hi rend="italic">Genoua</hi> • <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> yielded thereunto
with blulhing: for which essed they parted away tbe next day, and shortly after the lAsx-
ia^tsoi <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> ind I/^bella, oi Haratto and Hipolita, oi Daria ind Sophronia, and of
Alphonso and Leoni&amp;i, v/ere solemnized with all pofsible magnificences.  The Srench Mar¬
quiss and Emilia promtsed anew an inviolable friendship to one another, with an oath that
neither of them would ever marry: and during certain days there were nothing but Balls,
unning at the Ring, and publique Seasts.  After which <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> and IsabelU bling re-
;ntred into the pofsession of all that belonged unto them, they were conduded with a great
leal of state to <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi>-, where the|||jircd with as much satissadion, as they had had mis-
haps; y»^»«w«o esteeming himself raSrc happy inthe pofsession oi IsabeHa, then is hehad
reconquered the Empire of his Fathers. But by a revolution which commonly arrives in all
things, it is come to pass, that the Principality of <hi rend="italic">Monaco</hi> is retiujned into a branch of the
House of the Grimaldies, which pofsesseth It at this day, under the protedion of
Spain; nothing remaining of <hi rend="italic">Justiniano</hi> but the memory of his glorious
adions; which certainly are great and famous enough, to oblige
Pofterity never to lose the remembrance of
