	<l>There's a Land to us far dearer,</l>
	<l>Than all others o'er which we may roam,</l>
	<l>And its radient skies are clearer,</l>
	<l>'Tis the bright Sunny South, our home.</l>
	<l> Then aloud let us sing to her glory,</l>
	<l>And exalt it in music and song,</l>
	<l>Let her virtues be embalmed in story,</l>
	<l>As our voices the echo prolong.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Oh, Georgia! The Star of the nation,</l>
	<l>Let rejoicing break forth on the air,</l>
	<l>Tho' misfortune hath spread desolation,</l>
	<l>Our hearts were brave enough to bear,</l>
	<l>'Till the clouds have retreated before us,</l>
	<l>And a Colquitt and a Candler o'er us</l>
	<l>Three cheers for the State that we love!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Yes, the new Star of Liberty is dawning,</l>
	<l>And gladness will once more illume,</l>
	<l>The Night that has darkened out Morning,</l>
	<l>And o'er cast it with woe, and with gloom.</l>
	<l>Peace and plenty may smile now upon us,</l>
	<l>With a President to shield us from the storm,</l>
	<l>North and South, East and West forever,</l>
	<l>Three cheers for Tilden and Reforn.</l>
