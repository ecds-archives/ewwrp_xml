FOR THE TWENTYSEVENTH BIRTHDAY

Of the Willie Hunt Smith Chapter of Daughters of the Confederacy, 
Organized by Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers as the Barnesville Chapter,
On the 27th of March 1896

One day as glorious Spring time came
to scatter Winter’s gloom away,
A faithful circle pledged their name
To honor due them shall be paid,
Their wondrous fame shall never die!

The ship was launched.  The valiant crew
Moved onward toward the shining goal,
And day by day its numbers grew,
Till three score glorified the roll!
Then Georgia’s great and gifted men,
As April brought Memorial Day,
Renewed each patriot soul again
With memories of the Gallant Gray.”

Instructors, preachers, merchants all,
And brave cadet with pride unite
In heeding thus the bugle call,
To honor chivalry and right,
And there with loyal hand each year,
I placed the rose and violent,
Till sorrows came with parting tear
And broken home!  Can I forget?

And then the “Old Guard” bade adieu,
As gentle faithful Mrs. Neal
Assumed the duties ever true 
With love and hope and earnest zeal.
Alas!  She has gone! but far above
Her spirit still is hovering o’er 
United there in Heavenly love
With our faithful members gone before.

Amid the shadows came a gleam 
Of radiant light!  That ship most brave
Each cloud of fate, each flickering beam,
And should ne’er be gulphed in stormy wave,
So one was chosen then to steer,
Whose love and beauty in her youth
Brought in their train sweet smiles of cheer,
And from her life the gems of Truth.

Willie Hunt Smith!  Bring flowers bright,
To wreath upon sunlit prow,
While o’er the wave a holy light

2

Illumes with love each patriots brow.
The kindly word, the smile that cheered
Can never from our soul depart
And features fair by love endeared
Will ever live within the heart!

Full twenty-seven years have passed,
Our monuments have sprung to view,
And yet the fields ahead are vast,
With much we hope in time to do.
With Mrs. Peacock, faithful guide
And pilot o’er the summer sea,
With Loyal heart we will abide
Forever true to U. D. C.
