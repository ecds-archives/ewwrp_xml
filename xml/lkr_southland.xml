      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Tis Morn, radient Morn!  Upon each hill</l>
	<l>There gleams a tint of gold, and in the vale afar</l>
	<l>Is heard the merry call of one who keeps</l>
	<l>Each wandering lamb from straying o'er the bar.</l>
	<l>The ploughman sings a cheer to new born day</l>
	<l>And maids light-hearted roam o'er snowy field</l>
	<l>Or who at eve should bring the finest yield?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Peace, lovely Peace, rests upon the Plantation Home!</l>
	<l>From teeming orchard to the garden gate,</l>
	<l>The sun-lit heights of Georgia's old red hills</l>
	<l>Bespeak the calm that dwells upon each State.</l>
	<l>King Cotton proudly smiles upon his royal seat,</l>
	<l>As autumn fruits their countless joys displayed;</l>
	<l>And golden grain breathes life and health complete,</l>
	<l>For Heaven's touch on every scene is laid!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>The Light of Holy Love beams o'er the peaceful hearth, for</l>
	<l>There was no Bandit then!  No evil soul to roam,</l>
	<l>The Master, Mistress, and loved old Mammy knelt,</l>
	<l>To thank the Heavenly Father for their blessed Christian Home,</l>
	<l>Our own dear land!  Our hallowed Southern Home!</l>
	<l>Was there ever on Earth a land surpassing thee?</l>
	<l>Where friends dependant (not slaves) who with their lates breath</l>
	<l>Despite all war, could true and faithful be?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>And was there ever a Christmas Time so glad?</l>
	<l>With Banjo, Violin, Dance and Joy that filled </l>
	<l>The heart with happiness pure and unrestrained </l>
	<l>In knowing those whose wealth they help to build?</l>
	<l>But list!  Far down yon vale the thundering guns of war</l>
	<l>Break up the placid flow of Atlantic wave,</l>
	<l>And wildly rush o'er loving peaceful homes</l>
	<l>TO cast their blooming roses in the grave! </l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Tis Night!  Cheerless Night!  No star illumes the way.</l>
	<l>Our statesmen wise on terms of peace were sent</l>
	<l>But not received.  Far different views prevailed -</l>
	<l>Against all Sovereign Rights coercion was intent!</l>
	<l>Then the Spirit of 1776 reawakened o'er the hills</l>
	<l>And steel alike met steel with American valor anew,</l>
	<l>Till "The Stars and Bars" at Manassas brought forth a hopeful light,</l>
	<l>And proved to all, the bravery of King's Mountain still is
	true!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Through strife was long avoided, yet our homes in ashes laid</l>
	<l>Brought in the mystic ruins words emblazed upon the air</l>
	<l>Soul cheering to the spirit with a light that cannot fade,</l>
	<l>This slogan of the Daughters - Live, Love, Think, Pray, Dare!</l>
	<l>The the Holy Spirit guided, and compensation came</l>
	<l>When Davis, Lee, and Stonewall add Righteousness to Fame,</l>
	<l>And with Heaven's light inspired still onward marched the Gray</l>
	<l>Though their number lessened daily mid the war clouds on the
	way.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Twas the Faith of our Fathers, which gave courage to the true,</l>
	<l>And it led by Holy Spirit all of our Southern Soldiers through</l>
	<l>Not a hero of the Southland under General Lee's command</l>
	<l>Would rob one of their property, or flash the fire brand!</l>
	<l>Then Hail, all Hail, with loving cheer, the memory tonight</l>
	<l>Of all who served their country in Justice and in Right,</l>
	<l>And may Daughters of Confederacy the gates of love unbar</l>
	<l>And lead the Blue and Gray as friends to Heaven's Crowning
	Star!</l>
