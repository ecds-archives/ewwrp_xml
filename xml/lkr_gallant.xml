No cause that is just and guarded
with trust
Can ever be lost to a patriot soul,
Nor the rights of a state be 
trampled in dust
When honorable valor leads on to 
the goal.
Then bravely look upward with conscience unstained
By reckless disorder, or vice unre-
strained,
For you won that glory with never
shall fade
It's pure as thy banner, thy musket
and blade.

Four wars have displayed of what 
metal they're made,
Old Guilford, Monterey and Manas
sas proclaim,
Then Spain with her heraldry, her
pomp and her power
Eclipsed as Hobson won honor
and fame.
This God-given spirit came down to 
the son
When Germans retreated and Vic-
tory won;
Then cheer upon cheer for our Vet-
erans in Gray
Who honor both flags of America 
today!

All hail to Atlanta! Queen city of 
light!
Whose ministering love gives wel-
come  and rest
To all who battle for justice and 
right,
From the north and the south, the 
east and west.
Encamped on her soil, by thousands
they came
And Gordon won chaplets and crosses
of fame,
Who are welcomed today with peans 
so gay,
And deem it an honor to march with 
the Gray!
