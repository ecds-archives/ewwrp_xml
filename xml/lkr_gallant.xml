      Old Boys in Gray</head>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>They are marching today in their armor of gray,</l>
	<l rend="indent">Where proudly in youth they so gallenly trod,</l>
	<l>E're Sherman invaded in battle array</l>
	<l rend="indent">And swore each "Rebel should sleep in the sod."</l>
	<l>But the strife and such boasting are all cast aside,</l>
	<l>As they glance on their banner with joy and with pride</l>
	<l>Still beaming with Justice and Mercy and Right,</l>
	<l>For it waved o'er Lee in heaven's own light!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>No cause that is just and guarded with trust</l>
	<l rend="indent">Can ever be lost to a patriot soul,</l>
	<l>Nor the rights of a state be  trampled in dust</l>
	<l rend="indent">When honorable valor leads on to the goal.</l>
	<l>Then bravely look upward with conscience unstained</l>
	<l>By reckless disorder, or vice unrestrained,</l>
	<l>For you won that glory with never shall fade</l>
	<l>It's pure as thy banner, thy musket and blade.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Four wars have displayed of what  metal they're made,</l>
	<l rend="indent">Old Guilford, Monterey and Manassas proclaim,</l>
	<l>Then Spain with her heraldry, her pomp and her power</l>
	<l rend="indent">Eclipsed as Hobson won honor and fame.</l>
	<l>This God-given spirit came down to the son</l>
	<l>When Germans retreated and Victory won;</l>
	<l>Then cheer upon cheer for our Veterans in Gray</l>
	<l>Who honor both flags of America today!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>All hail to Atlanta! Queen city of light!</l>
	<l rend="indent">Whose ministering love gives welcome and rest</l>
	<l>To all who battle for justice and right,</l>
	<l rend="indent">From the north and the south, the east and west.</l>
	<l>Encamped on her soil, by thousands they came</l>
	<l>And Gordon won chaplets and crosses of fame,</l>
	<l>Who are welcomed today with peans so gay,</l>
	<l>And deem it an honor to march with the Gray!</l>
