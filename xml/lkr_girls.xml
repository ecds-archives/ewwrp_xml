Useful Little Girls. (1)

Minnie Tyler
A little girl I am indeed
And little do I know.
Much help and care I yet shall need
That I may ??? great
If I would ever hope to do
Things great and good and useful too.

Lucile Grshrism
Yes even now I ought to try
To do what good I may
God never meant that such as I
Should only live to play
And talk and laugh, and eat and drink
And sleep and never think

Grace Woodward
I may if I have but a mind
Do good in many ways
Plenty to do the young may find
In these our busy days.
Sad would it be though very small
If I was of no use at all.

Bobbie ????
One gentle word that I may speak
Or one kind loving deeed
May through a trifle poor and weak
Prove lifes a tiny seed;
And who can tell what good may spring
From such a very little thing?

All together taking each other’s hands,
“And a little child shall lead them”!
