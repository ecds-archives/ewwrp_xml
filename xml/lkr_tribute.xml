      <byline>By The Poet Laureate Mrs Loula Kendall Rogers.</byline>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>When all the world is beaming bright oftimes there comes a cloud,</l>
	<l>And Nature droops in sympathy as the giant Oak is bowed,</l>
	<l>When a favorite flower gently pleads as if in search of aid,</l> 
	<l>O tell me is there a land where Roses never fade?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>There is a land, a radiant Land, of one Eternal Day,</l>
	<l>No night is there, no storm of War to dim its golden ray,</l>
	<l>The thunder's roar, the battle shout, terrific war whoops cease,</l>
	<l>And all the universe repeats a song of Love and Peace.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Our Georgia Rose transfigured, finds congenial friends anew,</l>
	<l>Her snow white purity acclaimed by all the great and true,</l>
	<l>The King of Kings has placed a Crown upon her brow so fair</l>
	<l>Then sorrow not -  but Oh, rejoice!  For her reward is there!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Her service here was knowledge - transforming youthful mind</l>
	<l>Uplifting Lucy Cobb with her learning most divine,</l>
	<l>Then when the day was over and stars illume the night,</l>
	<l>She was planning still for Georgia, and new ways to make it bright.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Oh, who in all the world but she had ever penned a thought,</l>
	<l>On great Historic Records which her native State had wrought?</l>
	<l>Of the First Atlantic Steamer that ever sailed beneath the sun,</l>
	<l>Was surely manned in Georgia!  And Georgia surely won!</l>
      </lg>
      <pb n="2" entity="lkr_tribute002" pages="2"/>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>She then upheld the veiling where all the Southland leads</l>
	<l>In Cotton Gins, and Missions where the Orphan sadly pleads,</l>
	<l>And where the South was <hi rend="underline">first</hi> to grace the Presidential Chair,</l>
	<l>For Washington our leader, was a well known Hero there.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Her Truths of History are well known and prove without a doubt,</l>
	<l>If blame was laid upon the South, she always brought it out,</l>
	<l>For Sovereignty, the Rights of State, her heart was ever true</l>
	<l>Her path was always blessed with Truth and Honor's unfailing glue.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Then let us follow the gleam she leaves, high up on land and sea,</l>
	<l>The Faith and Honor of noble aims for our glorious U.D.C.</l>
	<l>And when the day beams fade away, amy angles waft above</l>
	<l>The songs with which we greet her soul in Everlasting Love!</l>
