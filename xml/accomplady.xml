<p>TO be enflamed with the Love of Sacred things is undoubtedly a Foundation for early Virtue to build on, and is frequently an Introduction to whatever we can justly and truly term Good or Great:* Therefore as you first owe your Duty to God who made you, and on whom depends your Being and Well being, not only here, but hereafter you must above all things, consider his Glory, and endeavour as much as in you lies, to render him tribute of Praise and Thanksgiving, imploring the Assistance of his Divine Grace, to instruct and enable you to supply your Defects, and increase your knowledge, and in so <hi rend="italic">*Remembring your Creator in the days of your Youth</hi>, That God, who loves the early Sacrifice of the Heart, will not be wanting to over-shadow you with the Wings of his Providence, and keep you from falling into those Snares Satan lays to *intrap you.</p>

*CHAP. II.
<hi rend="italic">Instructions for Young Gentlewomen in Behaving themselves dutifully towards their Parent.</hi>
<p>AS our Parents are those from whom, next God, we have our Being, and by whose tender Care and inseparable Love we are nourished and preserved from innumerable Dangers and Hazards; therefore observe,</p>
<p>In the first place, your Reverence, Love, and Obedience, is strictly required, not only by the Tyes of Nature, but by God's Holy Word, as sundry places in Scripture manifest; nor can their Infirmities in any wise absolve you, or dispense with your non-performance; but in such a case you ought to double your observance, that thereby, as much as in you lies, you may hide their Weakness and Defects from the Eyes of others.</p>
<p>You must observe at all times to obey the Will of your Parents (if it be in your power, and not contrary to God's Command) without repining, or *entring into dispute, performing what you do with cheerfulness, shewing by your willing mind your ready Obedience, and by your quick dispatch, demonstrating the Pleasure you rake in the performance, shunning all occasions of giving them any disquiet, pacifying their Anger, if it at any time arise, with submission either in Words or by Behaviour, tempering your Anions with a moderate sweetness of Disposition and Silence, for too much Ostentation or Loquacity is displeafing: When your Parents *greve be you sad; when they rejoice, be you pleasant, as sympathizing with them in Heaviness and Joy; yet
*be

be not over inquisitive into the cause; but if you are desirous to know it, wait their leisure to reveal it, or learn it from some other Hand.</p>
<p>Forget not to pray for your Parents as often as you put your Vows to Heaven, beseeching the Almighty to shower his Blessings upon them; which is one great advance by which a Child endeavours to make his Parents restitution for their Care and Tenderness; for nothing without calling God to your assistance can in that nature be effectual; the diffarence being otherwise so vast between what has been done for you, and what you can do to deserve it.</p>
<p>Let not the hopes of Riches, no, nor the seveity of your Parents, imprint in your mind a desire of their Death, let the Almighty be offended, and shorten your Days.</p>
<p>Shun those that speak ill of your Parents and would make them seem contemptible in your Eyes: Nor let their Poverty, should you be advanced by any means to Riches or Honour, render your Duty and Obedience less, for they cannot be but the same in all condition: If they be poor, you ought to relieve them; if they are weak of Understanding, you. must assist them with your Counsel: If they be injured or oppresed, endeavour to succour and redress them; for no Years can exempt you from observing your Duty to your Parents; nor ought you to dispose of your self in Marriage, nor otherwise, without their allowance and content, your Person being indispensibly theirs in a lawful way to dispose of. And so it was under the Law of Moses in relation to a Virgin's Vow; the which, though the had made, yet if her Father approved it not, it was void; as in Numb. chap. 3o. vet S.

her, becaufi her Father difalloreed her. By this we fee the great 'Power that Parents had over their Children, even to a degree of cancelling, and rendring of none effea the obligation of a Vow, which Power was given by God himfelf.
Certain it is, that no poverty, fault, or unkindnefs of Parents, can difpenfe with that Duty and Obedience, which, by the Law of God and Nature, Children owe their Parents, for the tender care, labour, and colt, bellowed on them : Nay, though Parents Ihould prove unnatural, and expofe them, even in. their Infancy, to a defperate Fortune of Hazard and Danger ; yet hill thole Children are bound to per.. form their Doty, and look for their Reward from Um who is the Author of all Blefi'ings.

And as Sociicry is that which all Creatures naturally covet; fo, if it be well chofen and managed, it is recreatory to the Body,and Mind but as bad Society is worfe than 'none, fo is it to be avoided.
Wherefore be not calmly won to enter into Difcourfe with thole you know not, unlefs urgent Burt-' nets require it, left you be fufpeaed of Levity and •. Indifcretion. Always obferve to confort your fell with your Betters, or Equals, knowing them to be virtuous; and avoid too much familiarity with Inferiours, unlefs you find them very difcreer, left you fall into contempt, if Female : or if Male, left you give them encouragement to make their Addreffes of Courtfhip, and by fubtil ways to infinuate themfelves into your good liking ; for Love, that takes the,Diadem from Queens, is blind : and Paflion diflinguilhes not Servility from Greatnefs; by which means, though you are high in Birth and Fortune, you may be brought to a yielding, which may turn to the grief of your Parents, or perhaps to their and your own Difgrace. And in this cafe prefume not too much upon your own Strength, by interchanging Gloves, Rings, Ribbons, or fuch things, which you may term Trifles, left by this kind of familiarity, Love by infallible ways opens .a Paflago to your I kart.

I am perfuaded that the Quality of the Perfon extenuates the Quality thereof, and renders that opi-. r,ion vain and frivolous.
I mull confefs, there is a kind of Privilege in youth to go \ay ; which, fhould I too feverely reprove t might justly merit your difpleafure ; yet that Gaity may as well be in Decency as otherwife, the ufe of Apparel being to dignifie the Wearer : Nor does a vertuous Demeanour more lively appear than in Look, Speech,. Gefture and Habit, within the compafs of Modefty, though Diamonds, Gold, and other precious things, were made for ufe ; and without .being.. imployed, would be ineffc&ual : Therefore to wear them in my Opinion, is one of the chiefeft Ends for which Nature produced thena, or Art brought i hem
to a fuller perfeEtion. The Pride in this cafe being } only centered in the Mind, and not in the External Ornaments ; which is rather known by the Carriage and Deportment of the Wearer, than by the Gar. 1 ments. And' though to diva Novelty, and run into every Faihion, be not commendable, yet Moderation is not emirs ; for two Reafous : As first, tbould you always keep in a Faihion, though decent, it would be looked upon as a conceited angularity ; or to continue in any ftrange Garb, after the Fashion is altered, would appear ridiculous, and caufe Laughter, efpecially among11 the ruder fort ; as much as a Wo. man of Fourfcore to be habited in the Garb of a Gentlewoman of Sixteen ; or to fee a Dairy Maid in her Ladies attire : Therefore whatever you wear, let it he proportionable to your Body, and fuitablc to your degree.
