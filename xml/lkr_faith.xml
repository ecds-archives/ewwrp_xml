	<l>Aurora gleamed in beauty o'er the hills</l>
	<l>And cast a ray of golden charm that thrills</l>
	<l>A soldier brave, who wandered neath the dome</l>
	<l>Of Mountain's sheltering arm and sun-lit home;</l>
	<l>Admiringly he gazed upon the view,</l>
	<l>Andkneeling there where woodland flowers grew'</l>
	<l>He plead for Heavenly guidance on his way,</l>
	<l>For he must meet impending battle on that day!</l>

      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>'Twas thus at Valley Forge that Washington</l>
	<l>Invoked the mighty "King of Kings," and won!</l>
	<l>For never a Warrior in other lands had brought</l>
	<l>So great a victory as he in Faith has wrought!</l>
	<l>Our vast Republic that extends from sea to sea,</l>
	<l>Whose banners wave in triumph o'er the Free;</l>
	<l>For Heaven has cast great blessings on our land</l>
	<l>Of Peace and Plenty by Divine command.</l>

	<l>Years pass - Then o'er the plains of Mexico</l>
	<l>Near by the gates of Alamo,</l>
	<l>The thundering sound of guns proclaim</l>
	<l>That General Lane has won the fame</l>
	<l>Of "<hi rend="underline">Marion</hi>," in his War time creed,</l>
	<l>And Zachary Taylor proved a help in need</l>
	<l>While Jefferson Davis in that Mexican War,</l>
	<l>Was at Buena Vista a reigning Star!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>A proof that undying Faith was there</l>
	<l>And our bravest heroes lead by prayer</l>
	<l>Not one private home they efface</l>
	<l>Nor cruelly burn a record's place</l>
	<l>This Law kept General Lee for all the years</l>
	<l>For <add place="supralinear">oft</add> he spared in Mercy a widow's tears,</l>
	<l>And to all nations his Orders were known,</l>
	<l>For his memory in reverence by the world is shown.</l>

      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Who can forget <add place="supralinear">the</add>brave Stonewall Jackson</l>
	<l>Whose Living Faith illumed each action?</l>

	<l>Years later <del rend="overstrike">on</del> the same true faith abides</l>
	<l>As Pershing, the world-honored leader guides,</l>

      <lg type="stanza">
	<l>Then Hail!  All Hail!  With thankful voice acclaim</l>
