               <p>The Epistle to the Reader</p>
               <p>FRIEND,<lb/>
Being that the day of the Lord is come, and he arisen 
in his Eternal Light, and is arising in the Consci 
ences of Men, the place where his Throne and 
Scepter must Rule the Nations; and being that 
he is King, and Lord and Lawgiver to those 
who are under his Governments, and is the Supreme 
Head and Judge in the consciences: Now this being arisen and ma 
nifested in this day of the Lord's Power, in the which he will make all 
his People willing and Subject to him; and being that this hath been 
long obscured and covered with the thick vail of darknesse and Cloud 
of Apostacy that hath been over the face of the Earth, and indeed o- 
ver the hearts of men, and the onely cause and reason of this, hath 
been the Cup of Abomination and Fornication the Nations have drunk 
in the worship of the Beast, upon which the Whore sits, which John 
saw (when he stood upon the Sand of the Sea) rise up out of the Sea, 
which all the world wondered after; insomuch, that Mystery Ba- 
bylon the Great made all nations drunk with the Cup of her For- 
nication: And now the day is come, that Babylon is come up in re- 
membrance with the Lord, and the Dayof her Judgements is come, 
and the Vials are pouring upon the Seat and Head of the Beast; and 
the darkness is expelling, and the Light is arising out of obscurity, 
and shining secretly in the hearts of People, where Gods appeareance 
and Manifestation is, where he writes his Law, and puts his Spirit in 
the inward parts, which is the new Covenant which he hath made with 
the House of Israel, and with the House of Judah, and which is 
also a Light to the Gentiles, by which they can do the things contain- 
ed in the Law, having the substance of the Law, which is Light, writ- 
ten in their Hearts, their Consciences also bearing them witness of the 
Justice and Righteousness of the Law, when God comes to judge the 
secrets of their hearts by Jesus Christ, who is the end of the Law for 
Righteousness <pb/>
Righteousness, and who is the Light that is given to be the salvation 
to the ends of the Earth.</p>
               <p>And now all people that comes to be guided by this Law, which is 
Light, they by so doing comes into Gods Covenant and Promise; and 
coming into this Light, and Covenant, and Spirit which God puts in 
the inward parts, here all people meet together, Jews and Gentiles, 
Barbarian, Scithian, Bond and Free in the Unity of the Spirit 
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, in which they come to be all one in 
Christ; &#x0026; if they be Christ's, then are they Abraham's Seed, &#x0026; Heirs 
according to promise:Gal.3.29.This is the great Mystery that hath bin 
hid from Ages and Generations past, by reason of the gross Dark- 
ness that hath covered men; and the great cause and reason of all this, 
hath been because the worship that hath been set up in the Nations, 
hath had its Foundation in the Darkness, &#x0026; the very root &#x0026; ground 
of it hath been Darkness it self, and the Teachers and Ministers 
thereof, have been Ministers of Darkness, and have not turned peo- 
ple from darkness to the Light, but on the contrary have drawn 
them from the Light and Spirit of God within them, unto their In- 
ventions, Imaginations, Meanings, and Expositions of the Scriptures 
without them, and so have been building Babel in the many Langua- 
ges, which God is coming to confound; and it may be they have read a 
Chapter, and then turn and pervert it, and mix with it their own dark 
imaginations of their evil hearts; and again read a verse of a Chap- 
ter, and make an hours Discourse of what they had intended and 
hatched up in their minds (it may be) a week before. And thus they 
have fed poor people with Chaff and Huskes; but the Lord is arisen in 
his mighty tower, with his Fan in his hand, and he is separation the 
Chaff from the wheat, and is gathering the Wheat into his Garner, and 
will burn-up the Chaff with unquenchable fire. 
And now Reader, in soberness and singleness of thy heart, read 
this following Treatise without an evil eye, and a prejudiced mind; 
and let the Truth of God have place in thy heart, and let the light of 
Christ in thy Conscience seriously judge and weigh the things therein 
contained, and (according to the Scriptures) prove all things, and 
hold fast that which is good; and look not at Men, nor at the Times 
as they stand in relation to men, for in do doing, the god of the world 
will blind the eye; but look at the Lord and at his Truth; and eye his 
dealing and dispensation of his will according to his wisdom, and let 
him <pb/>
him be thy fear, and let him be thy dread, and slight not thy Day of 
Visitation of his love; For truly the Lord whom we seek, will sud- 
denly come to his Temple, and who may abide the day of his coming? 
Who will sift as a Refiners fire, and will be as Fullers Soap. Certainly 
he will plead with all flesh by Sword and by Fire, and bring into the 
Valley of Jehosaphat, and all flesh will be as grass, and the glory 
thereof as the Flower of the Field, when the spirit of the Lord blows 
upon it, because all People are Grass. It is not flesh and blood that can 
enter into the Kingdom of God, which he is now restoring unto Israel; 
it is that, that will pass the fire of his jealousie, and come through 
clear and pure, that will be accepted of in this his day; People have 
long made him serve with their sins, and wearyed him with their Ini- 
quity, and their worships and Services have been an abomination unto 
him; and the fear that hath been taught towards him, hath been by 
the precepts of men, and flesh and blood hath performed the Worship 
that should have been to him, and therefore hath there been not en- 
trance into the Kingdom of God, but all have been kept back, and 
out of the holy City, though the Gates have stood open by Day, yet no 
unclean could enter, nor nothing that wrought abomination, or made a 
lye, for that is in the Night of darkness, and is out of the Day 
where the Gates of the holy City stands open. 
And so now (Reader) these things being set before thee in love 
unto thee and to all people; slight them not, nor look not lightly over 
them; for if thou seriously consider and with them with that of God 
in thy Conscience, thou wilt finde them truth, and according to the 
Scriptures of Truth: therefore search and examine the following 
Treatise by the Scriptures and the Spirit of Truth, and thou wilt find 
that in they own bosom which will answer to the Truth of what is here 
written. So to the Lord I commit thee, and to his witness in thee 
which will answer for his Truth.

               <p>A true TESTIMONY, &#x0026;c.</p>
               <p>To all the professed Teachers in the whole world, who go under the 
Name of Christians, and make a profession of Christ, who was 
offered up at Jerusalem, which the Scriptures declares of, whether 
they be Jesuits, Bishops, Priests, Protestants, Presbyters, In- 
dependents, Anabaptists, and to all sorts of Sects and Se- 
ctaries whatsoever; This unto you all, to prove, or disprove 
the Doctrine of the QUAKERS, which is the same with 
Christ, the Apostles, and Prophets; which doth prove your 
Doctrine to be false, and out of the Doctrine of Christ. 
</p>
               <p>Your testimony which ye do bear of the coming of 
Christ (who are called Christians by Name) is one- 
ly the Letter of the Scriptures, because that there are 
Records left of Christs words which he spoke in the Mount, and 
which he spoke at Jerusalem, and at Samaria, and which he 
preached among the multitude, and the many Mira- 
cles that he wrought, and what he spoke to the Souldiers 
when he was apprehended, and what he spoke before the High 
Priest and Pontius Pilate, and what he spoke when he was upon 
the Cross. The Disciples having written of his Preaching, 
and of his Miracles that he wrought, and of his Sufferings, 
those Writings are your Testimony of Christ. And again, the 
Apostles after they had received the holy Ghost, and Power 
from above, when Christ was offered up and ascended, the 
Apostles having received his Eternal Spirit, and they going on 
in the work of God, converted thousand to the Faith, and 
did great and wonderful Works and Miracles by the Spirit 
of Christ which they had received, and they travelled up 
and down in several parts of the World, and turned Peo- 
ple
<pb n="2"/>
ple from Darkness to the Light, and from the power of Satan unto God' 
and there was a Record of their Words, Service, and Actions, 
which are called, The Acts of the Apostles, which do testifie of 
several remarkable Words, Actions, and Conversions, that were 
wrought by them through the Eternal Spirit. And after they 
had gathered several Churches and People into the unity of the 
Eternal Light and Spirit of God, and had begotten many 
into the faith, which could bear witness in the Spirit of God 
of the Eternal Truth which they had received through the 
Doctrine of the Spirit. </p>
               <p>Now the Apostles when they were separated, and at a di- 
stance from those Churches, they wrote several Epistles to 
the Saints, that were gathered and sanctified in Christ Jesus, and 
made partakers of the precious Faith, &#x0026; such as were called 
to be Saints; the Apostles wrote not their Epistles to the worlds 
nor to such as were not gathered by them, neither Jews nor Gen- 
tiles, but to the Churches of Christ, sanctified in Christ Jesus, cal- 
led to be Saints, of what sort or denomination soever they were, or 
went under, whether Corinthians, Ephesians, Romans, Galatians, 
&#x0026;c.</p>
               <p>Now the Apostacy and Darkness coming over, and the false 
Apostles getting up, being erred and gone from the Sprit, and 
turned aside from the life and power, of the purity and innocen- 
cy that the Apostles were in, and turning out of the Light of 
the glorious Gospel which was in them, the darkness came over 
them, and the Antichristian Sprit entred in amongst them; 
for the Apostle John saw in his time, that the Antichrist was come 
and entred into the World, whereby he said, He knew it was 
the last time, &#x0026; that there were many Antichrists already; &#x0026; he 
knew it was the time that Christ had prophesied of, That false 
Prophets should come in sheeps clothing, but inwardly were ravening 
Wolves, ravened and erred from the Spirit of Truth, which 
was in the true Apostles, and so did deceive many, that even 
darkness covered the face of the Earth and all was lost, and 
the Beast rose out of the Sea, and out of the Earth, and all 
the world wondred after them, and fell down, and worshipped 
the Beast, and Antichrist, and his Power, and so all nations 
were made drunk with his Cup of Fornication and Abomination; 
Yet
<pb n="3"/>
Yet this was not unseen nor undiscover'd before it came; For 
Christ prophesied of it, that false Christs and Antichrists would 
come in the later dayes, Wolves in sheepes clothing would come, and 
by their fruits you should know them, Mat.7.15. And the A- 
postle Paul he knew that grievous Wolves would enter in amonst 
them after his departure, that would not spare the flock, Acts 20.29. 
And Peter he was sensible of false Prophets that was amongst 
the People, &#x0026; did also foretell of false Teachers that should privily ] 
bring in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them; 
and he also saw, that many would follow their pernicious ways, and 
that through Covetousness they with feigned words would make Mer- 
chandice of People; and Timothy saw that in the last Dayes peril- 
ous Times should come, that men should bee lovers of themselves, ha- 
ving a form of godliness, but denying the power; from such turn 
away, faith the Apostle; for of there sort are they which creep 
into houses (calling them Churches) and leads captive silly wo- 
men, laden with sin, and led away with diverse lusts; ever learning, 
and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth. Now as Jan- 
nes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the Truth: 
Men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. And again, the 
same Apostle saith, That the time would come, when the people would 
not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts would heap to them- 
selves Teachers, having itching ears, &#x0026; they would turn away their ears 
from the Truth, &#x0026; shold be turned unto Fables. New all these seeing 
that this Apostacy would come, This is a certain testimony that it 
was to come, and is come, and hath over-spread the face of the 
earth since the Apostles daies, as hath been clearly manifested 
by the many heads and Horns of the Beast, and of the Dragon' 
and the many Religions and Sects that have started up since 
the daies of the Apostles; and as on got up, another was 
pull'd down; And now the blind people that have been nursed 
up in blindness, and darkness, and ignorance, under this cloud 
of Apostacy; New when that the Truth is manifested, and 
risen through this Darkness and Apostacy, and they seeing that 
the Scripture speaks of false Prophets, they say, the false Pro- 
phets are but com'd now; and they call the Spirit of Truth the 
false Prophet, because it bears testimony against the false worships 
in the World. But I would ask such people, which of these 
Sects
<pb n="4"/>
Sects, or Heads, or Horns that have been up since the daies of 
the Apostles, which of them they look upon to be the true 
Prophets? Whether it is the Pope, Luther, or Calvin? or which 
other of the old Fathers (so called) or Bishops and Presbyters, Inde- 
pendents or Anabaptists? for all these have been, and have had their 
Time in this apostacy, and have gotten the Writings of the Pro- 
phets, Christ, and the Apostles, and so have all had the Form of 
godliness, but denyed the Power of godliness, according to the pro- 
phene of the Apostle Peter, who said, There were false Prophets 
among the people, even as there should be false Teachers among them, 
which should bring in damnable Heresies, and that they should received 
the reward of unrigheousness, who have forsaken the right way, and 
are gone astray, following the way of Balaam, who loved the wages of 
unrighteousness, which the Apostle Jude said, Whose mouths must 
be stopt, who subvert whole Houses, teaching things they ought not for 
filthy lucre sake; who serves not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own 
bellyes, and counts gain godliness. Now let all people search and 
read who these are, and whether these be the true prophets, or 
the false? And whether these have not been, and yet are, in the 
time of Apostacy? for all Christendom (as its called) have had 
the Scriptures, and professed Christ for the Declaration 
thereof, and not from the Spirit of Truth in themselves, but be- 
cause they have heard that there was such a Man which dy- 
ed at Jerusalem, and that there were such men after him as 
the Apostles were; and they having their words and writings 
upon record, do make these a sufficient Testimony for them of 
their knowledge and worship of God, and so preach &#x0026; teach, 
and takes Texts out of these words, and adds thereunto 
their own Inventions, and so feeds poor ignorant people with 
these; and here hath been the Worship that hath been upon 
the face of the Earth all the time of the dark night of Apo- 
stacy since the Apostles dayes. Now let any honest reasona- 
ble heart judge whether this can be a sure ground and true te- 
stimony for people, to trust their souls under such for teach- 
int? for it was not Christ nor the Apostles practice to take o- 
thers Records &#x0026; Writings that had been spoken from others; 
but they spoke as the spirit gave them utterance, and as the holy Ghost 
taught them, not with wisdom of words, but in the demonstration of 
the
<pb n="5"/>
the spirit and of power. Yet they will bring a Scripture, and say 
Christ took a Text when he spake of Esaiah's Prophesie, where 
he said The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, &#x0026; he hath annointed me to 
preach, and to open the blind eyes, and to preach liberty to the Cap- 
tives; and when he had read these words, he closed the Book, and said, 
This day this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears, for it was he that 
the Prophet spoke of, who is the Annointing, and the Annointed, 
to preach glad tydings to the poor, and liberty to the captive, and to 
the opening of the blind eyes; but these blind Leaders leads the 
blind, but doth not open their eyes, though they can make the 
Scripture a covering for their false Worship; for let any one 
prove and try the Teachers themselves, and they are as blind, and 
as ignorant of their own souls, and as far from having a true 
testimony of assurance of their own salvation, as those they speak 
to, or pretend to teach: Now let people consider this, and se- 
riously lay it to heart, and beware how they trust their souls 
under such Teachers and teaching, who have no other, nor bet- 
ter testimony then Records without them, which were given 
forth from the spirit of God in others; which spirit is Eternal 
and Infallible, which these Teachers of the World cannot in 
truth confess, but must (if they confess truth) utterly deny 
that they have any such spirit, as many of them have done 
already. How can these be true Teachers of people in the way 
of truth, which have not the spirit of truth? for if it be not all 
infallible spirit, it is a lying spirit, and not the spirit of Truth. 
Now let people seriously consider what they venture their 
souls upon; for it is not a deceitful lying spirit that will feed 
the soul, it's the spirit of life and truth that nourisheth the 
soul, and leads into all truth. Now here is the chief differ- 
ence betwixt them and us, They have the words and declarati- 
on of Christ and the Apostles, declared from the spriti of life; 
and we have the spirit which these words words were declared 
from, not another, but the same eternal Spirit which they had, 
do we witness, and bear our Testimony of, the same Christ (and 
not of another) which witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pi- 
late, and was crucified upon the cross at Jerusalem; This Christ 
which all the Christians in Christendom profess in words, do we 
bear testimony of in the spirit of life and power, according to 
the Scriptures. 
Obj.
<pb n="6"/>
Obj. But it may be objected and said, How came you to this 
Spirit, seeing that you say, that darkness and Apostacy hath been 
over the face of the Earth since the dayes of the Apostles, and that 
all Worships and Professions have been but from the Letter of the Scri- 
ptures without them, this is but an upstart Religioun, how is it that you 
are attained to this that none are attained to in so many hundred years 
before? And are you wiser then all our fore-fathers? What is be- 
come of all that is gone before? </p>
               <p>Ans. This Objection is against the unlimited Spirit &#x0026; Power of 
the living God, which did foresee the Apostacy befre it came; &#x0026; 
Christ and the Apostles did prophesie of it; for the same Ob- 
jection might be against the Lord when he said unto Pharaoh, 
I even for the same purpose have raise thee up, that I might shew 
my power in thee, and that my power might be declared throughout all 
the Earth; therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and 
whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, why 
doth he yet find fault, who hath resisted his will? Nay, but oh man! 
Who art thou that replies against God? Shall the thing formed, say 
to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? What if God 
(willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, en- 
dured with much long suffering, the Vessels of Wrath, fitted 
to destruction, and that he might make known the Riches of 
his glory on the Vessels of Mercy which he had before prepa- 
red unto glory; and this is the very case; The spirit of the Lord 
cannot be limited, but limits all according to the good plea- 
sure of his will, that he may make his power known. 
But furthermore, as to our particular, we answer, We recei- 
ved not this spirit of Man, nor by Man, but by the immediate power 
and revelation of Jesus Christ, according to the work and operation 
of it in us; As the Apostle said, For when it pleased the Lord to re- 
veal his Son in the Apostle, he consulted not with flesh and blood, but 
went on in obedience unto the Lord: And so the same spirit that 
revealed the Son in the Apostle, revealed him in us; for we 
neither received it of man, neither were we caught it by man, 
but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ; for no man could teach 
it us, but who had the Revelation of Jesus Christ, according 
as the Apostle said to the Romans, If the spirit of him that rai- 
sed up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from 
the
<pb n="7"/>
the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because that his spirit 
dwelleth in you, Rom.8.II. And again, Know ye not that ye are the 
Temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? I Cor.3. 
Now though these Scriptures bear testimony to the truth of 
this, yet these Scriptures are not our testimony only, for we have 
our testimony in the same spirit as was in them that spoke forth 
the Scriptures; and these Scriptures bears testimony with us, and 
we to them, and so are in unity with the same Spirit which gave 
them forth.</p>
               <p>And this is the Hope that we are to give an account of to e- 
very one that asketh with meekness &#x0026; fear; for god hath made 
known unto us the Riches of the glory of this Mystery amongst the 
Gentiles, which was Christ in them (and now in us) the hope of glory; 
and this is the same Christ which was offered up at Jerusalem once 
for all, through the Eternal spirit, and this is the HOPE which pu- 
rifies even as he is pure; which HOPE maketh not ashamed, but an- 
chors the Soul upon the rock CHRIST JESUS; and the Apostles 
who had the Eternal spirit, are our forefathers: And this is not 
an upstart Religion which we are of, but a pure Religion, and un- 
defiled before God, which keeps every one that keeps in it, unspot- 
ted of the world; Yet this hath been hid from ages and generati- 
ons past, but now is revealed unto us by the spirits which spirit peo- 
ple have erred from in the time of Apostacy, and from this they 
do erre at this very day, and such counts the spirit within Here- 
sie, and goes to Scriptures without them, and traditions of men, 
and teach those for Doctrine; and here is the Reason wherefore 
this Spirit and Revelation hath been hid so many hundred years, 
even because people have been erred from the spirit of God in 
them, through which the Revelation is manifested, and they 
have been erred in their hearts; therefore the way of God 
hath not been known.</p>
               <p>Christ said to the Woman of Samaria when he was on the 
Mountain where Jacobs Well was, where the Jews used to wor- 
ship, he said, They worshipped they knew not what; and he also said, 
that the time was coming that they should not worship at Jerusalem, 
(which was a place commanded of god for the Jews to wor- 
ship in) nor in this Mountain; and he further testified, That God 
was a spirit, and that they worshipped him, must worship him in 
spirit
<pb n="8"/>
spirit and in truth, saying, The Father was seeking such to worship 
him, for they only are the true Worshippers of God. 
Now I do ask all the Teachers and Professors in Christendom, 
Where this spirit is, that God is to be worshipped in, if it be not 
in man? And how it is, or can be attained to, any otherwise 
than by the light of Christ Jesus with which he hath lighted every 
man that cometh into the world, in whom is life, and this life is the 
light of men? And where this worship of God in the spirit is per- 
formed, if it be not in man? And Where Gods Throne is, (where 
the ancient of dayes doth sit) if it be not in man? And where 
the Scepter of Christ is swayed, which is a righteous Scepter, if it 
be not in Man? And where the King is that shall reign &#x0026; pros- 
per, whose Name shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness? 
And how and where must people come to worship god in the 
spirit, which denies the Light of Christ to be their Leader and 
Teacher, and say it is natural? and some say every one hath it not; 
and other say, It is not sufficient, and so they are all upon 
heaps, and in confusion, who believe not in the Light which 
Christ Jesus hath enlightened them withall, who is the Light of e- 
very man; so denying the Light, and being erred from it, are 
in darkness until now, and stumbles, and knows not whether 
they go.</p>
               <p>Christ saith, I am the light of the world, he that followeth me, 
shall now walk in Darkness, but shall have the Light of life: And a- 
gain saith he, While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that you 
may be the children of the Light: I am come a Light into the world, 
that whosoever believeth in me, shall not abide in darkness. Now I 
do ask any of the Teachers of the World, how any comes 
to see Christ any otherwise then by the light of the body, 
which he saith is the eye? seeing that he said to the Jews who 
talked with him, and he with them, They had not heard his 
voice, nor seen his shape; for he whom God hath sent, they believed 
not.</p>
               <p>This may be the condition of the Priests of the World, 
and Teachers of the Letter, and they ought to own it, That 
they have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape; for 
how should they, when they deny the light of Christ that is 
in them to be their Guide and Teacher, which Christ hath lighted 
them<pb n="9"/>
them withall, which is the Key of David, which opens and none shuts, 
and shuts and none opens? And he told the Jews, That they did 
search the Scriptures that did testifie of him, and in which they did 
think to have eternal life; but (sayes he) you will not come to me 
me that you may have life; I receive not honor from men (sayes he) 
I desire not that you should come to me as to give honour as from men, 
but that you would come that you might have life; but I know you, 
that you have not the love of God abiding in you: this he spoke to 
the Jews, that he said had not his word abiding in them, yet they 
searched the Scriptures, who did not believe in him, though 
he did many Miracles amongst them yet they persecuted him, 
and sought to kill him, and took up stones to stone him, who 
is given for a Covenant to the People, and for a Light to the Gentiles, 
that he may be the salvation to the ends of the Earth: And this is 
the new and Everlasting Covenant, the promise of God the 
Father, who hath said, Is it a light thing that though should raise 
up the Tribes unto Jacob, and restore again the preserved of Israel? 
with whom the Lord hath said, I will make a new Covenant, I 
will write my Law in their hearts, and put my spirit in their inward 
parts; and by this Spirit and Light doth God teach his People 
himself; and all that comes to the leading and teaching of 
this Spirit, comes to the knowledge of the Lord, which shall 
cover the Earth, even as the waters covers the Sea; and to this 
Light did the Apostle turn people from the Darkness, and 
from the Power of Satan unto God. And by the nature 
of this Divine Light, did the Gentiles the things contained 
in the Law, which shewed the Work of the Law (of the spi- 
rit) written in their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness 
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of Men by Jesus Christ, 
according to the Gospel: And here the Apostle doth justifie the 
Gentiles, in that he saith, Not the hearers of the Law are justi- 
fied, but the doers; and their uncircumcision, which did the Law, 
he accounted circumcision, and said to the Jews, Shall not 
their uncircumcision judge your circumcision, which breaks the Law; 
&#x0026; he further saith, We are of the true circumcision, who worship God 
in the spirit, and rejoice in christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the 
flesh; for he is not a Jew that is one outward, neither is that circumci- 
sion which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inward- 
ly<pb n="10"/>
ly, and that is circumcision that is of the heart, in the spirit, and not 
in the Letter, who praise is not of men, but of god, Rom. 2. And 
this is the seal of the everlasting Covenant, that takes away 
the foreskin of the heart, and washes away the filth of the 
flesh; and here the knowledge of the true God is manifest- 
ed in man, where God shews it unto him, according to the 
Apostles Doctrine, Rom.I.9. </p>
               <p>And when Paul came to Mars-Hill, ans saw the Anteni- 
ans Altar, with the inscription upon it, to the unknown God, he 
said, God that made the world, and all things therein, seeing that he 
is Lord of Heaven and Earth, he dwelleth no in Temples made with 
hands, neither is he worshipped with mens hands, as though he needed 
any thing, seeing he giveth to all life and breath, and all things, 
and hath made of one blood all Nations of men, to dwell on the face 
of the Earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and 
the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek the Lord if haply 
they might feel after him, and find him,, though he be not far from every 
one of us, for in him we live, move, &#x0026; have our being Act.17.24. Here 
the Apostle did not lead them out to the Writings and Re- 
cords of others without them, but he brought them to him 
in whom they did live, and move, and had their being, that so they 
might feel after him, and find him; for he said, He was not far 
from every one of them; and he brought them off the outward 
Temple which was made with hands, and said to the Corin- 
thians, Ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will 
dwell in them, and walk in them, I will be their God, and they shall 
be my People; and he that defiles the Temple of god, him will God 
destroy; for the Temple of God is holy whose Temple are ye; and what, 
know ye not that your bodyes are the Temple of the Holy Ghost which 
is in you, which ye have of god, and ye are not your own, but you are 
bought with a price; therefore glorifie him in your body, and in your
spirit, which are God's.</p>
               <p>Here the Apostle clearly demonstrates, that the bodies of 
God's People are his Temple, and God is the Spirit that is 
in them; and this is the Teacher and Preacher, which the Apo- 
stle turns and brings People to, whom he teaches; he told 
the romans that the righteousness of Faith speaketh on this wife, 
Say not in thy heart who shall ascend, or descend; but what faith is? <pb n="11"/>
The word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, and that is 
the word of Faith that we preach, faith the Apostle, (mark) How 
then (faith he) shall ye call on him on whom ye have not believed? 
And how shall ye believe on him of whom ye not have heard? And how 
shall ye hear without a preacher? For Faith cometh by hearing, and 
hearing by the word of God. And this is the Word which the A- 
postle preached, which is nigh, in the heart; which word opens the 
blind eye, and unstops the deaf ear; and they cannot hear with- 
out this Word of Faith, by hearing of which, Faith comes; 
and none can hear without this Precher, who is sent to bring 
glad tydings of good things; but this is not the Preachers of the 
letter of the Scriptures without them, for they have prea- 
ched many hundreds of years, but the deaf ears are not unstop- 
ped yet, nor the Blind eyes opened by their Preaching; and so the 
Scripture is now fulfilled which the Prophet Isay spake of, 
who faith, Bring forth the blind People that have eyes, and the deaf 
that have ears; And again he faith, They have Eyes, and see not, 
Ears, and hear not, hearts, and do not understand. Isa.43.10. 
And the Lord faith, I will lay waste Mountains and Hills, and 
dry up all their Herbs; and I will make their Rivers Islands, and I 
will dry up the Pools; and I will bring the blind by a way they knew 
not, and pathes which they have not seen; I will make darkness Light 
before them, and rough wayes plain, and crooked things streight; them 
that comes into this Path and Way, must come from the 
blind Teachers of the World; who are Leaders of the blind, 
and keeps people in blindness and ignorance of God, and 
his Truth, who denyes the Light to be sufficient Teacher, 
which is the Eye of the whole body, &#x0026; if this Eye be single, the body is 
full 
of Light; But with this eye they do not see, neither can they 
believe the Truth if it be declared unto them, except they 
come to the Light that doth manifest it in them. Now the A- 
postle Peter directed those that he worte to , to a more sure Word of 
Prophesie then that which he heard in the Mount, 2 Pet. 1.19. Which 
voice he did not know that it was within him; and therefore 
he directed them to a more sure Word then that was which he heard 
in the Mount, which Word was a Word of Prophesie, where unto he 
said, they did well that they took heed, as unto a light that shined in 
a dark place, until the day dawned, &#x0026; the day-star arose in their hearts; 
this<pb n="12"/>
this testomony of Jesus, the which is the spirit of Prophesie: This the 
Teachers of the World brings to blind people with, &#x0026; saith it 
the Scripture that the Apostle speaks of. Now let any that 
have but common reason judge, whether the Apostle was 
like to say, That the Scriptures were a more sure word, 
then the Voice of God that was heard in the Mount, which 
said, This is my beloved Son, hear yet him; and that the Scrip- 
tures should be a light shining in a dark place, and that the Scri- 
tures should be the day dawning, and the day-star arising in the 
heart: If people would but look into things, they might see 
their deceivableness; for the Apostle goes on with these 
words, saying, Knowing this first, that no Prophesie of the Scrip- 
ture is of any private interpretation; for the Prophesie came not in old 
time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were mo- 
ved by the Holy Ghost. Here the Apostle disswades them from 
looking at the Scriptures to be of any private Interpretation, or 
coming by the will of man, which is their whole work, to 
give their Meanings and Interpretations in their own Wills 
unto, which is wholly contrary to the Apostles Exhortation 
and Doctrine, who said, We have not followed cunning devised 
Fables, when we made known unto you the Power and the coming of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, but were Eye-witnesses of his Majesty. And 
the Apostle Paul who was rased up by the Power, Spirit, and 
Voice of the Lord, who said, Arise and stand upon thy feet, for 
I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a Minister 
and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those 
things in which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the peo- 
ple, and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send thee to open the blind 
eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to the Light, Act. 26. And the 
Apostle goeth on bearing his testimony, having obtained 
the help of God, witnessing both to small and great, saying 
none other thing then that which the Porphets and Moses 
did say should come that Christ should suffer, and that he should be 
the first that shold rise from the dead, and should shew Light unot the 
people, and to the Gentiles. And this was the Witness and the Te- 
stimony which the Apostle helf forth, who was a Minister of 
God. But these Teachers of the World deny and gain-says 
this<pb n="13"/>
this Doctrine; and the Apostle saith, Therefore seeing we have 
this Ministry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not, but have re- 
nounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor 
handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the Minstration of the 
Truth, commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of 
God, 2 Cor. 9. I. And if our Gospel be hid, it is hid from them that are 
lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them 
that believe not, least the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is 
the Image of God, should shine unto them: See here, and behold 
how the Apostle recommended himself to every mans conscience in 
the sight of god; yet his Gospel might be hid to them that were lost, 
and was from the Light, and would not believe, which the god 
of the world had blinded their minds, least the Light should shine un- 
to them; and so it is the same still, our Gospel is hid unto such as 
believe not in the Light; For God who commanded the Light to 
shine out of the darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light 
of the knowledge of the glory of god, in the face of Jesus Christ; 
2 Cor. 2. I. 3. 9. And if the Light of Christ shine not in their 
hearts, our Gospel is hid. And again he saith, Ye were Some- 
times darkness, but now you are light in the Lord, walk as children 
of the Light; for all things that are reproved, are made manifest by 
the light; Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and stand 
up, that Christ may give thee light, Eph. 5. And this is the Mes- 
sage which the Apostle did declare, that God is light, and in 
him is no darkness at all; and if we say that we have fellowship with 
him, and walk in darkness, we lye, and do not the truth; but if we 
walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with ano- 
ther, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all sin, 
I John I. 5. This is the Message of the Minister of God; and 
the Apostel gave thanks unto God the Father which had made 
them meet to be partakers of the Inheritance, with the Saints in light, 
who had delivered them from the power of darkness, and had trasla- 
ted them into the Kingdom of his dear Son. This is not a new Do- 
ctrine, though it may seem so to many; because this Mystery 
hath been hid, and the Spirit of god which opens this My- 
stery, erred from, and turned from, by those that have been 
Teachers of people; and not onely so, but even their Do- 
ctrine hath been, and now is, That none must look for, nor 
expect<pb n="14"/>
expect Revelation nor Inspiration by the Spirit of god; and so 
they do what in them lyes, to stop this Current of Life and 
Spirit, which Christ jesus the Fountain of all life hath set o- 
pen, who in the last day of the Feast stood up and said, If a- 
ny many be a-thirst, let him come unto me, and drink; He that belie- 
veth on me, out of his belly shall flow Rivers of living Waters. And 
this he spake of the Spirit which these Teachers of the world 
would stop; the pourings of which Spirit is unlimited to 
Son or Daughter, Jew or Gentile, Barbarian, Scythian, Bond, or 
Free, Time or Place, or Condition, but according to the good pleasure 
of his will, who is the Author and the fountain of it; and all that 
are Ministers of God, and of the Spirit, it is their joy and de- 
sire that people grow into the Light of Life; for they that are 
in the Light, the day of destruction shall not overtake them 
as a Thief, who are Children of the Light, and of the Day; 
and this is the desire of all the faithful in Christ Jesus, That 
they dwell and abide in the Light, where the fellowship is 
one with another, and where the power of God preserves 
and keeps from the pollutions of the World, and temptati- 
ons of Satan; which Power is made manifest the appear 
ing of Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath 
brought Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel, whose Im 
mortality dwells in the Light, where the Lord God Almighty and 
the Lamb is the Temple, 2 Tim I. 10. And here the City comes 
to be known which hath no need of the Sun, nor of the Moon, to 
shine in it, for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the 
light thereof, and all the Nations of themn that are saved shall walk in 
the light of it, and the Kings of the Earth shall bring their glory and 
honor to it, and the glory of the Nations shall come unto it, and there 
shall in no wise enter into it that which defiles, neither that which wor- 
keth abomination, or maketh a lye, but they which are written in the 
Lambs book of life, Rev. 21. This is the great work which the 
Lord is working in this his Day, and the spiritual Building 
which he is rearing and setting up; and he hath put his hand 
to the work; and when he worketh, who can let it? Who 
hath resisted his Will? Who hath directed the Spirit of the 
Lord, or been his Counsellor? Or taught him? Of whom 
took he Councel? Or sho instructed and taught him know- 
ledge,<pb n="15"/>
ledge, and shewed him the way of understanding? Behold, the 
Nations are but as the drop of a Bucket, &#x0026; as the small dust of the Bal- 
lance before him he taketh the Isles as a very little thing, Lebanon is 
not sufficient to burn, and the Beast therof for a Burnt-offerings; it is 
he 
that sitteth upon the Circle of the Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof 
are as grashoppers; By his Spirit he will remove the great Moun- 
tains of the Earth, and they shall become a Plain, and he will bring 
forth the head-stone, and lay it a top of all; for the stone which is 
cut out of the Mountain without hands, breaks in pieces the Imgae, and 
will become a great Mountain, and the Kingdom which shall never be 
destroyed, (and shall not be left to other people, but will break in 
pieces, 
and consume all Kingdoms) this is arising, and the ancient of Dayes is 
coming to sit in Judgement in the Saints of the Most High; and the 
Kingdomes of the world is becoming the Kingdomes of the 
Lord and of his Christ; and the little one shall become 'a 
thousand, and the small one a great Nation. Dan 7. chap. And the 
Lord of Hosts will hasten it in his time; so it is in vain to 
stand against the God of Heaven, or to resist his work which 
he hath begun in the Earth, which he is working, and will 
work by the Spirit, in this his day of Power he wil make all his 
people willing and subject to him, &#x0026; every knee must bow to him, 
and every tongue confess to God; for the first Adam was made a living 
soul, but the second is the Lord from Heaven, a quickning spirit which 
doth quicken and raise up the just unto the resurrection of Life, 
and he is made manifest in his people to destroy the works 
of the Devil, which he hath wrought in the disobedient 
part of man, and so brought the first Adam into the fall, and 
so under the Curse, that the very Earth is cursed for his sake; 
but christ Jesus, which the Apostle saw made a little lower then 
Angels; for the suffering of death, through which he hath wrought the 
Redemption of man Heb. 2. 6. Into a blessed and happy, &#x0026; perfect 
condition; Though the Priests and Teachers of the World 
makes it their Work to destroy this Work of Redemption 
of the Son of God, who redeems out of sin and all evil, and from 
a vain conversation, to serve the living God in newness of spirit, and 
not in the oldness of the letter, which redeems from the Earth; and 
from the pollutions of the world, and from all unrighteousness, all 
those that believe on him, and trust in him, and obey him, and wait 
for him, unto them shall he come the second time without sin unto sal- 
vation<pb n="16"/>
vation; but this is a Mystery, which cannot be believed, by the 
dark and ignorant sinning and transgressing Ministry and 
Professors of the Nations, which lyes wallowing in their sins 
and uncleanness, and drink up iniquity as the Ox drinketh Waters; 
these that are filling up their measure of iniquity, and are 
wholly covered with the power of darkness, these cannot see 
how it is possible that ever any should get out of this state 
and condition, being that they are quite ignorant of their 
Redeemer living in them, and so goes about to perswade all 
people of an impossibility of being freed from sin, but that 
they must sin all the dayes of their lives, and so keeps peo- 
ple in the fall, in the transgression, under the curse, &#x0026; death 
is the reward of sins; and so these Ministers are the Ministers 
of death: But Christ Jesus redeems from under the Curse, 
and from under the Bondage of sin and corruption, which all 
the Creation hath long groaned under, &#x0026; waits for the bles- 
sed liberty of the sonds and chldren of God, Glory &#x0026; honour be 
unto his holy Name for ever, who hath sent his only begotten Son in the 
likenss of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin the flesh; for as by 
one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of 
one, shall many be made righteous: But this the disobedient will 
never know, who turns from, and disobeys the one that 
should make them righteous: and here are all the Priests 
and Teachers, and Professors of the world, in the disobedi- 
ence, erred from the Spirit, in the Transgression, and in the 
sin; and so teaching all people to be sinners, as they can do 
no otherwise, who are not Ministers of the Light of Christ, 
nor turns not people to the Light of Christ, in whom is no 
sin who hath said, Except a man be born again of water and of the 
spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Now that which 
is born of the Spirit, is Spirit, and this enters the Kingdom; 
For it is the spirit that quickens, the flesh profiteth nothing; The words 
that I speak unto you, (saith Christ) they are spirit, and they are life's 
but there were some that believed not: Now those that de- 
ny the Light of the Spirit of Life, they know little of the 
pourings forth of the Spirit, or of the Manifestation of the 
Spirit of God, which he hath given to every one to profit 
withall; but the Ministers of the Letter, and of darkness, 
which<pb n="17"/>
which have erred from the Spirit, and endeavours to keep 
all people back from the teaching, and leading, and guiding 
of the spirit, they do not profit with it, but hides their ta- 
lent in the Earth, and counts the Lord a hard Master; there- 
fore he must needs take it from them, and give it unto those 
that have profited with it; this is witnessed, and manifested, 
and seen with those that have eyes in this day; The Apostles 
spake as the Spirit gave them utterance, and their preaching was 
not with the enticing words of mans wisdom, but in the power and de- 
monstration of the Spirit, not according to the wisdom of the world; 
but he spake the wisdom of God in a Mystery, even the hidden wisdom 
which God had revealed unto him by his Spirit, which Spirit seach- 
cheth all things, yea the deep things of God: Therefore its good 
for every one to have a true Testimony of this Eternal Spi- 
rit; which believes not every spirit, but tryes them, whether they be of 
God, and proves all things, and holds fast that which is good; and he 
that layes his Foundation here, he builds not his House on 
the Sand, but on the Rock, on which the whole Church is built, 
which is in god, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Pillar and 
Ground of Truth; And when the wind blows, the storms and the Tem- 
pests beats, this House will stand; for they that are joyned to the Lord, 
are one Spirit with him, and of one heart and soul; if they were 
ten thousand, they are all one, and all of one, who are be- 
gotten and born, and brought forth, and sanctified by one 
Spirit; and here is the Mystery of the fellowship of the Go- 
spel, which is in the unity of the Spirit, which is the bond of peace. 
And this is not a shaddow, nor a vanishing fading thing; 
but this is a substance that proceeds from the living God, 
and returns unto him; by which Spirit he is made known 
unto the sons of men, and by which spirit he words and cre- 
ates in Christ Jesus unto righeousness and true Holiness; 
for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, who have been made 
to drink all into one Spirit, whether Jews or Gentiles, Bond or Free; 
if they come into this Spirit which makes, and unites, and 
knits together, they are all one; for the body is not one member, 
but many; but they that denies this Spirit, and the teaching 
thereof, are not of this body, nor do not drink of this Cup 
of the New-Testament; but they are drinking of the Cup 
of<pb n="18"/>
of Fornication and Idolatry; for the Apostle said, They could 
not sit at the Lords Table, and the Table of Devils; and they could 
not drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils; and so they 
that drink not of the Cup of the Spirit [new] in the King- 
dom, let them read in their own bosomes what they are 
drinking of. </p>
               <p>The Apostle said, that the corinthians were manifestly de- 
clared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred by him; written not with 
Ink, but with the spirit of the living God; not in Tables of stone, but 
in the fleshly Tables of the heart. Here is the Ministration mani- 
fested by them that are ministers of the spirit of the living 
God, who reach unto that of god in the hearts of people; 
and the same Spirit in people answers to the annointing which 
is in them, which they received, even the Unction of the holy One; and 
such need not that any man should teach them, but as the same annoin- 
ting teacheth them, which is truth, and no lye, I Joh. 2. 27. But this is 
not the Ministration of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the 
Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life, 2 Cor. 3. For the Apostle 
was made an able Minister of the New Testament, whose 
Ministration was more glorio0us then the Law, which was 
written in Tables of stone; and he saith, The Lord is the 
Spirit, which Spirit is written in the fleshly Tables of the heart, and 
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and all that are the 
Sons 
of God, are led and guided by the spirit of God, Rom. 8. According 
to the apostles words, who said, Because ye are sons, god hath 
sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father, 
Gal. 4. 6. And we through the spirit, wait for the hope of righteous- 
ness by the Faith and who walks and abides in the spirit doth not fulfil 
the 
lust of the flesh; for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit 
against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, Ga. 5. 5. 
And this is the Teacher, Leader and Guider of God's People 
who are called to be Saints, &#x0026; sanctified in Christ Jesus, through the 
obedience of the spirit which subdues, &#x0026; brings down, &#x0026; subjecteth under 
in man and woman, that which is contrary; it working and opera- 
ting in the inward man, and putting on, and adorning the 
heart with a meek, and with a quiet spirit, which is with the Lord 
of great price: This is precious in the sight of the Lord, when 
the spirit beautifies with salvation, and sanctifies the heart 
to <pb n="19"/>
to the Lord by its powerful working, here the Lord is glori- 
fied in his Saints; and this eternal Spirit, and Substance, 
and Word, which is quick and powerful, sharper then any two-edged 
Sword, which separates betwixt the precious and the vile, betwixt the 
holy and profane, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul ans spirit, 
and of the joynts and marrow, and is a discerner of the thougths and 
intents of the heart, Heb. 4. 12. This is the sure Teacher that 
layeth a true Foundation, on which the Prophets and Apostels 
are built, the corner-stone, which all the wise Builders have disal- 
lowed and set at nought, which is now become the head of our Cor- 
ner; glory &#x0026; honor be to the Highest for ever, accrding to Christs 
words, who saith, did you not read in the Scripture, The Stone 
which all the Builders re[?] and set at nought, the same is become 
the Head of the Corner; this is the Lords doings, and is marvelous in 
our eyes; and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on 
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder, Matth. 21. 42, 
49. And Peter saith, That it is contained in the Scripture, Behold, 
I lay in Sion a chief Corner-stone, elect and precious; and he that be- 
lieveth on him, shall not be confounded; unto you therefore which be- [Isa. 
28 16] 
lieves he is precious; but unto them who are disobedient, the Stone [Psal. 
1 8. 
which the Builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the 22] 
Corder, and stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them [i Pet. 
2. 6.] 
that stumble at the Word, being disobedient; this is the [7. 8.] 
Stone and Word that all the disobedient stumblest at; Jews 
and Gentiles that will not come to the Light which Christ 
Jesus (who is the light of men) hath enlightened them with- 
all; the obedience of the Light of Christ Jesus, is the obedi- 
ence to the Cross of Christ, the preaching of which (the A- 
postle saith) it was to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the 
Greeks foolishness; but unto all, both Jews and Greeks, it is Christ the 
Power of god, and the wisdom of God, I Cor. I. The Light and 
the Power of god, is the Cross of Christ; this the Apostle 
did not preach with the wisdom of Words, least the Crosse of 
Christ should become of none effect, which is unto all that are sa- 
ved, the Power of God; and he saith, After that in the wisdom 
of god, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foo- 
lishness of Preaching, to save them that believe: this is the wis- 
dom of God, and the Way of God, not to teach people by 
that <pb n="20"/>
that which man's Wisdom teacheth; and that which man's 
dark heart invents and imagines, &#x0026; studies out of his brain, 
but by that which the Holy Ghost teacheth in this his day in 
which he is risen in his Eternal Spirit; and they that can be- 
lieve in this foolishness of preaching, are saved; and they that 
cannot believe, to them this Gospel is hid, because that the foo- 
lishness of God is wiser then men, and the weakness of God 
is stronger then men, who hath said, I will destroy the wisdom 
of the wise, and bring to nought the understanding of the prudent; for 
God hath chosen the foolish things of the worlds, to confound the things 
that are mighty, that no flesh might glory in his presence, but in him: 
This is the Will, and Way, and Work of the Lord, by which 
he teacheth his people, and so they have access by one spirit unto 
God the Father, Jews and Gentiles, Barbarians, Scithians, Bond and 
Free if they come unto Christ Jesus the Light and Life, and 
everlasting Covenant, which is given to be the salvation unto the 
ends of the Earth, which was offered up by the Eternal Spirit one for 
all. Eph. 2. 18. 
All people which comes unto this Eternal Spirit which is 
in them, of what sort soever, if they come to this Light, Co- 
venant, and Spirit, they are all one in christ Jesus, and if they 
be Christs, then are they Abrahams Seeds, and Heirs according to pro- 
mise. All that doth endeavour to keep the Unity in the Spi- 
rit, and Bond of Peace, is strengthened by this Spirit in the 
Inner-man; &#x0026; the eyes of their Understanding comes to be 
enlightened, &#x0026; they do come to comprehend with all Saints, 
the heigth, and the bredth, and the depth of the love of 
god, which passeth knowledge and is a mystery to the wise 
Rabbies of the World, and all the disobedient ones, that 
will not stoop to the Light of Christ, and his Power &#x0026; cross 
in them, but will live in the liberty of the flesh, where they 
may exercise their fleshly liberty, Pride and ambition, Su- 
perfluity of Naughtiness, vain Glory and Arrogancey, Vo- 
luptuousness, Pomp and Vanity of the World, all which are 
of the first man, fallen from God, and is of the Earth, earth- 
ly, which the cross of Christ, which is the power of God is to
crucifie the affections and the lusts thereof, the World, and 
the flesh, and the Devil, who is obedient and faithful to the 
Witness <pb n="21"/>
Witness and Testimony of the living God in them, and to 
its Guiding, and Leading, and Teaching; puts off the old man 
and his deeds, and puts on the new man, Christ Jesus, who is 
created after god in righteousness and true holiness, and so comes to 
be renewed in the spirit of their minds, and to have their conscien- 
ces cleansed, and their bodies washed with pure water, Eph. 5. And so 
they bring forth the fruits of the spirit, which are in all good- 
ness, righteousness, and truth, yea, joy, love, peace. Long-suffereing, 
gentleness, faith, meekness, and temperance; And against such 
there is no Law; who are in this state, keeps the Law, and breaks 
it not, and are in the Love, which fulfils it, and one with the 
Justice, Equity, and Righteousness of it, which was added because 
of transgression: And where there is no transgression, there is no 
need of a Law, nor the Law is not against such. 
But we find little of those fruits of the Spirit in the 
World (which cannot receive the Spirit of Truth) amongst 
all Professors, Priests and Teachers thereof; this is the Mark 
which Christ hath set us to try the false Prophets by; he 
saith, By their fruits shall you know them, who gets the sheeps clo- 
thing, (the Scriptures) but inwardly are ravening wolves: We 
have found the Priests, Professors and Teachers of these Nati- 
ons, to minister Persecution and Cruelty to us, as the Prisons 
and goals of these Nations may bear (and have born) testi- 
mony. And another Mark that christ gave of the false Pro- 
phets to know them by, was when all men should speak well of 
them, for so did their Fathers of the false Prophets; Now let all 
people judge, whether this be not the condition of the 
Priests and Teachers at this day; for they bear rule by their means, 
and yet the people love to have it so; but what will they do in the end 
thereof, when God comes with his overflowing scourge, and breaks 
the Covenant with Death, and the agreement with Hell, and sweep 
away the Refuge of Lyes? Matth. 7. Which many hundreds of 
years have bin their strength; but god is coming to overturn 
them, &#x0026; to confound them, &#x0026; to cut down the fruitless trees 
that brings not forth good fruit, and doth manifest that the 
evil Tree cannot bring forth good fruit; for men do not gather 
Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thistles; for the best of them have 
been but as a bryar, &#x0026; the most upright of them as a Thorn- 
Hedge,<pb n="22"/>
Hedge, as many will come to see then their eyes comes to 
be opened; and they shall be as a bowed wall, and as a tottering 
fence, Psal. 62. Let but the honest and the godly hearted 
judge betwixt them and us, whether their fruits are not the 
fruits of the flesh, which the apostle saith (Gal. 5. 17.) are 
these, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Idola- 
try, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedi- 
tions, Heresies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunkenness, Revilings, In- 
ordinate affections, evil Concupiscence, Covetousness which is Idola- 
try, Anger, Malice, Blasphemy, filthy communication, Effeminate- 
ness, and abusers of themselves with mankind, revellings, Banquet- 
ings, Excesse of Wine, and abominable Idolaters, Filthinesse, foo- 
lish jesting and talking which is not convenient, Col. 3. 8. I Cor. 6. 9. 
And let the upright judge, whether they be not lovers of 
themselves, covetous boasters, proud blashpemers, unthankful, un- 
holy, disobedient to Parents, without natural affection, truce-break- 
ers, false Accusers, Incontinent, fierce despisers of them that are 
good, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of 
god, having a form of godliness, but denying the Power, and from 
such (the Apostle exhorts the people to) turn away, 2 Tim. 1. 3. 
Now the Reader may judge it to be harsh, or consorious- 
ness in charging all these fruits of the flesh upon the Teach- 
ers and Ministers of the World, many of which they would 
seem to evade; but this I say further for the Information of 
the Reader, that they are Ministers of Darknesse, and not 
Ministers of the Light, but denyes the Light, both the Minister 
from, and to Minister to; which the Ministers of god were Mi- 
nisters of the Light, and the Message that they brought, was, 
That God was Light, and in him was no darknesse at all, 1 Joh. 1. 1. 
And Paul was made an able Minister of the New-Testament, not 
of the Letter, but of the Spirit; and he turned People from the 
darkness to the light, and from the power of Satan unto God, who is 
light, in which whosoever walks, the blood of Jesus Christ his Son, 
cleanseth him from all sin. Now these Ministers &#x0026; Teachers of the  
World, whose Ministry stands in the darkness where all sin is 
committed, and all the fruits of the flesh acted, these cannot 
clear themselves from none of the things before mention- 
ed, for they stand in that ground which brings forth the 
fruits<pb n="23"/>
fruits of the flesh; and therefore is their Doctrine altogether 
for sin, and against perfection and cleansing, and preacheth frequent- 
ly that none can be free from sin while they are upon the earth; for 
they are guilty in their hearts and consciences, that they sin 
continually, &#x0026; so with their blind dark mids they can never 
see that any can be cleansed or redeemed from sin, which is 
wholly contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, who saith, that Christ 
was manifest to take away sin, whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not' 
whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, neither known him; he that com- 
mitteth sin, is of the Devil; whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, 
for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of 
God; in this is the children of god manifest, and the children of the 
Devil, 1 Joh. 3. And now Reader, do but in soberness weigh 
those thigs according to the truth of the Scriptures, &#x0026; this 
will take away the prejudice, &#x0026; remove the Objection which 
might arise in thy mind concerning the fruits of the flesh ap- 
plyed to the Teachers and Professors. 
And all that desire after godliness, &#x0026; the Truth as it is in 
Jesus, they must turn from them that hath the Form, &#x0026; denies 
the Power, who brings forht the fruits before-mentioned; for as 
many as receives Christ Jesus, (the Light) to them he gives power to 
become the Sons of God. It is the word of his Power by which all 
things were created, by which he upholds all things; and 
it is his power that brings his seed out of bondage, &#x0026; out of 
the house of darkness: and the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
which the Apostle was not ashamed of to preach, is the power of 
god unto salvation, unto every one that believes, to the Jew first, &#x0026; also 
to the Greek; and this Treasure the Apostle had in an earthen vessel, 
that the excellency of the Power might be of God: and here was the 
Apostles Doctrine establihed, in the mighty power of god, 
whereof (saith he) I was made a Minister according to the gift of the 
Grace of God given unto me, by the effectual working of his Power, that 
so he might know the power of his resurrection, and the fellowhip of his 
sufferings: but this is a Mystery, and unknown to the Teachers &#x0026; 
Ministers of the letter, who are in forms &#x0026; appearances, without the 
Power, &#x0026; in the ordinations of men, &#x0026; receives their approbati- 
on from men &#x0026; are made Ministers by men, these deny and resist 
the Power &#x0026; Spirit the Apostles were made Ministers of, &#x0026; even 
denies immediate Revelation, &#x0026; saith it is ceased, &#x0026; so denies the 
gift<pb n="24"/>
gift of Gods grace which hath appeared unto all men, to teach the 
denying of ungodliness &#x0026; allworldly lusts, &#x0026; teacheth (all that doth o- 
bey it, &#x0026; follow it) to live godly, righteously, &#x0026; soberly in this present 
evil world. And so those Teachers endeavours to limit the spirit 
of the living God to Times &#x0026; Persons, which cannot be limited; 
and saith, we must not look for it now, as in the Apostles time; we 
must look to the Scripture, &#x0026; not to the spirit for Revelation; 
&#x0026; so blasphemes the God of Heaven, &#x0026; gainsays his Truth, &#x0026; the 
revelation of the Son of God, who said, The Father was a Spirit, &#x0026; 
they that worship him, must worship him in spirit &#x0026; in truth, &#x0026; he was 
seeking for such worshippers to worship him, &#x0026; who hath said, There 
is none that knows the Son but the father, neither doth any man know 
the Father save the Son, and he to whom the son reveals him. 
And so these Teachers that denies Revelation, &#x0026; the Spirits tea- 
ching, doth not desire that the Son should be known by the Fa- 
thers drawing; for there isnone that can come to the Son, except the Fa- 
ther draw him; neither is it possible for them to bring people to 
the knowledg of the Father who denies Revelation, being there is 
none that knows the Father save the Son, &#x0026; he to whom the Son reveals 
him; so the infinite mercy &#x0026; wisdom of the Lord God hath hid 
these thigs from them, &#x0026; hath revealed them unto the faith- 
ful &#x0026; obedient, who walks in his Light, &#x0026; keeps in it, where the 
revelation is manifested; &#x0026; so Christ Jesus saw great cause of thank- 
ing the Father, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he had hid those 
things from the wise &#x0026; prudent, &#x0026; had revealed them unto Babes, chil- 
dren of the Light, which were begotten into the Light, &#x0026; were 
translated into it, &#x0026; made one wiht it, &#x0026; abode in the Annoint- 
ing which they received in the beginning, they had fellow- 
ship with the Son &#x0026; with the Father; he that believes on the Son, hath 
everlasting life; he that believeth not on the Son, shall not see life; for 
the Father loveth the Son, &#x0026; sheweth him all things that he doth; For 
as the Father raiseth up the dead, &#x0026; quickneth them, even to 
the Son quickneth whom h will; &#x0026; who believes in the Light, 
and walks in the light of the Son of God, is quickned by him, 
&#x0026; hath the Father revealed to him, not in Parables, but he doth 
shew him plainly of the Father; for he hath committed all judg- 
ment to the son, that all men might honor the Son, as they honor 
the Father; he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father 
that hath sent him; he that believeth not in the light of the Son 
of<pb n="25"/>
of God, he honoreth not the Son; &#x0026; he whose mind is not tur- 
ned unto the Light of God in him, he knows not the Son, nor him 
that sent him; Jesus cryed and said, He that believeth on me, belie- 
veth no on me, but on him that sent me; he that seeth me, seeth him 
that sent me. I am come a Light into the World, that whosoever belie- 
veth on me, should not abide in darkness: Mark here now, Christ's 
Words; He that sees him to be the light come into the world, sees 
him that sent him; &#x0026; he that believes in Christ that is come a light 
into the world, believes on him that sent him;and he that believes 
on Christ Jesus who is come a Light into the world, abides not in the 
darkness, but hath the Light of life; this is the great Work of God 
that every one believe on him that God hath sent; &#x0026; he that 
believeth on him, hath the witness and testimony of him in himself; 
&#x0026; he that knows not that Christ is in him, is a Reprobate; And 
this is the will of him that sent me (saith Christ) that everyone that 
seeth the son, may have everlasting life, &#x0026; I will raise him up at the 
last Day: This is the portion and reward which the true belie- 
vers receive from him who is the resurrection and the life, he that 
believes on him, though he was dead, yet shall he live, and he that lives 
and believes, shall never dye; (He that can receive it, let him.) This 
was a Mystery unto Martha: Jesus saith, No man can come unto me 
except the Father (which hath sent me) draw him; It is written in the 
Prophets (saith he) They shall be all taught of God; every man there- 
fore, that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 
So here now every one whose eye is single, may see, that none 
cam come but whom the Father draws, and they that are taught of 
God, comes to the Son, which he hath given a light into the world; and 
this is the WAY, the TRUTH, and the LIFE; &#x0026; no man comes 
to the Father but by him; And in not other way, nor by no other 
Name under Heaven shall any one be saved, but by him, and he is able 
to save to the utmost all those that comes unto God by him, and not other 
Foundation can any man lay, then this which is already laid; but let e- 
very one take heed how he builds thereon; &#x0026; he which prea- 
cheth another Gospel, let him be accurst; for this is the rock and 
Foundation on which the whole Church is built, CHRIST JESUS 
the LIGHT, and precious Stone, which Jews &#x0026; Gentiles that are 
saved, are built on; for he is their Peace who hath made both one, 
and hath broken down the middle wall of Partition which was between, 
for through him we have doth an access to the Father, &#x0026; are built up- 
on<pb n="26"/>
on the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, JESUS CHRIST 
himself being the chief Corner-stone, in whom all the Building fitly fra- 
med together, groweth unto a holy people in the Lord, who are builded to- 
gether for an habitation of God, through the spirit; Here is the great 
Work of the Mystery of God, which he is working in this his 
day, whose Tabernacle is with men, and the Most High dwells in 
the Kingdoms of men, he whose delight is with the sons of men, 
is arisen, and wisdom lifteth up her voice, and cries, 
Oh ye simple ones, understand wisdom; &#x0026; ye fools, be of an un- 
derstanding heart; unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the Sons 
of men. 
CHRIST JESUS is coming to reign, &#x0026; the Scepter of his righte- 
ousness which is a right Scepter, will he sway the Nations with; &#x0026; those 
his enemies that willnot that he should reign, must even be broke, and 
bound, and slain before him; therefore it is good for all people to 
hear his voice, and to turn at his reproof, and to hearken dili- 
gently to the Word that is night in the heart, &#x0026; to encline their ears 
that their souls might live; there is a Word that saith, this is the 
way; which way is for the wayfaring man; this TEACHER will 
never more be removed into a corner; but their eyes must see their Tea- 
cher; this WAY which hath long been hid and hedged up, Now 
hath the Lord opened and made manifest in this his Day, and the 
Law and the Testimony which was sealed among the Disciplines, is 
now opened, and the Word that speaks according to the Light is 
now revealed, &#x0026; the Light is shining in the consciences of men, 
and they are children of the Light, and of the Day, walks 
in it, and it shines in their hearts, and gives them the light of the know- 
ledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the express Image of 
the Invisible God, the first-born of every creature; and this cleanseth 
and purgeth the conscience from dead works, to serve the living God; &#x0026; 
in this every one may draw near in full assurance of Faith, 
having their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and their bodies 
washed with pure water; but it was impossible that the blood of Buls 
and Goats should take away sin; but this man after he had offered 
one sacrifice for sin, sate down at the right hand of God, expecting till 
his enemies be made his footstool; Which the high Priests that went 
before him, were daily offring the same Sacrifice which could 
bnever take away sin, nor make perfect as appertaining to the consci- 
ence; yet by one offering, Christ Jesus the everlasing High Priest, hath 
perfected<pb n="27"/>
perfected for ever them that are sanctified; this is he that doth the 
will, who said, In the volume of thy book it is written of me, Lo I come 
to do thy will, O God; by which Wil we are sanctified, whereof the 
Holy Ghost is a witness to us; for after that he said before, 
This is the covenant that I wil make with them, After these days (saith 
the Lord) I will put my Law in their hearts; and in their minds, I will 
write them; Here the Apostle witnesseth the holy Ghost to be the 
Witness &#x0026; Testimony of Gods truth in the promise of the new Co- 
venant of the Law written in the heart, &#x0026; of the spirit putting in 
the inward parts; Now these that denies the spirit of God which 
gives testimony and witness of his everlasting Covenant, are 
strangers to this life, &#x0026; Aliens to the Common wealth of Israel; for 
the Covenant of Promise is to the elect Seed of Abraham; not of 
the Bond-woman, but of the Free; not of the SEEDS, which are 
many, but of ONE, which is CHRIST, that is Elect according to the 
fore-knowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the spirit, 
unto obedience, &#x0026; sprinkling of the blood of Christ, who doth purifie their 
souls in obeying the Truth, through the spirit; For this cause is the 
Gospel preached, that they may be judg'd according to men in 
the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit; this is the chief 
end of the Ministry of the GOSPEL, which is GLAD-TYDINGS 
to the Poor, LIBERTY to the Captive, but JUDGEMENT to him 
that hath captivated the Seed, till that be dead which hath held 
the Seed in bondage; and until the enmity be slain, and the middle 
wall of Partition taken away, and of twain, made one new man; this 
is the Ministration of the everlasting Gospel; for Christ also hath  
once suffered, being put to death in the flesh, but quickned in 
the spirit, by which also he went and preached unto the spirits 
in prison; &#x0026; he that is annointed to preach glad tydings to the poor, 
and liberty to the Captives, is now preaching to the spirits in prison, &#x0026; 
binding up the broken hearted, and raising up them that are fallen' 
and he is enlightening the blind eyes and unstopping the deaf ears, &#x0026; 
opening the Prison-doors, and bringing the Prisoners forth of the Pri- 
son houses, so that the Prisoners of hope doth rejoice, that have been in 
the pit which is without water; For Christ calls, Come unto me every 
one that is weary and heavy laden, &#x0026; they shall find rest for their souls, 
who will make his yoake upon them, which is easie, &#x0026; his burthn, 
which is light, to the obedient, and to the faithful, which are sub- 
jected unto him, &#x0026; &#x0026; waits for Him, they that love him, and keep his 
Com-<pb n="28"/>
Commandments, who saith, He that hath my Commandments, &#x0026; keep- 
eth them, he it is that loveth me; &#x0026; he that loveth me, shall be loved of 
my Father, &#x0026; I will love him, &#x0026; will manifest my self unto him: Here 
is an Infinite reward, which wil even satisfie the Eternal &#x0026; Im- 
mortal soul, which nothing can satisfie but the living God, who 
saith, If any love me, &#x0026; keep my words, my Father will love him and 
we shall come unto him, &#x0026; make our abode with him; Here the COM- 
FORTER, which is the Holy Ghost, which proceeds from the Fa- 
ther &#x0026; the Son, is manifested, which doth teach all things, &#x0026; brings 
all thinge to remembrance; &#x0026; this is the Inheritance which the Saints 
in Light are made partakers of, even the spirit of Truth which the 
world cannot receive, which leads into all truth all them which do 
obey and follow the leading, &#x0026; guiding, &#x0026; teaching of it: The Apostle 
desired that Timothy might know how he ought to behave himself 
in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar 
and ground of Truth; And without controversie (saith he) great is the 
Mystery of godliness, GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH, justi- 
fied in the spirit, seen of Angels, &#x0026;c. This mystery I have endeavou- 
red in part to open, according to the Scriptures: and if any 
come to the Key of DAVID which opens this mystery, they 
will see the Truth of it, and seal to it in that measure of the 
Spirit which god hath given to every one to profit withall; 
For unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the 
gift of Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will; and he that is 
faithful in the little, is made Ruler over much: And so this is the 
WAY, the TRUTH, and the LIFE; and ever one that doth 
set at nought this, and resist this, let his blood be upon his own 
head. 
Now let the Reader by what is here written, seiously search, 
examine, and try by the Scriptures, and the measure of the 
Spirit of god in him, who are the true Prophets, and the fase; 
and who are the true Teachers, and who are the false, and what 
is the true Worship of God, and the false; And let him ven- 
ture his soul, as he dare answer before a just &#x0026; Righteous God.

               <p>From a true Lover of the sols of all people, and who desires the 
good of all, and that all might come to the knowledge 
of the Truth. M. F.
